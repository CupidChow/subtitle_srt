2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,551
of the Glam Grunge match.

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,516
I wonder who won for Glam Grunge.

4
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,100
I'm so curious!

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,852
I can't wait!

6
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,230
I'm so curious about this match.

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,482
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

8
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,236
<i>I wondered if I even did a good job.</i>

9
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>I'm confident.</i>

10
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>I'll be the first man to beat First Man.</i>

11
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,828
Please reveal the results
of the Glam Grunge match.

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,585
FIRST MAN: 3
SEONGSU-DONG PRINCE: 1

13
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,505
Congratulations!

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,342
With a score of 3 to 1,
First Man will advance to the next round.

15
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,971
Unfortunately, Seongsu-dong Prince is out.

16
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,934
<i>The way he interpreted</i>
<i>and carried out the given keyword</i>

17
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,394
was very artistic.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:04,898
I believe the beauty of grunge comes

19
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,525
from a place of real messiness.

20
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,443
<i>But Seongsu-dong Prince's look</i>
<i>was too clean.</i>

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,989
He should've put his techniques aside
for this particular look.

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,783
<i>He just slightly lacked experience.</i>

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,704
<i>Between the two,</i>
<i>First Man's look fit the theme better.</i>

24
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,290
<i>The first and foremost priority is</i>

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,251
<i>staying true to the theme.</i>

26
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,045
<i>When Saem-mool pointed that out,</i>

27
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:31,466
I realized that I'd almost lost
to Seongsu-dong Prince.

28
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>I realized I only survived</i>
<i>because I followed my principles.</i>

29
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,931
I had hoped to show you more of my work.

30
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,976
I've only shown you the flashiest looks,

31
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,353
so it's a pity that I can't show you more.

32
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,857
I felt sad.

33
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,527
<i>He just went against the wrong person.</i>

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>I'm like a little minnow,</i>

35
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,073
and I finally got eaten up
by the sharks today.

36
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,327
I'll just accept my lack of experience.

37
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,286
SEONGSU-DONG PRINCE

38
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,329
<i>It's too bad.</i>

39
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,168
I knew you'd win!

40
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,546
<i>Of course, I'm ecstatic.</i>

41
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,548
I can't keep my cheekbones down.

42
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,301
BARBIE

43
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,969
Next up is Barbie.

44
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,929
The next keyword is Barbie.

45
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,350
There's a signature look we think of
when we think of Barbie.

46
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,518
I hope the models
actually look like dolls.

47
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,686
- Totally.
- Completely.

48
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,396
- Completely fake.
- Not human.

49
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,066
I hope they don't even look human.

50
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,194
Models for Barbie, please enter.

51
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:38,784
Barbie!

52
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:39,910
Barbie!

53
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,995
- Barbie!
- Oh, my!

54
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,331
- That's stunning!
- My goodness.

55
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,293
YE-SEUL ARTS CENTER
VS. SHORT-FORM CONTENT QUEEN

56
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,795
My look is called

57
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,088
"Plastic Girl."

58
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,589
<i>She's a Barbie doll</i>

59
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,840
<i>who couldn't become a human.</i>

60
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,509
<i>That's why she's so sad.</i>

61
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,593
<i>In the last round...</i>

62
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:57,928
Ye-seul Arts Center,

63
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,763
you'll be put on hold. Thank you.

64
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,766
Those who overcome a difficult time
succeed even more.

65
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,934
You watched <i>Culinary Class Wars, </i>right?

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,271
I wanted to be perfect, but couldn't.

67
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,481
That's so sad!

68
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,651
I wanted to reflect that
in my sad Barbie makeup.

69
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,863
<i>I'm betting my whole life on this Barbie.</i>

70
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,573
I'll choose Barbie.

71
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,492
You've chosen Barbie.

72
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,619
<i>I was set on Barbie from the start.</i>

73
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,288
I would've chosen Barbie,
even if Detailed Hands had chosen it.

74
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,165
I only focused on the theme
and not my competitor.

75
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,503
The video that somewhat
put me on the map was of me at home,

76
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,380
<i>pretending my boyfriend</i>
<i>was visiting me in half an hour.</i>

77
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,966
<i>It was a video</i>
<i>where I rushed through my makeup.</i>

78
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,136
So I wanted my Barbie to be getting ready.

79
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,055
<i>I just wanted to show myself as Barbie.</i>

80
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,182
What an adorable outfit!

81
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:45,976
No way.

82
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,520
SEONG MIN-JU AND SEONG MIN-JI
The models are so pretty.

83
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:54,359
You're a Barbie getting ready for a party.

84
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,904
<i>I was going against Ye-seul Arts Center.</i>

85
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,573
She's an expert.

86
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,658
She's just a total veteran in the field,

87
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,744
so I knew I couldn't beat her
with my skills alone.

88
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,829
But I'm a one-woman show.

89
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,414
<i>When shooting my videos,</i>

90
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,791
<i>I have to prepare everything myself,</i>
<i>from my hair to makeup.</i>

91
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>With that said, I may be better</i>
<i>at preparing the overall look.</i>

92
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,297
<i>I prepared the props,</i>
<i>the shoes, and the outfit.</i>

93
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,840
<i>I prepared everything myself.</i>

94
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,759
I love that outfit.

95
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,011
How did she find something so beautiful?

96
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,971
It's all in the design.
I cut and sewed everything.

97
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,347
She's so cute.

98
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,349
She has a definite theme.

99
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,351
She must be going out with the hair rolls.

100
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,978
- In her hair.
- I guess so.

101
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,315
- It looks like a commercial.
- Beauty content creators are

102
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,693
- always so creative in their expressions.
- They're so innovative.

103
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:41,156
I wanted to create
the perfect Barbie eyes.

104
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,742
I poured my heart and soul
into those eyes.

105
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>Barbie has huge eyes,</i>

106
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,122
<i>so I made her eyes look</i>
<i>as expansive as possible.</i>

107
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,210
<i>I opened her eyes up using big lashes</i>

108
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,963
<i>and blue contact lenses</i>
<i>to really give that Barbie look.</i>

109
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,342
Can you tell me
where you got those contact lenses?

110
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,718
They're from China.

111
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,136
Of course.

112
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,388
- You can't get them in Korea.
- I knew it.

113
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,767
Everyone seems to struggle
with gluing one-piece falsies.

114
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:13,146
Close your eyes slightly. That's enough.

115
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,690
Can you open your eyes? Perfect.

116
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,442
Barbie is all about her lashes.

117
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:18,735
This is crazy!

118
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,278
Please close your eyes.

119
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,411
I'll use double eyelid tape
to clean it up.

120
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,248
Film-type eyeliner

121
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,917
isn't great at sticking. So...

122
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,418
Please close your eyes.

123
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,217
The line is perfectly clean now.

124
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,553
That's the thing
about film-type eyeliners.

125
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,764
I just need to wipe that.

126
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,193
She also looks stunning.

127
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,030
She's a human Barbie!

128
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,910
<i>I've been a makeup artist for 23 years.</i>

129
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,246
I've polished my skills over decades.

130
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,332
<i>I used those precise skills</i>
<i>to create that doll look.</i>

131
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,711
I worked so hard to create
that doll-like skin texture.

132
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,964
I need to showcase all my tricks.

133
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,466
Just like that.

134
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,136
I'll win with my skills.

135
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,055
Open your eyes.

136
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,808
All right. It's a pink cut crease.

137
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,477
<i>The symmetry between the two eyes.</i>

138
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,647
<i>My model's double eyelids</i>
<i>folded at different points.</i>

139
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,107
<i>So, I had to do a cut crease</i>

140
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,610
<i>to achieve symmetry in her eyes.</i>

141
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,820
<i>That was a huge challenge.</i>

142
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,156
I'll raise the line

143
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,742
- on this side.
- Okay.

144
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,912
I need to keep this side's line
as close to the lash line as possible.

145
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,289
This eye needs to look bigger.

146
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,918
Now, time for the doll lashes.

147
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,169
Open your eyes.

148
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,339
One, two, three, four, five.

149
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,299
She looks beautiful,
even in that hair net.

150
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,843
- Her face is so small.
- Yes.

151
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,595
I want to get up and see.

152
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,684
Your face must be debris-free.

153
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:18,021
I'll add a glow
to make her skin look like plastic.

154
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,524
I planned to make her skin glow.

155
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>Pat McGrath once used this method</i>
<i>in a show.</i>

156
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,946
<i>She used an airbrush</i>

157
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,990
<i>to give the shiniest finish to the skin.</i>

158
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,952
<i>I wanted to blow people's minds</i>
<i>with the skin texture.</i>

159
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,207
<i>- </i>Short-Form Content Queen.
- Yes?

160
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,917
- Hello.
- Hello.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,294
She definitely
looks like Barbie from behind.

162
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,837
You're not the Barbie, are you?

163
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,422
I dressed up to match her.

164
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,882
You're one with the theme!

165
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,385
Did you purposely make her skin look

166
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,678
- Yes, on purpose.
- not human-like?

167
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,054
I purposely made her skin look like that.

168
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,056
Then, I'll use a spray on her neck.
Give me a second.

169
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:53,974
Like this.

170
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,435
What's this?

171
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,896
- It's a brightening cream spray.
- Brightening cream!

172
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,648
It's a must for K-pop idols.

173
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,650
- Really? No wonder!
- Yes, K-pop idols wear it

174
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,776
almost daily.

175
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,152
No wonder they look so fair.

176
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,071
- Very pale, right?
- They don't look human!

177
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,782
We used a lot of tanning products
back in the day.

178
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,243
But people prefer fair skin now.

179
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,161
- It works!
- Her skin looks very fair, right?

180
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,038
Yes, but it also looks so natural!

181
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,415
- It gives a nice glow, too.
- Yes.

182
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,916
- K-pop idols...
- Let me see what it is.

183
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,793
It's a great product.

184
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,087
- Really?
- "White Vita Spray?"

185
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,714
I'm getting one.

186
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,216
Your back seems very sweaty.

187
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,467
I'm so hot!

188
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:32,053
- It's the angora.
- Seriously.

189
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,930
It's inspired by your look

190
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,390
- on the first day.
- Right.

191
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,100
- It's similar.
- When I wore my fur jacket?

192
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,351
Yes, I copied that style.

193
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,104
People kept teasing me,
saying I looked like a melting candle.

194
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,441
- Much cooler, right?
- Very. I love you.

195
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,777
- Hello!
- Hello!

196
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,154
Ye-seul Arts Center.

197
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,365
That's stunning.

198
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,534
- What's this?
- An airbrush.

199
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,077
What are you doing with it?

200
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,954
- I spray it.
- On her skin?

201
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,372
It's supposed to spray face paint.

202
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,416
How? Why won't the paint come out?

203
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,918
I wonder why it's not working.

204
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,420
Why isn't it working? What do I do?

205
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,880
It's not working. I'm in trouble.

206
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,551
<i>The airbrush wasn't even mine.</i>

207
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,637
I borrowed it
and practiced with it for days

208
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,014
to perfect my look.

209
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,891
But the airbrush wouldn't work today.

210
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,645
It's not working. What should I do?

211
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,775
<i>I kept checking the time.</i>

212
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,943
<i>I had to get this done</i>
<i>before the 20-minute mark.</i>

213
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,613
The question was,
should I give up on the skin texture?

214
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:36,826
<i>But I decided I needed to show</i>
<i>what I'd intended and planned.</i>

215
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,163
So, I just used my hands.

216
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,292
- Here I go.
- Okay.

217
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,840
I never imagined
the airbrush would fail on me.

218
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,094
<i>I learned from practicing at home</i>

219
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,764
<i>that simply applying the wrapping mask</i>
<i>would make all the makeup come off.</i>

220
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,391
<i>So, I mixed it with water</i>
<i>in a 1-to-1 ratio.</i>

221
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,894
<i>It was very watery,</i>
<i>so I applied multiple layers</i>

222
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,729
<i>and dried each layer, one by one.</i>

223
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,064
You can dry this side.

224
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,691
I'll need to apply multiple layers.

225
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,238
- You can't talk from now on.
- Okay.

226
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:19,911
<i>I could manually apply the mix</i>
<i>because I had practiced it so much.</i>

227
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,247
It's working, right?

228
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,082
It's coming together.

229
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,209
It's all coming together.

230
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,171
One is a very matte makeup,
and the other is a very glowy makeup.

231
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,382
I know, right?
I didn't expect such a huge difference.

232
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,177
The judges will also
have a hard time this round.

233
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,013
One is a Barbie in the process
of getting ready,

234
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,057
and the other is a Barbie
who's ready to go out.

235
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,311
Barbie models, please enter.

236
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,400
That's very pink!

237
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,738
That's very pink!

238
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,413
She's posing.

239
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,374
I'll now introduce the looks to you.

240
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,917
The first look is called

241
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,419
"Plastic Girl."

242
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,130
She's a sad Barbie
who wanted to become human

243
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,007
but couldn't become one.

244
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,137
The second look is called
"The Process of Self-Love."

245
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,347
The look reflects the beauty

246
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,766
of both the process
and the perfect result,

247
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,188
all of which come from my loving hands,
which are also beautiful.

248
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,192
Judges,

249
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,152
please begin your evaluations.

250
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,030
I can feel my heart pounding
while standing here.

251
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,909
Ba-bump! Ba-bump!

252
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,160
What's with my heart?

253
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,588
<i>This artist deepened the eyes</i>
<i>to create doll-like eyes,</i>

254
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,549
<i>and the symmetry was spot-on.</i>

255
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,509
<i>When she opened her eyes,</i>

256
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:03,223
<i>I could almost see a doll</i>
<i>blinking her eyes.</i>

257
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,726
- They're so observant.
- This is so intense.

258
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,270
- Her skin...
- It's so clean.

259
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,731
- It looks like she has that on, right?
- Yes.

260
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,858
- Totally.
- Yes.

261
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,944
It seems to extend
all the way down to her neck.

262
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,030
Her base makeup looks very doll-like.

263
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,326
Her facial expressions are on point!

264
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,161
I'm falling for you!

265
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,041
She's flirting with RISABAE!

266
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,501
How lovely!

267
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,336
Why am I getting so nervous?

268
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,007
Could you close your eyes?

269
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,386
Thank you.

270
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,306
She really values symmetry.

271
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,557
- Symmetry?
- Yes.

272
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,352
From where the lashes begin
to the symmetry of the lines...

273
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,979
- I'm doomed, then.
- What?

274
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,023
<i>She looked like a doll.</i>

275
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,942
<i>She did a great job</i>
<i>at gluing the falsies, too.</i>

276
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,861
<i>Everything was perfect,</i>
<i>like a Barbie doll.</i>

277
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,616
She looks so pretty.
She's like a real doll.

278
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,535
<i>She looked so pretty.</i>

279
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,662
Look at the details!

280
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:11,207
<i>From head to toe,</i>
<i>every little detail made her look</i>

281
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,875
<i>so beautiful.</i>

282
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,295
- I'm in awe of the lashes.
- I know.

283
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,340
This is hard.

284
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,300
I know!

285
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,635
Saem-mool saw your model and said,

286
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,346
"She's so pretty!"

287
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,932
Short-Form Content Queen!

288
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,560
I don't know what to do.

289
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,312
- This is terrible.
- This is so hard.

290
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,523
They're both beautiful
in such different ways.

291
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,151
I keep laughing because I'm dumbfounded.

292
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,819
I can't help but laugh.

293
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,946
- I couldn't write anything!
- Me neither.

294
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,157
- They both look so pretty.
- Yes.

295
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,244
This is driving me nuts!

296
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,039
They both look too pretty!

297
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,749
They look like real dolls.

298
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,042
- Right?
- Seriously.

299
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,795
Has everyone...

300
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,090
- I'm going crazy.
- made their decisions?

301
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,593
I can't choose one.

302
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,927
But you must.

303
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,763
Yes, I must pick one.

304
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,014
- Please vote.
- Okay.

305
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,640
Please vote now.

306
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,276
Have the judges finished voting?

307
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,070
- Yes.
- All right.

308
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,029
Who are the makeup artists

309
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,656
behind the Barbie match?

310
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,866
Please come in.

311
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:33,164
They were Ye-seul Arts Center
and Short-Form Content Queen.

312
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,499
Hello.

313
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,798
Let's announce the winner

314
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,091
right away.

315
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:43,966
I'm curious.

316
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,135
Please reveal the results

317
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,139
of the Barbie match
in the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

318
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,725
I wonder who won.

319
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,978
<i>My look had a special flair.</i>

320
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,146
<i>I really wanted to win.</i>

321
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,818
<i>My Barbie looked so perfect.</i>
<i>I was confident.</i>

322
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:11,035
SHORT-FORM CONTENT QUEEN: 2
YE-SEUL ARTS CENTER: 2

323
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,996
It's a tie of 2 to 2!

324
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,917
The contestants will step outside
for a moment,

325
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,669
and the four judges

326
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,171
will reassess the looks.

327
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,090
See you soon.

328
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,091
- Okay.
- Okay.

329
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,510
Judges, please assess the looks again.

330
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,347
- It's a very close call.
- Indeed.

331
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,976
I wanted to make my final call
based on the fine details,

332
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,353
and I noticed a little gap here.

333
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,063
There's no eyeshadow here.

334
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,192
You seem to have decided on the winner.

335
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,904
Contestants, please return.

336
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,706
Seo Ok will announce the winner.

337
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:01,377
The winner of the Barbie match is...

338
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,049
Ye-seul Arts Center.

339
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,801
Ye-seul Arts Center.

340
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,303
- Congratulations.
- Ye-seul Arts Center,

341
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,804
you've passed.

342
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:12,805
Thank you.

343
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,600
- Thank you.
- Short-Form Content Queen,

344
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,685
unfortunately,
it's time for you to go home.

345
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,395
It was a close call until the end,

346
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:23,191
so we decided to look
at the fine details more.

347
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:27,737
We noticed
that you missed a spot

348
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,572
in the retouching process.

349
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,784
There was a little spot on the left eye
without any eyeshadow.

350
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,331
The eyeshadow colors are perfect
on this eye,

351
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,750
but there's no eyeshadow
at the end of this eye.

352
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,047
How did you even notice that?

353
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,382
I was just trying my best
to look for something.

354
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:51,302
<i>She seems to have corrected the eyeliner.</i>

355
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,930
<i>When she erased the eyeliner,</i>

356
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>she should've corrected</i>

357
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,266
<i>the eyeshadow as well.</i>

358
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,935
<i>But she seems to have forgotten</i>

359
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,103
<i>to add the eyeshadow back here.</i>

360
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,064
<i>That was why there was no eyeshadow</i>
<i>in the outer corner.</i>

361
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,526
So, since Ye-seul Arts Center's look
was more polished,

362
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,110
we decided that she was the winner.

363
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,862
I see. Congratulations.

364
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,783
Short-Form Content Queen has only been
learning makeup for two years,

365
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,201
but she's a natural prodigy.

366
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,789
She's surprised me
and inspired me to learn more.

367
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,624
I practiced the look daily.

368
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,127
I forgot about my main job
and practiced for this every day.

369
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:27,255
I even went home and practiced after work.

370
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,757
- My gosh.
- You're so passionate.

371
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,635
- I loved the skin makeup.
- Yes, it was beautiful.

372
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,013
So many contestants went home
and practiced all night.

373
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,140
From the bottom of our hearts,
thank you once again.

374
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,767
- Great work.
- Yes.

375
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,435
Good job!

376
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,646
You may now exit with your models.

377
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,357
- I'm crying for Short-Form Content Queen.
- Thank you to the two models, too!

378
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,441
Great work!

379
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,068
Especially the first model.

380
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,612
First model! You may smile now!

381
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,031
You're so professional!

382
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,658
Even until the end!

383
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,159
She put a ring on her!

384
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,953
- My goodness.
- They must be getting married.

385
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,955
- Be careful.
- Watch your step!

386
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,332
- What's her job?
- She's so funny.

387
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,376
- Is she a model or an actress?
- I'm also curious.

388
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,669
Walk back safely!

389
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,920
She's something else.

390
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,171
- She surely is.
- She's so cute!

391
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,091
<i>I could see the difference</i>
<i>in years of experience</i>

392
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,011
when the two competed against each other.

393
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,221
<i>The newbie was a newbie,</i>

394
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,515
<i>and the expert was an expert.</i>

395
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,604
- Is she crying?
- She is!

396
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,148
- Did she cry?
- She did!

397
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:32,278
Oh, my!

398
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,365
I worked so hard

399
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:38,868
that my makeup is a mess now,

400
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,204
but to be honest,
I did everything in my power,

401
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,956
so I'm very satisfied.

402
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,792
Bye, then!

403
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,716
They've set up their stations.

404
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,055
The colors!

405
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,723
They're very flashy.

406
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,350
I wonder how they'll use those colors.

407
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,602
<i>It's Pop of Color.</i>

408
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,479
Is my makeup from <i>U-Go-Girl</i>

409
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,481
an example of that style?

410
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,691
- All the flashy eyeshadow colors?
- Yes.

411
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:15,112
When used correctly,
colors add so much life to a face, right?

412
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,740
I wonder who signed up for this theme.

413
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,742
Smoky Girl from Busan.

414
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,951
Pop of Color.

415
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,620
- Is that your choice?
- Yes.

416
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,413
As you can see,

417
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,124
I love to be bold with my colors.

418
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,918
Who's confident about using colors?

419
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,044
I'm not.

420
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,962
Who thinks they can nail
the Pop of Color look?

421
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,841
Designer Collector

422
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:36,926
has stepped forward.

423
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,762
I've been following Smoky Girl from Busan

424
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,764
<i>for a long time now.</i>

425
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,725
So I know her makeup style,

426
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:49,230
but she doesn't know mine.

427
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,275
<i>I'm currently a brand artist</i>
<i>for L'Oréal Korea.</i>

428
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,945
<i>I'm in charge of luxury beauty brands</i>
<i>such as Yves Saint Laurent, Prada, Armani,</i>

429
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,613
<i>and Valentino Beauty.</i>

430
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,032
<i>I'm in charge of</i>
<i>all these luxury beauty brands,</i>

431
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:01,784
<i>which is why my nickname is</i>
<i>Designer Collector.</i>

432
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,663
I'll prove my power as a brand artist.

433
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,292
<i>　My Pop of Color makeup look is called</i>
<i>"The Color Fairy."</i>

434
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,168
A FAIRY-LIKE LOOK USING PASTEL TONES

435
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,295
<i>I saw the model's face</i>

436
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,090
MOLLY AND FREYA
<i>and thought she looked like a fairy.</i>

437
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:21,011
<i>I wanted to use</i>
<i>pink, yellow, green, and blue.</i>

438
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,432
<i>I used a pink eyeshadow</i>

439
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,600
<i>as a bold blush on her cheeks.</i>

440
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:29,729
- The blush!
- It's very bright.

441
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,356
She looks so lovely
with the pastel-toned blush.

442
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,276
<i>I added a pop of yellow around her temples</i>

443
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:39,739
<i>and made the two colors look harmonious</i>
<i>while embracing her face.</i>

444
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,742
<i>I added some green in the inner corners</i>

445
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,660
<i>as a highlight of the look.</i>

446
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,371
She looks beautiful!

447
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,875
<i>Then, I used blue</i>
<i>all over the center of her eyes.</i>

448
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,836
<i>The colors are stunning.</i>

449
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:56,714
Busan is known for Gwangalli.

450
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,341
<i>"Unforgettable Gwangalli,</i>
<i>　Sunset by the Beach."</i>

451
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,178
<i>My main colors are blue and orange.</i>

452
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,512
<i>I told her to prepare just two things.</i>

453
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,973
<i>Stockings and shoes in those exact colors.</i>

454
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,809
<i>I wanted to create a sunset look,</i>

455
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:12,271
<i>so I blended the orange</i>
<i>to make it look like a sunset.</i>

456
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,023
The lashes!

457
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,192
She came so prepared.
Did she buy that, too?

458
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,279
<i>I also tried to make the eyeliner wings</i>

459
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,115
<i>look like crashing waves in the ocean.</i>

460
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,950
That's intense.

461
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,163
Designer Collector,
you'll regret having challenged me.

462
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,499
Please reveal the results

463
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,374

DESIGNER COLLECTOR: 4
SMOKY GIRL FROM BUSAN: 0

465
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,339
Wow, the score is 4 to 0!

466
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,090
Congratulations.

467
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,425
- Thank you!
- Congratulations!

468
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,220
Everything looked so clean,

469
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,431
<i>and the colors were perfectly blended.</i>

470
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,934
<i>You did a spot-on job</i>
<i>at following the theme.</i>

471
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,603
Smoky Girl from Busan,

472
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,272
<i>you added too many details</i>

473
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,943
<i>that I couldn't see</i>
<i>the sunset or the ocean.</i>

474
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,236
<i>It was too much.</i>

475
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,029
I don't think I can go to Gwangalli.

476
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,990
Thank you for watching
Smoky Girl from Busan.

477
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,495
Next is Bohemian.

478
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,248
I love that theme.

479
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,749
You're the bohemian icon.

480
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,543
I used to prefer

481
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,212
messy and smudged looks

482
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,588
over very clean looks.

483
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,799
BOHEMIAN

484
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,551
ROYAL FAMILY VS. LARGE GIRL

485
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,094
<i>I just saw the theme</i>

486
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,012
and signed up without knowing anything.

487
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,764
But I later learned

488
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,850
<i>that Royal Family was very famous.</i>

489
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,061
I'm currently a freelance makeup artist.

490
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,437
<i>I was often the exclusive makeup artist</i>

491
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,399
<i>for stars and celebs, like Hélène Mercier,</i>

<i>and other VIP guests visiting Korea.</i>

494
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,116
I was the exclusive makeup artist
for many of them.

495
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,701
My look is called

<i>I've never seen a lipstick in that shade!</i>

498
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,252
<i>She keeps mixing colors</i>
<i>until she gets the exact color she wants.</i>

499
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,170
<i>She's a true makeup artist.</i>

500
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,630
<i>She's a true master.</i>

<i>It's a style that is currently</i>

505
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,394
<i>trending worldwide.</i>

506
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,606
<i>I started with base makeup</i>
<i>that followed all the rules</i>

507
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,109
<i>and added unruly lashes,</i>

508
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,820
<i>messy freckles, and so on</i>

509
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,490
<i>in hopes of expressing free-spiritedness.</i>

510
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,825
What's that?

511
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,660
- They don't look like lashes.
- They are.

512
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,205
<i>The bottom eyelashes</i>
<i>were the key to my look.</i>

513
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,166
<i>I wanted to showcase sparse lashes</i>

514
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,834
<i>with thick clumps.</i>

515
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:43,088
- Hello, Large Girl.
- Hello.

516
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,925
<i>The title of my makeup look is</i>

517
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,468
<i>"Boho Blossom."</i>

518
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,554
<i>She should look as lively as a flower.</i>

519
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:54,642
<i>I wanted the lashes</i>
<i>to look like blooming flowers,</i>

520
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,936
<i>so I drew long eyeliner wings.</i>

521
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,022
<i>I used flatter lashes</i>
<i>toward the outer corners of the eyes</i>

522
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,233
<i>and sharp, straight lashes</i>
<i>in the inner corners</i>

523
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,861
<i>for that fluttering, feather-like feel.</i>

524
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:10,783
- Her brows!
- I cut them slightly.

525
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,535
<i>I added some big highlights,</i>

526
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,414
<i>such as body tattoos,</i>
<i>to add more of a free-spirited feel.</i>

527
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,708
Look at those lashes.

528
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,043
The two looks are completely different.

529
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,254
It's so interesting to see
such different approaches, isn't it?

530
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,549
- It must be so hard to choose one.
- Yes.

531
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,302
They look like tribal girls. How cute.

532
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,889
The twins look nearly identical,

533
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,976
but they look very different now,
don't they?

534
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:37,893
Yes.

535
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:42,064
Which Bohemian look will win?

536
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:46,235
Bohemian models, please enter the stage.

537
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,155
The outfits already look very exotic.

538
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,078
This is so interesting!

539
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:01,083
I feel like I'd see both of these looks
where all the bohemians are.

540
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,919
The first look is called "Boho Chic Look."

541
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,548
This is a modern,
elegant take on the Bohemian look.

542
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,425
<i>There's elegance from following the rules,</i>

543
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,427
<i>but with the unruly elements,</i>

544
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,596
I created an elegant
yet free-spirited look.

545
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,391
The next look is called

546
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:18,934
"Boho Blossom."

547
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,271
Free-spiritedness and individuality
meet a blooming flower

548
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,316
<i>to become a blossoming free soul.</i>

549
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,946
The look captures the model
shining her own light.

550
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,282
Oh, my. She's adorable.

551
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,661
Please reveal the results
of the Bohemian match.

552
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:42,124
<i>I'm confident that I'm better</i>
<i>at making someone look pretty with makeup.</i>

553
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,836
<i>It's not about who's good and who's not.</i>

554
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,840
I'd just be so happy
to make it to the third round.

555
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:54,636
Please reveal the results
of the Bohemian match.

556
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,013
I'm so nervous.

557
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,557
LARGE GIRL: 1
ROYAL FAMILY: 3

558
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,770
Congratulations.

559
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,314
Royal Family wins with 3 to 1.

560
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,068
<i>Royal Family's look had depth,</i>

561
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,487
but I was initially confused
about the lashes.

562
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,947
<i>Then, I realized</i>
<i>the chunky lashes were intentional.</i>

563
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,159
<i>Not only did she make</i>
<i>the bottom eyelashes clumpy,</i>

564
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,662
<i>but she also coated the upper lashes</i>
<i>with mascara multiple times</i>

565
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,998
to achieve that look.
It must've taken a lot of effort.

566
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,043
<i>The look just screamed Bohemian.</i>

567
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,587
I haven't had so much fun

568
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,839
doing makeup in so long.

569
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:33,592
I was so happy to have the chance
to do what I wanted

570
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,968
and showcase what I wanted.

571
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,136
Thank you.

572
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,847
Great work.

573
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:42,643
- She's here.
- Who is it?

574
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,644
Who won?

575
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,145
She won!

576
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,941
Hers had a more distinct vibe.

577
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,526
- Congratulations!
- She looks stunning.

578
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,735
Congratulations!

579
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:59,451
Please choose some winning candidates,
including yourself.

580
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:01,578
Winning candidates?

581
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,413
Oh, New York Master.

582
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,498
New York Master.

583
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,375
- Detailed Hands.
- Detailed Hands.

584
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,377
- New York Master.
- Detailed Hands.

585
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,586
I'm terrified of her.

586
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,046
She's the scariest.

587
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,464
<i>Detailed Hands.</i>

588
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:18,011
<i>The judges would struggle</i>
<i>to find any flaws in her details.</i>

589
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,429
<i>New York Master.</i>

590
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:22,641
<i>It'd be impossible to beat her</i>
<i>in a death match.</i>

591
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,352
DURING THE 1-ON-1 ROUND MATCHING
I'll choose Flapper Look.

592
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,896
New York Master and Beauty Wiki.

593
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,065
Rather than competing
against New York Master...

594
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,568
I'll go against Beauty Wiki.

595
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,238
I'm choosing Large Girl...

596
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,073
- Have you already chosen?
- Yes.

597
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,742
- I didn't even tell you to choose yet!
- Earlier, I told her

598
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,494
not to come out
so she could save her knees.

599
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,580
You've already chosen Large Girl!

600
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,707
I don't want to go
against New York Master.

601
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,417
I'll choose Short-Form Content Queen.

602
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,295
Short-Form Content Queen,
you've been matched.

603
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,006
I'd be terrified to go 1-on-1 against her.

604
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,549
New York Master,
please return to your seat.

605
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,050
My gosh! What do I do?

606
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,344
<i>Nobody would choose me,</i>

607
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:02,347
leaving me at a dead end with no options.

608
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,683
Detailed Hands.

609
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,613
Detailed Hands, you've been waiting
very quietly and patiently.

610
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,074
There aren't many keywords remaining.

611
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,452
- Natural.
- Natural?

612
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,536
Yes, I'll go with Natural.

613
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,705
Okay, Detailed Hands has chosen Natural.

614
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,458
Nobody wanted to take on Natural.

615
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,084
That was when I knew it was mine.

616
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,545
Detailed Hands has chosen Natural.

617
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,755
I'll join her.

618
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,049
New York Master, are you choosing Natural?

619
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,800
Yes, I'll choose Natural.

620
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,302
Oh, my!

621
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,346
- That's a big match.
- What?

622
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:43,972
- It'll be a big match.
- Yes.

623
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,808
I like all kinds of makeup looks.

624
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,644
I'll take on the challenge.

625
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,188
I didn't want to go against her!

626
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,274
Her nickname is Detailed Hands.

627
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,402
<i>I thought I'd have a good chance</i>
<i>of winning in the Natural match.</i>

628
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,822
<i>I work on photoshoots</i>
<i>where my makeup completes the look,</i>

629
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,741
<i>so that's my strength.</i>

630
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,660
The dice have already been thrown.

631
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,287
We'll have a true winner

632
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:11,041
<i>when we compete with our best works.</i>

633
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:12,834
Natural.

634
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:17,130
A natural makeup look on twins?

635
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,508
JUNG YEO-RU AND JUNG AE-RAN
That sounds like a huge challenge.

636
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,261
Natural makeup is
the most basic of its kind.

637
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:26,932
I feel like you don't need to do much
for a natural look.

638
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,810
That's what I think,
but I hear it actually requires more.

639
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:33,146
You need to observe your model
very closely

640
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,691
to work with their natural features
for the look.

641
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,319
You must cover any flaws
very naturally and delicately

642
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,697
without making the makeup look
like it's too much.

643
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,073
While preparing the makeup,

644
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:47,369
the artist must stop at one point
and say, "This is all I'm going to do."

645
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,162
It's a conscious choice to stop.

646
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,080
That's why it's hard.

647
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:53,709
This is something
makeup masters can excel at.

648
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,546
<i>So, natural makeup</i>
<i>is actually master-level makeup.</i>

649
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,257
<i>The K-beauty style of Natural makeup.</i>

650
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,051
That's actually a very complex look.

651
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,762
You must pay attention
to the very fine details.

652
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,515
You must be
exceptionally attentive to details.

653
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,101
You must make the model look classy
without looking flashy.

654
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,395
A classy and bright look.

655
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,565
<i>I decided to go for a Korean actress look.</i>

656
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,403
<i>I tried to work with the original lines,</i>
<i>colors, and texture of the model.</i>

657
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,614
<i>My goal was to accentuate those features</i>
<i>in the most delicate ways</i>

658
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,242
<i>to make her look bright,</i>
<i>but also very sophisticated.</i>

659
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,704
<i>My biggest focus was on her skin.</i>

660
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,581
<i>I wanted her skin</i>

661
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,460
<i>to look like it was glowing,</i>
<i>but in a silky, subtle way.</i>

662
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,713
<i>It all depends on the force</i>
<i>and how much product you use.</i>

663
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,467
<i>I paid attention to every fine detail</i>

664
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,135
<i>and built up every layer with care.</i>

665
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,263
- She looks so clean.
- So clear!

666
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:52,184
- She's indeed Detailed Hands.
- Doesn't her skin texture look different?

667
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,101
BEFORE AND AFTER BASE MAKEUP
Yes.

668
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,228
She's very meticulous.

669
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,732
She always strives
for 200 percent perfection.

670
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,901
Do you feel like you look different?

671
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,611
- It's like you're someone else, right?
- Yes.

672
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,821
It's like I got plastic surgery.

673
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,948
I'm so curious.

674
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,326
I wonder how the other artist is doing.

675
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:15,999
I'm brushing every fine eyelash,
even the hidden ones.

676
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,919
<i>She must look natural,</i>
<i>but also sophisticated.</i>

677
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,631
<i>My goal was a city woman's natural look.</i>

678
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:27,636
My biggest strength lies in base makeup,
even in New York.

679
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,848
<i>I wanted to make her skin look silky.</i>

680
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,519
<i>I used MAC's Face and Body Foundation</i>

681
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,231
<i>with Banila Co's foundation</i>
<i>that has the perfect silky finish</i>

682
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,608
<i>to keep the makeup light</i>

683
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,777
<i>and matched the model's shade.</i>

684
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,657
<i>The base makeup sometimes</i>
<i>doesn't look well-blended into the skin</i>

685
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,158
<i>when you use</i>
<i>both foundation and concealer.</i>

686
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,912
<i>So, I sprayed some mist</i>
<i>to balance out the moisture and oil</i>

687
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:58,125
<i>before lightly applying the concealer</i>
<i>to sit right on her face.</i>

688
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:02,712
<i>I repeated that mist-and-concealer process</i>
<i>over many layers.</i>

689
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,340
Her base makeup is so beautiful.

690
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:08,176
Wow, her skin looks like art!

691
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,511
BEFORE AND AFTER BASE MAKEUP
Her skin looks insane.

692
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,347
Her skin looks photoshopped.
It looks completely clean.

693
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,059
<i>I glued individual lashes</i>

694
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:19,312
<i>and put mascara on every hidden lash</i>

695
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,106
<i>to make them look full.</i>

696
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,526
This look seems to require
so much attention to detail.

697
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,487
She's very detailed.
Each and every lash looks perfect.

698
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,366
<i>Her brows were a bit short,</i>

699
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:35,537
<i>so I used some special techniques</i>
<i>to extend her brows naturally.</i>

700
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,624
She filled the entire brow,

701
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,377
but it doesn't look too dark
or like it's too much.

702
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:46,047
She's using a pencil
and even going the opposite way.

703
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,509
She's excellent at working on fine details
with her hands.

704
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,428
She's New York Master, after all.

705
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,638
Look at the brows.

706
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,640
- They're perfect.
- I'm speechless.

707
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,143
- The lines are...
- They look perfect.

708
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,023
I'm stunned.
She hasn't even applied the falsies yet.

709
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,734
- Every feature looks so clean and clear.
- Exactly.

710
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:10,113
<i>The model's brow hairs were all going</i>
<i>in the right direction,</i>

711
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:12,365
<i>so I only accentuated that</i>
<i>and added a bit more</i>

712
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,744
<i>in the more sparse parts</i>
<i>with a few touches.</i>

713
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,747
- Her brows look so beautiful, right?
- I agree.

714
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,041
<i>I used black gel eyeliner</i>

715
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,959
<i>to line her eyes for the eye makeup.</i>

716
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,544
<i>I didn't make the lines too thick.</i>

717
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:26,463
<i>Just enough not to take away</i>
<i>from her natural beauty.</i>

718
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,549
Look down.

719
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,926
That's stunning.

720
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,929
I don't want to take off my makeup today.

721
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:36,389
She's very meticulous.

722
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,767
This is the ultimate natural makeup.

723
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,268
Natural makeup is really hard.

724
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,230
The details.

725
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,732
They're working on every fine detail.

726
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,403
The model's natural face had

727
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,697
<i>a very bright orange-brown color.</i>

728
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,785
<i>So, to make her natural colors</i>
<i>look beautiful,</i>

729
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:01,122
<i>I used more coral and peach shades</i>
<i>instead of pink on her face.</i>

730
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,668
<i>The model's eyes were very brown,</i>

731
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,171
<i>and they were so clear.</i>

732
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,091
<i>So, I covered her eyelids</i>
<i>with a subtly pink eyeshadow color</i>

733
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,135
<i>that had very fine sparkles.</i>

734
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,721
<i>That was to accentuate her eye color.</i>

735
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:19,391
<i>Then, I used pink on her cheekbones</i>

736
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,978
<i>and the undereye area.</i>

737
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,146
They look different.

738
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,982
I can see it.

739
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,986
It's amazing how different the models look
under the same theme.

740
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,988
This model has more pink on her face,

741
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,489
while the other has more coral tones.

742
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:35,657
DETAILED HANDS: CORAL
NEW YORK MASTER: PINK

743
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,744
They're both such masters of their craft

744
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,664
that the outfits and hairstyles
will also play a huge part.

745
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,667
Let's get you changed.

746
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,169
This is my last push.

747
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,506
It's a battle
between the ultimate queens of details.

748
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,677
- It won't be an easy fight.
- The details!

749
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,348
Please make it to the finals, okay?

750
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,186
It's like crystal clear water falling.

751
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,022
How will the judges evaluate these looks?

752
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,816
<i>It'll be impossible for the judges</i>
<i>to choose a winner.</i>

753
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,193
<i>The hardest makeup look is</i>
<i>indeed a Natural look.</i>

754
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,365
Natural models, please enter.

755
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,703
- They look very natural.
- So natural.

756
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,545
NATURAL

757
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,889
<i>I'll now explain the looks.</i>

758
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,140
The first look is called

759
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,392
"An Actress on the Red Carpet."

760
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,062
It's a natural, bright, and elegant look

761
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,731
for an actress at an awards ceremony.

762
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,236
The second look is called

763
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,821
"Natural Luxe."

764
00:35:56,905 --> 00:36:00,909
It's an elegant but effortless look
with a luxurious skin texture

765
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,954
and natural but clear eyes,
New Yorker style.

766
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,248
Judges,

767
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,792
please begin your evaluations.

768
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,590
- Do you feel overwhelmed?
- Yes, I do.

769
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:18,134
Sorry, we have to look at you
very closely in this round.

770
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:27,977
Did you get lash extensions?

771
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,105
- No.
- Oh, they're glued on?

772
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,447
<i>I assessed the Natural looks</i>
<i>very carefully.</i>

773
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,200
<i>It's the most important makeup look,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

774
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,203
Could you close your eyes?

775
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,249
<i>I couldn't wait for the results.</i>

776
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,585
<i>I wondered what they had on their minds</i>
<i>as they looked at my makeup.</i>

777
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,546
<i>My gosh.</i>

778
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,631
This is hard.

779
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,308
Has everyone voted?

780
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,938
Contestants for Natural makeup,
please enter.

781
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,406
They were Detailed Hands
and New York Master.

782
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,493
They're both very strong contestants.

783
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:29,330
It all makes sense now.

784
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,624
What do you mean?

785
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,003
Let's announce the winner first

786
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,172
before we continue talking.

787
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:40,508
Please reveal the results

788
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,052
of the Natural match
in the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

789
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,185
<i>What if I get eliminated?</i>

790
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,604
<i>I want to make it to Round Three!</i>

791
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,405
- I'm nervous!
- I can't do this!

792
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,199
DETAILED HANDS: 3
NEW YORK MASTER: 1

793
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,492
Congratulations!

794
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,244
Congratulations!

795
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,331
The winner of the Natural match
in the 1-on-1 Mirror Round is

796
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,415
Detailed Hands.

797
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,500
Congratulations.

798
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,377
Everything made sense

799
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,838
when you two came in.

800
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,341
One captured the essence of K-beauty,

801
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:25,804
while the other captured
the international style of Natural.

802
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,389
When I looked at this model,

803
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,643
I had a feeling her makeup artist

804
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,061
was someone who worked abroad.

805
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,897
Everything makes sense now.

806
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:38,066
You had different styles
for this Natural look,

807
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:42,153
but I chose Detailed Hand's model,

808
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,823
as her makeup captured
the traditional K-beauty style better.

809
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:45,782
I see.

810
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,409
<i>That's what Natural makeup means to me.</i>

811
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:53,581
It's not about making people think
you've put on makeup to look fancy.

812
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:56,709
Instead, it's about making people think
you're naturally beautiful.

813
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,504
<i>The makeup on this model's face</i>

814
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,589
<i>looked like a part of her own face.</i>

815
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,552
I chose New York Master's look

816
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:09,556
because it looked like that of a mature,
professional, working woman.

817
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:13,643
I was enticed by the color
of the undereye makeup, too.

818
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,271
I've been reminded once again today

819
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,941
that my internationally-based career
has led me to have

820
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,442
very much of a New York style.

821
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:25,280
I also realized my shortcomings

822
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,991
after competing with Detailed Hands today.

823
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,494
Her look seemed to tell me
what K-beauty was all about.

824
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:35,373
<i>It inspired me to learn more</i>
<i>about K-beauty, too.</i>

825
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,252
I wanted to keep fighting
without holding back.

826
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,881
As sad as I am,
I think I put up a good fight.

827
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,302
NEW YORK MASTER

828
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:50,263
<i>Next,</i>

829
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,306
Glitter Party.

830
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,182
Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room wins.

831
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,310
Congratulations!

832
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:59,314
First Empress Myeongseong wins
in the Flapper Look match.

833
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:03,276
Makeup Model Student wins
in the K-pop match.

834
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,153
Congratulations.

835
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,113
It's time for the last match.

836
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,324
It's the Drag match.

837
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,160
You know who we haven't seen?

838
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,953
MACtist.

839
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,165
I bet MACtist would nail this match.

840
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,668
Is he going against SSIN, then?

841
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,420
That's going to be a fun match!

842
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,005
No way!

843
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,341
I love you!

844
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,304
You can already hear them outside!

845
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,305
Everyone is going crazy.

846
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,350
I'm so curious!

847
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,854
MACtist will go against BeauTube Veteran

848
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,190
in the Drag match.

849
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,317
They'll nail this!

850
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,861
Drag is about challenging gender norms

851
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,863
<i>and expressing one's true self.</i>

852
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,491
AN ART FORM OF SELF-EXPRESSION
THAT CHALLENGES GENDER NORMS

853
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,868
MACtist, have you ever done such a look?

854
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,955
Changing genders is easy for me,

855
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,915
like flicking a light switch on and off.

856
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,875
I also go back and forth all the time.

857
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,586
Both of you are confident
about changing genders with makeup.

858
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,048
Both of them are
too skilled to be eliminated.

859
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,342
- It'll be an intense match.
- It's the last match, Drag.

860
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:10,635
DRAG

861
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,261
- Did you see the comedians?
- Yes.

862
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,972
I was so surprised to see them.

863
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,640
LEE SANG-HO AND LEE SANG-MIN
<i>I have a feeling they'll pull it off well.</i>

864
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,266
I can see them go all out.

865
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,435
- Like this.
- They'd be great at it.

866
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,646
- Do you know anything about drag makeup?
- No.

867
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,524
It's where men dress up as women.

868
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,820
I thought a lot
about how I'd like to do this makeup,

869
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,863
and in the process, I noticed

870
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,408
<i>that the keyword was "Drag,"</i>
<i>not "Drag Queen."</i>

871
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,578
So, the theme of my makeup today is

872
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,122
"Drag King."

873
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,082
Why a drag king, you ask?

874
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:46,462
<i>Drag culture is a satire</i>
<i>of gender norms through exaggeration.</i>

875
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:50,008
<i>Today, I want to change things up</i>
<i>and create a look with masculine elements.</i>

876
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:52,260
- I wasn't expecting a drag king.
- Me neither.

877
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,846
Her ideas are so different.

878
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,390
<i>It'll be totally different</i>
<i>from the drag makeup you know.</i>

879
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:01,602
<i>People usually associate blue</i>
<i>with masculinity.</i>

880
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,604
Please close your eyes.

881
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:07,025
<i>I applied blue eyeshadow on his eyelids</i>

882
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,569
<i>and blended it out with green eyeshadow.</i>

883
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,613
<i>The colors were also very symbolic.</i>

884
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,450
- SSIN chose such pretty colors.
- Indeed.

885
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,452
- The blue looks stunning.
- Yes.

886
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:22,415
<i>I thought it'd be nice to add</i>
<i>some drag elements,</i>

887
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:26,002
<i>so I added falsies</i>

888
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,046
<i>and plenty of glitter.</i>

889
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,883
- Do you need help?
- Could you hold it?

890
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,053
- Please leave the sideburns out.
- I'll leave them out as much as possible.

891
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,346
<i>I prepared an Elvis Presley-style wig</i>

892
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,807
<i>and put makeup on his sideburns</i>
<i>to connect his face to the wig.</i>

893
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:41,434
<i>And the brows.</i>

894
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,061
Look at his brows.

895
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,272
A drag king's brows are supposed to be
thicker and darker.

896
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,817
<i>I went against the norm</i>
<i>of a drag queen look</i>

897
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,903
<i>and incorporated</i>
<i>every typically masculine element.</i>

898
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,239
What's MACtist doing?

899
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,909
He's doing classic Drag makeup.

900
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,330
My makeup is called
"Face Me, Like a Queen."

901
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:07,001
It reflects my desire and determination

902
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,337
<i>to become the queen of JUST MAKEUP.</i>

903
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,131
<i>I poured myself into this model.</i>

904
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,174
"Look at me."

905
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,385
"I'm the real queen here!"

906
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,476
<i>The key to Drag makeup is</i>

907
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,353
<i>removing the natural brows.</i>

908
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:29,023
<i>Once we erase the brows,</i>
<i>there's more space for eye makeup.</i>

909
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:33,027
<i>I used a darker, warm-toned concealer</i>

910
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,531
<i>to get rid of the eyebrows first.</i>

911
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,538
<i>Then, I began creating</i>
<i>a dramatic eye makeup look.</i>

912
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,666
You can tell
he's experienced in this, right?

913
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,209
- Like he's done it before.
- Yeah.

914
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:51,045
He got the eyes perfect on the first try.

915
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:55,049
His confident,
bold strokes are so impressive.

916
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,260
- He's different.
- The range is also very wide.

917
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,511
Yes, the range, too.

918
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:02,056
I couldn't use those colors so boldly.

919
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,725
<i>The key point of my makeup is</i>

920
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,936
<i>the use of contrasting</i>
<i>complementary colors</i>

921
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:10,857
<i>for a more dramatic and wild look.</i>

922
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,067
<i>It's all about the bold eyes.</i>

923
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,865
Oh, my, those falsies!

924
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,741
Those falsies could almost touch
his forehead!

925
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,913
He's placing the undereye falsies
under the undereye bags.

926
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,373
To make his eyes look bigger.

927
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,834
It seems to be
all about making the eyes bigger.

928
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,295
It's about how well
you can expand the eyes.

929
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:35,381
They're using completely different colors,
so it's very interesting.

930
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,759
One is all blue,
and the other is all gold.

931
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:40,803
Drag makeup is interesting.

932
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,764
- I can't wait to see the outfits!
- What?

933
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,142
I bet they prepared so much
for the outfits.

934
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,937
- He's already in the outfit.
- He's wearing it.

935
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,564
Miss Korea?

936
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,399
Queen!

937
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,235
That's a real wig for drag queens.

938
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,945
With the lace in front.

939
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,447
- It won't fall off, right?
- No.

940
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,450
- This side, too!
- What are they doing?

941
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,702
- That's incredible.
- My gosh!

942
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,662
- He's a bullfighter.
- The outfit.

943
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:07,914
What an impressive outfit.

944
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,291
How can anyone beat these guys?

945
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,127
<i>- Between me and MACtist?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

946
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,254
<i>I think I'll win.</i>

947
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:16,672
All right.

948
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:21,135
<i>The theme was Drag, not Drag Queen.</i>

949
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:23,638
<i>That's my winning move.</i>

950
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:26,307
<i>I'm confident.</i>

951
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,309
<i>I'm the queen. I'm the real one.</i>

952
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,812
Here they come! The last models!

953
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:37,318
<i>I'll return in victory.</i>

954
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,781
It's a battle between
a drag king and a drag queen.

955
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,325
- Goodness!
- What a solid finale.

956
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,660
I know, right?

957
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:47,662
Let's go.

958
00:45:51,332 --> 00:45:53,709
Why is everyone cheering so loudly?

959
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,879
Here comes the last match
of the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

960
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,757
Models for Drag, please enter.

961
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,697
That's scary!

962
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:24,490
I'm scared.

963
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,575
These two...

964
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,577
All right.

965
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,955
They're both fighting for attention!

966
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:35,459
The Drag models are
Korea's biggest twin comedians.

967
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,879
I'll now introduce the looks.

968
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,631
The first look is called

969
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,801
"Not Drag Queen, but Drag King."

970
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,639
Just as drag queen makeup
is more than just looking like a woman,

971
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,725
I wanted this makeup to question

972
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,729
society's extreme requirements
for masculinity.

973
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:56,480
That's SSIN.

974
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,734
- BeauTube Veteran.
- Yes, BeauTube Veteran.

975
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,153
The second look is called

976
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,197
"Face Me Like a Queen."

977
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:09,076
I'm the queen of JUST MAKEUP.

978
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,912
I made my statement through the model.

979
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,291
It's a concentrated look
of the powerful energy of drag makeup.

980
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,586
<i>My enemy will immediately realize</i>
<i>their defeat</i>

981
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:22,089
because there can only be one queen!

982
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,301
That was the artist's statement.

983
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:27,928
- I don't know who to look at first!
- Seriously.

984
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,598
- It must be scary to approach them.
- Yes, I'm scared!

985
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,600
My goodness, this is hilarious.

986
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,226
EVALUATING THE DRAG LOOKS

987
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:40,232
- The beard is very unique.
- How interesting.

988
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,444
The artist printed the bread on his face.

989
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:47,740
<i>A content creator is indeed different.</i>
<i>The look was far from ordinary.</i>

990
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,743
<i>The way the artist drew the beard,</i>
<i>for example.</i>

991
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:53,788
The artist even left eyebrow scratches.

992
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,750
<i>- There's "KING" written on his neck.</i>
<i>- Above the brows, too.</i>

993
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:02,254
<i>This artist doesn't go</i>
<i>for anything ordinary or expected.</i>

994
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,340
As expected from BeauTube Veteran.

995
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,469
I love the wit involved
in the drag king look.

996
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,684
It's amazing.

997
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:19,772
<i>It was a dramatic cut crease eye makeup.</i>

998
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,733
<i>That's a key element in drag makeup.</i>

999
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:25,611
- The sparkles are beautiful.
- Yes.

1000
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,740
<i>It was such a playful look,</i>

1001
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:35,162
<i>yet the artist was spot-on with all</i>
<i>the details involved in Drag makeup.</i>

1002
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:38,999
<i>MACtist is truly unlike any other.</i>

1003
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,835
Check me out before you go!

1004
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:44,004
I can't look you in the eyes!
I saw you, though.

1005
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,172
- Did you?
- Yes.

1006
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,051
<i>I was prepared to look for</i>
<i>my go-to priorities,</i>

1007
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:53,514
<i>such as the proportions and the balance,</i>

1008
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,058
<i>when I heard Drag was the next theme.</i>

1009
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,494
We will now bring the two artists

1010
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:17,830
who created these beautiful Drag looks.

1011
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,207
I knew it!

1012
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,502
All right.

1013
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:26,213
The contestants in the Drag match were

1014
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:30,092
BeauTube Veteran and MACtist.

1015
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,387
The judges were very intrigued
by the looks.

1016
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:36,223
Let's announce the results first.

1017
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,143
Please reveal the results

1018
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,896
of the Drag match
in the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

1019
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,565
I'm curious.

1020
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:50,154
<i>Now that I'm here, I can't go home.</i>

1021
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:54,158
<i>I'll show you the power of a veteran.</i>

1022
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:56,368
The last contestant to pass!

1023
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,246
I wonder who it'll be!

1024
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,499
Will it be the king or the queen?

1025
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,001
That is the question.

1026
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,924
MACTIST: 4
BEAUTUBE VETERAN: 0

1027
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:17,890
MACtist wins 4 to 0.

1028
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:20,267
BeauTube Veteran,

1029
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,937
unfortunately, you've been eliminated.

1030
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:26,315
The moment I saw the model,
I knew that it was BeauTube Veteran's work

1031
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,735
because it was so witty.

1032
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,946
But the wig!

1033
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,323
It created a shadow,

1034
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,951
which took a bit of focus
away from the face.

1035
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:40,663
<i>It was an Elvis Presley-style wig</i>
<i>with big bangs,</i>

1036
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,123
which left a big shadow on his face.

1037
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,794
<i>There were too many elements</i>
<i>in the makeup,</i>

1038
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,797
<i>so his face looked a bit too crowded.</i>

1039
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,967
The look could've been
a bit more balanced.

1040
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:56,303
His eyeliner wings and the mustache

1041
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:58,597
all stayed in such a narrow zone.

1042
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:01,684
<i>The makeup made his features look</i>
<i>too crowded in the center.</i>

1043
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:05,145
That got some points off as Drag makeup.

1044
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,481
Saem-mool.

1045
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,317
For a very long time,

1046
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:15,155
drag has been all about self-expression
through shows and plays.

1047
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,951
When MACtist's model stood in front of me,

1048
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:21,996
he drew me right in
with that sense of self-expression.

1049
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,292
Those exaggerated elements were expressed

1050
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,252
in such a chic way, which I loved.

1051
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,005
The last comment from the model

1052
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,090
ultimately made me choose him.

1053
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,427
He's even wearing colored contact lenses!

1054
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,095
Wasn't it tiring, Your Majesty?

1055
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,096
It's fine.

1056
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,140
He made me look beautiful, after all.

1057
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,808
I'm so happy.

1058
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,477
<i>He said he was so happy</i>
<i>that the artist made him look beautiful.</i>

1059
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,771
I could tell he meant it.

1060
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:51,358
Yes, that's the power of makeup.

1061
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:58,157
He was so humorous and helpful

1062
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,700
when we actually met in person,

1063
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:03,787
so everything came so naturally
when working with him.

1064
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,999
Hearing your comment, Saem-mool,

1065
00:52:08,334 --> 00:52:11,837
means the world to me

1066
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,715
as his makeup artist of the day.

1067
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,925
Great work, you two.

1068
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:22,181
Great work to the twin models, too.

1069
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,099
- Thank you.
- The four of you

1070
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,143
- may return.
- Okay.

1071
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,145
- Thank you.
- Great job!

1072
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,605
- Watch the steps.
- Thank you.

1073
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,814
- Good job.
- You, too.

1074
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,900
- I hope I didn't make you get eliminated.
- Not at all.

1075
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:37,863
I did my best.

1076
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,574
It's time to return to the online world.

1077
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,245
I'm so sad.

1078
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:47,122
I know. It was too perfect.

1079
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:49,583
His look was flawless.

1080
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,839
He made it!
He said he'd throw a fit if he didn't.

1081
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,930
His model is hilarious!

1082
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,099
- That's incredible.
- You're so pretty!

1083
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,059
- He's hilarious!
- I know.

1084
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,436
All our artists are so amazing.

1085
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:11,313
They're incredible.

1086
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:15,567
They must've put in
so much thought and effort

1087
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,027
to prepare for this round.

1088
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,448
1-ON-1 DEATH MATCH MIRROR ROUND IS OVER
<i>The show is over.</i>

1089
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:23,909
Please get up.

1090
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,619
Only the eliminated contestants, please.

1091
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:28,288
Are the lights going out on us
all at once?

1092
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,457
- You seven can go that way.
- What are they doing?

1093
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,876
What's going on now?

1094
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,461
What are we doing now?

1095
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:35,796
Where are we going?

1096
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,506
- Hold on.
- This way?

1097
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,674
Why?

1098
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,217
They must be doing something!

1099
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,510
There must be a redemption round.

1100
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,814
Great work.

1101
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,822
That's a wrap for the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

1102
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:06,034
It's time for
the 15 eliminated artists to go home.

1103
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,578
You must be so sad.

1104
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,829
I don't want to leave!

1105
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:12,875
The judges and I are also very sad

1106
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:16,170
that we haven't seen
all the wonderful looks you've prepared.

1107
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,296
That is why...

1108
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,047
No way.

1109
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:23,677
We will announce additional contestants.

1110
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,762
Please pick me!

1111
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:32,186
But we will only select

1112
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,980
just one more contestant.

1113
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:38,192
THERE'S ONLY ONE ADDITIONAL CONTESTANT

1114
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:39,526
...one more contestant.

1115
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,488
Who will it be?

1116
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,407
Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon,
who do you want it to be?

1117
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,869
Me!

1118
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,874
Large Girl,
who do you think will be chosen?

1119
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,209
Me!

1120
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,461
Me!

1121
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,593
The four judges have already chosen

1122
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,554
the additional contestant to pass
through a discussion.

1123
00:55:07,763 --> 00:55:09,890
- They're close.
- We must choose one of them.

1124
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:12,226
We should choose between two
and narrow down the options.

1125
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,436
Should we choose between these two?

1126
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,649
This artist has shown us

1127
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,985
very different looks
for Round 1 and Round 2,

1128
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,823
so we really want to see
what incredible look they'll prepare next.

1129
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:29,868
We have very high hopes
for this contestant.

1130
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,579
So, everyone has chosen this contestant
to save for Round Three.

1131
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:36,041
The additional successful contestant is...

1132
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,839
<i>I still have more to show them.</i>

1133
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,299
<i>I have to make it to Round Three,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1134
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,261
<i>I did well, too. I did.</i>

1135
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,685
Wait.

1136
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,442
<i>There will be one K-pop group</i>

1137
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,111
<i>with makeup from two teams of artists.</i>

1138
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,237
<i>If the team fails, everyone is out.</i>

1139
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,281
<i>- This isn't the right color.</i>
<i>- Just one minute left!</i>

1140
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,782
- Let's listen to our captain.
- Oh, man!

1141
00:56:08,824 --> 00:56:10,409
<i>- I'm disappointed.</i>
<i>- I'm resentful.</i>

1142
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,035
It's over for us.

1143
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,579
They look completely different.

1144
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,163
That's how important makeup is.

1145
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,680
