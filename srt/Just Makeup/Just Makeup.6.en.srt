The additional successful contestant is...

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,729
<i>I still have more to show them.</i>

9
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,098
<i>I have to make it to Round Three,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

10
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,168
<i>I did well, too. I did.</i>

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,977
Wait.

12
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,116
I feel like I'm about to faint!

13
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:53,920
Director Jung!

14
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:54,988
Are you nervous, Saem-mool?

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,389
- Yes, very nervous.
- Take a deep breath.

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,657
Take a deep breath.

17
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,169
I'm so nervous!

18
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,838
The last contestant to advance
to Round Three is...

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,982

26
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,906
I had so much that I wanted to show,

27
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,642
but was unable to display much of it.

28
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,813
<i>That was what I was</i>
<i>most disappointed about.</i>

29
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,350
The makeup she prepared for Round Two was

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,786
<i>totally different from</i>
<i>what she did for Round One.</i>

31
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,655
<i>She ditched all her habits</i>

32
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:06,926
<i>and took on a new huge challenge</i>
<i>in the flashiest way, which amazed us all.</i>

33
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,530
I can't wait to see
another dramatic change from her.

34
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,465
What?

35
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,435
- Who is it?
- It's Hyun-jeung!

36
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,172
You came back alive!

37
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,007
<i>I won't pass by</i>
<i>a hair's breadth next time.</i>

38
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:26,413
I'll show everyone
how capable I am in Round Three.

39
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,582
- No!
- Great work.

40
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,351
Please don't leave!

41
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,186
It's a shame.

42
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,322
- Great work.
- You were amazing.

43
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,192
- That was exhausting.
- Right?

44
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,728
Great work, everyone.
Please work on my face next time!

45
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,864
- Yes, I would love to!
- Please do.

46
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,502
- Oh no.
- Don't cry!

47
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,671
Both of you did an incredible job.

48
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,039
My gosh!

49
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,174

- It feels like

55
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,863
when we all first met at the beginning.

56
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,871
- What's going on now?
- I'm scared!

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,177
Congratulations to the 16 artists

58
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,345
Congratulations.

59
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,486
What mission are you
expecting to see next?

60
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,787
A fashion show?

61
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,222
A fashion show?

62
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,790
Backstage beauty!

63
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,492
Oh, it could be a backstage project!

64
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,129

K-POP STAGE

67
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,470
"K-pop Stage."

68
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,341
I love it!

69
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,377
This is bad. It's not my forte.

70
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,545
Yes, you can!

71
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,982
With K-pop idols gaining global attention

72
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,517
<i>and popularity,</i>

73
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,852
<i>K-beauty has also been experiencing</i>

74
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,521
<i>a rise in global popularity.</i>

75
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,289
<i>Many global fans strive to look</i>

76
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,825
<i>like these K-pop idols.</i>

77
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,227
Many people want to copy

78
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,096
<i>the makeup looks that K-pop idols have,</i>

79
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:27,233
<i>which has led to the rise</i>
<i>of K-pop idol cover makeup videos.</i>

80
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,071
<i>K-pop definitely goes hand-in-hand</i>
<i>with the rise of K-beauty.</i>

81
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,642
Our show will be watched globally,

82
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:39,579
so this K-pop idol mission
will be crucial to this show.

83
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:40,480
K-POP STAGE

84
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,115
You will listen to a K-pop group's song

85
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,884
and create a look that best suits

86
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,120
the group's performance.

87
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,057
So we'll be art directors
for the performance.

88
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,494
And you will work in teams for this round.

89
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,862
...work in teams for this round.

90
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,332
...work in teams for this round.

91
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,802
<i>The time has come.</i>

92
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,672
<i>Everyone's makeup style is so different,</i>

93
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,440
<i>and so are our backgrounds.</i>

94
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,710
<i>We need to agree on things as a team.</i>

95
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,047
<i>I generally work by myself,</i>

96
00:05:14,114 --> 00:05:15,815
<i>so I'm not sure</i>
<i>if things will turn out well.</i>

97
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,885
4 PEOPLE PER GROUP
The 16 contestants will get into 4 teams,

98
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,620
<i>two of which will work with a girl group,</i>

99
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,890
<i>while the other two work with a boy group.</i>

100
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,792
Wouldn't it be easier to work
with a girl group?

101
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,494
The gender doesn't matter to me.

102
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,129
<i>Four judges</i>

103
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,632

There will be 100 fans!

107
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,942
This became way bigger than
what I was expecting.

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,111
Everyone from the winning teams
will move to the next round.

109
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,548
Everyone from the losing teams
will be eliminated.

110
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,683
Really?

111
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,618
As there are two teams each!

112
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,486
The whole team gets eliminated?

113
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,188
- The whole team?
- Yes, the whole team.

114
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,356
We need to be smart.

115
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,024
Oh, my.

116
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,627

<i>and STAYC's interpretation of the message</i>

129
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:35,328
<i>about moving on</i>
<i>without letting one's ex hold them back.</i>

130
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,998
I think it's more fun

00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,411
FOURTH MOST VOTES:
MACTIST

176
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,081
These are the four captains.

177
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,385
Now, we'll decide
who will work with which team

178
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,187
and the performance order,
which are as important as the captains.

179
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,658
STAYC: TEAM A FIRST, TEAM B NEXT
<i>The most-voted captain will go first</i>

180
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,795
TWS: TEAM C FIRST, TEAM D NEXT
in choosing their team.

181
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,864
I'll choose TWS and go second.

182
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,699
Golden Hand in Paris chose TWS

183
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,702
<i>and will take the second spot.</i>

184
00:08:55,802 --> 00:08:58,071
That was clever.

185
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,006
That way, she can see

186
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,341
- Avoid going first?
- what the first team does.

187
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,177
I loved TWS's liveliness!

188
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,946
<i>So, I knew I had to choose TWS.</i>

189
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,182
TWS, I love you!

190
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,551
Next, Detailed Hands.

191
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,153
- I've made my decision.
- Okay.

192
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,755
I actually wanted to take
the second spot for TWS,

193
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:17,323
but since it's been taken,

194
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,592
I'll choose the first spot for TWS.

195
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,227
My gosh!

196
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,996
What an intense battle.
They're both so talented!

197
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:23,997
- What do we do?
- Unbelievable!

198
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,900
Detailed Hands has chosen
the first spot for TWS.

199
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,601
Detailed Hands and Golden Hand in Paris
will compete

200
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,904
<i>with two looks for TWS.</i>

201
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,606
That only leaves the two spots for STAYC.

202
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,641
First Man.

203
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,976
I'll choose the second spot for STAYC.

204
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:39,179
That only leaves me
with the first spot for STAYC,

205
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,780
but going first is the best, isn't it?

206
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:41,981
I'm confident.

207
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,785
<i>MACtist and First Man will compete</i>

208
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,187
<i>with two looks for STAYC.</i>

209
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,856
I'm in a huge dilemma. What should I do?

210
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,558
Which captain do you want to choose?

211
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,792
Golden Hand in Paris.

212
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,495
Do you have a team you want to be in?

213
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,497
- I don't know!
- Me neither.

214
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,734
Now, I'll give you just ten minutes.

215
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,736
You have ten minutes!

216
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,171
TEAM SELECTION BEGINS FOR K-POP STAGE
Please choose your teammates.

217
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,874
Ten minutes? Let me think for a bit.

218
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,042
Come on over!

219
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,144

Who are you choosing?

226
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,062

Join me for TWS!

228
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,999

TWS!

230
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,004
I've worked with many male K-pop artists.

231

NEVER DEAD QUEEN, CREATIVE DIRECTOR
I recently worked with 82MAJOR.

232

I'm currently working with ENHYPEN.

233
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,843
It's great. You're experienced

I'm very happy.

241
00:10:57,624 --> 00:10:59,592
I wanted to work with you guys.

242
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,595
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS IS READY
You'll find details I miss...

243
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,532
<i>I thought some were especially talented,</i>

244
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,334
<i>and all my teammates were among them.</i>

245
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,135
<i>So, I knew I'd be fine.</i>

246
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,303
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS, DESIGNER COLLECTOR,
SWAG MAKER, OH DOLCE VITA

247
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,240
I understand K-beauty better.

248
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,975
<i>That should give me some leverage.</i>

249
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:20,146
<i>I've worked in various settings.</i>

250
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,783
My strength lies in my ability
to try new things.

251
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:29,823
TWS STAGE: TEAM DETAILED HANDS
VS. TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

252
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,038
We'll begin the performance now!

253
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,439
In 1, 2, 3.

254
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,476
- The set is so pretty!
- I know!

255
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,344
It's like the set of an actual music show.

256
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,947
The judges sit in the back.

257
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,282
TWS's rehearsal will begin now.

258
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,685
TWS, please get on the stage.

259
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,587
- Hello.
- Hello.

260
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,456
TWS STAGE
Hello!

261
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:04,557
I'm already a fan!

262
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:06,426
I feel like I'm here as their fan.

263
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:09,462
They look so cool! Go, TWS!

264
00:12:10,363 --> 00:12:11,664
TWS, let's introduce ourselves.

265
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,966
- Twenty-four, seven with us!
- Seven with us!

266
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:13,900
- Hello, we're TWS!
- Hello, we're TWS!

267
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,636
- You can see each person on the screen!
- Each person has their own screen.

268
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,371
- It's like a fan cam.
- That's incredible.

269
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,640
Look at the lights.

270
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,076
And you can see every detail so well.

271
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,079
I didn't know we could see them
on these screens!

272
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,515
INDIVIDUAL SCREENS FOR EACH MEMBER

273
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,950
- We can see each member here.
- Yes.

274
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,287
<i>I've been working with K-pop idols</i>
<i>for a long time,</i>

275
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,823
<i>so I know attending their rehearsal is</i>
<i>an absolute must.</i>

276
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,526
<i>Every broadcasting company has</i>
<i>different lighting,</i>

277
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,194
<i>and the stages are also different.</i>

278
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,263
<i>You must take note of the differences</i>
<i>during the rehearsal</i>

279
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,632
<i>and plan to use</i>

280
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:49,869
<i>the lights, stage, and angles accordingly.</i>

281
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:02,982
The lights are blue.
I bet all lights will be blue-toned.

282
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:12,492
- DOHOON's ears will really stand out.
- Right.

283
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,998
Pay good attention to their hands.

284
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,174
Their faces already look contoured
on the screen.

285
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,976
They won't need much contouring.

286
00:13:37,217 --> 00:13:39,619
Their lips look so red on the screen.

287
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,388
Every color is more noticeable.

288
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:46,393
We'll need to finish the lips
with a pale tone.

289
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,564
We need to tone the blue glow down, too.

290
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:04,577
All done.

291
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,313
Thank you!

292
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,849
How was it? What did you think?

293
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,852
We'll need to focus on the skin tone,
as they'll be sweating.

294
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,022
- They're using blue lighting.
- What?

295
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,557
- The lights are blue-toned.
- Right.

296
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,992
That was incredible.

297
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,493
It's perfect.

298
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,762
<i>Our opponent, Team Golden Hand in Paris.</i>

299
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,631
<i>Of course I couldn't help</i>
<i>but be wary of them.</i>

300
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,233
So, our team met up almost daily.

301
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,936
What do the fans like and dislike?

302
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,838
We could add some glitter here.

303
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:34,674
Add some highlighter here.
That should be good.

304
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,576
The particle sizes are consistent.

305
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,180
<i>We practiced so much.</i>

306
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,316
We got six models,

307
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,252
<i>sat them down in a row, and set the timer</i>

308
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:47,787
<i>to rehearse our makeup.</i>

309
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,056
We even hired hairdressers

310
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,592
<i>to run a simulation of the whole thing,</i>

311
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,628
<i>from doing the makeup to the hair.</i>

312
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,232
It wasn't easy to find male models,

313
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:02,736
so I reached out to Seongsu-dong Prince.

314
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,772
<i>He became our model,</i>
<i>which I really appreciated.</i>

315
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,540
It was intense.

316
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,777
<i>We did everything together</i>
<i>except for sleeping.</i>

317
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:14,514
<i>We basically spent</i>
<i>every moment of the day together.</i>

318
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,417
Nobody practiced more than we did.

319
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,854
Nobody had more meetings than we did.

320
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,390
But Golden Hand in Paris is
based in Paris!

321
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,959
How is she as a team captain?

322
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,529
To be honest, I was very worried

323
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,898
because Golden Hand in Paris

324
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:33,667
was based in Paris.

325
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,970
<i>We only had two and a half days</i>
<i>to practice everything together.</i>

326
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:38,905
We were communicating 24 hours a day
due to the time difference.

327
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:42,342
We had to message each other
day and night.

328
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,612
We couldn't really practice

329
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,547
until the whole team got together.

330
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:51,151
We couldn't even settle on the looks
until we met.

331
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,752
That made me anxious

332
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,354
and second-guess everything.

333
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,956
I was constantly anxious
and doubtful about that.

334
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,461
I felt really bad for my teammates.

335
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,130
I still feel bad.

336
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,432
I get emotional...

337
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,768
whenever I think about that.

338
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,710
TEAM DETAILED HAND'S BACKSTAGE
Today is the day. At last!

339
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,714
- So, no more practices?
- No more after today!

340
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,881
Thank you!

341
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,351
I wanted to run it about three more times.

342
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,387
- Hello.
- Hello!

343
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:29,556
- Hello.
- Hello.

344
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:30,690
- Hello, I'm HANJIN.
- Hello.

345
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:31,825
- Hello.

LESS THAN TWO HOURS UNTIL STANDBY

362
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,200
What's the look for today?

363
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:18,838
I thought so much about this song

364
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,408
and thought it had crystal clear vibes.

365
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:23,076
- Really?
- Yes.

366
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:26,713
So, I came up with another look

367
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,216
to showcase your refreshing energy.

368
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,584
- Really?
- Yes.

369
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:37,257
Our theme is
"Clarity: Identity Formation."

370
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,161
<i>Clarity is about sharpness</i>
<i>and transparency.</i>

371
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,864
I was inspired by the lyrics
of "Lucky to be loved."

372
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,033
ALL MY DREAMS BECOME CLEAR

373
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,436
YOUR WARM BREATH MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M ALIVE

374
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,971
<i>It's about the uncertainty in their hearts</i>
<i>turning to certainty.</i>

375
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,441
I wanted to incorporate that thought
into their makeup.

376
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,809
Another thing was...

377
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:57,711
I could tell that
it was a song for your fans.

378
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,113
It's a message to your fans,
saying, "We'll be your fans, too."

379
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,414
- That's right!
- Yes.

380
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,049
It's our first song for our fans.

381
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:04,250
- Exactly!
- Yes.

382
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,519
Their fans are called 42, which sounds
like the Korean word for "relationship."

383
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,121
So I also wanted to
incorporate 42 into the look.

384
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:10,623
- Hello, we're TWS!
<i>- Our focus was to establish</i>

385
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,193
<i>the strong connection between 42 and TWS.</i>

386
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,295
That was the key to our looks.

387
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,264
<i>Their fandom's signature color is</i>
<i>sparkling blue.</i>

388
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,701
We set sparkling blue as our main color

389
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:25,071
<i>and used the subtle glow</i>
<i>of the sparkling blue</i>

390
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:26,606
<i>as the highlighter shade.</i>

391
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,208
BLUE HIGHLIGHTER

392
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,844
<i>Our focus was to preserve</i>
<i>their natural charms</i>

393
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,347
<i>while showcasing</i>
<i>another form of refreshing energy.</i>

394
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:40,353
- Is this a highlighter?
- Yes, it is.

395
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,389
- Like this.
- That's so cool.

396
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,859
It reflects light in a very subtle way.

397
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,127
- You're right!
- Yes.

398
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,895
- It has a light purple hue.
- That's right.

399
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:52,232
I love how it blends with the blush.
It looks great.

400
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,570
- But it doesn't just end here.
- Okay.

401
00:18:58,071 --> 00:18:59,973
There's something else we do.

402
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,207
I see.

403
00:19:01,775 --> 00:19:03,677
Every time you add something new,

404
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,245
I get that much more curious
about the final look.

405
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,746
We even have
a special effects makeup artist.

406
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,014
Really?

407
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,786
- Give me a moment.
- Okay.

408
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:16,956
What's that?

409
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,631
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS'S BACKSTAGE
I became a fan

410
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:26,933
- Really?
- after seeing your videos so many times.

411
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,283
They did so much research!

412
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,586
I'm already so touched.
They prepared so much!

413
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:47,987
We built a good storyline, right?

414
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:49,756
- Yes, this looks amazing.
- Yes.

415
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:53,393
Our theme is "Blooming Emotions."

416
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:57,063
The look expresses
the fullness one feels from love.

THE STORYLINE BEHIND THE SONG
<i>We mostly focused on analyzing the song</i>

418
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,104
KEYWORDS RELATED TO THE THEME
<i>and showing their emotions through makeup.</i>

419
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:09,175
<i>We tried to show TWS growing in 42's love,</i>

420
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,012
<i>and boys entering adulthood</i>

421
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,682
<i>with the emotions and radiance observed</i>

422
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,317
<i>in that transition.</i>

423
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,653
- I read the storyline in the back.
- Yes.

424
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,288
- Your song interpretation...
- Is it spot-on?

425
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,057
- Yes, it's perfect.
- Really? Thank you.

426
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:27,594
I didn't think you would incorporate
our story of growth as well.

427
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,062
Thank you so much.

428
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:31,264
This was the first time we incorporated
the story of our growth in this album,

429
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:32,966
so the album itself symbolizes growth,

430
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,968
- Yes, I can tell.
- especially this song.

431
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,470
You usually don't wear much makeup
for most of your performances.

432
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:38,972
No, we don't.

433
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,974
- Our main keyword is "refreshing,"
- Right.

434
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,309
and we usually try to look
more like teen students.

435
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,644
That's why we don't wear much makeup.

436
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,713
<i>We're preparing looks</i>

437
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,082
<i>that don't cover up</i>
<i>much of their natural faces.</i>

438
00:20:49,315 --> 00:20:52,052
<i>We tried to stay close</i>
<i>to their usual makeup styles</i>

439
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,821
<i>by only adding basic contouring.</i>

440
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:58,224
For the outfits, "romance" was the focus.

441
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,528
<i>We added some frills and a corsage</i>

442
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,165
<i>to give off a more mature version</i>
<i>of their refreshing energy.</i>

<i>We had Never Dead Queen,</i>
<i>who could do special effects makeup.</i>

00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,453
We wanted to showcase her specialty

<i>To add elements</i>
<i>that would showcase her skills,</i>

448
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:34,227
<i>we added TWS's logo</i>
<i>and their fandom name, 42, on their faces.</i>

449

453
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:49,976
I never thought I'd get to watch anyone
use an airbrush in person.

454
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,014
That's so cool!

455
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,416
Are you brightening his skin?

456
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:58,918
The paint is white.

457
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:03,123
It gives off a fresh look.

458
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:05,058
- No way.
- That's fascinating!

459
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:09,829
<i>Even with the glitter,</i>
<i>the key was to make them sparkle</i>

460
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:13,533
<i>even more clearly on stage.</i>

461
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,135
- I'll take them off now.
- Okay.

462
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,574
Isn't it pretty?

463
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:23,309
It looks amazing.

- Okay.

466
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,351
Thank you.

467
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:33,720
It's so pretty.

468
00:22:33,887 --> 00:22:36,022
It complements your long, beautiful neck.

469
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,123
Hello.

470
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:40,460
- Show off your neck for the final pose.
- Like this.

471
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:43,029
Yes, we put paint on that side on purpose.

472
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,130
- Really?
- Yes.

473
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,566
Because our highlight moves go
to the right!

474
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,968
- You're right. We go this way.
- Like that.

475
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,538
- All our moves go to the right.
- They put so much thought into this!

476
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,507
<i>- I know. They did so much research.</i>
<i>- I'm so touched!</i>

477
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,943
- This is so touching!
- My goodness.

478
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:01,781
<i>We watched the choreography video</i>
<i>more than 100 times.</i>

479
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:04,784
There are moments when the members get
solo shots on camera.

480
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:07,053
For example, HANJIN has a part
in the middle of the song,

481
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,989
<i>where he stands alone for his solo shot.</i>

482
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,426
<i>So, we put "42"</i>
<i>on the right side of his neck.</i>

483
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:18,465
<i>As for KYUNGMIN, he's very cute</i>
<i>as the youngest member.</i>

484
00:23:18,965 --> 00:23:22,936
<i>His feature was the logo I'd printed.</i>

485
00:23:24,104 --> 00:23:25,572
So, that's how it's done!

486
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:27,874
Should we work on the hands?

487
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,542
Yes, I'll get started.

488
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,545
<i>Their choreography involves</i>
<i>a lot of hand movements.</i>

489
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:34,681
<i>Their hands move a lot</i>
<i>in "Lucky to be loved,"</i>

490
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:38,251
<i>so we used their signature color,</i>
<i>sparkling blue,</i>

491
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,787
<i>to paint the backs of their hands.</i>

492
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:47,594
- Like this?
- Yes!

493
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,695
That's it.

494
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,197
<i>I also worked on DOHOON's ears.</i>

495
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:53,199
Have you ever had makeup on your ears?

496
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,702
I've only applied
brightening cream on them.

497
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,203
It's my first time
getting makeup on my ears.

498
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,508
<i>I wanted to add a feature</i>
<i>to DOHOON's ears.</i>

499
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:04,511
You can see DOHOON's one ear at the start.

500
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:09,082
<i>I wanted to add</i>
<i>a clear but glittery element</i>

501
00:24:09,149 --> 00:24:11,351
<i>for that moment.</i>

502
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,653
Our fans will love this.

503
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,888
It looks stunning!

504
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:15,955
- Really?
- Yes.

505
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,824
I'd better take lots of photos today.

506
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:22,262
- I'm nervous!
- Who's next?

507
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,831
- I'll start working here.
- It's like an in-ear monitor.

508
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:26,032
Right.

00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:41,014
They're transitioning
from young boys to adults.

514
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:42,982
Just imagine how much they shine
at that age.

515
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,819
<i>I wanted to really showcase</i>
<i>that youthful glow,</i>

516
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:49,189
<i>so I purchased Swarovski gemstones</i>
<i>for the look.</i>

517
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,691
- This is your choreography,
- Yes.

518
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,493
so we wanted to accentuate your hands.

519
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,196
We thought it'd be nice
to make your hands sparkle, too.

520
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:59,132
We watched their choreography video
countless times.

521
00:24:59,199 --> 00:25:02,535
<i>We had to add a featured element</i>
<i>that would unify all six members</i>

522
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:05,372
<i>when we noticed them pointing fingers</i>
<i>in the choreography.</i>

523
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:06,873
<i>So, we added that element to their hands.</i>

524
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,478
<i>They'll sparkle like crazy on stage.</i>

525
00:25:11,544 --> 00:25:13,780
<i>We'll make TWS shine from every angle.</i>

526
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,149
Let's see it one more time.

527
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,587
Perfect. Thank you.

528
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:22,422
- We'll add a heart on this side.
- Really?

529
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:26,159
We designed and prepared
these temporary tattoos with the TWS logo.

530
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,861
For this move!

531
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,529
- Yes, that's it!
- Right.

532
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,331
Your hand goes up at the end,

533
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:33,833
and I wanted to add something
to bring attention to your hand.

534
00:25:37,003 --> 00:25:38,538
It's so beautiful.

535
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,509
I think it'll look great on the stage.

536
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,677
I bet.

537
00:25:44,177 --> 00:25:46,346
There's no way
people will miss this on stage.

538
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,882
- It'll really stand out.
- Yes.

539
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,583
<i>We analyzed each member</i>

540
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,285
<i>and set the gemstones differently</i>
<i>for each member.</i>

541
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:56,222
<i>For KYUNGMIN and DOHOON,</i>

542
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:58,892
<i>the gems will be decorating their ears,</i>

543
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,528
<i>while SHINYU will have sparkles</i>
<i>trickling down his face.</i>

544
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:06,132
<i>For YOUNGJAE, we wanted to create</i>
<i>a serene, beautiful look.</i>

545
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:10,103
<i>We chose different designs and colors</i>

546
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,371
<i>to suit each member.</i>

547
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:15,141
<i>Then, we placed different-sized gemstones</i>
<i>in a harmonious way.</i>

548
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:17,177
Could you show the hand gesture again?
Sorry.

549
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:18,978
This is so...

550
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,647
Let me place it a bit higher.

551
00:26:20,714 --> 00:26:22,115
Your hand goes this way,

552
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,117
- so I'll add some more along this line.
- Okay.

553
00:26:24,184 --> 00:26:25,852
- Right? Is that better?
- Yes.

554
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:28,788
That's so pretty.

555
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,392
We could prepare our hands like this
instead of getting our nails done.

556
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:33,693
I know! For the stage.

557
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,295
- It'd be perfect.
- Not just for the stage. Just every day.

558
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:36,730
Let me try it.

559
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:37,931
This is nice.

560
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,132
It's perfect!

561
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,103
Hey, look at it! It's absolutely perfect.

562
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:48,508
JUDGES' MIDWAY EVALUATIONS
FOR TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

563
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,643
- Hello.
- Hello.

564
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:53,613
I see, on the ears.

565
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:57,717
This is bad.

566
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,921
<i>What I wanted to check on was</i>

567
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,723
<i>how the team made each member shine</i>

568
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,825
<i>with so many in the team.</i>

569
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,561
- Hello.
- Hello.

570
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,897
<i>And how will they balance the elements</i>

571
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,333
<i>to make everyone look like a team?</i>

572
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,603
<i>That's one of the main things to focus on</i>
<i>for K-pop stage makeup.</i>

573
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,306
- All the other members have
- Yes?

574
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:23,143
some sort of sparkle on their faces.

575
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,011
Will he just have some highlighter on?

576
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:28,281
Yes, we're using subtle sparkles
and highlighter for him

577
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,883
for a more subdued look.

578
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,118
We figured it'd be too much

579
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:35,021
if we added anything more
to his facial features.

580
00:27:35,088 --> 00:27:36,423
So, we just decided to give him
a subtle glow.

581
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:38,258
You wanted to give him a more mature look?

582
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,726
Yes, a more mature look.

583
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:48,234
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS'S BACKSTAGE

584
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,904
Some have colors, and others don't.

585
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:53,873
We're going to add pops of color

586
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,509
after we look at everyone together.

587
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:58,044
- As a finishing touch?
- Yes.

588
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,346
They're not ready yet, then.

589
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:01,047
- No, we're still working.
- You haven't added the colors.

590
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:02,582
No, we haven't.

591
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:05,719
You have 15 minutes until standby!

592
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,587
Let me take a look at your neck.

593
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,490
Please check their body makeup, too.

594
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:18,131
You have ten minutes!

595
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,001
- It's almost time!
- We're almost done!

596
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,303
Are you done with SHINYU? All of it?

597
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,544
You have five minutes until standby!

598
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:35,081
Could you please roll
the other sleeve up, too?

599
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:39,019
We'll begin recording now.

600
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,088
Just one more minute to go!

601
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:44,024
We have one minute left.

602
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,225
Here.

603
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,293
We should stop fixing it now.

604
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:49,262
- TWS, please head to the stage.
- Okay.

605
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,430
We'll see you later.

606
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:51,631
I like it.

607
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:54,968
TWS'S STAGE MAKEUP IS READY

608
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:04,344
Changing the world with makeup.

609
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,279
Welcome, everyone,

610
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:09,082
to the top-class makeup survival show,
JUST MAKEUP.

611
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,517
Hello, I'm Lee Hyo-ri.

612
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,901
JUST MAKEUP is a show

613
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:30,437
where nationally and internationally
renowned makeup artists

614
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:33,840
and leaders of K-beauty
engage in friendly competition.

615
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,311
It's the world's first large-scale
makeup survival show.

616
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:42,549
Today, we have your two favorite groups,
TWS and STAYC,

617
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:46,853
who will be featuring
in the "K-pop Stage" team mission.

618
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,223
And as this round is called "K-pop Stage,"

619
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,759
we've invited special judges.

620
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:54,427
The special judges

621
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:56,096
are you, the fans!

622
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,836
<i>Today's result will be based</i>
<i>on the four judges' votes</i>

623
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:06,973
<i>and the 1 total vote of</i>
<i>the 100 special judges, the fans.</i>

624
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,110
In other words, a team must receive

625
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,745
at least 3 out of 5 votes to win.

626
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:14,314
Everyone on the winning team will survive,

627
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:18,685
while everyone on the losing team
will be eliminated.

628
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,622
The fans can only vote for one group,
TWS or STAYC,

629
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:25,325
depending on which group
they are a fan of.

630
00:30:25,392 --> 00:30:26,459
Let's hear from the SWITHs!

631
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:29,662
STAYC'S FANDOM

632
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:33,033
I definitely hear more men
from SWITH's side.

633
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:37,637
It reminds me of
the cheers I heard in my Fin.K.L days,

634
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:39,472
so I feel right at home.

635
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:41,174
All right, 42!

636
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:43,977
TWS'S FANDOM
42

637
00:30:44,044 --> 00:30:46,379
Your cheers are higher-pitched,
as you're mostly ladies.

638
00:30:46,546 --> 00:30:49,749
I look forward to your fair evaluations.

639
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:53,620
She's checking for
last-minute adjustments.

640
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:56,823
Almost done.

641
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,058
- What are you doing?
- Thank you.

642
00:30:58,124 --> 00:30:59,559
We'll do our best on stage.

643
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,996
It looks good now. It's too...

644
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:06,599
- Let's get ready to go.
- Please get ready.

645
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:07,634
- Good luck!
- You look great.

646
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,536
- See you later.
- You've got this!

647
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:13,973
Let's begin, then.

648
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,977
The first performance is by TWS,
prepared by Team Detailed Hands.

649
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,246
TWS, please enter the stage.

650
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,696
The fans are so passionate!

651
00:31:37,597 --> 00:31:39,099
- Hello.
- Hello!

652
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:41,234
This is Team Detailed Hands' version

653
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:43,336
of "Lucky to be loved" by TWS.

654
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:15,802
- That was smart of him, showing his hand.
- Indeed.

655
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,707
Look at SHINYU's neck!

656
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,709
- It's so pretty!
- Stunning.

657
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,479
CLARITY: IDENTITY FORMATION
BY TEAM DETAILED HANDS

658
00:32:26,546 --> 00:32:29,249
THEME SHOWCASING TWS'S TRANSITION
FROM BOYHOOD TO ADULTHOOD

659
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:32,652
WHILE KEEPING ITS YOUTHFUL ENERGY,
FEATURING THEIR SIGNATURE SPARKLING BLUE

660
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:36,923
EMPHASIZING THAT THE SONG IS FOR THE FANS

661
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:41,294
BY MARKING THE FANDOM NAME, "42,"
EVERYWHERE

662
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:45,865
OUTFITS WITH MINIMAL COLORS AND PATTERNS,
EACH WITH A STRAP

663
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:49,402
TO MAKE EVERY MOVE LOOK
LIKE A MUSICAL NOTE

664
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:53,306
I see the fans
covering their mouths in shock

665
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:55,175
and their jaws dropping.

666
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,077
I guess they've never seen
TWS like this before.

667
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,748
They all look stunning!

668
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:04,984
They look incredible.

669
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:09,489
TWS, please begin your performance.

670
00:33:19,532 --> 00:33:25,538
TEAM DETAILED HANDS' VERSION

671
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:36,950
- The blue has such a pretty, subtle glow.
- You're so right.

672
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,119
- Everyone shines in their own ways.
- Right.

673
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:54,634
- YOUNGJAE has highlighted cheekbones.
- They used highlighter.

674
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:08,348
JIHOON has something on his hand.

675
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:10,684
They got temporary tattoos on their hands.

676
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,063
I'm in awe. They look so good.

677
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:43,883
It suits them.

678
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,760
DOHOON has something on his ears.

679
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,829
- Yes, but it's hard to see what it is.
- They put something on his ears.

680
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:30,363
They're doing their best to show
what we painted on their hands.

681
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,998
They're showing their hands
more than usual.

682
00:35:43,543 --> 00:35:46,680
Watch the end, where SHINYU turns

683
00:35:46,746 --> 00:35:47,914
and shows his neckline.

684
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:49,349
- Here?
- Yes.

685
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:13,840
That was wonderful!

686
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,243
- The blush and the features are pretty.
- They added an overall blue glow.

687
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,212
- It's all blue.
- Yes, it must've been intentional.

688
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:21,614
- They look adorable.
- For sure.

689
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:25,418
The team that created TWS's first look,
Team Detailed Hands,

690
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:27,087
please come up on the stage.

691
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:32,025
Please give them a big round of applause.

692
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:49,542
I'm Detailed Hands,
the captain of Team Detailed Hands

693
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:51,077
that created TWS's first stage look.

694
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:52,846
Thank you. Hello.

695
00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:54,047
Thank you!

696
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:58,318
Through makeup,

697
00:36:58,385 --> 00:37:01,554
we wanted to showcase
TWS's refreshing vibes,

698
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:05,058
but in a way that's different
from what is usually portrayed.

699
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:08,995
We placed clear but sparkly decorations

700
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:13,500
on places like their deer-like long necks
and beautiful ears

701
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:16,069
for a unique look.

702
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:20,006
Additionally, we know
sparkling blue is their signature color.

703
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:24,844
So, we used that color to make a reference

704
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:29,582
to TWS's long journey of growth
with their fans, 42.

705
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:32,485
I just received a perfume sample sheet.

706
00:37:32,552 --> 00:37:33,553
What's this?

707
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:36,022
We wanted to point out

708
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:38,825
that visual beauty isn't everything.

709
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:43,296
We wanted to show you that beauty
wasn't just about what you can see.

710
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:45,732
We prepared this perfume

711
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:48,601
in hopes that TWS's youthful performance

712
00:37:48,668 --> 00:37:50,670
and the perfume will be remembered

713
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:52,706
for a very long time.

714
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,444
You know how they spray perfume
at concerts?

715
00:37:57,544 --> 00:37:59,312
- Really?
- Yes,

716
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:02,982
TAEYEON mixed her favorite scents
for her concert

717
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:06,386
and sprayed the mix at the concert venue
to spread that scent to the audience.

718
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:07,620
- No way!
- Yes.

719
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:09,456
Let's now hear

720
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:11,591
- from the judges.
- I'm so nervous!

721
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:13,126
It was

722
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,295
absolutely amazing in my eyes.

723
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,263
I loved it

724
00:38:17,897 --> 00:38:21,634
because I didn't think you could express
youthful energy in that way.

725
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:25,372
And I could tell
from the TWS members' faces

726
00:38:25,438 --> 00:38:26,940
that they were very happy
with their makeup.

727
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:30,377
That's everything for a makeup artist.

728
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:32,779
The level of satisfaction we give

729
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:35,215
to our performing artists
plays a huge part

730
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:37,317
in how well they perform on stage.

731
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:40,053
I could tell that the members were happy

732
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,555
the whole time they were performing.

733
00:38:42,622 --> 00:38:45,992
And that made me further enjoy
their performance. I loved it.

734
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,193
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

735
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,096
That was Saem-mool's feedback.

736
00:38:50,163 --> 00:38:51,731
Captain Detailed Hands,

737
00:38:51,798 --> 00:38:53,566
you have one last chance

738
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:56,102
to say something to the fans
to win their votes.

739
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:59,673
In the past two weeks,

740
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:02,776
all we thought about was 42 and TWS.

741
00:39:02,842 --> 00:39:04,844
- That's true.
- I mean it.

742
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:07,647
- Seriously.
- We love you!

743
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:10,684
Our only focus was
on how we could satisfy the fans

744
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:12,585
and boost the artists' confidence

745
00:39:12,652 --> 00:39:15,622
so they could shine more on stage.

746
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:19,292
That was all we thought about.

747
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,161
I know you've traveled far to be here,

748
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:25,799
so I hope this performance will linger
in your hearts for a long time,

749
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,634
just as the perfume's
lingering scent will.

750
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:29,502
- Thank you.
- All right.

751
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:34,040
TWS's fans, 42, please remember
the impression

752
00:39:34,107 --> 00:39:36,509
Team Detailed Hands' makeup
and stage left on you.

753
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:41,047
- They did well.
- They had some nice touches to the look.

754
00:39:41,114 --> 00:39:42,282
Yes, but our makeup looks better.

755
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:44,584
- I like ours better.
- Yes.

756
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:47,320
- It was so cute.
- I think it emphasizes the details more.

757
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,356
What did you think of the performance?

758
00:39:49,522 --> 00:39:50,857
The other teams need to step up.

759
00:39:51,424 --> 00:39:53,593
Team Detailed Hands did so well.

760
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,829
I know! Tell me about it.

761
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:04,004
Time for standby!

762
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,208
<i>My teammates were like soldiers</i>
<i>going to a battlefield.</i>

763
00:40:08,375 --> 00:40:11,044
<i>They didn't forget a single thing.</i>

764
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:12,645
<i>I was so thankful</i>

765
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:15,248
<i>when they followed through</i>
<i>on all my requests.</i>

766
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,152
I'm really curious what they'll do.

767
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:20,687
Should we put away our lightsticks now?

768
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:21,988
- Yes!
- Mine is already off.

769
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:23,390
Put it away, everyone.

770
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:25,158
- Fold it.
- Put it away.

771
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:28,061
The next performance is
TWS's second performance,

772
00:40:28,128 --> 00:40:30,130
prepared by Team Golden Hand in Paris.

773
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:32,332
Please welcome TWS onto the stage.

774
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:48,481
The fans seem to love it.

775
00:40:50,684 --> 00:40:52,619
This is "Lucky to be loved" by TWS,

776
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:54,854
Team Golden Hand in Paris's version.

777
00:41:03,096 --> 00:41:04,564
That's a new look.

778
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,177
That's the power of makeup.

779
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,082
BLOOMING EMOTIONS
BY TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

780
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:27,520
LOOK THAT REFLECTS THE TURBULENT EMOTIONS
BOYS EXPERIENCE AS THEY ENTER ADULTHOOD

781
00:41:27,587 --> 00:41:30,323
SWAROVSKI GEMSTONES WERE USED

782
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:36,162
TO REPRESENT THE RADIANCE OF YOUTH
AS THEY BLOOM TO ADULTHOOD

783
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:40,367
THE OUTFITS ARE KEPT MINIMAL
WITH ONLY FRILL AND FLOWER FEATURES

784
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:43,036
TO LEAVE A ROMANTIC AND STRONG IMPRESSION

785
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:46,473
His ear looks so pretty!

786
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:47,941
They look stunning on camera.

787
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:50,610
- When they're just standing, the ears...
- You can see them really well.

788
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,545
- That was a really nice touch.
- It was a great idea.

789
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:54,748
- That was worth the money.
- I know!

790
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:57,350
What? Why did they put gems on their ears?

791
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:00,086
On their ears? That's just too much.

792
00:42:01,287 --> 00:42:04,357
I see some colors.

793
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:05,859
But it's a relief it's not too much.

794
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:08,928
TWS, please begin your performance.

795
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:12,499
They haven't seen their hands yet.

796
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:14,868
We haven't even shown the main highlights.

797
00:42:14,934 --> 00:42:17,270
Will those details get caught on camera
when they're dancing so fast?

798
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,545
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS VERSION

799
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:39,693
Look at their hands!

800
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:58,345
I see laser beams coming from their hands!

801
00:42:58,978 --> 00:42:59,946
That member's hand is...

802
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:03,149
- Their hands are sparkling like crazy.
- They are.

803
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:19,065
Their fingers look stunning.

804
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:21,534
It's dazzling!

805
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:35,382
- My gosh.
- We worked on both hands for this moment.

806
00:43:43,923 --> 00:43:45,425
That needs to be on camera.

807
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:49,029
They did their research, too.
The hands are decorated for those moves.

808
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:57,804
They look so pretty!

809
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:03,103
- That was crazy.
- My goodness.

810
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:04,671
It was unbelievable.

811
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:07,140
I couldn't feel their refreshing energy
from what they did.

812
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,742
- Me neither.
- No.

813
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:10,410
I need to really think about this.

814
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:12,912
I know! It's so hard to choose.

815
00:45:13,313 --> 00:45:15,115
Everyone is so good, aren't they?

816
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:17,550
This is driving me nuts.

817
00:45:18,118 --> 00:45:22,255
We've now seen both of TWS's looks.

818
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:24,090
- Hello!
- Hello, we're

819
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:25,925
Team Golden Hand in Paris.

820
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,097
We wanted to stay loyal

821
00:45:31,164 --> 00:45:35,001
to portraying the feeling of love
in our look.

822
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:38,438
<i>The song starts off seriously,</i>
<i>then they start smiling so brightly</i>

823
00:45:38,672 --> 00:45:41,341
<i>before getting serious again.</i>
<i>It seemed very emotional.</i>

824
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:44,377
We wanted to portray that
in line with the song and the lyrics

825
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:46,212
in the clearest way possible.

826
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:50,216
We wanted to showcase all the emotions
in the transition to adulthood,

827
00:45:50,283 --> 00:45:53,453
the blossoming youth, and its brilliance.

828
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:56,756
We wanted to add some sparkly elements

829
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:58,425
to present those to you.

830
00:45:58,491 --> 00:45:59,926
Thank you.

831
00:45:59,993 --> 00:46:03,396
I'd love to hear what the judges think.

832
00:46:03,463 --> 00:46:06,166
Jin-soo, what did you think about that?

833
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:11,671
You've done a great job
in preparing the boyish looks

834
00:46:11,738 --> 00:46:15,742
to reflect the personality and image
of each member.

835
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:19,546
When I observed your team backstage,

836
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:21,748
<i>I noticed you adding the Swarovski gems</i>

837
00:46:21,815 --> 00:46:24,517
<i>while checking their hand choreography.</i>

838
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:27,053
When they got on stage,

839
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,890
<i>the gems really did their part</i>
<i>and left a strong impression.</i>

840
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:32,225
Thank you.

841
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:36,696
Lastly, is there anything
you would like to say to their fans?

842
00:46:36,763 --> 00:46:39,833
I want everyone's youthful years
to flow like water,

843
00:46:39,899 --> 00:46:42,469
with ease and much radiance.

844
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,605
That's the sentiment
that was incorporated in this look.

845
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,207
Thank you.

846
00:46:47,273 --> 00:46:50,310
Please remember
Team Golden Hand in Paris's makeup

847
00:46:50,377 --> 00:46:53,613
deep in your hearts, 42.

848
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,415
- It's beautiful.
- Right?

849
00:46:55,782 --> 00:46:57,617
It's like stage special effects.

850
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:59,719
They looked like lost youths.

851
00:47:03,556 --> 00:47:06,092
The sparkles are going crazy
as they're waving.

852
00:47:06,693 --> 00:47:08,661
- Thank you, everyone!
- They're sparkling.

853
00:47:11,297 --> 00:47:14,501
- When they moved quickly, the makeup...
- I know!

854
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:17,170
- The sparkles left an afterglow.
- Indeed.

855
00:47:17,237 --> 00:47:19,372
- Each time they moved...
- All around, too!

856
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:21,641
The sparkles made their faces glow
with the afterglow.

857
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:23,076
- The way the lights spread!
- I know!

858
00:47:23,143 --> 00:47:25,111
That was what we were going for.

859
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:26,179
The afterglow looked stunning.

860
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:27,647
We did great.

861
00:47:27,814 --> 00:47:30,216
But I thought

862
00:47:30,283 --> 00:47:32,986
our makeup looked better.

863
00:47:33,153 --> 00:47:35,088
- Our makeup was more discreet.
- Yes.

864
00:47:35,488 --> 00:47:39,392
That concludes the performances
prepared by the two teams,

865
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:42,262
Team Detailed Hands
and Team Golden Hand in Paris.

866
00:47:42,328 --> 00:47:45,865
We got to really dive into TWS's charms.

867
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:48,668
I hope you haven't forgotten
that you're all judges, too.

868
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:52,539
I saw some of you forget
and have too much fun earlier.

869
00:47:52,605 --> 00:47:56,409
But don't forget to vote for a team
on your way out.

870
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:01,047
I wonder how the fans will vote for them.

871
00:48:01,114 --> 00:48:01,981
Same.

872
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:04,617
What did the fans like more?

873
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:08,321
TEAM DETAILED HANDS

874
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:09,589

TEAM DETAILED HANDS VERSION
<i>TWS's first performance felt</i>

876
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:15,362
<i>like that of youthful boys playing</i>
<i>at the beach in summer,</i>

877
00:48:15,428 --> 00:48:17,797
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS'S VERSION
<i>while the second performance felt</i>

878
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:19,899
<i>like that of mature boys</i>
<i>who were entering adulthood.</i>

879
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:21,901
100 TWS FANS WILL VOTE
<i>Please vote for the team</i>

880
00:48:21,968 --> 00:48:23,970
BETWEEN TEAM DETAILED HANDS
<i>you think did a better job at making looks</i>

881
00:48:24,037 --> 00:48:26,039
AND TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS
<i>that suit the song.</i>

888
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:51,031
THE FANS HAVE VOTED FOR TWS'S STAGE

889
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:54,734
It's time to determine the winners.

890
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:56,202
TWS,

891
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:58,304
you performed your song
with two different looks.

892
00:48:58,371 --> 00:49:00,040
How did you feel about them?

893
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:03,476
The makeup artists listened to our song
countless times,

894
00:49:03,543 --> 00:49:06,746
analyzed it,
discussed the meaning behind it,

895
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:09,382
and put so much effort
into preparing these looks.

896
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,851
We were so grateful and honored to be
on the receiving end of that.

897
00:49:11,918 --> 00:49:17,490
Seeing teams of people
work so hard to make us shine

898
00:49:17,557 --> 00:49:19,859
inspired us to give our all in what we do.

899
00:49:19,926 --> 00:49:22,162
Thank you so much for that.

900
00:49:22,228 --> 00:49:26,733
When else would I get my makeup done
by these eight makeup masters?

901
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,470
They helped us create

902
00:49:30,537 --> 00:49:32,772
such a glorious evening of youth today.

903
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:35,775
Thank you so much.

904
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:40,180
Thank you.

905
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:45,685
I will now announce the final result

906
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:48,455
for Team Detailed Hands
and Team Golden Hand in Paris.

907
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:50,223
Are you nervous?

908
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,825
- Yes.
- Yes.

909
00:49:52,425 --> 00:49:56,329
First, let's hear the reviews
for Team Detailed Hands.

910
00:49:56,763 --> 00:49:58,431
Jin-soo?

911
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:02,302
It was very memorable for me.

912
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:04,804
You stuck to their theme of youthfulness

913
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:07,007
and their boyish image

914
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:09,943
<i>while respecting their individuality.</i>

915
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:14,647
Something I wish could've been better was

916
00:50:15,815 --> 00:50:18,351
the airbrushed stickers.

917
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:20,520
<i>You added a very nice special touch</i>
<i>with those,</i>

918
00:50:20,954 --> 00:50:23,223
<i>but on stage,</i>

919
00:50:23,757 --> 00:50:27,360
they were a bit distracting.

920
00:50:27,727 --> 00:50:30,630
Other than that, your makeup was memorable

921
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:33,433
with an excellent storyline.

922
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:36,536
You did very well with the makeup.

923
00:50:36,603 --> 00:50:38,471
Okay, thank you.

924
00:50:38,538 --> 00:50:41,107
Next, RISABAE, please tell us

925
00:50:41,174 --> 00:50:44,477
what the judges thought
of Team Golden Hand in Paris's makeup.

926
00:50:44,744 --> 00:50:47,981
When I first watched the rehearsal,

927
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:51,284
<i>I was surprised by the fast choreography.</i>

928
00:50:51,351 --> 00:50:55,755
And your ideas to work
with such fast choreography were

929
00:50:55,822 --> 00:50:58,091
absolutely brilliant.

930
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:01,194
<i>Every time their hands moved,</i>
<i>it was as if there was a stage effect.</i>

931
00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:03,063
<i>They looked like lost youths</i>

932
00:51:03,129 --> 00:51:05,598
<i>and all the other things</i>
<i>you wanted to show.</i>

933
00:51:05,665 --> 00:51:07,634
<i>That reminded me</i>

934
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:10,704
of the power of body makeup once again.

935
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:13,606
One thing I wish could've been better was

936
00:51:14,908 --> 00:51:18,511
the last touches on the colors.

937
00:51:18,578 --> 00:51:22,315
You added more colors at the last minute,
which made each person stand out,

938
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:25,051
but it took away
from the lost youth image I'd imagined.

939
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:27,354
Instead, it made them look a bit cuter.

940
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:30,790
That was one thing
I personally thought could've been better.

941
00:51:30,857 --> 00:51:32,726
But we enjoyed what you came up with.

942
00:51:32,992 --> 00:51:36,996
Have the four judges made up their minds?

943
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,300
RISABAE, you seem to be in a pickle.

944
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,434
Have you decided?

945
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:43,937
Yes.

946
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,741
Okay, judges.

947
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:50,977
Please cast your votes.

948
00:51:51,044 --> 00:51:53,213
TEAM DETAILED HANDS VS. TEAM GOLDEN HAND
THE JUDGES' VOTING BEGINS

949
00:51:53,313 --> 00:51:56,116
This is so hard.

950
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,419
<i>Team Detailed Hands' makeup delivered</i>

951
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:01,988
<i>a very youthful, cheerful energy,</i>

952
00:52:02,055 --> 00:52:04,391
<i>while Team Golden Hand in Paris showcased</i>

953
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:06,993
<i>a more mature and stronger side of TWS.</i>

954
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,628
<i>That made it so hard to decide.</i>

955
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:10,864
<i>Which team was I to choose?</i>

956
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:22,308
The judges have finished voting.

957
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:23,443
TEAM DETAILED HANDS

958
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,578
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

959
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:27,747
I'm so nervous!

960
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:30,116
- Let's hold hands.
- She wants us to hold hands.

961
00:52:32,952 --> 00:52:35,889
Today's result will be based
on four votes from the judges

962
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:38,825
and the votes
from the 100 special fan judges,

963
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:40,160
<i>which will count as one.</i>

964
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:44,764
Basically, the team
that takes 3 out of 5 votes will win.

965
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:47,934
RESULT ANNOUNCEMENT FOR FAN VOTES
Let's look at the fans' votes first.

966
00:52:51,104 --> 00:52:54,841
It was a very close call
with 58 to 42 votes.

967
00:52:54,908 --> 00:52:59,546
It was a very close call
with 58 to 42 votes.

968
00:53:00,046 --> 00:53:02,515
- ...with 58 to 42 votes.
- That was so close!

969
00:53:02,816 --> 00:53:06,920
Which team earned 58 votes?

970
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:10,590
<i>The fans, 42, who love TWS dearly,</i>

971
00:53:10,657 --> 00:53:12,826
<i>loved what we came up with</i>
<i>when they first saw it.</i>

972
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:18,131
<i>Team Detailed Hands was</i>
<i>so considerate of the fans,</i>

973
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:20,767
<i>so it made me scared about the results.</i>

974
00:53:22,302 --> 00:53:24,404
Please reveal the results.

975
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:28,808
I can't wait to see who wins.

976
00:53:29,976 --> 00:53:30,844
TEAM DETAILED HANDS

977
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:33,713
Congratulations to Team Detailed Hands

978
00:53:33,847 --> 00:53:37,484
for winning over the fans' hearts.

979
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,186
It was a very close race,

980
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,756
CURRENT SCORE 1 : 0
but Team Detailed Hands earned 42's vote.

981
00:53:42,822 --> 00:53:46,793
<i>I thought</i>
<i>the fans' vote mattered the most.</i>

982
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,430
<i>The fans decided we'd won,</i>
<i>which meant we must've won overall.</i>

983
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,665
There were so many elements
that must've touched the fans' hearts.

984
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,901
It was a close call, anyway.

985
00:53:55,635 --> 00:53:57,070
Team Detailed Hands earned 42's vote.

986
00:53:57,604 --> 00:54:01,808
Let's now reveal the judges' votes.

987
00:54:02,008 --> 00:54:06,312
First, RISABAE, please reveal your vote.

988
00:54:12,485 --> 00:54:13,920
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

989
00:54:14,254 --> 00:54:16,990
RISABAE voted

990
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:19,592
for Team Golden Hand in Paris.

991
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,095
It's 1 to 1 now.

992
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,764
Next, Jin-soo.

993
00:54:24,831 --> 00:54:26,666
Please reveal your vote.

994
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,837
<i>It was a tie,</i>
<i>so I couldn't bear to look at his screen.</i>

995
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:32,472
Look how sweaty my hand is.

996
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,541
Oh no.

997
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:38,244
Please reveal your vote.

998
00:54:39,012 --> 00:54:39,913
TEAM GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

999
00:54:39,979 --> 00:54:42,982
Jin-soo also chose

1000
00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:45,385
- Team Golden Hand in Paris.
- What do we do?

1001
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:49,289
CURRENT SCORE 1 : 2
If one of the two remaining judges voted

1002
00:54:49,356 --> 00:54:50,557
for Team Golden Hand in Paris,

1003
00:54:50,757 --> 00:54:53,460
Team Golden Hand in Paris will be
the final winner of the match.

1004
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:55,662
I'm so nervous.

1005
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:58,498
What a nerve-wracking moment.

1006
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:03,737
Saem-mool, please reveal your vote.

1007
00:55:05,572 --> 00:55:06,573
Ms. Jung!

1008
00:55:07,774 --> 00:55:08,975
<i>What do I do?</i>

1009
00:55:09,242 --> 00:55:11,111
<i>We're really desperate!</i>

1010
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:17,283
TEAM DETAILED HANDS

1011
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:20,186
Saem-mool voted

1012
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:22,822
for Team Detailed Hands.

1013
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:24,624
It was a very close race
in the fans' votes,

1014
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:26,693
and I guess the same goes
for the judges' votes.

1015
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,296
It's currently 2 to 2
without a clear winner.

1016
00:55:30,764 --> 00:55:32,365
It was a very close race
in the fans' votes...

1017
00:55:32,432 --> 00:55:33,833
What do I do?

1018
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,568
What are we supposed to do?

1019
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:39,139
CURRENT SCORE 2 : 2
Lastly, which team did Seo Ok,

1020
00:55:39,205 --> 00:55:41,775
the judge with the final vote,

1021
00:55:41,841 --> 00:55:43,576
vote for?

1022
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:45,879
<i>I loved both teams' work.</i>

1023
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,347
<i>I witnessed their process,</i>

1024
00:55:47,414 --> 00:55:49,082
<i>and I know what effort it takes</i>
<i>to achieve those looks</i>

1025
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:51,017
<i>as someone who works in the field.</i>

1026
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:52,886
<i>I really felt for them,</i>

1027
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:55,689
<i>so whenever I tried to vote for one team,</i>

1028
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:57,490
<i>the other team held me back in my mind.</i>
