00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,194
First, let me introduce the top three.

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,280
Here's the first contestant
of the top three.

7
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,660
<i>This contestant quietly but powerfully</i>
<i>made it to the finals.</i>

8
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:38,705
<i>From the timeless,</i>
<i>classic makeup look of Round One...</i>

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,332
She's so good.

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,460
<i>- She's incredible.</i>
<i>- She's very talented.</i>

11
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,296
<i>To the powerful mermaid makeup look.</i>

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,132
She's a well-trained artist.

13
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,468
<i>She possesses</i>
<i>exceptional fundamental skills.</i>

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>As a brand artist,</i>
<i>she overcomes limitations</i>

00:00:55,389 --> 00:01:00,269

17
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:05,482
She is Oh Dolce Vita.

18
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,405
Here's the second contestant
of the top three.

19
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,908
<i>This contestant dramatically survived</i>
<i>in the redemption round.</i>

20
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,953
Detailed Hands has survived.
Congratulations.

21
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,205
<i>And she made it to the finals.</i>

22
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,125
- She's so talented.
- You can tell she's different.

23
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,168
Gosh, this is thrilling.

24
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,921
<i>From the makeup process</i>
<i>to the final results,</i>

25
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:30,591
everything proves Detailed Hand's skills.

26
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>I think she really came to show everyone</i>

27
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,345
<i>why her name is Detailed Hands.</i>

28
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,015
<i>With flawless detail and perfection,</i>

29
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,851
<i>she's definitely proven her class.</i>

30
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,854
She is Detailed Hands.

31
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,359
Here's the last contestant
of the top three.

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:54,364
<i>This contestant has been on a roll</i>
<i>since Round One, without a single crisis.</i>

33
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,242
It's Golden Hand in Paris.

34
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,994
Really?

35
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,912
She's an artist

36
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>who constantly thinks of new faces</i>
<i>and never-before-seen makeup looks.</i>

37
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,878
<i>She's an artist</i>
<i>who always surprises everyone</i>

38
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,006
<i>with her unique and brilliant makeup.</i>

39
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,216
She is Golden Hand in Paris.

40
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,389
<i>Since I know how much preparation</i>
<i>the top three put into this round,</i>

41
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:24,269
and how detailed they all are,

42
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,730
<i>I have no idea who will win.</i>

43
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,069
A special cheering squad is here
to cheer the top three on.

44
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,695
Who could it be?

45
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,615
Hello.

46
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,578
LET'S GO, GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS
LET'S GO, OH DOLCE VITA

47
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,246
What?

48
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,585
MACtist.

49
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,128
- Hello.
- Hello.

50
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,963
Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon.

51
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,424
- Hello.
- You're wearing a sparkly outfit again.

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,010
- Large Girl is here too.
- You're so cool!

53
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,680
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

54
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,056
You can do this!

55
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:08,897
The contestants who competed with you
have gathered here to cheer you on.

56
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:12,776
The makeup is over.
There's no competition for you today.

57
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,027
You must be feeling at ease.

58
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,278
- Yes!
- Yes!

59
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,489
Your faces look brighter than ever.

60
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,865
I'm so happy.

61
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,784
First Man, how are you feeling?

62
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,120
Don't we look different today?

63
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,872
- Everyone looks so fresh.
- Yes.

64
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,876
Big Sister of Beauty, is there anyone
you're rooting for among the three?

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,546
It's our forever captain, Detailed Hands.

66
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,050
I prayed for her every day.

67
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,969
- Really?
- Yes.

68
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,139
Are any of you rooting for someone else?

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,014
Yes.

70
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,809
As you know,

71
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,353
- two of our former teammates
- Yes.

72
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,605
- have advanced to the finals.
- Yes.

73
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,441
So we're rooting for them both.

74
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,152
- I see.
- I hope either of them wins.

75
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,195
Oh, so you're happy
as long as it's not Detailed Hands.

76
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,488
That's not what I meant.

77
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,867
Is that what you're saying?

78
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,411
I'm rooting for Detailed Hands as well.

79
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,497
I just hope one of these two wins

80
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,166
so we can enjoy the dinner
they're treating us to.

81
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,375
I see.

82
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,255
All right. We will now bring in the models
whose dreams will come true.

83
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,256
Who are they?

84
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,009
- I'm so nervous.
- I'm really curious.

85
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,763
She is an actress who says
that she was destined to be an actor

86
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,974
and is still actively working
across the genres

87
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,018
of TV shows, film, and theater.

88
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,437
Please welcome Actress Jung Hye-seon.

89
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:33,023
Hello.

90
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,197
She looks amazing.

91
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,281
My goodness.

92
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,741
Unbelievable.

93
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,534
- I got goosebumps.
- Me too.

94
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,869
I'm getting goosebumps.

95
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,454
Hello, Ms. Jung.

96
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,539
Thank you for coming such a long way.

97
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,999
Please say hello to our contestants.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,043
I'm nervous.

99
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,548
I thought I wouldn't get nervous anymore
once I got older,

100
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,842
but it turns out I still get nervous.

101
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,930
I think the moments
when you feel nervous are the best.

102
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,725
If you never get nervous,
you'd be as good as dead.

103
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,435
It's nice to meet you all.

104
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,731
I went to her green room
to say hello earlier.

105
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,275
And when I saw her sitting there
in this jacket and sunglasses,

106
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,403
I almost backed away.
She looked so charismatic.

107
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,406
She looked so cool
that I was really surprised.

108
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,995
I look forward to seeing what kind of role
you'll be transforming into today.

109
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,833
All right. Let me introduce
the second model now.

110
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,461
She exudes incredible charisma,

111
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,756
showcasing her unique presence
in a variety of genres.

112
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,175
Please welcome Actress Ban Hyo-joung.

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,935
Welcome.

114
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,436
Hello.

115
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,147
She's so cool.

116
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,483
She's just so cool.

117
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,611
Look at her charisma.

118
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,154
Her presence is unbelievable.

119
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,281
- She's so cool.
- Oh, wow.

120
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,991
My goodness.

121
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,285
Hello.

122
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,997
Please say hello to our contestants.

123
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,332
I'm just Ban Hyo-joung.

124
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,629
- That was cool.
- Thank you.

125
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,799
"I'm just Ban Hyo-joung."
I think it explains everything.

126
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,969
- Right.
- The models are incredibly charismatic.

127
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,221
I don't know what to do.

128
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,892
All right. Let me introduce
the last model then.

129
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,979
I wonder if there's anyone in Korea
who doesn't know this person.

130
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,480
With her unwavering passion for acting,

131
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,817
she has appeared in over 200 works
as our nation's beloved actress.

132
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,986
Please welcome Actress Kim Young-ok.

133
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,823
Hello.

134
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,075
Nice to meet you all.

135
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,038
Look at her outfit. It's so cute.

136
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,540
- She looks amazing.
- It's so hip.

137
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,751
She's like G-DRAGON.

138
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,670
Hello, Ms. Kim.

139
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,423
Please say hello to our contestants.

140
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,885
They say they will transform us.

141
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,347
Good luck with that. I'm curious to see

142
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,849
how you will transform the three of us.

143
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,685
Let's see what you are capable of.

144
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,982
What kind of roles
have you mainly played so far?

145
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,151
- Throughout your acting career...
- Actually,

146
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,236
I want to ask you.
Have you seen any of my work?

147
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,321
Of course, I have.

148
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,198
- We worked together before.
- Right.

149
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,699
What was the title? <i>Three Leaf Clover?</i>

150
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,077
- I asked you to keep it a secret earlier.
- In the show,

151
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,037
- You don't have to mention it.
- I was your grandma.

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,330
She played my grandmother.

153
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,832
You did well in the show,

154
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,417
but the ratings weren't that good.

155
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,543
That's true.

156
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,757
Thank you for saying that I did well.

157
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,550
- You did well.
- I see.

158
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,887
But I did point out your low-toned voice.

159
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,722
Yes, you did. A lot.

160
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:55,892
She's scolding her.

161
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,728
I started my career playing a grandmother,

162
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,563
so I've mostly played grandmothers.

163
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,399
I just wish

164
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,236
I could play a role like a princess.

165
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,905
I wish I could do it
even if it's the last thing I do.

166
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,783
- It's just a dream.
- I think it would really suit you.

167
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,077
It's just like a midsummer night's dream.

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,412
No, it isn't just a dream.

169
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,915
I believe it might come true today.

170
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,419
Today, the three of you
will be doing a photoshoot with the theme

171
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,254
of your dreams as actresses.

172
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,006
Have you done photoshoots before?

173
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:29,843
I did a lot of photoshoots
when I was younger,

174
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,929
but who would hire me these days?

175
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:37,559
I've done a <i>hanbok</i> photoshoot before,

176
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,103
but it was so long ago
I can't even remember when.

177
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,773
Then this must be incredibly meaningful.

178
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:48,778
Unfortunately, I don't remember
ever doing a photoshoot.

179
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,904
Have you never done one before?

180
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,282
I've taken photos for interviews,

181
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,452
but I've never done a separate photoshoot.

182
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,370
That's why this opportunity
is so precious.

183
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,288
I see.

184
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,792
This is the final round with the theme
of their dreams as actresses.

185
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,131
<i>The final round will evaluate</i>
<i>not only the completed makeup looks...</i>

186
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,466
How about she looks
directly at the camera?

187
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,511
<i>...but also the photoshoot itself.</i>

188
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,515
Judging will be based on a point system.

189
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,102
It's 97 points.

190
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:24,981
<i>Each judge can award</i>
<i>a maximum of 100 points.</i>

191
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,987
<i>The contestant with the highest score</i>
<i>will be the winner.</i>

192
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,698
The final winner's photoshoot

193
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:38,161
will grace the cover of the December issue
of Harper's Bazaar.

194
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,579
THE COVER OF THE DECEMBER ISSUE
OF HARPER'S BAZAAR

195
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,041
That's amazing.

196
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:47,796
For a makeup artist
to be in charge of a magazine cover

197
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,339
is practically impossible.

198
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,300
This is an unprecedented mission.

199
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,513
<i>Usually, professionals work together</i>
<i>for the cover of a magazine.</i>

200
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,059
<i>But it's not common</i>
<i>for a makeup artist to direct the process.</i>

201
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,478
It will be another huge challenge.

202
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,855
It won't be easy.

203
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,944
Now, all three of you,
please go to your partners.

204
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,362
I'm coming.

205
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,407
- Hey.
- Hello.

206
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,035
- It's nice to see you again.
- Ms. Ban.

207
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,079
You were amazing.

208
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,372
You were really cool.

209
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,540
Thanks.

210
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,209
It's nice to see you again.

211
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,173
Hey.

212
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,636
- All right. It's all good.
- Thank you, Ms. Kim.

213
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,264
- They all met good partners.
- Right.

214
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,142
They all found a partner
whose style suits them well.

215
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,935
They all found a good match.

216
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,978
They all look perfect.

217
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,647
- They look like a good match.
- I know.

218
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,482
They really look good together.

219
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,944
They look quite charismatic.

220
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,905
They have a charisma
that radiates from their inner strength.

221
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,075
I'm really curious to see
how they'll transform them.

222
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,579
As her wish
is to play an upscale lady role,

223
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:08,334
I'd like to transform her
into a sophisticated and elegant queen.

224
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,296
I can't wait.

225
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,508
Ms. Jung was an action star in the 1970s.

226
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,761
The movie was titled
<i>Madame Jang from Hong Kong.</i>

227
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,809
Madam Jang did not retire.

228
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:30,106
Today, I'm going to transform her
into the leader of heroes.

229
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,943
Ms. Ban's dream role

230
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,153
is the Grim Reaper.

231
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,743
Today, I'll create a guide of souls
with my makeup.

232
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:46,956
The top three are now ready to win.

233
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,043
You will have 120 minutes
to do your makeup.

234
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,670
Please grab your brushes

235
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,632
and start creating your makeup look now.

236
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,383
DETAILED HANDS,
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS, OH DOLCE VITA

237
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,386
- Good luck!
- You got this!

238
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,804
- Let's go!
- Good luck!

239
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:03,431
Go, Detailed Hands!

240
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm really curious about all of them.

241
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,186
- How would they look?
- How will they work this out?

242
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,480
- They all have different themes.
- Right.

243
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,067
An artist who works at a salon.

244
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,402
A freelancer from abroad.

245
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,154
And an artist
who works for a foreign brand.

246
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,656
These three made it to the finals.

247
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,491
There they are.

248
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,076
My goodness.

249
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,702
It's on. The screen is live.

250
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,330
There they are.

251
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,957
My goodness.

252
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,291
So immersive.

253
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,668
This is so cool.

254
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,338
It's great that we can watch the process.

255
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,132
- I'm grateful.
- It's an honor.

256
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,554
- It feels cool.
- Yes.

257
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,847
Your cheeks are flushed.

258
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,016
Your face is feeling hot.

259
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,272
She gives a good massage.

260
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,232
I wish I got that massage.

261
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,484
This will make my skin even better.

262
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,487
I really like your touch.

263
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,740
<i>I got her skin ready.</i>

264
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:07,120
<i>Then I got a foundation</i>
<i>that was long-lasting and highly adherent.</i>

265
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,416
<i>I used that foundation</i>
<i>to smooth out her skin texture.</i>

266
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,131
I guess she's using tissues
to remove the oil from her face.

267
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,050
I guess the Grim Reaper
would have matte skin.

268
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,177
- Pale and matte skin.
- Right.

269
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,931
I can't imagine a Grim Reaper
with glowy skin.

270
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:30,852
Since it was for a photoshoot,
I didn't want to use a lot of powder.

271
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,230
<i>So I deliberately tried to create</i>
<i>a matte finish from the beginning.</i>

272
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,026
<i>I mixed foundation and concealer</i>

273
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,902
<i>and applied a thin layer.</i>

274
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,864
The base makeup must be tricky.

275
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,907
Since the model is relatively old,

276
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,035
her skin would take makeup
a little differently.

277
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,372
I think every touch
has to be very delicate.

278
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,374
If I were her, I'd be doomed.

279
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,418
It's really hard to apply the base.

280
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,921
<i>Then I focused on covering up any spots.</i>

281
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,090
<i>I think I did it for a very long time.</i>

282
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,886
What if I do so well
after this photoshoot?

283
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,431
I'm a bit worried.

284
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,772
I have a lot of wrinkles,

285
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:18,524
so it'll be harder to do makeup on me
than on others.

286
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,402
It's all right.

287
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,613
You are a lot older than the other two.

288
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,782
- Right. I'm the oldest one here.
- Yes.

289
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,117
I hope the judges
take that into consideration.

290
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,248
<i>I first applied a liquid foundation</i>

291
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,959
<i>that adheres perfectly to the face</i>
<i>with a spatula.</i>

292
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,505
<i>It needs to adhere well to the wrinkles.</i>

293
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,966
As you grow older,
your face ages differently from your neck.

294
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,845
It may become dull, dark, red, or drab.

295
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,306
<i>So I applied a layer</i>
<i>that matched her neck color,</i>

296
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,850
<i>a slightly darker color</i>
<i>on the outer edges,</i>

297
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,603
<i>and a lighter color on the front.</i>

298
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,772
<i>I used four different foundations.</i>

299
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,275
Detailed Hands is
truly the master of base makeup.

300
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,278
I want to see Detailed Hands
apply base makeup up close.

301
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,363
It must be a work of art.

302
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,407
Detailed Hands
is really skilled at base makeup.

303
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,161
Detailed Hands' attention
to detail is extraordinary.

304
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,996
The way she uses her hands.

305
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,665
An action star.

306
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,291
- An action star from Hong Kong?
- Yes.

307
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,501
The leader.

308
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,295
Keep your eyes closed.

309
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,843
She's using black on her eyes
for a smoky look.

310
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>We had the theme</i>
<i>where she'd move the world</i>

311
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,560
<i>with her gaze, gestures,</i>
<i>and intense charisma.</i>

312
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:39,063
<i>The makeup that best suited it</i>
<i>was a slightly grunge-inspired</i>

313
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,314
<i>smoky makeup look.</i>

314
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,526
It looks so cool.

315
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,197
The makeup is really bold.

316
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,992
Look at that eye makeup.

317
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,871
She started forming the eye-hole,
which is her strength.

318
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,831
Right. That's her specialty.

319
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,667
Did she leave the center empty on purpose?

320
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,043
I think so.

321
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,962
Why do you think that is?

322
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,381
Is she going to
do something in the center?

323
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,719
The sunken areas of the eyes
were heavily shaded,

324
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,723
<i>while the central area,</i>
<i>where the light falls, was highlighted</i>

325
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,391
<i>to create a sense of contrast.</i>

326
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,230
Her long acting career has allowed her
to possess both brightness and darkness,

327
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:26,068
<i>so I tried to create an eye makeup</i>
<i>that conveyed such a narrative.</i>

328
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,237
Look at the gradient.

329
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,240
Achieving a gradient with black
is really difficult.

330
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,451
If things go wrong, it can look messy.

331
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,287
Applying smoky makeup

332
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,416
or doing a cut crease makeup
on an older model is very challenging.

333
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,920
But Oh Dolce Vita is doing a great job.

334
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,215
- The eye shape and pattern...
- She shaped the eyes well.

335
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,799
The gradient looks amazing.

336
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:53,596
The smoky makeup is perfectly balanced.

337
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,602
My goodness, Golden Hand in Paris
is using something black.

338
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,855
Golden Hand in Paris
is also doing smoky makeup.

339
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,274
Right. It's the Grim Reaper.

340
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,610
<i>I wanted to capture</i>

341
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,320
<i>the dreary and grim</i>
<i>aura of the Grim Reaper.</i>

342
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,781
<i>So I thought a smoky look would work.</i>

343
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,700
But I still wanted to use some colors.

344
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,496
<i>There was a shimmery dark blue shadow,</i>
<i>and the shimmer was so beautiful.</i>

345
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,248
<i>And it created a nice gradient.</i>

346
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,001
<i>I started the gradient</i>
<i>by drawing a horizontal line</i>

347
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,879
<i>through her eyeliner</i>
<i>to highlight her charisma.</i>

348
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,924
Golden Hand in Paris's smoky makeup
looks beautiful.

349
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,760
She didn't contour or apply any liner yet.

350
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:35,638
- Right.
- She's just smudging with the eyeshadow.

351
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,306
- Right?
- Yes.

352
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,058
I like this color combination.

353
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,603
- It's pretty.
- The silver color looks good on her.

354
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,314
The silver color
really brightens up her face.

355
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,400
- I think it's going in a good direction.
- Yes.

356
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:52,321
Golden Hand in Paris is putting
a lot of effort into the eye makeup.

357
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,197
Right.

358
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,702
Ms. Ban, please face the front.

359
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,580
I think...

360
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,458
I think the inner corner
of the left eye needs to be raised.

361
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,587
The inner corner should be...

362
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,922
It should be raised a bit higher.

363
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:13,134
- A little higher.
- Please raise it.

364
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,346
This one is too high,
and the other is too low.

365
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,559
<i>The eye makeup was uneven.</i>

366
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,352
<i>I was like, "What should I do?"</i>

367
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,479
<i>"Did she not notice that?"</i>

368
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,983
<i>Did she have a hard time</i>
<i>reading the curves of her face?</i>

369
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,445
<i>Why can't she get the eye area right?</i>

370
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,863
<i>Is it that she just can't do it?</i>

371
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,199
Golden Hand in Paris's work
isn't good enough.

372
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,577
- This is too common.
- Considering what she's done,

373
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,162
this is a bit disappointing.

374
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,788
People have expectations.

375
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:46,042
And she hasn't met those expectations yet.

376
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,084
Right.

377
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,671
Golden Hand in Paris needs to try harder.

378
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,090
I think she'd need a special move.

379
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,550
Right. I bet she'll have one.

380
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:58,554
It won't be easy for her to win
if she keeps doing what she's been doing.

381
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,683
Since two of the makeup looks
are quite heavy,

382
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,561
Detailed Hands' work
stands out even more, right?

383
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,772
She does look like the Queen of England.

384
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,899
Yes, she does.

385
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,902
I look elegant now.

386
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,988
<i>I wanted to use a slightly</i>
<i>Western-style eye makeup look,</i>

387
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,199
with cut creases.

388
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,160
But the vertical wrinkles around her eyes
were too pronounced,

389
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,746
which went against the cut crease look.

390
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,331
<i>So I toned it down a lot.</i>

391
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,125
<i>Instead, I decided to use</i>
<i>warm, deep colors.</i>

392
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,587
<i>Using wine and plum colors,</i>

393
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,633
<i>I aimed to portray an elegant queen,</i>
<i>wearing the passage of time,</i>

394
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,679
while naturally highlighting
the traces of time.

395
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,766
Detailed Hands is making her move now.

396
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,061
She's drawing the eye hole.

397
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,396
There she goes.

398
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,530
By the way, Detailed Hands

399
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,491
uses a lot of small strokes.

400
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,536
What I'd finish in 3 strokes,
she does in 30.

401
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,413
The model has a lot of wrinkles,

402
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,623
so she stretches the skin out
while applying makeup.

403
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,461
- I can see her skills well.
- I know.

404
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,464
She suddenly became beautiful
like Queen Elizabeth.

405
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,175
- The colors are amazing.
- Yes. It suddenly became beautiful.

406
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,343
She keeps layering the colors.

407
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,388
It's amazing that it looks so clear
even after all the layering.

408
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,098
It looks really pretty.

409
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,808
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

410
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,645
I think it's her first time
wearing such a makeup look.

411
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:30,771
- Right?
- I think so.

412
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,398
The theme and the model...

413
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,233
- They work well together.
- They create a big synergy.

414
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,861
I need you to get dressed now.

415
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,903
What about the lips?

416
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,864
I'll do it after you get changed.

417
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,240
Is it okay if everyone sees me like this?

418
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,908
- It's okay.
- It's no problem.

419
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,829
- It's all right. It's not done yet.
- We shouldn't show it yet.

420
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,497
That's the rule.

421
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,958
- She doesn't want to show us.
- We already saw it.

422
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,002
We already saw your face.

423
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,129
We already saw everything.

424
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,672
- We saw it all.
- We shouldn't show it yet.

425
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,883
It's all right. It's not done yet.

426
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,842
It's okay to show it.

427
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,677
They'll see it anyway.

428
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,474
She's so lovely. My goodness.

429
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,312
We'll see you later.

430
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,565
My gosh. She's so adorable.

431
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,734
- She's lovely.
- How cute.

432
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,864
Would you like to try the outfit on?

433
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,115
The outfit.

434
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,288
Look at her outfit.

435
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,290
It looks so cool.

436
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,084
- It's black.
- That's amazing.

437
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,712
She's the human NARS.

438
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,088
Exactly.

439
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,554
Amazing.

440
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,976
She's putting on a wig.

441
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,687
- A wig?
- Is she putting on a wig?

442
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,274
They straightened her hair earlier,
and I thought that was it, but...

443
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,652
So that's why they straightened her hair.

444
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,154
The wig is the kick.

445
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,366
She looks so cool.

446
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,204
As soon as she put on the wig,
her aura changed completely.

447
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,623
I felt a thrill there.

448
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,627
She looks like an elf.

449
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,754
It suits her so well.

450
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,925
I can imagine
what she'd look like in the photoshoot.

451
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,262
I guess Golden Hand in Paris
would have a finishing blow.

452
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,596
- I bet she would.
- Of course.

453
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,056
I hope there's something.

454
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,979
I think Golden Hand in Paris would have
something else up her sleeve.

455
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,647
I don't think so.

456
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,609
She's been using a lot of objects so far.
Isn't she using anything today?

457
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:43,279
Golden Hand in Paris
would need something strong.

458
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,781
Shall we begin?

459
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,992
- Yes.
- All right. Let's begin.

460
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,160
What? She's putting something on.

461
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,705
- She's putting something on.
- She's putting something on.

462
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,540
Please face the front.

463
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,084
What's that?

464
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,794
- What is that?
- What's that? I've never seen it before.

465
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,839
- Of course she had something.
- She had something. I knew it.

466
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,299
Right. That couldn't have been everything.

467
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,592
I know.

468
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,595
Why am I feeling happy
that she's using something?

469
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,305
I'm happy.

470
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,556
What is that?

471
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,808
<i>I've done some research,</i>

472
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:17,771
<i>and I saw an artist do a beauty project</i>
<i>using mother-of-pearl.</i>

473
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,399
I thought it could be a kick in a way.

474
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,109
<i>It's a fusion of old and new.</i>

475
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,403
<i>Since the smoky makeup is quite intense,</i>

476
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,240
<i>I tried using mother-of-pearl</i>
<i>to balance it out.</i>

477
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,287
I think it will give off
an East Asian aesthetic.

478
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:37,458
The cloud shapes add a sense of depth.

479
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,835
I knew it.

480
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,671
- Something up her sleeve.
- I knew she'd have something.

481
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:44,632
- She's got great ideas.
- Yes.

482
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,342
She's extraordinary.

483
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,886
Be careful, Ms. Kim.

484
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,764
It's okay to show it.

485
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,558
- I'm all right.
- It's okay to show it.

486
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,393
Still, I don't want to.

487
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,228
I don't want to show it.

488
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,688
- Where is my seat?
- Here.

489
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,315
- This way.
- Okay.

490
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,192
- She's so lovely.
- Right.

491
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,611
- She's cute.
- Ms. Kim.

492
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,696
I'll show it once it's all finished.

493
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,282
Hurry and apply the lipstick first.

494
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,077
- We still have 35 minutes left.
- The lipstick...

495
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,412
What if we're out of time
before the lipstick?

496
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,748
- Okay.
- I'm getting my own way.

497
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,041
I'm nervous.

498
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,877
- Right.
- So, this is what a competition is like.

499
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,672
It must've been nerve-racking.

500
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,883
Where's the toned-down orange one?

501
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,052
This is a little dewy.

502
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,637
Slightly...

503
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,640
- Does my breath stink of coffee?
- No.

504
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,891
- No.
- Not at all.

505
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,017
I have a bad sense of smell.

506
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,313
- The Queen of England.
- She looks so pretty.

507
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,316
Ms. Kim's photoshoot
would look like a scene from a movie.

508
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,736
I can see each of their strengths here.

509
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,655
This is very colorful.

510
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,864
This is artistic.

511
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,366
And this is very detailed.

512
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:56,453
There is a definite difference
between them.

513
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,708
Among those three,
my personal favorite is Oh Dolce Vita.

514
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,419
It's the most suitable
for a magazine cover.

515
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,422
It looks even more stylish
than I expected.

516
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:07,631
I like the middle one.

517
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:09,883
- The middle?
- Yes. Golden Hand in Paris.

518
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,719
I really love it.

519
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:17,391
I find Detailed Hands' work the prettiest.

520
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,435
- This is textbook makeup.
- Right.

521
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,688
The photoshoot will be the key.

522
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,857
For now, I have no idea.

523
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,192
I'm curious to see how it turns out.

524
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,445
THE FINAL MAKEUP IS READY

525
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,451
PHOTOSHOOT SITE

526
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,661
SHIN SUN-HYE
PHOTOGRAPHER

527
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,788
JUNG HYE-MI
HARPER'S BAZAAR BEAUTY DIRECTOR

528
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,803
This is cool.

529
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:01,226
The end should be a little more this way.
It's covering this camera angle.

530
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,729
The set had to be bigger because of me.

531
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,648
The set for my shoot was the biggest
because of the parachute.

532
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,861
Let's begin.

533
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,287
Good.

534
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,918
The top part isn't high enough.

535
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,669
It should be higher.

536
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,673
Pull it this way. Go and pull it.

537
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,222
- Wait. Please fix her hair first.
- Yes, let's.

538
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,224
- Let's take a break.
- We will take a short break.

539
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,226
You must be tired.

540
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,654
All right. Let's resume.

541
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,490
- Hello.
- Good work.

542
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,827
- Her pose and expression are crucial.
- Yes.

543
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,870
She's trying to look cool.

544
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,205
But I think it's a bit hard.

545
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,832
With the wind and all.

546
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,708
Please lift it higher.

547
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,633
I'll go up.

548
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,136
<i>The parachute work was really hard.</i>

549
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,388
<i>It was tough. It suddenly became tricky.</i>

550
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,431
Oh, dear.

551
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,016
Gosh, I'm sorry.

552
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:30,524
She looks like a real queen.

553
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,945
Let's begin.

554
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,865
You look amazing right now.

555
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,241
You look stunning.

556
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,578
She looks gorgeous.

557
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,538
After a few shots,

558
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,874
let's try getting some close-ups
of the makeup.

559
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,377
Okay. You'd need to fix the makeup
before the close-up shots.

560
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:55,591
This time, without a smile,
looking surprised.

561
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,760
Please look at the camera. Okay.

562
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:02,264
Nice.

563
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:06,435
Please keep your back straight. Good.

564
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,936
Detailed Hands looks so serious.

565
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,396
This kind of vibe.

566
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,273
Hang on. Excuse me.

567
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,316
Good.

568
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,402
<i>It wasn't just about having my work</i>
<i>featured on the cover of a magazine.</i>

569
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:19,114
<i>She's almost 90,</i>
<i>but she's never done a photoshoot.</i>

570
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,240
Here we go.

571
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,284
What I wanted even more

572
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,204
was to give the photoshoot
to Ms. Kim as a gift.

573
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,998
You look great.

574
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,249
Hang on.

575
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,798
What do you think? Please take a look.

576
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,301
How about she looks
directly at the camera?

577
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,220
I like that angle.

578
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,846
Good. You look great.

579
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,432
Please look at the camera.

580
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,976
Nice. That was great just now.

581
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,645
Okay.

582
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:54,858
She looks amazing.

583
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,820
Detailed Hands.

584
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,281
<i>I think Detailed Hands will win.</i>

585
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:09,998
Excuse me.

586
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,338
<i>The image of a Grim Reaper</i>
<i>is someone you can't look down on</i>

587
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,506
<i>and who looks cool.</i>

588
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:22,010
<i>So I had her wear</i>
<i>an oversized suit and high heels.</i>

589
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:27,349
<i>I emphasized the overall length</i>
<i>to make her seem like a reaper.</i>

590
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,103
You did a great job.

591
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,230
Even a dog?

592
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,774
Is it a wolf?

593
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,150
- Wait.
- Yes, a wolfdog.

594
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,568
- Really?
- Yes.

595
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,322
It looks so cool.

596
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:48,620
I heard that wolves
are responsible for running around

597
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,497
looking for souls.

598
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:55,544
<i>So I thought it would create a good story</i>
<i>if I captured a wolf and the Grim Reaper</i>

599
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,045
<i>in one frame.</i>

600
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,547
All right.

601
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,715
- Wait.
- Let's do this.

602
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,008
Shooting.

603
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,176
Okay. Good.

604
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,598
She feels like
a charismatic guide of souls.

605
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,852
- You look stunning.
- It's going really well.

606
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,396
- You look great.
- This is amazing.

607
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,064
Okay. It's really good now.

608
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,899
It's okay to put your hand in your pocket.

609
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,485
I'll fix your makeup a little.

610
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,571
Good. That looks great.

611
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,117
I think this much would be nice.

612
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,036
I don't think the light will go this way.

613
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,620
This is pretty.

614
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,956
Please try the hat on.

615
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,921
She looks amazing.

616
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,300
THE PHOTOSHOOT IS OVER

617
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:03,945
Thank you all for your hard work.

618
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,950
Good work, everyone.

619
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,787
Our three actors,

620
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,498
thank you for your hard work,
even until late.

621
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:18,335
We appreciate you
for staying with us until the very end.

622
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,253
Ms. Kim.

623
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,839
How did you feel
working on the project with us today?

624
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,801
I've gotten my makeup done
while filming TV shows before,

625
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,470
- Yes.
- but I didn't realize this was possible.

626
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,639
I had a lot of respect
for my makeup artist.

627
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,432
- You had a lot of respect.
- Thank you.

628
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:35,018
That's the best compliment.

629
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,355
Ms. Ban, how was it?

630
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,523
Oh, dear.

631
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,318
I wonder if I'll ever have
an experience like this again in my life.

632
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,362
I can't help but be astonished.

633
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,364
She is astonished.

634
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:49,032
- You know what?
- Yes?

635
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,368
I was worried about this face of mine.

636
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:56,832
I kept wondering if my makeup artist
liked my face or not.

637
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:00,043
I've been worried sick.

638
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,003
You were the best model.

639
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,506
Ma'am.

640
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,884
Thank you for your funny comment.

641
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,761
All right.

642
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,473
You must be curious about the results.

643
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,850
- Yes!
- Yes!

644
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,560
- I'm curious.
- I'm so nervous.

645
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,187
Now, we will begin judging

646
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,649
the photos
for the final round mission, Dreams.

647
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:24,151
REVEALING THE PHOTOS
FOR THE FINAL MISSION, DREAMS

648
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:28,822
First, Oh Dolce Vita, please come forward.

649
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,248
- I'm nervous.
- They must be nervous.

650
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,167
- Oh, my goodness.
- Good luck!

651
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,544
Stand tall!

652
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,753
She must be nervous.

653
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,380
Gosh, this is so nerve-racking.

654
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,634
I'm feeling nervous for her.

655
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,055
You look amazing standing there.

656
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,101
Oh Dolce Vita,
what is the title of today's photoshoot?

657
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,105
I named it "Hero Standing Above Time."

658
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,524
All right. Please reveal the photos

659
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:07,360
of Actress Jung Hye-seon,
who has become an action star.

660
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,904
I'm so nervous.

661
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,655
I'm really nervous.

662
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,950
I can't wait to see how it turned out.

663
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,538
My goodness.

664
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,375
I'm getting goosebumps.

665
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,212
That's the wig she put on earlier.

666
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,923
The styling is great.

667
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,225
That's unbelievable.

668
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:42,270
HERO STANDING ABOVE TIME
BY OH DOLCE VITA

669
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:46,733
That's unbelievable.

670
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,237
Amazing.

671
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,283
This is incredible.

672
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,370
The makeup is great, of course,

673
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,081
but Ms. Jung's gaze truly captures

674
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:05,293
the image of the best action star,
unrivaled by anyone.

675
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,254
I think that's a parachute.

676
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,797
A white parachute.

677
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,799
- It looks so cool.
- Right.

678
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,926
The hair is insane.

679
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,053
- She picked a great hairstyle, right?
- Yes.

680
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,347
This is so cool.

681
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,140
<i>I got emotional.</i>

682
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,767
<i>It wasn't just the main cut.</i>

683
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:24,354
<i>Looking at the other cuts</i>
<i>that were shown together,</i>

684
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,898
I thought that the actress
was well portrayed.

685
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:30,277
<i>I couldn't believe they managed</i>
<i>such stunning work.</i>

686
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,321
<i>Seeing the makeup on the large screen,</i>

687
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,032
<i>every detail was visible.</i>

688
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:40,662
Despite all that,
the makeup looked perfect.

689
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,206
Actually, Ms. Jung

690
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:48,211
has been single-mindedly pursuing
her dream for about 60 years.

691
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,172
But her dream is not over yet.

692
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,967
Conveying the idea
that her dream will continue forever,

693
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:57,345
I tried to capture that narrative
through her eye makeup.

694
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:02,851
I tried to focus on her eyes
with a tear-like sheen,

695
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,855
a hollow center, a deep eyelid,

696
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,191
<i>while keeping the other parts</i>
<i>of the makeup minimal.</i>

697
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,777
I explained earlier
that she was Madame Jang

698
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,655
from the film, <i>Madame Jang from Hong Kong.</i>

699
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,366
There's a scene in the movie
where she descends in a balloon

700
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:20,410
and engages in action.

701
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:23,913
I was so impressed by that photo
that I decided to pay homage to it.

702
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:27,208
<i>And this time, she descends</i>
<i>on a more advanced parachute.</i>

703
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,293
<i>It captures her energy</i>

704
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,962
that can move anything with a single gaze.

705
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:34,674
This work is my tribute to someone
who has spent her whole life

706
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,844
on this path with a single conviction.

707
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,512
Thank you for your explanation.

708
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:46,728
I wonder what the judges think
about Oh Dolce Vita's work.

709
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,397
Saem-mool, please tell us
what you think of her work.

710
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:53,485
True to its title,
"Hero Standing Above Time,"

711
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,820
it has a very weighty feel.

712
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,866
I could fully appreciate
Actress Jung Hye-seon's intense gaze

713
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:03,703
and the charisma of the hero.

714
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,747
I could feel all of those things.

715
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,249
It's truly amazing.

716
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,672
Not only does it portray
the passage of time through the eyes,

717
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,924
<i>but it also shows the flow of her hair,</i>

718
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,135
<i>the feel of the trench coat,</i>
<i>and the delicate design of the background.</i>

719
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,721
<i>Everything was in harmony.</i>

720
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,224
I was also deeply moved
by the way the nails looked

721
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,102
<i>as if they had</i>
<i>been damaged by the passage of time.</i>

722
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,438
I was impressed
by how the photoshoot portrayed

723
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:34,025
the beauty of someone who had
gone through so much all this time.

724
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,276
I truly enjoyed your work.

725
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:44,035
Ms. Jung, how do you feel
seeing your photos on such a large screen?

726
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,788
I feel shy.

727
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,415
Why?

728
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,625
I only dreamed about this
in my younger days.

729
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:54,879
How did I possibly think
of doing a photoshoot with this face?

730
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:57,048
No. You look amazing.

731
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,466
You're so cool.

732
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,218
- You look stunning.
- You look great.

733
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,054
- You look amazing.
- You're beautiful.

734
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:08,518
I wonder what the other actresses
think of Ms. Jung's photos.

735
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,479
It's truly amazing.

736
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,190
How could she express herself like that?

737
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:16,401
I guess this is what you call
a photoshoot,

738
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,819
although I don't know much.

739
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,740
I'm no match for Jung Hye-seon as a model.

740
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,116
This is so cool.

741
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,661
It's really cool.

742
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:33,001
Now it's time to enter your scores.

743
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:38,339
Have you decided what score
you'd give it out of 100?

744
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,511
Please enter your scores.

745
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,846
100 POINTS FROM EACH JUDGE,
FOR A TOTAL OF 400

746
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:49,809
How many points did Oh Dolce Vita receive?

747
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,814
The judges are done entering their scores.

748
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,357
Are the scores being revealed one by one?

749
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,776
- I guess so.
- Seriously?

750
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:01,738
First, Oh Dolce Vita,

751
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:06,201
please choose the judge
whose score you're most curious about.

752
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,703
Then we will reveal it first.

753
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,038
It's getting more interesting.

754
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,248
Who would it be?

755
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:14,125
Who would it be?

756
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:17,712
Director Jung.

757
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,215
Oh Dolce Vita

758
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,760
is most curious about Saem-mool's score.

759
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,969
Why is that?

760
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,806
She's someone I have always admired,

761
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,683
and I've been a fan for a very long time.

762
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,393
Since I was little.

763
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,353
All right.

764
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:38,483
Then we will reveal
Saem-mool's score first.

765
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,903
Please reveal the score.

766
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,998
It's 97 points.

767
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,505
It's quite high.

768
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,592
- Amazing.
- That's a really high score.

769
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,845
- Isn't that high?
- It's really high.

770
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:09,097
It's 97 points out of 100.

771
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,765
<i>It was more generous than I expected.</i>

772
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,935
<i>I was more than satisfied.</i>

773
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,144
All right then.

774
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,064
As for the other three scores,

775
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,233
please...

776
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,111
do not reveal them right now.

777
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,824
We will reveal the scores
of the three judges later.

778
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,618
Oh, no.

779
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,870
What's going on?

780
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,247
- That's so mean.
- I'm having a headache.

781
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,541
This is show business. You all know that.

782
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,751
- All right.
- This is so much fun.

783
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:42,547
Oh Dolce Vita,
you may go back to your seat.

784
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,051
- Well done.
- Thank you.

785
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,344
All right.

786
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,930
Next up is Detailed Hands.
Please come forward.

787
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,399
- I'm curious.
- Me too.

788
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,193
I'm excited.

789
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,906
What is the title of your photoshoot?

790
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,075
It's "A Graceful Queen Who Wears Time."

791
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,078
"A Graceful Queen Who Wears Time."

792
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,165
Please reveal the photos
of Actress Kim Young-ok,

793
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,375
who has become a queen.

794
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,461
- I'm so curious.
- Oh, my.

795
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,754
Did it go well?

796
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,188
My goodness.

797
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,148
I've never seen her this splendid.

798
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,985
- Seriously.
- My goodness.

799
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,445
It's beautiful.

800
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,530
So pretty.

801
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,283
A GRACEFUL QUEEN WHO WEARS TIME
BY DETAILED HANDS

802
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,039
- So pretty.
- It's so pretty.

803
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,499
She's a queen.

804
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,084
The Queen of England.

805
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:03,544
Even her hair looks pretty.

806
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,005
She looks stunning.

807
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,174
It's so cool.

808
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:13,388
Seems that the image
of a very lovely queen has been made.

809
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,724
Ms. Kim is a woman who shows
the passage of time on her face,

810
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,352
and I felt a profound presence
in those wrinkles.

811
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:22,730
I found those wrinkles so beautiful

812
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:25,733
<i>that I tried to capture them as they were.</i>

813
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:31,155
She also told me
that she admired Queen Elizabeth.

814
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:35,410
And she mostly wears a lot of blush
and has curls in her hair.

815
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,538
So, I added some blush
to her deep contour makeup

816
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,874
to give her a more vibrant look.

817
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,293
I wish that, at least for today,

818
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:49,757
she could be the most beautiful queen
who gracefully wears time.

819
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:50,800
Thank you.

820
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,511
Thank you for your explanation.

821
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,096
She's the queen herself.

822
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,098
I love her expression in that picture.

823
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,267
Look at her facial expression.

824
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,393
That's unbelievable.

825
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,270
I love the photo at the end.

826
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:06,774
As an artist myself, I kept wondering

827
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:11,195
<i>how you could achieve</i>
<i>such delicate detail and expression</i>

828
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,364
while watching your makeup process.

829
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:17,452
I felt a profound, inexplicable resonance.

830
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,121
<i>She was the oldest actress of the three,</i>

831
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,873
so she had a lot of wrinkles,

832
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,459
making it incredibly difficult
to apply colors.

833
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:29,047
<i>And yet, she blended</i>
<i>and expressed the colors incredibly well.</i>

834
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:34,469
The base makeup is beautiful, yet minimal.

835
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,305
During the eye makeup process,

836
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,349
<i>I was so impressed by how you</i>
<i>meticulously handled the details,</i>

837
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,310
<i>which is truly your specialty.</i>

838
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:47,648
I was in awe of how you could blend
everything so intricately

839
00:42:47,732 --> 00:42:50,151
and bring out the texture
with such detail.

840
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,695
I was truly amazed.

841
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:53,821
Thank you.

842
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,532
That's why she's Detailed Hands.

843
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:59,243
Ms. Kim, how are you feeling?

844
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,873
I felt really bad for the artist.

845
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,919
I should've provided her
with fresh and tight facial skin

846
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,171
for her to work with.

847
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,965
I think she put in so much effort.

848
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,218
My eyes are uneven,

849
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,178
and even my eyebrows are uneven.

850
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:20,014
I have a lot of flaws on my face,

851
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,475
but she put in the utmost effort

852
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:25,978
to cover up those flaws.

853
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,522
So I'd like to give her my highest praise.

854
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,608
Thank you.

855
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:36,197
Ms. Jung, what do you think of the photos?

856
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,741
She's so beautiful that I'm jealous.

857
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:48,209
Now, Judges, please make your decisions
and enter your scores.

858
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,380
This is hard.

859
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,381
I know.

860
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:58,761
Again, we will only reveal the score

861
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:03,766
of one judge chosen by Detailed Hands.

862
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,936
I choose Lee Jin-soo.

863
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,521
He said good things about my work.

864
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,066
Then, among the four judges,

865
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:15,903
we will reveal Jin-soo's score.

866
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,156
Please reveal the score.

867
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,119
Who would you give a high score to?

868
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,371
- Detailed Hands.
- From looking at the photoshoot?

869
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,626
But the first work
was such a huge shock to me.

870
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:33,171
Right. Oh Dolce Vita's work.

871
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,679
It's 96 points.

872
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,815
It's too soon to say
which work will rank first,

873
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,610
but first place goes to Oh Dolce Vita,

874
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,904
and second place
goes to Detailed Hands for now.

875
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,906
What? This is so thrilling.

876
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,909
The difference is only one point.

877
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,330
<i>I knew the other two</i>
<i>would come up with something intense,</i>

878
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,915
<i>but my theme was a queen.</i>

879
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,419
I couldn't try anything dramatic or edgy.

880
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,171
<i>It made me a little nervous.</i>

881
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,465
<i>What if my work looks so plain?</i>

882
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:20,801
I felt a lot of pressure.

883
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,431
There's going to be a tie.

884
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,350
I bet there will be a tie.

885
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,103
All right.

886
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,106
Next up is Golden Hand in Paris.
Please come forward.

887
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,779
I'm curious.

888
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:45,034
Golden Hand in Paris gets really nervous
when she gives a speech.

889
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,828
She's so cute, but I'm worried about her.

890
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,122
She's from Paris.

891
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,334
She's been an artist in Paris
for 20 years.

892
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:56,754
<i>Both of them are strong contestants</i>
<i>and strong rivals.</i>

893
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,799
<i>But I'm worried that Golden Hand in Paris</i>

894
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,094
<i>might have brought in some wow factors.</i>

895
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:08,266
Golden Hand in Paris,
what is the title of your photoshoot?

896
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,185
The title of my photoshoot

897
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,855
is "Grim Reaper: The Guide of Souls."

898
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,900
Please reveal the photos
of Actress Ban Hyo-joung,

899
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,736
who has become the Guide of Souls.

900
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,493
I'm so excited and nervous.

901
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,328
I'm curious.

902
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,038
I'm so excited.

903
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:31,914
I'm nervous.

904
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,170
That's so cool.

905
00:46:56,314 --> 00:47:00,318
THE GUIDE OF SOULS
BY GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

906
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,489
That's amazing.

907
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,201
What's this? This is unbelievable.

908
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,623
A very powerful look has been made.

909
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,046
When I first came up with the theme,

910
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,424
I wanted to capture the feeling
of the Grim Reaper as the guide of souls.

911
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,344
So, in the photo, I used light

912
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:30,598
<i>to express how the souls follow her</i>
<i>and wander around her,</i>

913
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,310
<i>and how she guides those souls.</i>

914
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,896
The butterfly is a being
that follows death.

915
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,606
<i>It's a black butterfly.</i>

916
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,776
They say butterflies follow souls.

917
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,904
When my grandfather passed away,

918
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,616
my mom said a white butterfly
flew over her head that day.

919
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,994
<i>Given that she's the Grim Reaper,</i>
<i>a black butterfly seemed fitting.</i>

920
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:54,538
And about the wolf in the photo.

921
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:57,291
<i>They say wolves follow souls.</i>

922
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,543
<i>They catch souls and guide them.</i>

923
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:02,922
I wanted to portray the dog
as a friend who guides souls with warmth.

924
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,344
<i>At that moment, my thoughts stopped.</i>

925
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,721
When I watched the process
from a distance,

926
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,349
<i>I thought, "Is she nervous?</i>
<i>This is a bit disappointing."</i>

927
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,559
<i>This is how I felt.</i>

928
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:19,522
But it turns out
she calculated everything in the photo

929
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,483
<i>down to the angle of the hat.</i>

930
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,318
<i>It was so impactful.</i>

931
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,986
I was fooled.

932
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,572
What? I was such a novice.

933
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,158
I couldn't think that far ahead.

934
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:34,245
Why would achieving symmetry matter
if the photos would be shot like this?

935
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,080
<i>She had precisely calculated</i>

936
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,875
<i>and planned the angle</i>
<i>with the hat in mind.</i>

937
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,502
<i>It was a perfect photoshoot.</i>

938
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:45,297
<i>In her other photos,</i>
<i>she's standing sideways too.</i>

939
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,050
I'm impressed
that she calculated all that.

940
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:49,760
To the point where I felt so pathetic.

941
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,804
<i>I still have a lot to learn.</i>

942
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:55,516
It's a work
with a bit more depth to the story.

943
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,518
Every detail has profound meaning.

944
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,353
I can't recognize myself.

945
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,107
Everyone is born alone and leaves alone.

946
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,569
But I wish people like that
could guide them.

947
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,321
Thank you for expressing it so well.

948
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,784
Anyway, I don't recognize myself,
but it's still me, Ban Hyo-joung.

949
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,369
Thank you.

950
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,245
That was so cool.

951
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:22,960
Ms. Jung, what do you think
of Ms. Ban's photos?

952
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,921
I'm afraid of seeing her in my dreams.

953
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,802
That means Golden Hand in Paris
pulled it off well.

954
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:34,847
Anyone would be afraid
of seeing the Grim Reaper in their dreams.

955
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,015
That's true.

956
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,558
She's afraid of seeing her in her dreams.

957
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,559
That's her whole comment.

958
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,395
How did the judges like it?

959
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,565
Saem-mool, please tell us
about your thoughts first.

960
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,067
As expected of you, Golden Hand in Paris.

961
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,570
You've pushed the boundaries

962
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:53,574
of what a makeup artist can express,

963
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,494
so I've been amazed
by your performances at every round.

964
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,871
It's incredibly moving.

965
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,873
How could you possibly think

966
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:04,752
<i>of applying mother-of-pearl</i>
<i>to her face like that?</i>

967
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:09,798
I think you, Golden Hand in Paris,
are the kind of makeup artist

968
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,384
who can encapsulate the meaning and story

969
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,513
<i>in a single photoshoot,</i>

970
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:18,766
<i>expressing it in a coherent</i>
<i>and compelling way.</i>

971
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,103
I believe that's why
you can move people so deeply.

972
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:27,608
It looks like you calculated
all the angles beforehand.

973
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,526
Is that correct?

974
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:33,614
Yes. When we first came up
with the beauty cut layouts,

975
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:37,076
the reference suggested
a woman wearing a hat, covering one eye,

976
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:41,372
<i>creating a stern gaze</i>
<i>with a touch of solidity and warmth</i>

977
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,040
<i>with the single eye.</i>

978
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,960
I believed Ms. Ban could demonstrate

979
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:49,046
the potential
to express all those feelings.

980
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,756
Thank you for your comments.

981
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,092
Now, Judges, please make your decisions

982
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:56,637
and enter your last scores.

983
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,558
This is the last score you're entering.

984
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:04,812
Golden Hand in Paris,
whose score would you like to check first?

985
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,315
I pick RISABAE.

986
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:14,363
All right. Golden Hand in Paris
chose to see RISABAE's score.

987
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:19,326
All right. Please reveal
RISABAE's score now.

988
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,039
Is it 99 or 100?

989
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,166
They all did a great job.

990
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,293
Such a great job.

991
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,753
- This is hard.
- It is.

992
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,645
Did you choose RISABAE

993
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:49,857
because you knew
she'd give you a high score?

994
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,525
- Yes.
- I see.

995
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,863
"RISABAE would appreciate my makeup look."

996
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,657
No. Her eyes were...

997
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:00,367
Her eyes...

998
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,870
I saw her eyes sparkle.

999
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,998
I guess RISABAE
radiated energy with her eyes.

1000
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,876
She sent the energy of love
to Golden Hand in Paris.

1001
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:13,339
All right. With the scores
of one judge chosen by the contestants,

1002
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,550
Golden Hand in Paris took first place,

1003
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,053
though it doesn't mean anything
at this point.

1004
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,388
You may go back to your seat now.

1005
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:26,560
Thank you.

1006
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,729
Thank you.

1007
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:33,067
I'd like to thank the three actresses
who joined us today

1008
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,569
for the final mission, Dreams

1009
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,571
and showed us
such impressive performances.

1010
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:41,241
Thank you so much for your hard work.

1011
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:45,704
Please share your thoughts
on being with us today.

1012
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:49,083
I've been living for so long
that I got to do something amazing today.

1013
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,669
It was my first time
doing a face fashion show.

1014
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:52,586
A face fashion show?

1015
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:54,213
- A face fashion show?
- Yes, but...

1016
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,799
All three of these artists
were top performers today.

1017
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:00,636
It's impossible to rank them.

1018
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,429
You have to give all of them top honors.

1019
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,889
Okay.

1020
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,102
You're right about that.

1021
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,770
All three of them deserve top honors.

1022
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,481
But though they are all top performers,

1023
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,233
we still need to rank them.

1024
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:18,404
- All three of them deserve top honors.
- She's so strict.

1025
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:21,448
I don't know
if I'll ever get another chance like this,

1026
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:26,954
but today was the first time
I peeked into this world of makeup.

1027
00:53:26,995 --> 00:53:29,123
I have no doubt

1028
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,875
that I'm fortunate to have met
such a wonderful artist.

1029
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:33,460
- Thank you for your comment.
- Wait.

1030
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:36,964
Let me interject and offer some words
of encouragement to you two.

1031
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,300
You two are more than
five years younger than I am.

1032
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,429
There will be
many more opportunities ahead.

1033
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,471
Yes, of course.

1034
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,890
I hope the judges
took this into consideration.

1035
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,603
I'm overwhelmed.

1036
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:52,813
She's so funny.

1037
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,315
Ms. Kim emphasizes
that she's five years older

1038
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,650
than the other two.

1039
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:57,693
- It's a warning.
- She's lovely.

1040
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,903
But the judges are already done
entering their scores.

1041
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,030
Thank you so much
for your encouragement and support.

1042
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,866
Please get home safely. Thank you.

1043
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,493
- Thank you for your wonderful work.
- Thank you for your work.

1044
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,578
Thank you.

1045
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:09,872
- You worked so hard.
- It was nothing.

1046
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,541
I'll look forward to the good results.

1047
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,542
Thank you.

1048
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,378
Please get home safely. Thank you.

1049
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,132
Thank you for everything.

1050
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,722
It's been a short yet long journey.

1051
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:30,684
Now, all that's left
is to announce the final winner.

1052
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:34,980
I think all the makeup artists here
saw today's photos and thought,

1053
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,483
"I wish I could do that too.
I can do that too."

1054
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,234
You all probably felt this way.

1055
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,069
MACtist.

1056
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:44,031
I'm sure you felt this just as much,
if not more than anyone else.

1057
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,115
What did you think?

1058
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,660
I was already sent home,
so I haven't thought about it.

1059
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:53,540
I was actually swept up
by the perfect performance

1060
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,168
of the three artists today.

1061
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,337
They were so on point
that I thought I'd get cut.

1062
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:02,382
Thank you for your perfect performances.

1063
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,551
I appreciate the hard work
of all three artists.

1064
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,720
- Today's winner is...
- Are you the host?

1065
00:55:06,762 --> 00:55:08,722
MACtist, you're not the host here.

1066
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:11,600
I see. What I want is the host position.

1067
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,728
So, today's winner will be announced soon.

1068
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:15,979
Thank you.

1069
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,234
He's hilarious.

1070
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:21,902
All right.

1071
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,238
Now,

1072
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,865
we will announce

1073
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,576
the final rankings.

1074
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,957
Let's go!

1075
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,042
Who will win the 300 million won?

1076
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,001
I have no idea.

1077
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,254
- I really don't know.
- They all did a great job.

1078
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,173
It would be so great to win first place.

1079
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:44,716
My work on the cover of a magazine.

1080
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,636
I'm so curious, but at the same time,
I'm also feeling calm.

1081
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,764
<i>I really didn't think</i>
<i>I'd make it this far.</i>

1082
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:52,641
I gave it my all in every mission.

1083
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,101
I really want to win.

1084
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,438
<i>I was really nervous.</i>

1085
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,190
I don't know who will win.

1086
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,942
I'm the winner in my mind.

1087
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:06,113
Based on just one judge's score,

1088
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,949
Golden Hand in Paris is currently first,

1089
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,326
Oh Dolce Vita is second,

1090
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,203
and Detailed Hands is third.

1091
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:19,126
What changes will the scores
from the other judges bring?

1092
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:24,464
I'll now announce the final rankings.

1093
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,342
I'm really nervous.

1094
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:29,136
First...

1095
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:37,603
We will reveal Oh Dolce Vita's score.

1096
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:45,611
Now, Saem-mool's score
has already been revealed,

1097
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:47,821
as can be seen on the screen.

1098
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:53,243
So, what scores did the other judges
give Oh Dolce Vita?

1099
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:56,330
Please reveal

1100
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,374
Oh Dolce Vita's score.

1101
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,967
Seo Ok gave her 99 points.

1102
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,346
Seo Ok gave her 99 points.

1103
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,851
RISABAE gave her 99 points.

1104
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,478
That's really high.

1105
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,438
This is crazy.

1106
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:30,238
Jin-soo gave her 94 points.

1107
00:57:30,322 --> 00:57:34,743
She received a total of 389 points.

1108
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,872
- It's 389 points.
- It's 389 points. My goodness.

1109
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,084
It's 389 points out of 400.

1110
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:45,337
She received a very high score.

1111
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,631
All right. Next,

1112
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:51,510
we will reveal Detailed Hands' scores.

1113
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:55,555
Jin-soo gave her 96 points.

1114
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,516
So that was a high score for him.

1115
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,602
He gave Oh Dolce Vita 94 points.

1116
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,523
The difference
will only be a couple of points.

1117
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:09,945
How many points
did the other three judges give her?

1118
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,364
Please tell us.

1119
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,327
Please reveal
the other three judges' scores.

1120
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:26,336
The earlier score was 389 points.

1121
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,591
Saem-mool gave her 99 points.

1122
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,515
Seo Ok gave her 100 points.

1123
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,143
Seo Ok gave her 100 points.

1124
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,894
- What?
- That's unbelievably high.

1125
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:44,354
- It's really high.
- Yes.

1126
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:52,070
RISABAE gave her 98 points.

1127
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:57,117
So Detailed Hands received
a total of 393 points.

1128
00:58:58,952 --> 00:58:59,995
That's high.

1129
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:02,456
- My gosh. It's high.
- It's high. She won.

1130
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:08,295
Detailed Hands is currently
in first place.

1131
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,048
She might be the final winner.

1132
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,383
<i>I thought Detailed Hands would win.</i>

1133
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,635
<i>The scores were extremely high.</i>

1134
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,305
<i>I was suddenly feeling so nervous.</i>

1135
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,807
Unfortunately, Oh Dolce Vita

1136
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:24,061
is now one step away from winning.

1137
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,856
Based on Golden Hand in Paris's score,

1138
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,151
the long-awaited first winner
of JUST MAKEUP will be decided.

1139
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,863
What score will Golden Hand in Paris get?

1140
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,656
I can't wait to find out.

1141
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,075
I'm feeling nervous for them.

1142
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:39,743
Everyone, are you curious?

1143
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,286
- Yes.
- Yes.

1144
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,705
I'm feeling nervous too.

1145
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:44,915
All right.

1146
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:49,169
We will now reveal

1147
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:51,588
Golden Hand in Paris's score.

1148
00:59:52,047 --> 00:59:56,510
She's already received
100 points from RISABAE.

1149
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,886
What about the three judges' scores?

1150
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,598
Will she

1151
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,770
receive a score higher than 393 points?

1152
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:13,068
Please reveal the scores

1153
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,321
of the three judges.

1154
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,200
I'm feeling more nervous.

1155
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,661
<i>I was really nervous.</i>

1156
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,704
<i>I was trying to gather my thoughts.</i>

1157
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:32,087
Saem-mool gave her 99 points.

1158
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,256
It's down to the two judges.

1159
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,103
Seo Ok gave her 100 points.

1160
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:51,231

01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,835
Jin-soo gave her 97 points.

1164
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,963
- With a total score of 396 points,
- Congratulations.

1165
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,549
Golden Hand in Paris
has become the final winner.

1166
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:23,430
JUST MAKEUP
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS WINS

1167
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,265
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1168
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,058
- Congratulations.
- I didn't think I'd win.

1169
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,435
I knew you'd win.

1170
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,145
I knew you'd win.

1171
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,233
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

1172
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,528
- I feel like crying.
- I really feel like crying.

1173
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:48,413
They look so pretty.

1174
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:53,084
The final winner is Golden Hand in Paris.

1175
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,085
Congratulations.

1176
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,633
- She deserves it.
- Yes.

1177
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,426
Gosh, this is amazing.

1178
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:07,515
And now, she's won
the 300 million won prize money.

1179
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,517
Congratulations.

1180
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,188
Treat us to a meal!

1181
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,316
Golden Hand in Paris, how are you feeling?

1182
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:18,485
This will be your last speech.

1183
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:24,491
I've been living in France
for about 19 years now.

1184
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,701
It's been almost 20 years.

1185
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:30,497
And I'm working really hard in my own way.

1186
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:35,460
But many times, I hit a wall.

1187
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:37,754
Am I doing a good job?

1188
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,799
Or should I go back to Korea?

1189
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,676
I often think about these things.

1190
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:48,265
While preparing for this show,
I kept asking myself

1191
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:52,560
if I could ever regain the passion I had
when I first started makeup when I was 20.

1192
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,273
But as I did it,
I found it incredibly fun.

1193
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:59,776
I feel like I've opened
a new path for myself.

1194
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:01,903
Yes. That's it.

1195
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,323
I sincerely congratulate you.

1196
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,201
I'm more than satisfied.

1197
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,997
I never imagined I'd make it this far.

1198
01:03:12,664 --> 01:03:15,834
I'm glad I was able to grow.

1199
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,335
I've learned a lot.

1200
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:22,632
I thought that I'd die happy if I could
solely focus on makeup and nothing else,

1201
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:25,093
but this round almost killed me.

1202
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,432
I've been given
such a valuable opportunity,

1203
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:33,101
and I'm so happy to have met
so many people.

1204
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:37,230
I'm also happy to have met
the people I respect.

1205
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,231
Thank you.

1206
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,609
We're happy too. Thank you.

1207
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,654
I think we've all been
amazed at every turn

1208
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,448
through JUST MAKEUP.

1209
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:52,203
I hope the positive power of makeup
spreads far and wide.

1210
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:58,251
We at JUST MAKEUP will forever support
each and every makeup artist.

1211
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,046
Thank you for being with us.

1212
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:04,591
It's finished!

1213
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:07,469
- It's over!

01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,395
<i>There's no one in this world</i>
<i>who's exactly the same.</i>

1215
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:20,065
Making someone beautiful
is always exciting.

1216
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:25,653
Because my makeup makes them happy
and gives them confidence.

1217
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,783
"I feel like I've found myself,
not just had some makeup done."

1218
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:33,453
<i>I always keep that in mind.</i>

1219
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:38,958
<i>Everyone wants to be</i>
<i>the protagonist of their own lives.</i>

1220
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,044
How many jobs out there

1221
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:45,048
<i>can give someone</i>
<i>a day that feels like such a gift?</i>

1222
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,966
I'm not going to remove
this makeup tonight.

1223
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:51,137
I got the best makeup of my life.
I mean it.

1224
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,764
I don't want to remove it.

1225
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,225
It's so pretty
that I can't stop looking at it.

1226
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:59,479
In a way, you could say
it's a power that only makeup has.

1227
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,481
<i>When they're really happy.</i>

1228
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:05,443
<i>They love what they see in the mirror,</i>

1229
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,780
and they feel so happy all day long.

1230
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:10,156
<i>There are so many...</i>

1231
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,491
<i>I don't know why I'm crying.</i>

1232
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,076
So many touching moments like that.

1233
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,496
I'm happy that I can help others

1234
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:20,125
by making their struggles beautiful.

1235
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,668
<i>"You gave me happiness."</i>

1236
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:26,840
Seeing clients who feel so happy,
saying I made them happy with my makeup,

1237
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,218
I was really glad
that I became a makeup artist.

1238
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,638
<i>I think everything about this job</i>
<i>is really beautiful.</i>

1239
01:05:35,682 --> 01:05:38,685
And if you don't like the makeup,
you could just remove it.

1240
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:39,561
That's it.

1241
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:46,085
We ended on such a happy note.

1242
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,337
Thank you.

1243
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,049
Are you interested
in competing in Season Two?

1244
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:53,218
Should I compete in Season Two?
