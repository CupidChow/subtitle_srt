Congratulations.

25

It's okay.

26
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,162
TEAM DETAILED HANDS HAS BEEN ELIMINATED

27
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,956
We did a good job.

28
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,334
Judge Seo Ok.

29
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:27,838
Please tell us what made you choose
Team Golden Hand in Paris.

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,507
My initial judging criteria was to see

31
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,676
if the members' faces were expressed well,

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,846
highlighting their individual strengths,

33
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,848
in line with the performance theme.

34
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,144
<i>Overall, the makeup was well-defined.</i>

35
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,521
<i>The areas where the faces</i>
<i>should shine were radiant,</i>

36
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,565
<i>and the parts that should be shaded</i>
<i>seemed good too,</i>

37
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,693
<i>highlighting the handsome</i>
<i>and beautiful features</i>

38
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,238
<i>of all six members of TWS.</i>

39
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,868
It felt like their features were
displaying more clearly on the screen.

40
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,704
And it felt like the light shattered

41
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,874
<i>and fell on the members</i>

42
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,835
<i>as they moved under the dazzling lights.</i>

43
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:11,381
I thought they used a truly powerful kick.

44
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,924
Thank you.

45
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,552
Now to the winners,
Team Golden Hand in Paris.

46
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,263
Swag Maker is shedding tears now.

47
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,557
Are you all right?

48
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,312
You're not the final winner yet,
Swag Maker.

49
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,733
Golden Hand in Paris,
please tell us how you're feeling now.

50
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:33,320
I'm really grateful to my teammates
for believing in me.

51
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,905
This is crazy.

52
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,370
This was my first time
trying K-pop idol makeup.

53
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,999
We had a seven-hour time difference.

54
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:50,420
They helped me make good use
of the time difference.

55
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,632
They made up for what I was lacking.

56
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,551
I was so lucky to work
with people like them.

57
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,594
Stop crying.

58
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,721
I was very grateful for that.

59
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,265
Thank you so much. I mean it.

60
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,436
Why do I feel like crying?

61
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,938
Me too.

62
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,648
- I keep...
- We're...

63
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,024
We're relating to them.

64
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,444
I can tell they had great teamwork.

65
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,404
All right.

66
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,156
Unfortunately, Team Detailed Hands

67
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,034
has been eliminated.

68
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,245
<i>We did our best.</i>

69
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,788
And we're proud of each other.

70
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,541
There's no team
that's more perfect than us.

71
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,584
We were happy and had fun together.

72
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,294
That's all that matters.

73
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,754
Let's go eat some barbecue now!

74
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,716
I can't stop crying.

75
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:43,140
<i>I'm grateful to my teammates who chose me.</i>

76
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,017
<i>I also feel bad</i>
<i>that I had them practice so much.</i>

77
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,896
I was happy and learned a lot
while working on this mission.

78
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,527
I believe this round
was very meaningful to me.

Is it done?

107
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,471
Without a single hesitation.

108
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,723
I only wanted to work with him.

109
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,227
I considered MACtist a favorite to win.

110
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,604
I'm quite decisive. I have a good feeling.

111
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,272
We will survive.

112
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,567
<i>The people I wanted came to me.</i>

113
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,863
I did SUNMI's makeup
for about three years.

114
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,324
<i>I know how idols look on stage</i>

115
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,243
<i>and what areas need more focus.</i>

116
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,870
Yes, I'm confident in that area.

117
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,874
I used to specialize in stage makeup.

118
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,793
<i>Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room</i>

<i>so I wasn't worried at all.</i>

121
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,551
If I support them well
and this team is well-managed,

<i>I found it strange.</i>

126
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,689
<i>I couldn't attract as many members</i>
<i>as I expected.</i>

127
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,609
Does it seem like I've never done
female idols' makeup before?

128
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,735
Please join me.

129
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,240
They said they grew up watching me.

130
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,535
So why wouldn't they come to me
after saying all that?

131
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,496
<i>Other teams had already formed.</i>

132
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,039
I can do this.

133
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,916
You worked on an idol
in the previous round, right?

134
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:15,917
Do you want to join me?

<i>So Makeup Model Student and I</i>

00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:26,303
<i>went to MACtist.</i>

140
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,139
- Do you have your team already?
-Yes.

141
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,682
I'm a loyal person,

142
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,310
so if you all come to me like this...

143
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,770
I guess the four of you are together.

144
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,274
He said he'd go with the three people

145
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,401
who approached him first.

146
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,403
Then we will...

147
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,031
- Thank you.
- Not everyone can be

148
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,116
on a team with people they want.

149
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,702
- I think we'll have good teamwork.
- Why?

150
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,663
I felt like our team was made up of people

151
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:56,499
who weren't accepted by others.

152
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,169
We were like members of a B team.

153
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,047
But the more I learned about them...

154
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,383
<i>I worked on BTS's makeup team</i>

155
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,761
<i>for about four years.</i>

156
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,680
<i>I worked on the music video</i>

157
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,349
<i>for "on the street" by j-hope.</i>

158
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,975
<i>And also "Dreamers" by Jung Kook.</i>

159
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,019
<i>I also worked on the makeup</i>
<i>for the music video</i>

160
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,314
<i>and photoshoots for "Butter" by BTS.</i>

161
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:24,277
I worked on the male idol
audition show <i>Fantasy Boys</i>.

162
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,237
And also on NCT's photoshoots.

163
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,031
When I was a junior staff member,

164
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,034
<i>I worked on a lot of TV music shows.</i>

165
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,536
It feels like a team

166
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,207
<i>made up of elite members</i>
<i>optimized for this mission.</i>

167
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,043
AFTER THE REHEARSAL
I have one last request

168
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,795
for our team members.

169
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,130
What I'm looking for is...

170
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:45,757
TEAM MACTIST'S WAITING ROOM

171
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,635
It should be clear, refreshing, and...

172
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,554
TEAM FIRST MAN

173
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,556
We want them to look bubbly, right?

174
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,228
So, I'll show you what I want to emphasize
with some images.

175
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,855
Because other teams might overhear.

176
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,566
- Hello.
- Hello.

177
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,609

<i>We have to keep it a secret.</i>

179
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,408
<i>This is a competition, after all.</i>

TEAM FIRST MAN'S WAITING ROOM

181
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,494
Should we put this down?

182
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,918
It's a little...

183
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,379
- We should block it completely.
- For example...

184
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,798
- The makeup itself...
- Quietly.

185
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,050
- They might hear us.
- The makeup itself...

186
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,928
We're here to win.

187
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,763
That's a given.

188
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,267
My teammates and I will never go home.

189
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,601
We won't.

190
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,106
STAYC STAGE
TEAM MACTIST VS TEAM FIRST MAN

191
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,108
TEAM MACTIST'S BACKSTAGE
All right. Shall we begin?

192
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,193
- Am I here?
- Will you attach it?

193
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,654
When they sit here...

194
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,948
All right. That's good.

195
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,619
<i>To avoid confusion on site,</i>

196
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,621
<i>we prepared the face charts.</i>

197
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,040
<i>Along with the face charts...</i>

198
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,126
<i>We put all the products in acrylic boxes</i>

199
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,919
<i>so that we could carry them around</i>

200
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>whenever we moved to another member.</i>

201
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,508
TEAM FIRST MAN'S BACKSTAGE
Do you see this?

202
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,303
<i>Although we work as a team,</i>

203
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,139
<i>it should be consistent</i>
<i>as if it were done by one artist.</i>

204
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,976
<i>So we should at least share</i>
<i>the same products.</i>

205
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,771
<i>Each team member will use products</i>

206
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,648
<i>of the same colors and textures.</i>

207
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,902
- They portioned them all out.
- Right?

208
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,988
- Hello.
- Hello.

209
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,616
- Hello.
- Hello.

210
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,451
- Hello.
- Hello.

211
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,496
- Hello.
- Hello.

212
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,165
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

213
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,919
So that's how we'll look? That's so cool.

214
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,674
2 HOURS LEFT UNTIL STANDBY

215
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,843
Maybe we should shout our motto
before we start.

216
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:54,761
Good idea.

217
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,721
- Makeup is all about spirit!
- Makeup is all about spirit!

218
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,680
Spirit!

219
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,766
- It's all about spirit!
- Spirit!

220
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,268
- So is that how I'll look?
- Yes.

221
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,020
Cute and fresh.

222
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,189
I like that.

223
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,359
The theme of our makeup...

224
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,195
is "Sunny Flex."

225
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,280
Flexing with a lot of sparkly things.

226
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,991
STAYC'S MISSION SONG
"FLEXING ON MY EX"

227
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,536
A REFRESHING TEEN-POP SONG
ABOUT MOVING ON FROM AN EX

228
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,663
STAYC PERFORMS THE SONG CHEERFULLY
WITH THEIR OWN SENSIBILITY

229
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,373
This is what the lyrics say.

230
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:26,209
"Even though we broke up, I'll get over it

231
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,086
and move on with my life."

232
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,713
I WON'T SUFFER BECAUSE OF YOU
I FEEL RELIEVED

233
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:35,009
We want to express the sense of
confident self-expression in this song.

234
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:39,264
<i>We will use citrus-based colors</i>
<i>with variations for the eye makeup.</i>

235
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:43,101
We're trying to highlight
each member's unique characteristics.

236
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,146
The color variations vary for each member.

237
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,398
<i>For Yoon, we used lime green</i>

238
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,068
<i>and apricot colors on her eyes.</i>

239
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,487
<i>For Sieun,</i>

240
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:59,325
<i>we used pink with a hint of lavender.</i>

241
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,579
<i>For Sumin, we used yellow.</i>

242
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,249
<i>We spiced it up a little</i>
<i>with some yellow on her bangs as well.</i>

243
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,795
<i>We used blue and lavender for ISA.</i>

244
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,173
<i>We mixed the two colors on her eyes.</i>

245
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:17,218
<i>For J, we used pink, purple,</i>
<i>and blue mixed together.</i>

246
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,929
<i>And we used coral for Seeun.</i>

247
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,683
Your skin will look transparent on stage.

248
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:26,394
And we'll use some glitter products.

249
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,898
The glitter will show your inner glow
and transformation.

250
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,191
- I totally understand.
- All right.

251
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,984
Do you think it suits the song?

252
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,028
- Yes.
- We've done a lot of research.

253
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,615
What's so funny? It's good manners.

254
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,117
TEAM FIRST MAN'S BACKSTAGE

255
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,328
What kind of makeup would it be?

256
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,873
The song is about youth
and breakups, right?

257
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,666
- Yes.
- So...

258
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,543
Our theme is "Free Again."

259
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,213
It's about finding your freedom again.

260
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,465
FREE AGAIN
FINDING MY OWN LIGHT

261
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,468
The song says
that I'll be fine even without you.

262
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,637
So I think it should be bright.

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,472
While it's bright and colorful,
it should be somewhat dreamy.

264
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,015
- That's spot on.
- I agree.

265
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,476
- That's a good point.
- Right.

266
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,479
<i>Like freedom that comes after a breakup.</i>

267
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,398
But at the same time, you could have

268
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,150
some lingering emotions.

269
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,236
To express those feelings,

270
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>we decided to use colors</i>
<i>that could feel a bit nostalgic.</i>

271
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,783
What's that?

272
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,660
This? It's for the cheeks.

273
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,373
<i>These days,</i>
<i>people use the word "lukewarm."</i>

274
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,001
<i>We used lukewarm rose and coral colors</i>

275
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,128
<i>with the beauty of restraint.</i>

276
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,673
<i>We made sure</i>
<i>their facial features looked beautiful</i>

277
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,508
<i>when seen in person on stage.</i>

278
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:43,179
<i>The colors we're trying to express</i>

279
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,181
<i>should never be too glossy.</i>

280
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,185
Our team will go
with a soft and smooth texture.

281
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,146
- The mood will be completely different.
- Right.

282
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,400
It's the complete opposite.

283
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,986
TEAM MACTIST'S BACKSTAGE
Everyone, it's been an hour!

284
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,990
How far along is everyone?

285
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,700
What's left to do now?

286
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,536
- Captain, please check on Sieun.
- Okay.

287
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,455
<i>The most important part was</i>

288
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,082
<i>expressing their sparkling moments</i>

289
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,294
<i>with glitter and highlighter.</i>

290
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,921
We wanted them to look

291
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,216
<i>more radiant and sparkly</i>
<i>under the stage lights.</i>

292
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,970
<i>We used various products,</i>
<i>textures, and densities</i>

293
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,056
<i>so they would look attractive</i>
<i>from all angles</i>

294
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,350
<i>with well-defined face lines</i>
<i>and smooth skin.</i>

295
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,519
- Where should I move on to?
- There.

296
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,147
- Me.
- Hello.

297
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,898
Our captain is busy.

298
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,152
I think our captain is an amazing person.

299
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,071
<i>While leading a lot of things,</i>

300
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,781
<i>he assigned roles to each of us.</i>

301
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,450
- You can connect them.
- Okay.

302
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>He's someone our team members can rely on.</i>

303
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:53,583
<i>MACtist took care of</i>
<i>all the final touches.</i>

304
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,336
<i>That way, the colors will be consistent,</i>

305
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,088
<i>and the overall balance will look like</i>

306
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,882
<i>it was done by one person.</i>

307
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,176
Okay, it's done!

308
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,385
Thank you.

309
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,597
TEAM FIRST MAN'S BACKSTAGE

310
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,893
Come here. Take a look.

311
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,104
- Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,611
I think the line could be a little longer.

313
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,779
- Longer than that?
- Yes.

314
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,074
And a little more emphasis
on the under-eye area

315
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,368
- and the lower eyelid.
- More outstanding? Okay.

316
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,662
She has extensive experience
with idol makeup.

317
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,997
Really?

318
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,749
So I should listen to her.

319
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,461
Back in the day, I worked with...

320
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,463
Girls' Generation.

321
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,342
- Really?
- I did their makeup.

322
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,345
- And I mostly worked with actresses.
- I see.

323
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,222
When it comes to makeup,

324
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,391
- it's not just about skills.
- Right.

325
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,143
There are trends, you know?

326
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,729
So I should listen to the experienced ones

327
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,189
like her.

328
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,651
<i>He was the most experienced among us,</i>

329
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,654
<i>so he could've taken care of</i>
<i>everything on his own.</i>

330
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,324
Feel free to touch up a bit more
after I'm done when you do the lashes.

331
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,159
- Okay?
- All right.

332
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,995
He gathered opinions
from his team members well.

333
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,581
The overall makeup is quite subtle,

334
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,209
so it'd be nice to add
teardrop parts here, right?

335
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,086
Let's put them on.

336
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,131
<i>We designed it</i>
<i>in long, linear shapes</i>

337
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,551
<i>to convey a nostalgic feeling.</i>

338
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,223
<i>The feeling of a teardrop</i>

339
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,809
falling and sparkling like a star.

340
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,978
It's pretty.

341
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,440
I'm complimenting myself.

342
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,652
<i>ISA has well-defined facial features.</i>

343
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,905
So, instead of adding things to her face,

344
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,075
<i>we did her ear like an ear cuff.</i>

345
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,163
<i>We made variations this way</i>
<i>so that they'd look different yet similar.</i>

346
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,541
This is cute.

347
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,544
<i>For J, we put a butterfly on her nose</i>

348
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,130
<i>so it would stand out in the center.</i>

349
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,215
Does this part have any significance?

350
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,051
The song says,
"I will be fine even without you."

351
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,554
This butterfly means she can fly away.

352
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,306
It's something like that.

353
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,726
You've finished her lips
with a matte finish.

354
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,436
Some members have glossy lips,

355
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,188
and others have matte lips.

356
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,189
Why is that?

357
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,610
We prioritized doing makeup
that suits each member.

358
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,737
She has a beautiful smile,

359
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,281
so her lips stand out when you see her.

360
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,366
If her lips were glossy,
it might stand out too much.

361
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,244
So we thought a matte finish
would be the better choice.

362
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,789
TEAM MACTIST'S BACKSTAGE
Captain. The captain of this boat.

363
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,417
Each member has their glitter

364
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:43,085
placed in a different position.

365
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,464
The makeup was tailored to their outfits.

366
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,425
- Their outfits?
- We checked the images first

367
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,885
and then came up with the makeup.

368
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,428
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

369
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,723
You have ten minutes left.

370
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:56,807
10 MINUTES LEFT UNTIL STANDBY

371
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,935
- Do you have anything left to do?
- What?

372
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,270
No, I'm wrapping up.

373
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,772
- Are you done?
- Yes.

374
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,650
A little... No.

375
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,276
Her skin looks a little powdery alone.

376
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,779
- Why don't we make her lips glossy?
- Sounds good.

377
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,698
- I'll add something moist to her lips.
- Okay.

378
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:16,786
- I think this is better.
- Right?

379
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,913
- This looks better than before.
- Yes.

380
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,123
You need to wrap things up now.

381
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,000
What?

382
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,797
Did you add the gloss on purpose?

383
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,966
- I didn't do that.
- Who did?

384
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,635
I did a matte finish on purpose.
Who changed it?

385
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,475
Did you put the gloss on her lips?

386
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,269
- Yes.
- I didn't do it on purpose.

387
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,397
Really? Actually, Makeup Trendsetter did.

388
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,818
She thought her face looked a little dry.

389
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,656
<i>I had my reasons</i>
<i>for going with a matte finish.</i>

390
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,661
About how you put the gloss on her.

391
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,080
We will go back to a matte finish.

392
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,332
Okay. No problem.

393
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,961
<i>I just wanted to make things better.</i>

394
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,922
But this is where things can go awry.

395
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,801
Stand by, everyone!

396
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,431
Do you like the finish?

397
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,224
Her lips look fine, right?

398
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,518
Are any of you not done
with the body makeup?

399
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,645
I fixed the eyeliner a little.

400
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:31,193
I wonder how the glitter
on their faces will look.

401
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,237
- We'll be moving to the stage now.
- Okay.

402
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,531
- The skin is a little...
- It's okay. It looks good.

403
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,283
- It's not bad.
- You think?

404
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,036
STAYC'S STAGE MAKEUP IS READY

405
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,246
This is the K-pop Stage team mission.

406
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,374
We will now have STAYC's first performance

407
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,585
with the makeup done by Team MACtist.

408
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,339
Let's take a look at what theme

409
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,215
Team MACtist went with for STAYC.

410
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,676
- I'll do the lip makeup again.
- Put it on again.

411
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,219
Your makeup looks nice.

412
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,512
One more touch on your nose.

413
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,681
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

414
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,934
- Wish us good luck.
- Light the stage on fire.

415
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,395
It's okay to use all your energy.

416
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,898
I'm feeling nervous.

417
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,941
- I know.
- Right?

418
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,737
STAYC, please come on out.

419
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,534
Good luck!

420
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,296
They're really excited.

421
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,051
- The colors.
- The colors look great.

422
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,595
- Hello, we're STAYC.
- Hello, we're STAYC.

423
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,265
"Flexing on My Ex" by STAYC.

424
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,935
Here's Team MACtist's version.

425
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:53,234
They're sparkly.

426
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,196
It's perfect.

427
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,874
The glassy look

428
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,835
is intense.

429
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,591
It's more colorful than I thought.

430
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,844
They used a lot of pearl products.

431
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,303
The pearl stands out a lot.

432
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,142
SUNNY FLEX BY TEAM MACTIST

433
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,310
EXPRESSING POSITIVE
AND SELF-CENTERED ENERGY

434
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,146
WITH THE ACT OF FLEXING SHININESS

435
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,941
EACH MEMBER WEARS A COLOR
THAT MATCHES THEIR MOOD,

436
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,987
PROJECTING A CONFIDENT SELF

437
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,073
STYLED WITH A Y2K PREPPY LOOK
WITH POP COLORS

438
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:44,785
TO MATCH THE COLORFUL MAKEUP

439
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,871
You are all judges now,

440
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,415
so please take a detailed look
and evaluate accordingly.

441
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,668
- My dolls.
- We can see the glitter well.

442
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,380
All right. STAYC's performance begins now.

443
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:09,059
TEAM MACTIST'S VERSION

444
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,707
I think it fits the song perfectly.

445
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,229
They're so pretty.

446
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,897
It's perfect with their outfits.

447
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:13,874
<i>- You're an eraser in my head</i>
<i>- You're an eraser in my head</i>

448
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,939
They're so lovely.

449
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,898
So pretty.

450
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,941
Thanks to you guys,

451
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,734
- I got to do something pretty!
- So pretty!

452
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,250
It looks a little too much.

453
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,127
I think it's quite daring.

454
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,088
If the judges like it,
it'll be a big plus.

455
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,144
I have a good feeling.

456
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,687
Yes. It feels good.

457
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,023
I have a good feeling.
That's why I'm being like this.

458
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,567
I think it's quite daring.

459
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,235
- The theme.
- Yes. It's bold.

460
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,195
- Right.
- Exactly.

461
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,696
Because those colors are a hit or miss.

462
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:08,572
- I think so.
- Right.

463
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:12,034
The team that created
the first version of STAYC's performance.

464
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,704
Team MACtist, please come up on stage.

465
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,376
Please welcome them
with a round of applause.

466
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,169
This is Team MACtist.

467
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:30,094
We're Team MACtist, who elevate
the aesthetics of detail through art.

468
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,053
Nice to meet you.

469
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:37,518
This is what we wanted to show
with this makeup look.

470
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,186
For the eyes,

471
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,523
we chose the pastel colors

472
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,568
that would match each member.

473
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:50,114
We made sure each member would stand out.

474
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:55,244
And the shimmer, glitter, and highlighter
applied to the faces

475
00:24:55,285 --> 00:25:00,541
should be considered
a sparkle and a will to envision

476
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,793
a better tomorrow.

477
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,629
Our look isn't just an image.

478
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,090
It is a work with a story.

479
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,342
Please remember that.

480
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,594
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

481
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,806
I'm really curious to hear
what the judges think.

482
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,433
Judge Seo Ok.

483
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,269
I believe you would have
evaluated it more carefully.

484
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes, I tried to look at
everything very closely.

485
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,152
The members' expressions
were so cute and adorable

486
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,739
- that I actually lost focus for a moment.
- I see.

487
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,909
But it is certain that this look,
the members' performance,

488
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,747
and this makeup really shone on stage.

489
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,415
Yes, I see.

490
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,044
Team MACtist, is there anything
you want to say to the fans?

491
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:48,964
Thank you all so much for coming

492
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,633
to this thrilling event.

493
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,302
You must've come a long way.

494
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,387
Please help us just this once.

495
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,807
I don't want to go home.

496
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,642
He said his thoughts out loud.

497
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,436
He sounds so desperate.

498
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:05,814
SWITH, this was the stage
created by Team MACtist.

499
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,649
Please make sure to remember it.

500
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,651
They might like it because it was new.

501
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,195
- Right.
- Or just because they were pretty.

502
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,947
They might not like it
because it was too daring.

503
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,282
- Right.
- They're fans.

504
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,367
- Fans of STAYC might not like it.
- Right.

505
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,827
It was too different.

506
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,996
I think we have an advantage.

507
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,539
- I'm getting excited.
- Me too.

508
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,418
I think we will have to see

509
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,504
both performances
to make a clear comparison.

510
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,176
We will now begin the second performance.

511
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,678
I'm looking forward to seeing

512
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,056
how STAYC will look this time.

513
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,767
I'll make your lips a little less glossy.

514
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,440
Please check this part.

515
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,441
A little on here.

516
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,986
Please come over here once you're ready.

517
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,739
Take it easy.

518
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:56,990
Save your energy.

519
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,368
This is Team First Man's look.

520
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,870
STAYC, please come up on stage again.

521
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,206
You look gorgeous.

522
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,959
Good luck!

523
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,086
Can we watch it there?

524
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,505
We have to watch it.

525
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,395
"Flexing On My Ex" by STAYC.

526
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,689
This is Team First Man's version.

527
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,907
They look pretty.

528
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,369
They look totally different.

529
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:52,045
It feels good. A good feeling.

530
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,589
- A good feeling.
- They look pretty

531
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,007
- with the makeup on.
- They're pretty.

532
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,009
- The key points.
- It's neat.

533
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,433
FREE AGAIN BY TEAM FIRST MAN

534
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,602
A THEME THAT CAPTURES
THE MATURITY OF YOUTH

535
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,021
BLOSSOMING THROUGH FREEDOM
AFTER THE PAIN OF LOVE

536
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,774
THE PAIN OF BREAKUP IS EXPRESSED
THROUGH MUTED COLORS,

537
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:16,904
WHILE THE BRILLIANCE OF YOUTH
IS EXPRESSED THROUGH GEMS

538
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:20,949
A HIPPIE LOOK CREATED
BY MIXING IVORY, THE COLOR OF PURITY,

539
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:25,078
AND DENIM, WHICH SYMBOLIZES YOUTH

540
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,372
I think their theme is fairies.

541
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,582
- I think so.
- With white.

542
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,167
It's okay. There's no fairy.

543
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,376
I'm the only fairy here.

544
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,212
Please be careful with such remarks.

545
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,130
I'm very sensitive right now.

546
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,760
- This is crazy.
- They look totally different.

547
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,428
This is a lot prettier.

548
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,556
Team First Man's version
of "Flexing On My Ex."

549
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,975
STAYC's performance begins now.

550
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:58,403
TEAM FIRST MAN'S VERSION

551
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,550
- The butterfly looks so cute.
- I know.

552
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:23,845
They used gems.

553
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:24,972
They tried hard.

554
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,950
She's a human rose.

555
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,077
Sumin looks so cute and fresh.

556
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,829
What did you just say?

557
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,372
I'm sorry.

558
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,693
The skin is well-pressed,
giving it a beautiful glow.

559
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,709
I just caught a glimpse of her hand,
and it looked pretty.

560
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,886
They're pretty.

561
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,974
They're so pretty and...

562
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,395
- How pretty.
- They're so pretty.

563
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,771
- They were lovely.
- How pretty.

564
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,023
They look totally different from ours.

565
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:44,152
Team First Man created
the second look of STAYC.

566
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:47,155
Hello. We're Team First Man.

567
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,116
Nice to meet you.

568
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,415
When we meet someone,
we end up parting ways.

569
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,668
- That's right.
- Yes.

570
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,546
"Even though my heart aches,

571
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,465
I've decided to love myself more

572
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:08,969
and continue on my own path."
This is the theme of our look.

573
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:13,306
Rose and coral colors
represent pure and delicate love.

574
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:18,520
Muted and faded colors
represent the feelings of parting.

575
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,816
And the glittering gems on their faces

576
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:27,446
express the journey of growth
and finding their own light.

577
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,531
With a different theme,

578
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,700
different members stand out.

579
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,535
- Did you feel the same way?
- Yes.

580
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:37,706
Do any of you think
this look suits you better?

581
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,667
Depending on how I answer...

582
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,794
- They're watching backstage.
- They're watching.

583
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,547
- No.
- They can't answer that.

584
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,758
Because they're watching?
I'm just asking about your taste.

585
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,386
Can you still not say anything?

586
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,599
You know, we're known to be a group

587
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,101
who can pull off

588
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:00,520
- any theme, so...
- I see.

589
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,189
I believe they both look good on us.

590
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,232
You're very well-trained.

591
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,068
She's so wise.

592
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,948
I'm really curious to hear
what the judges thought.

593
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:14,367
This song conveys many different emotions.

594
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,829
I think each member portrayed
those emotions well,

595
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,290
tailored to their individual charms.

596
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,751
Some members had a more melancholic look

597
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,587
that highlighted their sadness.

598
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,756
And others showed

599
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,091
a sense of freedom
and a sense of recovery.

600
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:33,428
Everyone had their own
unique style and feel,

601
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,264
but I think it all came together
like one song. I liked it.

602
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,933
Thank you.

603
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:40,936
Team First Man.

604
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,021
Please say a word to SWITH,

605
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,273
who will evaluate your look.

606
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:49,402
Our main theme was light.

607
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,487
Do you know why?

608
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,281
You all are in your youth now, right?

609
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,284
We've captured
the radiant moment of youth,

610
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,496
beautifully portraying it

611
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,082
in a way that suits STAYC.

612
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,376
Please vote for us. Thank you.

613
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,794
All right.

614
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,130
Please keep in mind

615
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:12,300
STAYC's performance
created by Team First Man.

616
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,221
Who will the fans choose?

617
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,806
Please don't forget about us.

618
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,351
Please vote for us.

619
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,688
<i>Today's result will be based on</i>
<i>the four votes from the judges</i>

620
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,941
<i>and the votes</i>
<i>from the 100 special fan judges,</i>

621
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,568
<i>which count as one vote.</i>

622
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,696
The first team

623
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:36,575
<i>focused heavily on the skin and colors,</i>

624
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,994
<i>while the second team focused</i>

625
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,912
<i>on the contour of faces</i>

626
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,998
- with some points to stand out.
- Right.

627
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:47,335
TEAM MACTIST, TEAM FIRST MAN

628
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,131
TEAM MACTIST, TEAM FIRST MAN

629
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,926
TEAM MACTIST, TEAM FIRST MAN

630
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,514
TEAM MACTIST, TEAM FIRST MAN

631
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:03,685
TEAM MACTIST, TEAM FIRST MAN

632
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,189
TEAM MACTIST, TEAM FIRST MAN

633
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,358
THE FANS HAVE VOTED FOR STAYC'S STAGE

634
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,737
STAYC performed
with two different looks today.

635
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,322
I wonder how they liked it.

636
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:20,660
First, what really impressed us
while getting our makeup done

637
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,954
by these eight artists

638
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,831
was that they listened to our songs

639
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:27,250
and watched our videos a lot,

640
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:30,045
meticulously selecting the right look

641
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:32,672
for each one of us.

642
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:35,216
I found it very touching.

643
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,346
"Flexing On My Ex" is a song
beloved by fans.

644
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,765
I'd like to thank them

645
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,517
for making both performances so beautiful.

646
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,935
Thank you so much.

647
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,066
Between Team MACtist and Team First Man,

648
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,569
which team has gotten more votes?

649
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,657
We will now reveal
the special judges' decision first.

650
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,827
The time has finally come.

651
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,623
Oh, my goodness. I'm so nervous.

652
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,916
Seriously.

653
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,584
Same here.

654
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,007
The special judges' decision

655
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,634
will now be revealed.

656
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,428
TEAM FIRST MAN

657
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,264
The fans have voted

658
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,517
- for Team First Man.
- We got it?

659
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,647
Yes. They received one vote

660
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,357
out of five first.

661
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,444
Which team
did the four judges choose then?

662
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:40,657
Saem-mool, please reveal your choice.

663
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,503
TEAM FIRST MAN

664
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:58,425
Saem-mool has chosen Team First Man.

665
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,512
Saem-mool has chosen Team First Man.

666
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,601
Team First Man has won two votes.

667
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,271
If even one of the remaining judges

668
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,064
chooses Team First Man,

669
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,942
Team First Man will win.

670
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,655
Next is Seo Ok.

671
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,323
Please show us.

672
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:30,165
<i>As the captain,</i>
<i>I promised to take responsibility</i>

673
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,833
<i>for my team members,</i>

674
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,460
<i>so I don't know</i>
<i>what I should do with this.</i>

675
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,337
I hope we will get all the votes.

676
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,505
That would be great.

677
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,142
TEAM FIRST MAN

678
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:55,023
Seo Ok has also chosen Team First Man.

679
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:59,194
Now, even if the remaining two judges

680
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,279
have chosen Team MACtist,

681
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,032
Team First Man will still win.

682
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,367
The result has already been decided.

683
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,495
Still, we will check the results

684
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,079
of the remaining two judges.

685
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,873
Please show us the results.

686
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,041
TEAM FIRST MAN

687
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,959
Okay. With a score of 5 to 0,

688
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,711
Team First Man wins

689
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,464
- by a landslide.
- Thank you.

690
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,924
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

691
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,342
Thank you.

692
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,887
Team MACtist.

693
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:29,224
Unfortunately, all members
have been eliminated.

694
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,476
Before the two teams' performances began,

695
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,978
we all watched the rehearsal together.

696
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,314
<i>Even before the makeup,</i>

697
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,317
<i>their faces were already glowing.</i>

698
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:41,778
<i>I thought that too much gloss</i>

699
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,863
<i>wouldn't work well</i>

700
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,907
<i>under such lighting.</i>

701
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,826
<i>Team First Man used</i>

702
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:50,411
<i>a semi-matte skin tone as a base</i>

703
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,456
<i>to create a very well-defined look.</i>

704
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,376
And each member had the right hairstyle.

705
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,921
<i>The members with short hair</i>
<i>also got long hair to match the theme.</i>

706
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,757
<i>I thought the combination of the gems</i>

707
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,593
<i>was well-balanced and harmonious,</i>

708
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,388
while still highlighting

709
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,474
each member's individuality.

710
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:15,103
When I looked at Team MACtist's makeup,

711
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,771
<i>I noticed too many excellent techniques</i>

712
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:19,107
<i>applied to just one face.</i>

713
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,610
<i>The color diversity was what I expected,</i>

714
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,404
<i>and the expectation was met,</i>

715
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,698
but I felt a bit disappointed

716
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,284
that some parts seemed

717
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,828
a bit excessive in a way.

718
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:36,291
Here's how we evaluated

719
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,167
Team MACtist's look.

720
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:42,630
We honestly felt their courage
in being so bold

721
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,883
in a survival show.

722
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:47,010
They could have gone

723
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,304
with something more subtle and beautiful.

724
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,140
The fact that they chose to do so

725
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,268
is a testament to their artistry.

726
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,103
I respect that.

727
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,230
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

728
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,776
I believe our team worked really hard.

729
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:07,405
<i>I'm so grateful to our captain</i>
<i>for his dedication</i>

730
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,699
<i>to keeping us happy until the very end.</i>

731
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,249
A weight's been lifted off my chest.

732
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,713
Thanks to my three teammates,

733
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,507
I was really happy.

734
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,344
Good work.

735
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,137
- You worked so hard.
- Thank you.

736
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,931
- Well done.
- Good job.

737
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,849
Everyone worked so hard.

738
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,435
K-POP STAGE ROUND IS OVER

739
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,772
<i>- Is it over?</i>
<i>- We've been eliminated for good now.</i>

740
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,153
<i>What is this rattling sound?</i>

741
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,199
What?

742
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,534
- Come on.
- Oh, my god.

743
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,371
What are they doing to us now?

744
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,830
What are you doing to us?

745
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,541
I knew it.

746
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,170
One, two, three, four, five, six...

747
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,632
There are eight of them.
I guess we're doing something.

748
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,886
You must be wondering why
you have been gathered here.

749
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,224
In Round Three, eight contestants passed,

750
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,309
and eight contestants were eliminated.

751
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,313
And the number of contestants
who will be competing in Round Four

752
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,190
is ten.

753
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:28,528
I see. Two of them will survive.

754
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,029
Two contestants.

755
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,698
REDEMPTION ROUND
That's tough.

756
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,241
This is really tough.

757
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,536
We've been so close,

758
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,038
<i>but we're suddenly becoming</i>
<i>enemies again now.</i>

759
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,374
<i>We will have to do makeup again.</i>

760
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,419
<i>And it's not like</i>
<i>all our team members can survive.</i>

761
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:46,587
This is so cruel.

762
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:52,176
The theme of the redemption round
is "Last Touch, My Last Feelings."

763
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,472
These are the models who will be with you
through what could be your last moments.

764
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,599
Please bring them in.

765
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,061
What?

766
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,148
Seriously?

767
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,158
What?

768
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,285
- Unbelievable.
- No way.

769
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,955
How are you feeling
looking at the models now?

770
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,500
Don't you think
they look somewhat familiar?

771
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:27,295
Never Dead Queen?

772
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,839
You're me.

773
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,091
Oh, it's themselves.

774
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,968
They're imitating them.

775
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:35,303
Unbelievable.

776
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,973
Yes. The models are here
dressed exactly like how you looked

777
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,433
when you first

778
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,188
appeared on our show<i>.</i>

779
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,231
My goodness.

780
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:49,567
Are they putting makeup on themselves?

781
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,905
- Right. That's how she appeared.
- Right?

782
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,823
I see.

783
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,159
I see. That's right.

784
00:42:58,826 --> 00:42:59,744
I got goosebumps.

785
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,126
I just got chills.

786
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,420
<i>I was jealous.</i>

787
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,923
<i>The model was tall and pretty.</i>

788
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,593
<i>How could they think of such a thing?</i>

789
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,680
<i>I thought it would be fun to express</i>

790
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:23,267
my current emotional state on a model

791
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,561
who recreated my appearance.

792
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,023
They could've been my model.

793
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,694
The theme of the redemption round
is "Last Touch."

794
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:37,365
I will reveal the mission now.

795
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,118
What are they going to use though?

796
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,327
They don't have any products.

797
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,329
I see something over there.

798
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,580
- Really?
- Really?

799
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,707
- There's something.
- What is it?

800
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,293
- I knew it!
- Of course!

801
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,546
- What is it?
- I knew it!

802
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,214
Of course!

803
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,300
It's HERA.

804
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,597
I think they're using lipsticks
without any base makeup.

805
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,432
Only with the products here?

806
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,851
Last Touch.

807
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,854
What you need
for a finishing touch is lipstick.

808
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:12,275
We have a variety of lipsticks
with different colors and textures here.

809
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,570
The contestants,
who may be eliminated here,

810
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,907
will have to complete their looks
using only lipstick.

811
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,492
Only lipstick?

812
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,998
With no mascara or brow products?

813
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,251
The Sensual lip product line itself

814
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:33,171
has a machine that can create

815
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:36,382
2 formulas with 145 colors.

816
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:40,094
So, I think it's best
to first evaluate the formulas

817
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:43,431
and try all the colors available

818
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,767
before trying something new and creative.

819
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,437
I believe that would be a better approach.

820
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,356
The time limit for the redemption round

821
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,735
which will determine your fate,
is 60 minutes.

822
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,237
The redemption round begins now.

823
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,697
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

824
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,032
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

825
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,284
- Please hurry.
- You can do this!

826
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:08,956
Can we try it on?

827
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,292
Are these the matte ones?

828
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,002
I should take as many as I can.

829
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,087
How I'm feeling right now?

830
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:17,965
They'd be shocked if they found out
how I'm feeling right now.

831
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,511
What you bring will matter.

832
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,513
Right. You need to be quick.

833
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:29,477
My gosh. I think I'll be going home.

834
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,772
What is happening?

835
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,650
I don't know what is happening.

836
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,111
I'm wearing two pairs of glasses.
I'm out of my mind.

837
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:47,078
Why is the director not moving?

838
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:54,126
<i>I'm not a person with a quick wit.</i>

839
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,213
I tend to think a lot
before making any moves.

840
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,007
<i>I needed some time to think,</i>
<i>so I cleaned up my spot first.</i>

841
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,552
<i>And First Man on the other side said...</i>

842
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,554
Director Woo.

843
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,181
- Yes?
- You should hurry and go.

844
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,516
- I should?
- Yes.

845
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:09,809
They're all over there.

846
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,728
<i>He told me to move, so I ran.</i>

847
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,524
<i>And I started collecting things.</i>

848
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,943
How many can I take?

849
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,319
Do we have something to put these in?

850
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,197
I don't even have a brush. This is bad.

851
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:26,951
<i>After that, I ran back,</i>
<i>cleaned up, and started the makeup.</i>

852
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,830
<i>The model was so pretty and elegant.</i>

853
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,332
This is how I looked when I came here.

854
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,045
<i>They mentioned my current feelings.</i>

855
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,715
<i>So I thought about</i>
<i>what I should express them with.</i>

856
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,049
How old are you?

857
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:43,676
I'm 23.

858
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,594
What a sweet age.

859
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,222
Then I thought I wanted

860
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,891
to meet myself at the sweet age of 23.

861
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,811
"I'm coming to meet you
at the sweet age of your 20s."

862
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,147
I think Big Sister of Beauty

863
00:46:56,689 --> 00:47:00,609
will pull it off well with a touch of art.

864
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,155
<i>In order to apply lipstick,</i>

865
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,198
<i>I'd need a big piece of paper.</i>

866
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,909
<i>For texture, I started creasing it.</i>

867
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,626
<i>I thought of flowers.</i>

868
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,714
<i>On one side, I tried to make</i>
<i>the shape of a flower.</i>

869
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,799
<i>It was like an abstract painting.</i>

870
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:30,598
<i>I used the yellow color</i>
<i>to make it look harmonious.</i>

871
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,267
<i>I tried to keep the colors simple though.</i>

872
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,396
<i>I colored the area under the eyes</i>
<i>with pink,</i>

873
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,190
<i>which feels warm and pure.</i>

874
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,860
I'm going to use this for the base.

875
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,240
<i>I toned up the skin a little</i>

876
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,910
<i>with a white-colored product</i>

877
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,246
<i>to mimic the translucent</i>
<i>skin tone of youth.</i>

878
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,666
The white looks nice.

879
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,836
This is my first time
applying foundation with lipstick.

880
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:04,173
Let's use this as concealer.

881
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,009
My goodness.

882
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,053
It works like a primer.

883
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,514
I can't believe this.

884
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,682
How can lipstick work like a primer?

885
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,893
This is amazing.

886
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,145
I didn't know what to do for the skin.

887
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,193
I can redeem myself.

888
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:26,779
This is how I'm feeling.

889
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,907
Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room

890
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,410
is working without hesitation.

891
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,831
<i>At the time, the color</i>
<i>I wanted the most was black.</i>

892
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,334
<i>I started drawing my emotions.</i>

893
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,338
I guess you're angry.

894
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,007
Do you see my anger?

895
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:50,886
I think I should go to get a refund.

896
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,684
I'm feeling extremely unhappy.

897
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,937
<i>I expressed my pointed heart</i>

898
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,982
<i>by slightly raising the line</i>
<i>to shape the lips.</i>

899
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,945
<i>Though I have a pointed heart,</i>
<i>I still want to wear beautiful makeup.</i>

900
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,197
It's preposterous, isn't it?

901
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,076
<i>I also highlighted</i>
<i>the texture of the eyebrows</i>

902
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,203
<i>to give them a moist look.</i>

903
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:18,873
She really wants to win.

904
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,959
I can feel her desire to win.
She still has some energy left.

905
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,961
- She's so determined.
- She is.

906
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,631
<i>I already had a plan in mind.</i>

907
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,800
<i>The makeup that I wore</i>
<i>when I first came here.</i>

908
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:33,804
<i>I thought I should do that</i>
<i>to remind myself why I was here.</i>

909
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,724
<i>Bruises come in a variety of colors.</i>

910
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,602
<i>I mixed those colors in detail</i>

911
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,145
<i>to create the bruises.</i>

912
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,022
Please close your eyes.

913
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:46,400
<i>I drew some scratches</i>

914
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,944
<i>using bright red colors.</i>

915
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,739
<i>I wanted to add some blood to it.</i>

916
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:57,953
<i>So I used a glossy red lipstick</i>
<i>to draw some blood.</i>

917
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,623
This is how I looked when I came here.

918
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,751
<i>Even though I was covered</i>
<i>in many bruises and cuts,</i>

919
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,961
<i>I wanted to express that</i>

920
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,006
<i>I would survive and go back.</i>

921
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,592
Who do you think will survive?

922
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,927
I think MACtist will.

923
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,887
I also think MACtist will survive.

924
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,890
I bet MACtist will be good
at missions like this.

925
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,394
<i>I just tried to express</i>
<i>my honest feelings.</i>

926
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,606
<i>I was sweating and feeling hot.</i>

927
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,359
<i>I wanted to go home,</i>
<i>and I didn't know what to do.</i>

928
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,861
<i>My face was all red.</i>

929
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,949
<i>We had a team match, but as the captain,</i>

930
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:39,787
<i>I failed to take care</i>
<i>of my teammates until the end.</i>

931
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,790
<i>That was what bothered me the most.</i>

932
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,127
<i>I just tried to express all that visually.</i>

933
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,965
<i>That was how I was feeling.</i>

934
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,802
It doesn't look like
they only used lip products.

935
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,137
They're amazing.

936
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,141
<i>I've worn black eyeliner</i>

937
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,726
<i>my entire life.</i>

938
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:05,145
<i>I wanted to express myself</i>
<i>in a way that resembled me.</i>

939
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,399
- It looks good on the model.
- Right.

940
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,150
How did she do that without eyeliner?

941
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,779
Do you mind if I put
a little lip gloss on your skin?

942
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:19,368
<i>I wanted to surprise people</i>
<i>with the skin texture.</i>

943
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:22,955
<i>It may look like a failure,</i>
<i>but that's not the case.</i>

944
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,083
<i>So I'm even more confident in myself now.</i>

945
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,753
<i>I think I pulled off</i>
<i>the skin texture that I intended.</i>

946
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,716
I wonder what Detailed Hands will do.

947
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,801
I bet she'll be good.

948
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,016
Look at Director Sohn's work.

949
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,476
That's quite bold.

950
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:45,811
It's bold.

951
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:48,981
Look at Detailed Hands.

952
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,191
I think she's expressing her feelings.

953
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:54,653
- Her feelings...
- I can feel her emotions.

954
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:58,115
She's drawing lines like that
using lipstick?

955
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,956
They're taking it really seriously.

956
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,667
- They're serious.
- Of course.

957
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,879
You have one minute left.

958
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:14,548
One hour is so short.

959
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:20,638
I understand why they said
everyone was doing a great job.

960
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,931
They all have great ideas.

961
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,184
I know. In such a short period of time.

962
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,896
It's cruel that
only two of them will survive.

963
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,566
Five, four,

964
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,153
three, two, one.

965
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,990
Please put down the lipstick
you are holding.

966
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,242
- Good work.
- Good work.

967
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:44,578
You did well.

968
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,582
The judges will go to the dressing tables

969
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,085
and evaluate each contestant.

970
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,630
- You should look at it this way.
- Okay.

971
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,091
- Detailed Hands.
- Yes.

972
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,426
What is the emotion you tried to express?

973
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:03,931
The work of my favorite Cubist painter,
Pablo Picasso,

974
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,100
came to mind.

975
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:10,437
He's a painter who expresses
even the invisible opposite.

976
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,357
DETAILED HANDS
"TWO DIFFERENT FEELINGS"

977
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,651
<i>I think one of the things</i>
<i>he was trying to portray</i>

978
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,154
<i>was a representation of</i>
<i>a different side of oneself.</i>

979
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:21,115
I think I have two different feelings now.

980
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,745
It feels somewhat bittersweet.

981
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,789
"I want to go home."

982
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:30,958
"It's finally over."

983
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,752
I feel liberated in a way.

984
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:39,299
I wanted to express
these two strongly mixed feelings,

985
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,636
so I used these two colors.

986
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,473
<i>I tried to express Picasso's style.</i>

987
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:52,062
<i>I used blue to express</i>
<i>a dejected and melancholic feeling,</i>

988
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,276
<i>and then used white on the skin.</i>

989
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,653
<i>With white and blue, these two colors,</i>

990
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:03,449
<i>I tried to paint the duality</i>
<i>of my inner self.</i>

991
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:09,788
This blue is a shade that I like.

992
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,957
And it also reminded me
of the mission that I lost today.

993
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,503
That's why I chose blue.

994
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:17,671
I see.

995
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,800
This is an image

996
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,511
of me at the age of 20.

997
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:28,140
BIG SISTER OF BEAUTY
"MY TWENTY-YEAR-OLD SELF"

998
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,601
<i>The eyes look fresh and innocent,</i>

999
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,686
<i>while the lower part feels a bit shy.</i>

1000
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:39,193
The highlight of a 20-year-old's face
is the skin.

1001
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,112
This product was really great.

1002
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,700
I mixed this color, beige,

1003
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,952
<i>and pink together</i>

1004
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:52,372
<i>to make a foundation</i>
<i>for a smooth skin texture.</i>

1005
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,833
<i>That's how I got the clear skin.</i>

1006
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:59,713
- She might become a phoenix.
- Right?

1007
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:03,342
If she survives again this time,
it will be unbelievable.

1008
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,552
Never Dead Queen.

1009
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:07,471
What is the emotion?

1010
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,516
I thought I would go back to my beginning.

1011
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,935
"MY BEGINNING"
<i>　Never Dead Queen</i>

1012
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,062
<i>is a queen who never dies,</i>

1013
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,649
no matter what trials
and tribulations come.

1014
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,443
To capture the bruises,

1015
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,905
<i>I mixed blue, green, yellow,</i>

1016
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,491
<i>and red colors.</i>

1017
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,452
<i>I will never die.</i>

1018
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,621
My team suffered a crushing defeat.

1019
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:36,375
"PURPLE-FACED RAGE"
<i>　I tried to create my purple-faced rage.</i>

1020
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,919
I used red to create the skin base,

1021
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,964
<i>and the black parts are to express</i>

1022
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,590
<i>my confused emotions.</i>

1023
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,595
You must be very angry.

1024
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,598
I admit that.

1025
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,101
- Good work.
- Thank you.

1026
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,395
Ye-seul Arts Center.

1027
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:59,606
What is the emotion you wanted to express?

1028
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,485
<i>Though my team suffered a crushing defeat,</i>

1029
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,487
<i>I'm still confident in myself.</i>

1030
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,281
"CONFIDENT IN MYSELF"
<i>　You're confident in yourself.</i>

1031
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,867
<i>I'm still confident in myself.</i>

1032
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,412
<i>I expressed my confidence</i>
<i>with the red lips,</i>

1033
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,831
<i>and the glossy skin tone is to highlight</i>

1034
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:19,960
<i>my strength, which is dewy skin.</i>

1035
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:25,132
I have lived a life of contentment
with my work.

1036
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,800
I've done my work

1037
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,720
for over 20 years,
so I'm confident in myself.

1038
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,681
What's wrong?

1039
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,603
No. I shouldn't look.

1040
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,022
Oh, dear.

1041
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,653
That was excellent.
You all are amazing artists.

1042
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,203
I must be out of my mind. Here I go again.

1043
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,041
I expressed my mindset,

1044
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,878
which has always been
with me my entire life,

1045
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,924
where I never forget
to draw black eyeliner

1046
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,843
before my husband wakes up in the morning.

1047
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:13,513
<i>I tried to capture the feeling</i>
<i>with smoky eye makeup.</i>

FIRST EMPRESS MYEONGSEONG
"ME, BLACK EYELINER"

1049
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,018
You two look quite similar.

1050
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,189
First Empress Myeongseong.

1051
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,732
- She did well.
- She did a good job.

1052
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:29,029
My inner feelings right now
are frankly quite pointy.

1053
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:32,324
I'm so sad that I'm very pointy and sharp.

1054
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:34,034
<i>Oh, no.</i>

00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,871
<i>While my heart</i>
<i>is dark red like these lips,</i>

1057
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:42,709
I still find myself wanting to make things
beautiful when it comes to makeup.

1058
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,296
For example, I used the gold color.

1059
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,881
<i>I used it to add glow to the face.</i>

1060
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,926
<i>I also used it for contouring</i>
<i>and even blushing.</i>

1061
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,761
<i>I wanted to show</i>

1062
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,597
that I can complete a full makeup look

1063
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,058
with just lipstick.

1064
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,730
All right. MACtist, what is the emotion

1065
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,691
that you wanted to portray?

1066
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,152
<i>I just tried to express</i>
<i>my honest feelings.</i>

1067
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:10,320
"HONEST FEELINGS"

1068
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:13,824
<i>I was in a situation</i>
<i>where I couldn't even lift my head.</i>

1069
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,034
<i>My face flushed,</i>

1070
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:18,829
<i>and I felt better,</i>
<i>then I felt somewhat indifferent.</i>

1071
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:21,665
<i>I sweated a lot and felt hot.</i>

1072
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:25,419
<i>I tried to capture those feelings.</i>

1073
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:28,130
It felt like I had taken a blow.

1074
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,049
That's the emotion.

1075
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,300
I see.

1076
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,510
THE JUDGING IS OVER

1077
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,761
<i>We're in trouble.</i>

1078
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,096
<i>What do we do?</i>

1079
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,849
First, about this contestant.

1080
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:41,101
I see the limitations.

1081
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,728
I feel bad.

1082
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,939
I think this contestant did a great job.

1083
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:49,109
I could relate to the identity

1084
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:50,944
of the artist that they are.

1085
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:54,406
It deeply moved my heart.

1086
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,324
I personally think...

1087
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,161
I think this contestant did a great job.

1088
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,537
Opinions are divided here.

1089
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,457
Jin-soo wants these two contestants.

1090
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,125
This is difficult.

1091
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,127
<i>They all did a great job.</i>

1092
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,712
<i>Can't we just pick four contestants?</i>

1093
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,713
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

1094
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,631
<i>What about another redemption round?</i>

1095
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,093
It's taking a long time.

1096
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:17,345
They must be torn.

1097
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,603
Our eyes are all red,
and we have bags under our eyes.

1098
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,813
My back hurts.

1099
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,273
What do we do?

1100
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,941
I'm hungry.

1101
00:59:30,192 --> 00:59:32,194
Are they done? Not yet?

1102
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,989
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

1103
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,158
- This is hard.
- It's too difficult.

1104
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:39,910
It took you a long time.

1105
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:40,827
Yes.

1106
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,290
Oh, no. He's wearing red lipstick.

1107
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,542
Did you experience
some changes in your emotions?

1108
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,919
Just to express my determination.

1109
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:52,506
MACtist is expressing his feelings

1110
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,342
with red lipstick right now.

1111
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,386
"Even if I have to go home,
I'll leave in style."

1112
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,850
It took the judges a long time
to make the final decision.

1113
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:07,229
Now, we will announce the final winners

1114
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,190
of the redemption round, "Last Touch."

1115
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,026
RISABAE will announce

1116
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,821
the first survivor.

1117
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,119
We were deeply impressed

1118
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,913
by the wonderful work

1119
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,916
of the eight amazing artists.

1120
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,709
Thank you all for your hard work.

1121
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,837
You did a wonderful job.

1122
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:36,133
The first survivor we have chosen
after much deliberation is...

1123
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,974
<i>Who will it be? I have no idea.</i>

1124
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,728
<i>I wanted to survive.</i>

1125
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,314
<i>I've been through a lot</i>
<i>to make it to Round Two.</i>

1126
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:53,275
<i>I had no intention of getting eliminated.</i>

1127
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,568
<i>I will never leave.</i>

1128
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,903
<i>I will never die.</i>

1129
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,029
<i>I was confident.</i>

1130
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:06,329
Detailed Hands.

1131
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:10,208
Detailed Hands has survived.
Congratulations.

1132
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,169
We will give you the brush.

1133
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,888
The reason we chose
Detailed Hands was that

1134
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,183
it seemed like inspiration struck her
the moment she heard the mission.

1135
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:30,187
She boldly chose only two colors
to create her work.

1136
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:33,440
<i>This truly demonstrates</i>

1137
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,735
<i>an artist's creativity.</i>

1138
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,530
<i>We were deeply impressed</i>

1139
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:44,910
by the bold, yet sophisticated lines
that resembled her unwavering presence.

1140
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,454
It was very impressive. Congratulations.

1141
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:49,164
Congratulations.

1142
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,124
Detailed Hands, the additional survivor,

1143
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:53,418
may now move to the gallery zone

1144
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,712
where the contestants are seated.

1145
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:03,136
I hope you'll be the final winner.

1146
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,262
Good luck.

1147
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,773
We have seven contestants now.

1148
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,609
Only one of them will survive.

1149
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,905
Saem-mool will announce the last survivor.

1150
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,241
- Okay. I'll announce the result.
- All right.

1151
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,410
The last survivor is...

1152
01:02:36,503 --> 01:02:38,171
MACtist.

1153
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,007
THE LAST SURVIVOR
MACTIST

1154
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:42,842
Congratulations, MACtist.

1155
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,139
- We knew he'd make it.
- Wearing the red lipstick.

1156
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:50,058
It brought him good luck.

1157
01:02:52,269 --> 01:02:54,521
Aren't you two a couple?

1158
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:55,689
You two are wearing

1159
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:56,898
- the same lipstick.
- That's why you're wearing it.

1160
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,733
Good job wearing it.

1161
01:02:58,817 --> 01:03:01,278
Please tell us why you chose him.

1162
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,197
<i>The biggest reason is</i>
<i>the perfect expressiveness.</i>

1163
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,032
<i>I was surprised when I saw the makeup.</i>

1164
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:09,577
Only the forehead is glowing.

1165
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,204
Is there a reason?

1166
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:13,248
The forehead is glowing

1167
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,710
<i>because I wanted to express</i>
<i>the fever and sweat.</i>

1168
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,795
<i>- Sweat?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1169
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,548
<i>I really liked the texture.</i>

1170
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:23,883
<i>It's not easy to create</i>
<i>a sense of dimension</i>

1171
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:26,553
<i>by layering the products like that.</i>

1172
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,930
<i>How did he create the look</i>
<i>using only one kind of product?</i>

1173
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,307
<i>I was deeply impressed.</i>

1174
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,311
After gathering all of our opinions,

1175
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,688
we decided to choose him.

1176
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,773
- MACtist, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1177
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,650
- Thank you.
- You may go to the gallery zone

1178
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,819
- and take a seat.
- Okay.

1179
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,822
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1180
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,240
Congratulations.

1181
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,616
You'll do well.

1182
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,662
- He's about to cry.
- What?

1183
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,289
- Are you crying?
- Don't cry.

1184
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:55,749
Are you crying?

1185
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,083
I feel so sorry.

1186
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,836
Oh, no.

1187
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:03,048
I hope our captain will be the winner.

1188
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,091
- Right!
- Me too!

1189
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,760
Yes.

1190
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,512
Why are you crying?

1191
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:13,600
Seriously, why are you crying?

1192
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:15,935
What's wrong?

1193
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,483
I'm just so...

1194
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,902
I gave them a really hard time.

1195
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:27,530
I feel like crying now. Oh, no.

1196
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,199
I'm sorry.

1197
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,951
- Why are you crying?
- Congrats.

1198
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,621
- Why are you crying?
- You'll be amazing.

1199
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:35,914
You have mood swings.

1200
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,207
You have to do well, okay?

1201
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,000
You know you're my favorite.

1202
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:40,126
Okay.

1203
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:43,588
I was really happy working with you.

1204
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:45,173
I mean it.

1205
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,593
Thanks for taking good care of me,
even though I'm so much older.

1206
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:49,636
Don't say that.

1207
01:04:53,515 --> 01:04:55,600
You have to win, okay?

1208
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,560
Good luck.

1209
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,121
What's this?

1210
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,293
- My goodness.
- Have a seat.

1211
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,879
- Have a seat, everyone.
- My goodness.

1212
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,172
My gosh.

why don't we have a toast?

1233
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,628
Cheers.

1234
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,885
First Man,
you must be really cold and tired.

1235
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,303
You gave up on your fashion.

1236
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,472
I've let it go.

1237
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,681
All of a sudden?

1238
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,143
Can you at least cover your shoulder?

1239
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,479
I want to show some color here.

1240
01:06:22,562 --> 01:06:24,898
I see. That's the detail.

1241
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,901
You didn't know we'd be doing this.

1242
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,652
You should've told me sooner.

1243
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,571
I just had some instant noodles.

1244
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:35,742
You look quite comfortable now.

1245
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:36,993
It's all right.

1246
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:40,246
You are the top ten makeup artists

1247
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:43,082
who have proven your skills.

1248
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,543
Now, you have

1249
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:48,588
only two rounds remaining
until the final winner is decided.

1250
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,589
Two rounds?

1251
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:51,841
Really?

1252
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:53,343
<i>This is just the start.</i>

1253
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:55,136
I believe the rounds

1254
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,055
where I can show off my skills will begin.

1255
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,225
<i>It's finally here.</i>
<i>It's one thing after another.</i>

1256
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,019
Here's the mission for Round Four.

1257
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,230
<i>In a way, it's the last hurdle</i>

1258
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,273
<i>to get to the final.</i>

1259
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,734
<i>What would it be?</i>

1260
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,153
It's "New Face."

1261
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,322
New Face?

1262
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:17,116
The New Face Round is a mission

1263
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,827
where you need to create
a new face with makeup.

1264
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:22,789
- Really?
<i>- There will be three different themes.</i>

1265
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:25,291
<i>You'll be given a theme, and you'll create</i>

1266
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,878
<i>a new face with your own interpretation.</i>

1267
01:07:28,962 --> 01:07:32,674
There will only be
one survivor for each theme.

1268
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:34,968
A lot of us will be eliminated.

1269
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,846
A total of three contestants
will advance to the final.

1270
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:42,350
<i>All ten contestants will compete</i>
<i>on the first theme,</i>

1271
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,185
<i>and only one contestant will survive.</i>

1272
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:47,730
<i>The remaining nine contestants</i>
<i>will compete on the second theme,</i>

1273
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,818
<i>and eight contestants will compete</i>
<i>on the third theme.</i>

1274
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,362
So we need to prepare for three themes.

1275
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,531
You should give it a try.

1276
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:59,409
I'm tired already.

1277
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,329
Now, I will show you

1278
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,331
the three themes.

1279
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,006
What's that?

1280
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,467
What?

1281
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,762
- What?
<i>- Last night...</i>

1282
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:22,700
