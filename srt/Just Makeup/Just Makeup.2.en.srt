1
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,927
Why is everyone here?

2
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,346
- It's a one-day class.
- I signed up for this class.

3
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,806
I can't believe I get to watch him.

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,976
I'm First Man.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,396
I was one of
the first male makeup artists.

6
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,899
I've worked with anyone, really.

7
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:26,902
<i>From Paris Hilton to Chloë Moretz</i>

8
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,737
<i>and Lee Hyo-ri.</i>

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,489
It's you!

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,325
- It's been so long!
- I know!

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,452
It must not have been easy
deciding to join the show.

12
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,703
But I couldn't say no.

13
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,331
I'm so grateful you could come.

14
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:42,793
<i>It was fascinating.</i>
<i>It felt like looking at a celebrity.</i>

15
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,588
I wanted to become a makeup artist
after watching First Man's show.

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,006
- Really?
- Yes, as a kid.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,424
<i>Just his presence alone...</i>

18
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,470
It took my breath away.

19
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,889
It felt kind of unfair.

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,976
<i>I'm wary of him as a fellow contestant,</i>
<i>but also curious what he'll show us.</i>

21
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,651
- First Man.
- First Man.

22
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,278
- It's like looking at a celebrity.
- It's surreal every time.

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,946
- He's like a celebrity to us.
- Yes, he is.

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,117
His strokes are incredible.

25
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,913
First Man.

26
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,665
- Hello.
- Hello.

27
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,167
- What's the theme of today's look?
- Today,

28
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,753
I'm preparing the look
of a supermodel in the 1990s.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,506
- A supermodel in the 1990s.
- Yes.

30
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,050
Each decade has a different trend,

31
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,137
and the 1990s were
all about the perfect proportions.

32
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,890
<i>The ideal beauty was</i>
<i>numerically and proportionally perfect.</i>

33
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,183
- Please hold this for me.
- Okay.

34
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,059
Thank you.

35
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,185
His expertise is on another level.

36
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,854
He asked the model to hold the palette.

37
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,857
<i>I'm adding some contour</i>

38
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>as I work on the eyeshadows.</i>

39
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,569
Look at the color gradient!

40
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,779
- He's going for a classic beauty look.
- Yes.

41
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,448
All the layers!

42
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,283
- I can see the colors blossoming.
- Indeed.

43
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,618
The colors just blossom.

44
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,538
- You already look great, don't you think?
- Yes.

45
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,878
I didn't think the modern fake lashes
that come in small parts

46
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,922
would go along with this look.

47
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,675
<i>So, I used a jumbo mascara</i>

48
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,844
to leave big clumps

49
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,472
on the lashes.

50
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,891
<i>That's the essence of a '90s look.</i>

51
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,853
Your naturally long lashes saved me today.

52
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,858
Very pretty.

53
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,572
<i>One of my strengths is</i>
<i>applying red lipstick perfectly.</i>

54
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,449
I also have that pencil.

55
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,284
I never thought to use it on the lips.

56
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:43,205
It's like the epitome of contouring.

57
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,998
All the layers.

58
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,208
I should just go home.

59
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,211
Your skills haven't rusted at all.

60
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,546
Hello.

61
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,841
He just goes for it. Just one swipe.

62
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,136
Those sharp hands.

63
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:03,058
<i>I didn't want to create a look</i>
<i>just to mimic something else,</i>

64
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,104
<i>so I went for a very complex look</i>
<i>with many layers.</i>

65
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,941
That's why I look like this.
Don't I suddenly look so old?

66
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,401
I aged years today.

67
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,948
I can't stop looking at myself
because I look so good.

68
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,409
- Your face looks very attractive, right?
- Yes.

69
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,286
- Doesn't it look enchanting right now?
- Yes.

70
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,501
Everyone's looks were so bold,

71
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,294
but the models were just so still.

72
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:34,339
<i>But makeup can look different,</i>
<i>depending on the model's energy.</i>

73
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,675
So, I thought of the best model
of the time,

74
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,552
<i>Shalom Harlow.</i>

75
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,596
- From now on,
- Yes?

76
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,306
your model name is Shalom.

77
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,975
- Shalom? Okay.
- Yes, Shalom.

78
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,060
Shalom, pose.

79
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,571
They're here.

80
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,200
Shalom.

81
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,663
I had a '90s supermodel look in my mind

82
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>as I created this look.</i>

83
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,170
FIRST MAN'S '90S SUPERMODEL LOOK

84
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,423
<i>Baroque-style beauty</i>
<i>was the thing in the '90s.</i>

85
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,300
You had to flaunt the beauty.

86
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,386
<i>It was all about the perfect proportions.</i>

87
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,014
<i>I used bold and clear lines</i>

88
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,515
<i>while keeping the saturation low.</i>

89
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:29,603
<i>I wanted to evoke the look of that period.</i>

90
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,189
Could you look down?

91
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,693
- I personally love
- Yes?

92
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:40,197
the inconsistent mascara texture

93
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,948
and its stickiness,

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,534
<i>so I used her real lashes</i>
<i>instead of gluing any on.</i>

95
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,577
<i>- I see.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

96
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,663
First Man.

97
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,042
First Man!

98
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,836
I was confident.

99
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,964
<i>But I wasn't sure</i>
<i>if they'd appreciate the '90s look.</i>

100
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>The challenge behind a classic look is</i>

101
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,303
<i>that it can look very outdated.</i>

102
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,679
First Man.

103
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,390
It's a yes from me.

104
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,850
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: PASS

105
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,227
Thank you!

106
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:14,898
You portrayed the perfect proportions
of the models in the '90s

107
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,484
<i>and did a great job</i>
<i>at using the colors from then.</i>

108
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,361
<i>It felt like I went back in time</i>
<i>to the 1990s.</i>

109
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,572
This look made me nostalgic.

110
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,992
You recreated the perfect '90s look,

111
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:31,414
so it was such a pleasure as
a fellow artist from the '90s to look at.

112
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,874
Thank you.

113
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,835
Here's my decision.

114
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,753
Here's my decision.

115
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,423
What will she say?

116
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,466
Let's see!

117
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,635
It's a yes from me.

118
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,970
- Thank you.
- Yes.

SEO OK: PASS
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: PASS

120
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,267
She looks great as is.

121
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:53,228
The look just looks so good in my eyes.

122
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,481
Coupled with the model's attitude,

123
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,442
your look hit the spot with the theme.

124
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,486
It was a no-brainer for me.

125
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,779
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

126
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,738
FIRST MAN PASSES

127
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,200
First Man has passed. Congratulations.

128
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,202
Thank you.

129
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,454
I knew it.

130
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,834
He's indeed a legend.

131
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,670
He'll be a tough opponent.

132
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,381
<i>He hit the spot.</i>

133
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,883
It was so satisfying.

134
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,468
<i>I hope the older colleagues will show us</i>
<i>more of this.</i>

135
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,387
I can finally breathe
now that I'm sitting.

136
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,973
First Man.

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,642
I wonder what will happen to me.
Gosh, it's hot.

138
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,354
I'm surprised to see
so many male makeup artists.

139
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,647
I know! There are so many.

140
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,649
I didn't know there were so many
in the field.

141
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,153
I had no idea
there were so many male makeup artists.

142
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,989
<i>I rarely see male artists</i>

143
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,824
<i>when I'm at work.</i>

144
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,952
<i>But there are</i>
<i>so many talented male makeup artists</i>

145
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,413
<i>on the set,</i>

146
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,998
<i>so I can't wait to see their work.</i>

147
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,209
I've seen this guy a lot.

148
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,210
Yes.

149
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,505
Heracles looks

150
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,591
just like Hercules.

151
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,218
- Yes, he looks like Hercules!
- He dressed like him, too.

152
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,345
His outfit.

153
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,430
Heracles worked for Hera.

154
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,431
Really? I see.

155
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:16,186
<i>I'm a senior makeup artist</i>
<i>for Hera, an Amorepacific brand.</i>

156
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,854
<i>I direct makeup for photoshoots</i>

157
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,857
<i>and apply makeup on models.</i>

158
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,526
<i>I also conduct makeup training sessions.</i>

159
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,362
She looks stunning.

160
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,447
He's so skilled at everything.

161
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,200
I can't wait to see his look.

162
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,493
What does he do for a living?

163
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,995
Who is this Hulk?

164
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,289
This bulky guy.

165
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,709
<i>Hello, I'm Beauty Hulk.</i>

166
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,835
BEAUTY HULK

167
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,800
<i>I work at Yoning in Cheongdam.</i>

168
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,844
<i>You know</i>
<i>all of Ralral's alter egos online?</i>

169
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,138
I do all of her makeup.

170
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,892
<i>Nobody thinks a professional makeup artist</i>
<i>prepares those looks.</i>

171
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,394
Bo-ri!

172
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,896
Beauty Hulk is amazing.

173
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,691
<i>He's always been great</i>

174
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:06,152
<i>at preparing cool, wild, and unique looks.</i>

175
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,279
<i>I'll live up to my nickname, Beauty Hulk,</i>

176
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,781
and win!

177
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,909
I went for an Asian baddie look.

178
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,411
- An Asian baddie look?
- Yes.

179
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,913
<i>I imagined her as an Asian baddie</i>
<i>who got up in the morning</i>

180
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,581
<i>and went out to get cigarettes.</i>

181
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,084
<i>　I wanted the look to say,</i>
<i>"I woke up like this."</i>

182
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,128
<i>I mixed BB cream and foundation</i>

183
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,131
<i>to achieve the right texture for the base.</i>

184
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,634
<i>I went right for the eye makeup next.</i>

185
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,512
<i>- Her eyes were quite round,</i>
- Please close your eyes.

186
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,764
<i>so I gave them some depth.</i>

187
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,393
<i>Then, I emphasized</i>
<i>the outer corners of her lashes</i>

188
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,396
<i>to achieve a sexy and strong look.</i>

189
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,483
The center of her face was quite flat,

190
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,278
<i>so I used a creamy blush</i>

191
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,115
<i>to make her features more pronounced.</i>

192
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,576
Is it the lighting?

193
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,787
Did you purposely make
this part of her face look prominent?

194
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,957
- This part...
- I made the undereye area look prominent.

195
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,293
So it was intentional.

196
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,381
<i>My whole life has been about makeup.</i>

197
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,551
<i>I hope I don't waste those years</i>
<i>and show something.</i>

198
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,179
Beauty Hulk.

199
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,390
Unfortunately, it's a no from me.

200
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,350
Beauty Hulk.

201
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,478
RISABAE: FAIL

202
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,979
- It's a no from me.
- I see.

203
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,524
She could've had
better nose makeup and contouring.

204
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,069
<i>You could've done more with the details.</i>

205
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,529
For example, this part was

206
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,990
- made to look rounder.
- More prominent.

207
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,410
<i>That doesn't complement</i>
<i>her bone structure.</i>

208
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,830
<i>You seem to have tried to smudge</i>
<i>her eyeshadows,</i>

209
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,291
<i>but the colors don't look well-blended.</i>

210
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,460
<i>The transitions aren't smooth.</i>

211
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,712
<i>Beauty Hulk has been eliminated.</i>

212
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,423
<i>- Please take your brush and exit...</i>
<i>-</i> Is he out?

213
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,591
That's too bad.

214
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,677
BEAUTY HULK IS OUT
That's a shame.

215
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,305
- Heracles.
- Yes.

216
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,599
Please tell us about today's look.

217
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,143
The theme of my makeup is

218
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,770
<i>"natural-born beauty."</i>

219
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,023
<i>I used a semi-matte foundation</i>

220
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,692
<i>to make her skin look clean.</i>

221
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,529
And to prevent the brows
from looking unnatural,

222
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,155
I didn't correct them so much.

223
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,658
<i>Instead, I worked</i>
<i>with her natural brow shape.</i>

224
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:21,496
<i>I also mostly used the colors</i>
<i>I already saw on her skin</i>

225
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>to achieve the most natural look.</i>

226
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,543
<i>Finally, I used a liquid blush</i>

227
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,877
<i>to create a glow.</i>

228
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,424
- He did it well for a man.
- Yes.

229
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,471
<i>My biggest goal was to pass Round One.</i>

230
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,724
- I bet he'll pass.
- Me too.

231
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,226
I'm sure he'll pass.

232
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,313
I'm...

233
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,232
I'm very conflicted.

234
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,571
Here's my decision.

235
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,159
It's a no from me.

236
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,243
SEO OK: FAIL

237
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,202
Okay.

238
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,580
You nailed the skin texture,

239
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,082
- and I understood your intentions.
- Yes.

240
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,210
<i>But you could've paid more attention</i>
<i>to the details</i>

241
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,546
<i>to achieve a more natural brow look.</i>

242
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,090
<i>The blending of your eyeshadows</i>

243
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,758
<i>and the symmetry also fall short.</i>

244
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,387
I thought you missed
a lot of fine details.

245
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,555
Oh, my gosh.

246
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,351
- It's a no from me.
- Okay.

247
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,479
Here's why. As the blush extends

248
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,023
<i>out from her cheeks,</i>

249
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,816
<i>it looks a bit splotchy.</i>

250
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,945
<i>The blush seems to end so abruptly</i>
<i>without proper blending.</i>

251
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,281
Unfortunately, it's a no from me.

252
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,616
- Thank you.
- Good work.

253
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,950
<i>Heracles has been eliminated.</i>

254
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:41,951
HERACLES IS OUT

255
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,334
- I hear there's a performance going on.
- Yes.

256
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,461
I've never seen anything like this before.

257
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,840
Did he use an airbrush for that just now?

258
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,885
- I think so.
- Yes, it seems like it.

259
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,305
Yes, he's using a stencil and an airbrush.

260
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,976
- He's very good.
- Yes.

261
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,356
<i>Hello, I'm Thai Lover.</i>

262
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,776
<i>I'm a makeup artist in Thailand.</i>

263
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:20,156
I initially knew nothing about makeup,

264
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,159
<i>but I met my wife,</i>
<i>who's also a makeup artist.</i>

265
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,703
<i>She brought me into makeup artistry</i>
<i>eight years ago.</i>

266
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,791
I prepare a lot of fantasy looks.

267
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,752
<i>My strength lies</i>
<i>in doing dragon or alien looks.</i>

268
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,464
<i>I'm great at creating dragons and aliens</i>
<i>with my makeup skills.</i>

269
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,637
<i>I specialize</i>
<i>in airbrushing and bodypainting.</i>

270
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,013
<i>So I'm using those skills</i>

271
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,808
<i>to create the look of a cyborg.</i>

272
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,017
THAI LOVER'S CYBORG MAKEUP

273
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,229
<i>I went along her facial structure</i>
<i>to create some curves.</i>

274
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,858
<i>Using contouring and highlighting,</i>

275
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,611
<i>I created a very three-dimensional look.</i>

276
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,867
- That's so fascinating.
- Oh, my!

277
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,869
- Along her bone structure!
- Unbelievable, right?

278
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,372
- He's on another level.
- It follows her bone structure.

279
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,873
<i>He's a true artist.</i>

280
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,045
Did you draw the lines

281
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,339
- unevenly on purpose?
- Yes, on purpose.

282
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:22,010
I purposely tore the stencil paper roughly

283
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:25,221
<i>and followed the rough lines to add depth.</i>

284
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,889
<i>It was a conscious choice for expression.</i>

285
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,478
Looks like he'll also pass.

286
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,731
Airbrushed works will undoubtedly advance
to Round Two.

287
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,443
He truly displayed
all of his capabilities.

288
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,653
Thai Lover.

289
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,575
- It's a no from me.
- It's a no from me.

290
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,743
Okay, thank you.

291
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,702
It's a no from me.

292
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
I guess painting flashy looks
doesn't mean you'll automatically pass.

293
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,876
You did your best to define the details,

294
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,587
<i>but face painting also requires</i>
<i>attention to detail</i>

295
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,088
<i>in defining the lines</i>

296
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,090
<i>and blending the colors smoothly.</i>

297
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,594
I believe that for a cyborg makeup,

298
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,305
it should've had perfectly clean lines

299
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,141
- to go with the cyborg theme,
- Yes.

300
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,769
<i>but I could see the airbrushed lines</i>

301
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,272
<i>- didn't have a neat finish.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

302
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,565
<i>- That could've been done better.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

303
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,942
- Unfortunately, you've been eliminated.
- Okay.

304
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:20,943
- Thank you.
- Good work.

305
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,195
- Good work.
- Thank you.

306
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,073
I'll take this.

307
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,826
- So many men are getting eliminated.
- Yes.

308
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,916
- You did great!
- Good job.

309
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,295
<i>To my surprise, I spotted</i>

310
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,548
<i>many more young and handsome male artists</i>
<i>than expected.</i>

311
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,134
Among them, the guy with the red hair.

312
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:49,097
<i>The artist with the red hair looked</i>

313
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,557
<i>like a K-pop singer.</i>

314
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,017
I've never seen him before.

315
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,353
He runs a boutique in Seongsu-dong.

316
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,063
Please look up.

317
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,441
Hello, I'm a makeup boutique owner
in Seongsu-dong.

318
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,193
<i>You can call me Seongsu-dong Prince.</i>

319
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,446
I named myself Seongsu-dong Prince

320
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,991
<i>in hopes of building my own makeup empire</i>
<i>in Seongsu-dong one day.</i>

321
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,161
<i>I apply makeup for everyday use,</i>
<i>as well as for weddings.</i>

322
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,496
<i>I also conduct lessons.</i>

323
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,498
I'm quite young in my field.

324
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,375
I have to win

325
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,669
for my new kingdom.

326
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,380
<i>I'll bring my best game.</i>

327
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,550
Is the model missing half of a brow?

328
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,718
What is he sticking on the model's brow?

329
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,887
- What is he putting on?
- No idea.

330
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,390
What is he putting on her brow?

331
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,975
I have no idea. Was it shaved?

332
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,519
Please look to the front.

333
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,191
Green? Is he going for a look from <i>Wicked?</i>

334
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,943
- He's using blue.
- Yes.

335
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,027
Light green.

336
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,365
When I saw him use green
without hesitation,

337
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,075
I wasn't sure if it'd turn out fine.

338
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,454
I think he's going for
a fantasy-themed look.

339
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,873
- He had a huge online presence
- Yes?

340
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,709
before opening his makeup boutique

341
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,086
for his artistic makeup styles.

342
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,214
- Really?
- He's worked a lot with Disney, too.

343
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,384
He did a lot of Disney character makeup.

344
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,220
I used to be a content creator, after all.

345
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,183
<i>Male makeup content creators are rare.</i>

346
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,269
<i>This makeup look helped me gain fame,</i>

347
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,730
<i>which eventually led me</i>
<i>to open my boutique.</i>

348
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,398
What's the theme of your makeup?

349
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,651
- It's a Disney-style makeup.
- Disney!

350
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,407
Please look down.

351
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,243
He's so fast!

352
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,703
- No way.
- It's pitch black.

353
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,413
- What is that?
- He's putting on eyeliner.

354
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,998
- In black.
- It's a very heavy look.

355
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,376
- It's more dramatic than drag makeup.
- He's bold.

356
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,545
It feels like a battle between them.

357
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,713
Please open your eyes.

358
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:50,593
That's so cool.
I can't wait for the finished look.

359
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,095
<i>I use very bold colors,</i>

360
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,057
and I believe I'm great at
making the bold colors look harmonious.

361
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,186
<i>I finished the look with full red lips.</i>

362
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,271
He's using complementary color contrast.

363
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,066
He's even painting her ears!

364
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,443
I needed something to distract the eyes,

365
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,529
as the model's face stood out too much.

366
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,031
<i>So, I added a gemstone from Swarovski.</i>

367
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,367
It looks even more beautiful
with the gemstone!

368
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>On the other side, I chose a black one.</i>

369
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,204
He came so prepared.

370
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,747
He even prepared swan feathers.

371
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,499
Oh, my! He's using feathers!

372
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,626
That was why he covered her brow.

373
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,627
I guess so.

374
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,796
Oh, my.

375
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,756
Amazing!

376
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,092
The men are so much bolder.

377
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,677
She looks stunning.

378
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,805
How did he create such art within an hour?

379
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,307
Today's makeup look is

380
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:43,187
my interpretation of a Disney character,
Cruella de Vil.

381
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,648
<i>Cruella is a very bold character</i>

382
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,234
<i>who can be so unpredictable.</i>

383
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,653
<i>She's always over-the-top.</i>

384
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,948
<i>I strived to be over-the-top</i>
<i>for everything.</i>

385
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,200
Did you make this ornament yourself?

386
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,995
Yes, I used eyelash glue
to glue each one on.

387
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,913
<i>You made a smooth transition</i>
<i>from a curly feather</i>

388
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,999
<i>- to a straight one.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

389
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,502
<i>I thought it'd be too boring</i>
<i>to stick with one kind of feather.</i>

390
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,379
<i>He's incredible with the details.</i>

391
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,551
- Did you draw all these dots?
- Yes.

392
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,928
- I drew each one, using eyeliner.
- I see.

393
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,347
<i>I also turned the ears into extra features</i>

394
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,850
<i>by putting makeup on them,</i>
<i>making them look like accessories.</i>

395
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,856
<i>No makeup looked as flashy as mine.</i>

396
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,400
I thought I stood a good chance.

397
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,402
Here's my decision.

398
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,531
It's a yes from me.

399
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,741
Thank you.

400
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,576
<i>He did an excellent job.</i>

401
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,078
<i>From the blending to the use of colors.</i>

402
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,622
<i>He wasn't just bold.</i>

403
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,123
<i>He didn't miss any details.</i>

404
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>The makeup looked very complete.</i>

405
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,085
I wasn't expecting much,
but he was very talented.

406
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,795
<i>He's a hidden prodigy I didn't know about.</i>

407
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,047
Thank you.

408
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,967
Seongsu-dong Prince.

409
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,010
Yes.

410
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,224
It's a no from me.

411
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,061
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: FAIL
SEO OK: PASS

412
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,480
Here's why.

413
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,357
It's the complementary color contrast.

414
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,901
<i>Black and white are contrasting shades,</i>

415
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,862
<i>and so are red and green.</i>

416
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,699
<i>You've added so many details</i>
<i>on each facial feature,</i>

417
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,619
<i>along with so much color contrast.</i>

418
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,498
When I look at each component,
as Seo Ok said,

419
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,208
you have done an excellent job
with the details.

420
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,001
But if you look at
the overall composition,

421
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,672
<i>the glitter, the dots, the feathers...</i>

422
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,299
<i>There are just too many elements</i>
<i>and details crammed</i>

423
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,967
into one look.

424
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:41,389
It would've been nice
if you were a little less ambitious.

425
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,600
<i>I couldn't let this guy be on hold.</i>

426
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,268
<i>He did too well.</i>

427
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,188
So, Seongsu-dong Prince,
you'll be put on hold.

428
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,398
Thank you.

429
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,943
These two might end up
putting everyone on hold.

430
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,196
Their opinions never match.

431
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,158
SMOKY GIRL FROM BUSAN
I've made up my mind.

432
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,744
It's a yes from me.

433
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,955
It's a no from me.

434
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,915
She's on hold?

435
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,876
Hidden Gem, it's a yes from me.

436
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,378
It's a no from me.

437
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,462
Another one on hold!

438
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,800
Judges RISABAE
and Lee Jin-soo mostly agree

439
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,177
on who should fail and pass,

440
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,472
but these two judges
have both worked at makeup boutiques,

441
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,099
and they're from different generations.

442
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,685
That's why they're so divided.

443
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,978
Their criteria are too different.

444
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,024
Director Seo Ok likes to pay attention
to the key components,

445
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,528
while Ms. Jung
looks for the overall balance.

446
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,823
I initially thought
your makeup looked stunning

447
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,241
- when I came by earlier.
- Yes.

448
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,785
<i>But the completed look is lacking</i>

449
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,288
<i>in the sense</i>
<i>that her facial features look unbalanced,</i>

450
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,833
and your interpretation of a flower
on her face is underwhelming.

451
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,043
It's a no from me.

452
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,171
I appreciated the details

453
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,507
<i>that could keep the look balanced.</i>

454
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,009
It's a yes from me.

455
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,678
- Swag Maker, you'll be put on hold.
- Thank you.

456
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,972
There they go again, those two!

457
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,807
- Again?
- Those two!

458
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,559
I'm on hold.

459
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,146
Big Sister of Beauty,

460
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,190
from afar,

461
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,193
it didn't seem like you did anything.

462
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,196
<i>But I can see</i>
<i>you've worked on so many things</i>

463
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,740
<i>now that I've compared her face</i>
<i>with her before photo.</i>

464
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,657
TIMELESS CLASSIC MAKEUP

465
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:28,204
I can tell you've carefully thought
about what'd look good on the model.

466
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,955
It's a yes from me.

467
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:31,123
Thank you.

468
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,458
Here's my decision.

469
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,502
It's a no from me.

470
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,879
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: PASS
SEO OK: FAIL

471
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,465
- They're divided again.
- On hold!

472
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,925
I interpreted it differently.

473
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:45,763
I couldn't tell if this classic look

474
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:51,852
<i>suited the model's youthful face.</i>

475
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,896
So it's a no from me.

476
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,524
Big Sister of Beauty,
you'll be put on hold.

477
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,859
They have such different perspectives.

478
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,946
This is so intense.
It's impossible to please both!

479
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:06,492
- Both of them have very strong opinions.
- Yes.

480
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,286
That must be why neither of them follows
the other person's decision.

481
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,498
I don't think we'll give
many passes to the contestants.

482
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,918
No, we can't discuss
our decisions beforehand.

483
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,588
We had different perspectives.

484
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,966
There's no rule on
how to give someone a pass.

485
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,968
You can't count the rights and the wrongs.

486
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,762
It's not a black-and-white matter.

487
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,974
I tried to pretend
I didn't know anyone here.

488
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,518
I tried to focus
solely on everyone's skills.

489
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,228
We have no choice.

490
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,939
- We must be objective with our decisions.
- Yes.

491
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,276
Satisfying both judges...

492
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,948
Mi-yeong, are you preparing
smoky eye makeup?

493
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,284
When else would I get to do it,
if not now?

494
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,743
I'm doing my best.

495
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,663
You're very bold today, Mi-yeong.

496
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,042
She's the makeup artist for Chung Ha.

497
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:58,252
What? Really?

498
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,590
I'm Glitter Magician, a makeup artist.

499
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,468
GLITTER MAGICIAN

500
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,220
<i>I chose the nickname Glitter Magician</i>

501
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,930
because of Chung Ha.

502
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,559
<i>The glittery look I gave Chung Ha</i>
<i>when she performed "Roller Coaster"</i>

503
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,643
<i>was very memorable.</i>

504
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,853
<i>That's why I went with this nickname.</i>

505
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,314
<i>And the warm autumn makeup</i>

506
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,108
<i>started gaining</i>
<i>so much attention from people.</i>

507
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,443
WHO'S THE MAKEUP ARTIST?
YOU DESERVE ALL THE PRAISE

508
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,819
That made me so happy.

509
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,703
Glitter Magician,
what look are you preparing?

510
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,706
I'm planning
a smoky eye makeup with glitter

511
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,458
to showcase the power of glitter.

512
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,002
- Smoky eyes with glitter?
- Yes.

513
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,505
<i>I prepared deep and intense smoky eyes</i>

514
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,425
<i>to bring people's eyes to hers.</i>

515
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,392
It's easy to make smoky eyes look
too overwhelming,

516
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,437
but she's managed to give
a K-pop idol feel to it,

517
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,230
as well as an artistic vibe.

518
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:05,986
Look at me.

519
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,990
What? What is she doing?

520
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,119
Open your eyes.

521
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:18,457
She kept adding more and removing some.

522
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,669
That's so cool!

523
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:25,172
<i>My technique was to finish the smoky eyes</i>
<i>and to erase some.</i>

524
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:28,092
<i>That was my way of showing</i>
<i>my unique style.</i>

525
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,054
She did a great job
at keeping the lines clean.

526
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,931
It suits the model so well.

527
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,060
- It'll be so hard to choose one.
- What?

528
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,354
- She's so good.
- They're all so good.

529
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,064
- I bet she'll make it to the next round.
- Yes.

530
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,944
She's adding glitter

531
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,071
- as the highlight.
- Nobody else used glitter,

532
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,698
so that'll make her stand out even more.

533
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,616
- She looks stunning.
- Yes.

534
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,453
Open your eyes.

535
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,415
Can you shake your head lightly?

536
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,791
Thank you.

537
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,046
<i>Makeup is an art form</i>
<i>without right or wrong,</i>

538
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,841
<i>so my priority is creating a look</i>
<i>that I find pretty.</i>

539
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,592
<i>This look is the result of that.</i>

540
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:17,516
My heart is pounding like crazy.

541
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,059
GLITTER MAGICIAN

542
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,978
Is it here?

543
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,062
All right.

544
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,356
Is it my turn?

545
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,693
Please explain the look to us.

546
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,946
I decided to do what I loved.

547
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:32,614
I wanted depth...

548
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,116
<i>Things I love.</i>

549
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,618
GLITTER MAGICIAN'S
SMOKY AND GLITTERY MAKEUP

550
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,121
<i>I incorporated glitter</i>
<i>into an intense makeup</i>

551
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,081
<i>to make the model look</i>
<i>charismatic and beautiful.</i>

552
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:44,460
<i>I didn't want to use glitter</i>
<i>like everyone else,</i>

553
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,919
<i>and I wanted to add my flair,</i>

554
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,589
<i>so I used glitter of a different color</i>
<i>for each eye.</i>

555
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,093
<i>As Glitter Magician,</i>

556
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,971
<i>I wanted to add my own flair to the look.</i>

557
00:25:56,847 --> 00:26:00,601
I always want my artists to stand out
more than anyone.

558
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,019
I want them to shine like stars.

559
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,272
I want them to stand out
and grab your attention.

560
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:06,398
That was my goal.

561
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:08,317
You're tearing up.

562
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,075
<i>Director Jung was my mentor.</i>

563
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,701
She's like the mom of makeup for me.

564
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:19,328
It felt like

565
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,040
<i>she understood</i>
<i>my intentions for my artists</i>

566
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,459
<i>when I was preparing this look.</i>

567
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,379
I'm tearing up again.

568
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,843
Do you think you've shown
what you wanted to show?

569
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,972
There are some things
I wish had turned out better,

570
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:39,973
but I did my best.

571
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,016
Okay.

572
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,477
- Let's have a look in the mirror.
- Yes.

573
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,193
<i>It was so nerve-wracking and scary.</i>

574
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,780
<i>I felt like a child trying to hide</i>
<i>her mistakes from her mom.</i>

575
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,329
Please look to the front.

576
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,207
Okay.

577
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,668
I've decided.

578
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,546
- Yes, I'm also ready.
- Okay.

579
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,632
They decided a lot more quickly
than I thought.

580
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,220
<i>Director Jung</i>
<i>made her decision so quickly.</i>

581
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,805
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

582
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:21,849
Glitter Magician.

583
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,894
It's a yes from me.

584
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,688
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: PASS

585
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,314
- Thank you!
- You proved to be a magician of glitter,

586
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,732
just like your nickname.

587
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,652
You did an excellent job

588
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,072
<i>at refining the finest details</i>
<i>and bold parts</i>

589
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,575
<i>in different textures.</i>

590
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,369
<i>You were very bold</i>
<i>with your use of eyeshadow</i>

591
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,954
<i>to create such deep eyes.</i>

592
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,582
<i>You also did a great job with the gems,</i>

593
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,126
<i>keeping a perfect balance</i>
<i>with the placements.</i>

594
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,378
I can't wait to see what you'll do next.

595
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,462
Thank you!

596
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,509
Director Seo Ok hasn't said anything yet.

597
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:58,844
She might be put on hold.

598
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,139
Glitter Magician.

599
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,684
Another one on hold?

600
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,896
- It's a yes from me.
- Thank you!

601
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,899
GLITTER MAGICIAN PASSES

602
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,108
That's amazing.

603
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,110
She did really well.

604
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,237
She was approved by both judges!

605
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,697
Congratulations.

606
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,990
- Thank you.
- Yes.

607
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,243
First, your look reflected your goal well.

608
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:24,453
It looked very complete,

609
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,747
and your intentions were clear,
which I really appreciated.

610
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,791
<i>Incorporating so many textures and colors</i>

611
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,128
<i>could cause a look to look overwhelming,</i>

612
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,131
<i>but you prevented that</i>
<i>by coordinating everything well.</i>

613
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,883
<i>The use of highlighter</i>

614
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,135
<i>suited the model perfectly,</i>

615
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:41,803
<i>playing as the highlight of your makeup.</i>

616
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,682
- Thank you!
- I'm so proud.

617
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:46,934
Thank you so much!

618
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,477
Great job.

619
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,314
Glitter Magician has passed.

620
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,690
Thank you!

621
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,276
- The smoky eyes...
- She nailed it.

622
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,321
- It was a memorable look.
- She did really well.

623
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,447
Great work.

624
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,075
- She's good.
- Yes.

625
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,786
It's been a while since Saem-mol
and I both agreed on

626
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,621
letting a contestant pass.

627
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:12,668
She knows how to express herself
through makeup freely.

628
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,087
<i>Her aptitude for makeup is something else.</i>

629
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,090
This feels like a dream!

630
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,176
<i>I'm very excited about the contestants</i>

631
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,761
who have such unique ways of expression.

632
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,888
I wanted to have a look.

633
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,599
<i>I'm expecting to see</i>
<i>many new ways of doing makeup.</i>

634
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,643
<i>The makeup skills used today are different</i>

635
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,354
from the skills used
when I was being trained.

636
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,439
<i>I'm sure the artists active in the scene</i>

637
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,816
<i>have a different eye than I do</i>

638
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,484
in reading trends.

639
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,823
<i>Hello, I'm Beauty Heiress.</i>

640
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:47,452
<i>I work at the SOONSOO Headquarters</i>
<i>in Cheongdam.</i>

641
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:50,205
I've done the makeup
for a photoshoot with NCT,

642
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>and I'm also the makeup artist</i>
<i>for Lee Su-ji</i>

643
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,710
<i>for her Shuu-vely Mom bit</i>
<i>and her other alter egos.</i>

644
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,546
Hello, I'm Hambuggy, the rapper.

645
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,298
<i>Buggy, buggy, ham!</i>

646
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,634
I believe
I'm an excellent, versatile artist.

647
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:06,722
<i>I hope this can be a chance</i>
<i>to show myself.</i>

648
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,849
I used mocha mousse, a popular color.

649
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,851
<i>Then, instead of a glowy look,</i>

650
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,103
I gave her a subdued glow
using a highlighter,

651
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,896
which is popular these days.

652
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,066
<i>I focused on featuring the highlighter</i>

653
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,818
and glossy lips.

654
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,154
It's stylish and her eyes look expansive.

655
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,115
<i>I can see how you expressed</i>
<i>the current most popular look,</i>

656
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,199
so it's a yes from me.

657
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,367
It's a yes from me.

658
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:29,953
Beauty Heiress has passed.

659
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:33,165
Thank you for giving me
the best makeup of my life.

660
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,916
I never want to take this off.

661
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,420
The mocha mousse makeup
may be very popular now,

662
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:41,715
but I added my own twist to it

663
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,508
<i>by making it a chocolate mousse makeup.</i>

664
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,801
LARGE GIRL'S CHOCOLATE MOUSSE MAKEUP

665
00:30:44,885 --> 00:30:46,595
Please think of the look

666
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,389
as a Hershey's chocolate vibe
rather than Ghana chocolate.

667
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,474
<i>Is it more of a milk-chocolatey vibe?</i>

668
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,351
Like it was made in the US.

669
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,395
It's a yes from me.

670
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:56,605
It's a yes from me.

671
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,899
<i>Large Girl left</i>
<i>a strong impression on me...</i>

672
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,318
I prefer a supple kind of look.

673
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,362
May I try touching it?

674
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,738
Yes, you can touch her face.

675
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,281
You might get some chocolate on you,

676
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,449
but go ahead.

677
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,159
- Is it supple?
- It is. Try touching her face.

678
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,161
It really does feel supple.

679
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,373
I touched the model's face,
and it did feel supple.

680
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,584
<i>I'm Makeup Trendsetter, Kim Yu-mi.</i>

681
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,629
<i>I'm very into fashion trends</i>

682
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,798
<i>and beauty trends,</i>

683
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,716
<i>　which is why I chose the nickname</i>
<i>"Makeup Trendsetter."</i>

684
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,470
I added freckles,
making her look like a young girl.

685
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,597
Then, I applied the mocha mousse lips

686
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,140
to keep it trendy.

687
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,642
We look so similar.

688
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,645
- I went to a makeup show in Japan,
- Yes?

689
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,523
and someone passed by me and shouted,
"It's Jung Saem-mool!"

690
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,316
<i>You did a great job with the skin.</i>

691
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,528
<i>You also seem to understand</i>
<i>and reflect the most recent trends.</i>

692
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,446
She's really good

693
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:48,323
- at freckle makeup.
- Yes.

694
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,617
I can tell you're detail-oriented.

695
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:52,452
Makeup Trendsetter, it's a yes from me.

696
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,621
Makeup Trendsetter has passed.

697
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,167
You did great!

698
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,002
I thought I'd be eliminated!

699
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,338
Don't cry! You'll make me cry!

700
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,058
- What?
- What?

701
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,685
Is that stage makeup?

702
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,520
I guess so.

703
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:21,022
She must've done that on purpose, right?

704
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,691
- I think so.
- The judges are on their way.

705
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,526
- Please wait at your stations.
- It really stands out.

706
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,611
- Will the judges understand the intent?
- I wonder the same.

707
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,657
Hello, I'm a makeup artist of 34 years.

708
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,535
<i>I'm First Empress Myeongseong.</i>

709
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:36,997
<i>The Last Empress.</i>

710
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,666
The stage makeup for the musical is
historical in the field.

711
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,085
When I was about 24, I designed
all the looks for <i>The Last Empress,</i>

712
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,338
<i>the musical that's celebrating</i>
<i>its 30th anniversary this year.</i>

713
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,216
I was the original makeup designer,

714
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,218
<i>and I prepared the makeup</i>

715
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:52,554
<i>for all the lead roles.</i>

716
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:56,725
<i>Today, I'm preparing the makeup for</i>
<i>the role of Empress Myeongseong</i>

717
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,643
<i>in The Last Empress.</i>

718
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,061
FIRST EMPRESS MYEONGSEONG'S
<i>THE LAST EMPRESS</i> MUSICAL LOOK

719
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,355
That's something only I can do.

720
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,900
<i>My biggest strength lies in a skill</i>

721
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,444
<i>that most beauty makeup artists</i>
<i>don't have.</i>

722
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,112
I can use dohran,
which is similar to foundation,

723
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,780
and use my fingers directly

724
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:13,742
<i>to contour the nose</i>

725
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,911
<i>and the rest of the face.</i>

726
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,749
Oh, my. The look is so intense.

727
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,668
It'll look beautiful in the end.

728
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,420
- Really?
- Yes.

729
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,422
- Were you caught off guard?
- Yes.

730
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,842
<i>Then, I made the eyelids look</i>

731
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,136
<i>as symmetrical as possible</i>

732
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,721
<i>and extended the eyelid areas</i>

733
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,389
<i>to make her face stand out more.</i>

734
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,442
Where did I put it?

735
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,615
She's having trouble finding something.

736
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,369
<i>I needed liquid eyeliner</i>

737
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,204
for the intense eye makeup.

738
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,290
<i>But I left it in my bag</i>
<i>and didn't put it on the table.</i>

739
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,210
Hold on.

740
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:08,880
Where is she going?

741
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,799
She must've forgotten something.

742
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,008
This is actually happening.

743
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,471
Could I borrow your black liquid eyeliner?

744
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,973
Yes, I have it.

745
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,851
- Black, or...
- Black, no. Do you have liquid eyeliner?

746
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,311
- Liquid?
- Liquid.

747
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,938
- Just liquid.
- This is liquid.

748
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,022
It's a brush liquid eyeliner.

749
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,148
- Do you not have anything else?
- No.

750
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,359
I have a brush pen in black.

751
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,152
But no gel eyeliner?

752
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,529
I have this.

753
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,947
- Will this work?
- Okay.

754
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,283
- Okay.
- Here.

755
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,579
All right.

756
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,293
<i>I was so nervous and flustered.</i>

757
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,669
<i>I thought I was doomed.</i>

758
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,588
<i>How was I to get through this?</i>

759
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,924
<i>You know how we say</i>
<i>your legs become jelly?</i>

760
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,509
<i>I felt that. I thought I was screwed.</i>

761
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,221
- I'll turn the chair to look at her.
- Okay.

762
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:00,682
Please explain today's look.

763
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,893
This is the look of Empress Myeongseong

764
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:07,230
<i>that I designed for the stage musical</i>
<i>about 30 years ago.</i>

765
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,234
<i>Each component may seem</i>
<i>too bold on its own,</i>

766
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,028
<i>but under the brightest stage lights,</i>

767
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,740
<i>the makeup will keep the actress</i>
<i>from looking washed out.</i>

768
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:20,619
<i>It reflects</i>
<i>Empress Myeongseong's strong personality.</i>

769
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,662
<i>It's stage makeup</i>

770
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,998
for big venues,
like Sejong Center for the Performing Arts

771
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,541
and opera houses.

772
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,959
The audience is far away,

773
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,961
and the actress wears a big headpiece

774
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,590
with red-toned <i>hanbok,</i>
embroidered in gold.

775
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,468
Please consider those factors
in your assessment.

776
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,594
- Okay.
- Okay.

777
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,138
Should I go first?

778
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,349
Have you already decided?

779
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,683
Or do you have a question?

780
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,894
- I've decided.
- Have you?

781
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:49,397
<i>This was my ultimate big break.</i>

782
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,274
<i>I really wanted their approval on it.</i>

783
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:52,817
Yes.

784
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,403
It's a yes from me.

785
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,613
Oh, my! Thank you!

786
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:57,656
It's a yes from me.

787
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,449
Oh, my! Thank you!

788
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,453
- Thank you!
- Here's why.

789
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,789
I could see

790
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,459
the bold lines and colors,
perfect for stage makeup.

791
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,628
It made me curious to see

792
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:14,255
what you'll do in the next round.

793
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,299
- Thank you!
- That's why it's a yes from me.

794
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,134
It's a yes from me.

795
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,761
Thank you!

796
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,221
SEO OK: PASS
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: PASS

797
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,973
I believe it's all about symmetry

798
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,518
when creating a three-dimensional look.

799
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,479
<i>So, I was very eager to see the look</i>
<i>once it was completed.</i>

800
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,106
<i>And the symmetry is definitely there.</i>

801
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,440
<i>Thank you!</i>

802
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:35,235
First Empress Myeongseong has passed.

803
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,404
FIRST EMPRESS MYEONGSEONG PASSES

804
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,697
You were amazing!

805
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:40,949
Congratulations!

806
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,328
I'm proud of myself
for staying calm in the moment

807
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,540
and working well
with the borrowed eyeliner products.

808
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,625
I want to cry.

809
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:51,960
I'm tearing up.

810
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,963
- I feel you.
- I've never been

811
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,923
so nervous and so happy

812
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,633
- in my life.
- I know!

813
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,636
My goodness!

814
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,391
What look have you prepared for today?

815
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,561
My signature makeup for today

816
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,895
is wedding makeup.

817
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:13,314
I do a lot of wedding makeup,

818
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,316
<i>so that's my strongest suit.</i>

819
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,361
<i>Think of it as a makeup look</i>
<i>for a wedding-themed photoshoot.</i>

820
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,114
<i>My theme today is makeup</i>
<i>for a Korean traditional wedding.</i>

821
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,825
- I see so many bridal looks.
- Right.

822
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,121
- I see your nickname is "Wedding-dol."
- Yes.

823
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,125
<i>I work at Comme Nana,</i>
<i>a boutique in Cheongdam-dong.</i>

824
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,544
<i>This is my go-to wedding makeup.</i>

825
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,337
<i>If I do just as I have always done,</i>

826
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,590
<i>I believe that will get me a pass.</i>

827
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:43,595
Wedding Spoon has started
putting things on the model's face.

828
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:48,975
<i>My mother has been running</i>
<i>a bridal boutique for over 35 years.</i>

829
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,394
<i>I've been at her shop for so long,</i>

830
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:55,774
<i>and I'm always around extra dress fabric</i>
<i>or accessories.</i>

831
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:58,610
<i>So, I'm using those elements today</i>

832
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,986
<i>to decorate the model's face.</i>

833
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,906
<i>Think of it as makeup for a photoshoot.</i>

834
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,533
She's preparing a look for <i>pyebaek,</i>
the Korean traditional wedding ceremony.

835
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,911
I've never seen the red dots in real life.

836
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,287
It looks adorable.

837
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,165
<i>Hello, I'm Grand Wedding Host.</i>

838
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,628
<i>I featured the traditional red dots</i>
<i>on the bride's cheeks,</i>

839
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,880
<i>but in a color gradient.</i>

840
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,842
GRAND WEDDING HOST'S
TRADITIONAL WEDDING MAKEUP

841
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,140
Grand Wedding Host,

842
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,934
it's a no from me.

843
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:31,893
It's a no from me.

844
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,729
The look isn't symmetrical,

845
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,732
<i>and it feels underwhelming.</i>

846
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:40,235
Sorry, but you've been eliminated.

847
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,320
Thank you for your work.

848
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,489
Wedding-dol is a great makeup artist.

849
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,907
I prepared a glowy look

850
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,867
- for the ceremony.
- For the ceremony?

851
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,662
WEDDING-DOL'S WEDDING CEREMONY MAKEUP

852
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,580
It's a no from me.

853
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,915
It's a no from me.

854
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,460
There should've been far more colors.

855
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,213
It feels like you've stopped halfway.

856
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,923
It's a shame, really.

857
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,509
I feel like Wedding Spoon will pass.

858
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:11,391
WEDDING SPOON'S WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT MAKEUP

859
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,730
On one hand,
using those accessories could help,

860
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,568
but on the other hand, it could cover
what she's done with the makeup.

861
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:24,237
Her entire face is covered

862
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,157
in lace, beads, and lashes,

863
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,911
so I can only see 10 to 20%
of your makeup skills.

864
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,413
That's really disappointing.

865
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,081
So, it's a no from me.

866
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,041
You'll be put on hold.

867
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:39,127
- Thank you.
- Good work.

868
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:42,130
JENNY THE VETERAN

869
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,799
She works at JENNY HOUSE,
which is why she's Jenny the Veteran.

870
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:52,891
<i>I've been working at JENNY HOUSE</i>
<i>in Cheongdam-dong for 20 years now.</i>

871
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,311
<i>When preparing my signature look,</i>

872
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,814
<i>I thought going with the look I applied</i>
<i>for the longest time</i>

873
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,482
<i>and the most often</i>

874
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,235
<i>would be the best reflection of who I was.</i>

875
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,905
So, I decided to go
with a bright-toned bridal look.

876
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,032
Are you sure you'll be fine

877
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,992
without the proper wedding hair and dress?

878
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,494
Yes, that'll put more focus on the makeup.

879
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,664
<i>For weddings,</i>

880
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,791
<i>you need a big white dress</i>
<i>and light reflections</i>

881
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,793
to make the makeup look more beautiful.

882
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,046
<i>But without a dress and lights,</i>

883
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,714
<i>I figured I needed to make</i>

884
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,842
<i>the model look even brighter</i>
<i>to achieve that wedding look.</i>

885
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,346
<i>So, I used a bright,</i>
<i>finely pearlescent makeup base</i>

886
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,140
<i>with a very light foundation</i>

887
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,767
<i>in the center of her face.</i>

888
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,729
<i>And I started subtly contouring her face</i>
<i>from the base makeup,</i>

889
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,566
<i>as brides always want their faces</i>
<i>to appear smaller.</i>

890
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,487
The makeup is different
for the ceremony and the photoshoot.

891
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,157
<i>Brides go for a more dewy look</i>
<i>for the ceremony,</i>

892
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,492
<i>but if it's too dewy,</i>

893
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,912
<i>it can make the eye bags stand out.</i>

894
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,539
So, instead, I prepared a photoshoot look

895
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,625
<i>by covering her eye bags</i>

896
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,212
<i>and worked with the natural blush she had.</i>

897
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,924
Brides these days love

898
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,386
pink-toned eye makeup.

899
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,846
<i>But the model's eyelids were quite hooded.</i>

900
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,848
Pink eyeshadows could cause her eyes

901
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,350
to look puffy,

902
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,852
<i>so I went for a different color scheme.</i>

903
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,397
<i>I used muted colors</i>

904
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,857
<i>to keep her eyes from looking puffy.</i>

905
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,403
<i>Bridal makeup is</i>

906
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,822
<i>all about maximizing brightness.</i>

907
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:34,534
<i>But the eye and brow makeup can take</i>

908
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,077
<i>the brightness away</i>

909
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,288
<i>or make the bride's face look less glowy.</i>

910
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,000
<i>To prevent that,</i>
<i>I went over the base makeup at the end.</i>

911
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,877
<i>I also put makeup on her upper body</i>
<i>to make her shine,</i>

912
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,170
<i>so that even from a distance,</i>

913
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,923
<i>people would think that she stands out</i>

914
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,843
<i>and get that</i>
<i>it's definitely a wedding look.</i>

915
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,927
I think I'm done.

916
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:03,896
JENNY THE VETERAN'S
WEDDING PHOTOSHOOT MAKEUP

917
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:08,109
Jenny, is this for the ceremony

918
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,902
or the photoshoot?

919
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,947
It's more suitable
for a wedding photoshoot.

920
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,159
<i>I would've added more sparkles</i>
<i>under or over her eyes</i>

921
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,453
if it were for a wedding ceremony.

922
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,289
But the base makeup is more suitable
for a wedding photoshoot

923
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,832
<i>than for a wedding ceremony.</i>

924
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:30,631
<i>I expected a lot from Jenny the Veteran</i>
<i>with her wedding makeup.</i>

925
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,759
<i>JENNY HOUSE.</i>

926
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,552
<i>I also used to have</i>
<i>dozens of brides come in</i>

927
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,096
for bridal makeup daily
at my old boutique.

928
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,016
So I had high expectations.

929
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,814
- Jenny the Veteran,
- Yes.

930
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,445
it's a yes from me.

931
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,113
JENNY THE VETERAN PASSES

932
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,490
Thank you.

933
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,492
I can see

934
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,328
all of your years of makeup knowledge

935
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,164
in this makeup.

936
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,292
The base makeup seems

937
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:10,463
<i>perfect for a bridal look.</i>

938
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,091
<i>The contouring is very natural,</i>

939
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,676
<i>but it contours all the curves</i>

940
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,845
<i>along her face perfectly.</i>

941
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,723
This is the perfect wedding makeup.

942
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,267
That was what I thought
when I saw your look.

943
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,353
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

944
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,855
Could you tell me
how you did your base makeup?

945
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,691
- I don't remember what I did!
- You don't?

946
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,945
<i>I'm not a big-name content creator,</i>

947
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,948
<i>and I'm not incredibly talented.</i>

948
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,867
<i>But I have faith</i>

949
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,829
<i>in my 25 years of hard work.</i>

950
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,498
<i>So, I'll just do as I always do</i>

951
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,334
- <i>and give my all.</i>
- You did so well!

952
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,212
The base makeup was perfect, wasn't it?

953
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,465
The skin looks immaculate!

954
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,135
She did well amid all this pressure.

955
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,223
- Hello.
- Hello.

956
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,392
- I'm a huge fan.
- Thank you.

957
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,269
I'm watching what everyone is doing.

958
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,563
- This is my first time.
- You're so cute!

959
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,606
- I don't know what to do.
- I've seen you online.

960
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,191
The giant puff!

961
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:14,527
- She's the it girl these days.
- No.

962
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,070
I initially watched your videos
because they were funny,

963
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,905
but you're so good.

964
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,157
I'm a huge fan of you all.

965
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,449
We'll do our best.

966
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,535
She knows me!

967
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:24,745
She's taken over the
short-form content world.

968
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,330
You saw the giant puff, right?

969
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:28,916
Short-Form Content Queen
with the giant puff!

970
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,420
<i>I'm like an amateur among experts.</i>

971
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:35,506
But even amateurs can also do
just as well at makeup.

972
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,592
I want to encourage people

973
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,595
to do the makeup they want and love.

974
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,096
I'm here to set an example.

975
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,348
It's Si-ne!

976
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,893
I love her.

977
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,896
I can't wait for her work.
She's great at doing makeup.

978
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,567
<i>I've never set up</i>
<i>a makeup station before in my life!</i>

979
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,153
I just laid everything
on my table at home!

980
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,072
<i>This was the first time in my life</i>
<i>that I set things up so nicely.</i>

981
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,075
<i>I separated and placed each item</i>
<i>with its kind, one by one.</i>

982
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,703
You can keep it on your lap.

983
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,289
It's fun to play with it.

984
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:11,834
When I smack this on my face,
my face gets imprinted onto the cushion.

985
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,173
She gave a giant puff about this big

986
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,466
to the model to hold onto.

987
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,968
I asked her why.

988
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,637
Did you bring this from home?

989
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,305
Yes, for her to play with.

990
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,141
To play with it!

991
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,809
To keep her entertained.

992
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,896
<i>She said, "It's boring to wait</i>
<i>for your makeup to be done."</i>

993
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,023
<i>Makeup artists are always scrambling</i>

994
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,483
<i>when working on their clients,</i>

995
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,319
but the client can definitely feel bored
while waiting for the makeup to be done.

996
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,197
So, she prepared a toy for her client

997
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,157
<i>to keep herself entertained.</i>

998
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,492
I appreciated that thoughtfulness.

999
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,910
What's the theme of your makeup?

1000
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:47,828
I wanted to accentuate the lashes

1001
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,997
- and create a French doll-style look.
- A French doll.

1002
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,749
I'll look forward to it.

1003
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,626
Thank you.

1004
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,172
<i>I started with her forehead</i>
<i>for the base makeup.</i>

1005
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,632
<i>I'm not an expert,</i>

1006
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,176
so I can't do my makeup
without touching the client's face.

1007
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:05,346
Instead, I have to get very close,
as if we're besties.

1008
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:07,390
<i>I had to touch the model's face nonstop,</i>

1009
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,016
<i>so I decided to work on her cheeks last.</i>

1010
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,727
<i>My plan was to start from the top</i>
<i>and make my way down.</i>

1011
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,147
- I'll be putting these on you.
- I see.

1012
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:18,526
But I prepared two other options
in case these didn't look good.

1013
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,029
<i>My model had huge eyes,</i>

1014
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,448
and the fake lashes I'm wearing

1015
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:28,661
<i>would've made her eyes look smaller</i>
<i>by covering them.</i>

1016
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,288
<i>I imagined</i>

1017
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,873
every possible eye shape yesterday

1018
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,042
and tried drawing my plan
for the fake lashes.

1019
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,463
Is she putting on double eyelid tapes?
Or fake lashes?

1020
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,216
- She's using individual fake lashes.
- I see.

1021
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,471
<i>I figured lashes growing longer</i>
<i>toward the outer corners</i>

1022
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,307
<i>would look good on anyone and tried them,</i>

1023
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,850
but they looked too simple.

1024
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,310
So, I added a little something special

1025
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:54,603
<i>by adding some pink in the center.</i>

1026
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,566
Colored lashes!

1027
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:02,361
It looks like she has
cherry blossoms on her lashes.

1028
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,239
Why do you look so pretty?

1029
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:06,866
You already look like a doll.

1030
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,077
I know I did it,
but I'm in awe of how pretty you look.

1031
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,080
She's going for a French doll look.

1032
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,206
It's so pretty.

1033
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,584
Everyone said it looked pretty,

1034
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,878
which made me hopeful
about advancing to the next round.

1035
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,297
Please explain the look.

1036
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:23,883
My signature makeup is

1037
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:27,762
all about having long, flashy lashes.

1038
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:31,891
<i>So, I went for a French doll look</i>
<i>with an emphasis on the lashes.</i>

1039
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,601
SHORT-FORM CONTENT QUEEN'S FRENCH DOLL

1040
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,105
<i>I added a pink lash to each lower eyelid</i>

1041
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,940
<i>as a cherry on top.</i>

1042
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:44,278
I also used many colors,

1043
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,864
such as blue, purple, and yellow

1044
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:50,659
to create a colorful base.

1045
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,954
Where did you use the yellow?

1046
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,957
On her nose bridge and under her cheeks

1047
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,293
to add some warmth.

1048
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,878
<i>I mixed yellow into those parts.</i>

1049
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,171
<i>I see.</i>

1050
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,714
- I've decided.
- Yes.

1051
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:05,841
Short-Form Content Queen.

1052
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,803
<i>I just hope I don't get eliminated.</i>

1053
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:09,970
I'll announce my decision.

1054
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:11,972
It's a no from me.

1055
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,933
It's a no from me.

1056
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,643
It would've been fine

1057
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,479
if you only used yellow on her nose.

1058
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,314
The yellow under her cheeks

1059
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,817
<i>looked too dark</i>
<i>and accentuated her laugh lines.</i>

1060
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,112
That was a bit disappointing,

1061
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,655
so it's a no from me.

1062
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,323
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1063
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,284
- Short-Form Content Queen.
- Yes.

1064
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:36,288
<i>I didn't want to seem too desperate</i>
<i>when eliminated.</i>

1065
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,458
I was ready to accept
my fate and any feedback.

1066
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,210
It's a yes from me.

1067
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,421
SEO OK: FAIL
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: PASS

1068
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:46,340
First, you've used difficult colors,

1069
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,802
<i>yet they look harmonious</i>
<i>with the colors on her face.</i>

1070
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,847
I can tell that you had
a clear design in your mind,

1071
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,307
which I commend you for.

1072
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,184
- So, you're on hold.
- Okay.

1073
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,853
Thank you.

1074
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,813
I expect a lot of YouTubers

1075
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,441
and Instagram influencers
will get eliminated.

1076
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,151
- I bet many won't make it.
- Influencers?

1077
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,194
They've never put makeup on someone else.

1078
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:10,364
This must be so difficult
for content creators.

1079
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:13,868
<i>As worried, the content creators struggled</i>

1080
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,662
<i>in setting up their makeup stations</i>

1081
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,040
<i>and putting makeup on the models.</i>

1082
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,376
- Are you okay?
- It stings.

1083
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,711
- Oh, no! I'm sorry!
- It stings.

1084
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,715
I wasn't sure
they'd handle this mission well.

1085
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,717
Face Hacker.

1086
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,886
<i>I minimized the length of her middle part</i>

1087
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,220
FACE HACKER'S MELLOW MUTED MAKEUP
<i>as much as possible</i>

1088
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:35,347
and made her eyes look bigger
in all four directions.

1089
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,560
I was really looking forward to your work,

1090
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:42,480
<i>but I can barely see</i>
<i>the adjusted facial ratio</i>

1091
00:49:42,563 --> 00:49:45,649
and the expanded eyes.

1092
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,818
Unfortunately, it's a no from me.

1093
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,236
Beauty Wiki,

1094
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,739
it's a no from me.

1095
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,742
<i>The details involved in the look,</i>

1096
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,411
<i>her brows, and the overall harmony</i>

1097
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,080
fell short, in my opinion.

1098
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,166
You'll be put on hold.

1099
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,834
The content creators tend to replicate

1100
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:06,712
the makeup they put on their faces
on the models.

1101
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,048
PURPLE GELATO
I toned her face down nicely

1102
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,591
<i>without making her look pallid.</i>

1103
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,426
<i>I just added light contouring.</i>

1104
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,928
- It's a no from me.
- Okay.

1105
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,556
You didn't work with the natural features

1106
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,391
the model had.

1107
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,435
- So you're on hold.
- Okay.

1108
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,896
In many cases, their own makeup styles

1109
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,607
won't look good on their models' faces.

1110
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:30,611
Cute Granny,
I thought your makeup was beautiful.

1111
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,780
<i>That was what I wanted to see.</i>

1112
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:33,697
<i>Yes.</i>

1113
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:35,449
But the model's look feels incomplete.

1114
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,825
I completely messed up!

1115
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,370
<i>Cute Granny has been eliminated.</i>

1116
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:43,415
All the active content creators are out.

1117
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,125
Nobody among them has passed so far.

1118
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:58,764
I wish I could get that for her.

1119
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,643
I'm 100% sure that this will happen.

1120
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:04,853
Is that SSIN?

1121
00:51:05,396 --> 00:51:07,815
The pioneering generation
of content creators.

1122
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,316
- She's very famous.
- Yes.

1123
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,445
<i>As a content creator,</i>

1124
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,781
<i>I'm very skilled at planning a theme,</i>

1125
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:18,993
<i>editing, and producing videos.</i>

1126
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,036
But I'm not officially certified

1127
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,788
as a makeup artist.

1128
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:27,835
<i>I'm a self-taught artist</i>
<i>who just follows her instincts.</i>

1129
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,130
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>how far I'll make it on the show.</i>

1130
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,965
<i>It's a lot of pressure.</i>

1131
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:34,174
<i>I'm scared.</i>

1132
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,179
You didn't bring
as many products as I thought.

1133
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,056
Yes, I just brought the necessities,

1134
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,308
although there are still a lot.

1135
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,018
- You only brought what you needed.
- Yes.

1136
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,936
Everyone's so different,

1137
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,605
- even with their setup.
- Right?

1138
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:52,610
Here.

1139
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,281
BeauTube Veteran,

1140
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,366
your setup is the messiest.

1141
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:03,162
I never learned
how to set up my station properly.

1142
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,664
This is how content creators' desks look.

1143
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,708
This is content creator style!

1144
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,752
- Yes.
- I'm also a content creator, though.

1145
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,920
- This is a content creator's desk.
- That's a first for me.

1146
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,590
<i>I wasn't trained for this.</i>

1147
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,426
But I looked around,
and others brought towels!

1148
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,346
Everyone had their palettes open
at the same angle.

1149
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,307
No wonder I always take so long
to find anything.

1150
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,940
Are you putting on the base makeup later?

1151
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,233
- Yes.
- Okay.

1152
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,861
Is there a special reason for that?

1153
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,029
Well...

1154
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,741
The eyeshadow can fall on her skin,

1155
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,035
so it's better for the model
to put the foundation on last.

1156
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:44,411
- Either way is fine for me, though.
- I see.

1157
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,121
I've done a lot of calculations.

1158
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:48,582
I've rehearsed about five scenarios
before coming.

1159
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,084
I knew we'd only get an hour!

1160
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,002
I saw it coming.

1161
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,838
<i>I practiced with one hour,</i>
<i>like it was a college entrance exam.</i>

1162
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,674
<i>"I should be at this point</i>
<i>　by the 10-minute,</i>

1163
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,092
<i>the 20-minute,</i>

1164
00:52:58,175 --> 00:52:59,677
<i>and the 30-minute mark."</i>

1165
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,514
So I didn't feel rushed at all.

1166
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:08,394
<i>I used a primer</i>
<i>to control the oil on her eyelids,</i>

1167
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:11,063
<i>removed the dullness on the eyelids</i>

1168
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,439
<i>using concealer,</i>

1169
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:15,192
<i>and then used contouring powder</i>

1170
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,070
<i>to shape the corners of her eyes.</i>

1171
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:22,658
Here, and here.

1172
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,785
<i>Then, I took a white pencil liner</i>

1173
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,496
<i>to mark the corners and sides of her eyes</i>

1174
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,790
for her eye placement when they were open.

1175
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,959
Calculating those points beforehand
helped me.

1176
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,129
Then, one here.

1177
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,173
<i>I took fake lashes about 5mm long</i>

1178
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,843
<i>and glued them under the lashes.</i>

1179
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,137
And the highlight of my look was

1180
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,305
the little gems.

1181
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,641
<i>I added a moon-shaped gem</i>

1182
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,685
<i>on the outer corner of her eyes,</i>
<i>right above the lashes.</i>

1183
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,438
That's my magic item.

1184
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:53,939
Where's my Pat McGrath palette?

1185
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,944
<i>I used an eyeshadow palette</i>
<i>unavailable in Korea.</i>

1186
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:02,448
It was by Pat McGrath Labs,
a brand by a British makeup artist.

1187
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,324
One palette is about 150,000 won.

1188
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,618
<i>I only use that palette</i>
<i>whenever I need to make an impact.</i>

1189
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,246
<i>I brought this special palette</i>

1190
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,332
<i>that I only use to really elevate a look.</i>

1191
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,835
<i>I used that</i>
<i>for all the main parts of the look.</i>

1192
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,005
BEAUTUBE VETERAN'S MZ SMOKY LOOK

1193
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,673
<i>I'd say the fun of the look comes</i>

1194
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,633
<i>from the little gems</i>
<i>at the outer corners of her eyes</i>

1195
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,719
<i>and the coral-toned gemstones</i>

1196
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:27,514
<i>above and below the eyes</i>
<i>and in the inner corners.</i>

1197
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,184
Were you trying to make the moon gems
look like her lashes?

1198
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,645
Yes, I purposely placed them
where her lashes ended.

1199
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,815
You used so many colors.

1200
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,567
<i>Yes, it's a colorful look.</i>

1201
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,445

1202
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,532

00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,661

00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,474
Thank you!

1209
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,769
Your makeup station may look

1210
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,939
- very disorganized,
- Please teach me how it should be done.

1211
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,566
- but I can teach you.
- Tell me where to place what.

1212
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,070
I was a bit worried,

1213
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,155
as this wasn't an environment

1214
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,032
a content creator would be familiar with.

1215
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:30,577
I was rooting for you,
but I was also very nervous.

1216
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,414
I was wondering
how BeauTube Veteran would do.

1217
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,874
I looked to the side,

1218
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:40,963
<i>and she'd noted every little detail down.</i>

1219
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:43,632
<i>I even read what she wrote.</i>

1220
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,427
She had a very meticulous blueprint,

1221
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,180
<i>yet she was so creative with her makeup.</i>

1222
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:52,558
<i>I could really feel that today.</i>

1223
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,227
A veteran is indeed different.
It's a yes from me.

1224
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:56,478
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1225
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,897
BeauTube Veteran has passed.

1226
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,153
Yes!

1227
00:56:06,572 --> 00:56:07,990
SSIN hasn't lost her touch at all.

1228
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,741
- She's on another level, right?
- Yes.

1229
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:12,286
Hello.

1230
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,788
<i>There are many content creators</i>
<i>from my platform,</i>

1231
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,333
<i>so I feel like I should do my best.</i>

1232
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,210
I'm very worried about my future here.

1233
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,296
I'm going to JUNG SAEM MOOL
Art and Academy from tomorrow.

1234
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,965
Which artist's makeup was

1235
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,342
the most memorable from today?

1236
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,678
It was Oh...

1237
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,555
- The person was in front of me.
-"Oh"?

1238
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,473
The NARS artist.

1239
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,893
<i>The profile was perfect.</i>

1240
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,603
<i>I knew she'd make it to the next round.</i>

1241
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:38,896
NARS.

1242
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,107
You're a makeup artist for NARS.

1243
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,860
Are you only using NARS products today?

1244
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:48,030
- It's her secret.
- Of course.

1245
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,157
All NARS.

1246
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,826
Hello, I'm Oh Dolce Vita,

1247
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,662
a makeup artist at NARS Korea.

1248
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,414
<i>I get so much joy</i>

1249
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:01,001
<i>from putting makeup on others.</i>

1250
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,502
It's like "Oh, happy day."

1251
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:06,048
<i>I train the brand artists</i>

1252
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:10,010
<i>and work on other sites,</i>
<i>such as backstage and photoshoots,</i>

1253
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,678
<i>for brand artistry development.</i>

1254
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,431
<i>I've been an artist representing one brand</i>

1255
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,016
<i>in different areas for a long time.</i>

1256
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:17,517
<i>I've been quite successful,</i>

1257
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,021
<i>which has led me to become</i>
<i>a team leader leading the brand.</i>

1258
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,652
- Do you always use your hands a lot?
- Yes, always.

1259
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,362
I only use my hands at NARS.

1260
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,405
- Are you only using your hands?
- Yes,

1261
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,698
I apply everything with my fingers.

1262
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,119
<i>They must've found it interesting</i>
<i>that I only used my hands.</i>

1263
00:57:36,203 --> 00:57:37,788
<i>I believe our hands are the best tools</i>

1264
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,750
<i>to make the base makeup look</i>
<i>as natural as possible.</i>

1265
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:45,879
<i>So I used my hands to achieve</i>
<i>the thinnest and most perfect base.</i>

1266
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,547
<i>I wanted it to look like her own skin.</i>

1267
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:51,551
- Her skin is so clear.
- There's a glow.

1268
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:56,348
<i>Then, I needed to do</i>
<i>a three-dimensional look for today,</i>

1269
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,935
<i>so I had to work on the brows</i>
<i>before anything.</i>

1270
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,604
<i>I needed the brows at the right angles</i>

1271
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:05,565
<i>before I could work on the contouring</i>
<i>that suits her face shape.</i>

1272
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,568
<i>I refined her natural shapes</i>
<i>as best as I could</i>

1273
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,862
<i>and used a neutral color</i>

1274
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,572
<i>to contour her eyelids.</i>

1275
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:16,618
<i>Then, I drew very sharp wings</i>
<i>with the liner</i>

1276
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,870
<i>without making them droopy.</i>

1277
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,247
<i>I applied mascara after that.</i>

1278
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,417
That looks good.

1279
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,585
I bet it'll look so nice at the end.

1280
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,087
It suits the model.

1281
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:35,178
<i>The key point of this makeup</i>
<i>is making the lips bold.</i>

1282
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,849
She's preparing red lips.

1283
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:44,146
My company has great colors.

1284
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,732
<i>Even with the lips, I wanted to add volume</i>

1285
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,358
<i>and make them look prominent,</i>

1286
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,944
<i>so it took me</i>

1287
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,487
about five red lip products.

1288
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:54,614
<i>I kept the edges of the lips dark</i>

1289
00:58:54,698 --> 00:58:57,576
<i>with a plum red shade to add depth.</i>

1290
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,954
<i>I cleanly lined the outline</i>
<i>to make it look more plump,</i>

1291
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:04,458
<i>and then I applied a brighter shade of red</i>
<i>in the center.</i>

1292
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,835
<i>I was very precise with the red lips,</i>

1293
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,962
<i>so there wouldn't be any need</i>
<i>for correction.</i>

1294
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:13,008
<i>My goal was to make the lips perfect</i>
<i>without error.</i>

1295
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,595
Oh, my! That's so pretty.

1296
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,805
She's so precise.

1297
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,683
How did she make the lips look so clean?

1298
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,396
<i>Lastly, I used a pearly gloss</i>

1299
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,690
<i>to maximize the volume.</i>

1300
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:32,069
<i>I ensured the lips would look plumper</i>
<i>toward the center.</i>

1301
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:34,654
She already gets 100 points
with the lips alone.

1302
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,947
The lips are a pass.

1303
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,825
- Oh Dolce Vita.
- Yes.

1304
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:42,287
My theme is "timeless beauty."

1305
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,832
I went for classic makeup
that looks beautiful on women

1306
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,168
in any day and age.

1307
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:51,671
OH DOLCE VITA

1308
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,343
<i>I worked with her delicate facial features</i>

1309
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,637
<i>for the brows, eyeliner,</i>

1310
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,014
<i>nose contouring,</i>

1311
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,100
<i>and face contouring.</i>

1312
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,435
After contouring her face properly,

1313
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,438
I wanted to accentuate
every facial feature

1314
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,066
<i>while making the makeup itself stand out.</i>

1315
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,027
<i>So I kept the eyeliner and lip lines</i>

1316
01:00:14,236 --> 01:00:15,362
as clean as possible.

1317
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,114
That was my way

1318
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,449
of maximizing her natural beauty
through makeup.

1319
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:23,662
I see. Which part of her face
would you say turned out the best?

1320
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,081
- Her lips.
- Her lips.

1321
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,875
<i>I drew the lip lines</i>
<i>beyond her natural lines</i>

1322
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,961
<i>and kept the outer part of the lips matte</i>

1323
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,963
<i>while making it glossy in the center.</i>

1324
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,090
That was how I made the lips look fuller.

1325
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:37,759
- May I go first?
- Yes.

1326
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,094
It's a yes from me.

1327
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:41,012
It's a yes from me.

1328
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,223
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1329
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,141
It's a yes from you too, right?

1330
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,183
- Yes.
- You passed!

1331
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,393
- You passed.
- Thank you.

1332
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,854
- Good work.
- Thank you!

1333
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:49,855
It was perfect.

1334
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:51,148
Congratulations.

1335
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,191
- Great work.
- You were perfect.

1336
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,569
I got goosebumps
as soon as I saw her face.

1337
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,945
- The lines...
- Oh Dolce Vita has passed.

1338
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,905
<i>- </i>Wasn't it perfect?
- Right?

1339
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,033
My gosh, she's so good.

1340
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,911
- She's incredible.
- She's very talented.

1341
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,663
I loved the texture

1342
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,331
- she prepared for the lips.
- It was stunning!

1343
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,917
<i>- It was very classic but not tacky.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

1344
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:11,960
<i>- Exactly.</i>
<i>- It was perfect.</i>

1345
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,589
I really give her all my respect

1346
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,508
<i>for keeping the lines so clean.</i>
<i>It was incredible.</i>

1347
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,969
I was so proud of myself.

1348
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:22,929
Good job, me!

1349
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:27,851
WHILE THE EVALUATION IS STILL ONGOING...
It must be so hard for the judges.

1350
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,690
A MODEL LEAVES THE STAGE AFTER THE JUDGING
Can I see your makeup?

1351
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,942
- Sorry?
- Can I see your makeup?

1352
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,068
- Sure.
- He's checking her makeup.

1353
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,195
Let's go. I want to see it, too.

1354
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:39,571
- Let's join them.
- Me too.

1355
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,033
Oh, my!

1356
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,159
- My goodness!
- Isn't it hard to see from here?

1357
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,285
It's cut out.

1358
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,330
- No way.
- Goodness!

1359
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,623
It looks like a real diamond.

1360
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,417
- That's incredible.
- Could you turn this way?

1361
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:57,464
- Even the base makeup is amazing.
- You're right.

1362
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,465
- Seriously.
- The brows!

1363
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:00,634
- That's incredible.
- Everything is on point.

1364
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:01,927
- It looks stunning.
- It's a vibe.

1365
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:02,844
<i>Bravo.</i>

1366
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:04,596
She deserves a round of applause.

1367
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:07,891
She's excellent.

1368
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,435
It wasn't just chills.

1369
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:13,355
<i>I was thoroughly shocked by her skills.</i>

1370
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,732
<i>I was deeply inspired by her.</i>

1371
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,359
What was that? It blew me away!

1372
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,069
<i>When she was doing the makeup,</i>

1373
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:21,696
<i>I hid in the corner</i>
<i>and watched her for 40 minutes.</i>

1374
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,325
Because I can't watch her work
in Korea otherwise.

1375
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,160
