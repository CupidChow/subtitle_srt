518
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,648
<i>From makeovers</i>

519
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,150
<i>to aesthetic looks and stage makeup,</i>

520
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,529
an artist can't be great at all.

521
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,991
<i>But RISABAE is unbelievably talented</i>
<i>in all of them.</i>

522
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,534
I approve of her as a judge.

523
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,830
I'm RISABAE,
a Korean beauty content creator.

524
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,458
I've worked in theatrical makeup,
specializing in special effects makeup,

525
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,210
as well as in a makeup boutique.

526
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,588
<i>And now, I'm a content creator,</i>

527
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,506
<i>so I can draw from my diverse experience</i>

528
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,302
<i>to assess each makeup look</i>
<i>from different perspectives.</i>

529
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,142
We have one more judge to present.

530
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,102
There's one more?

531
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,313
- No way.
- I bet the last judge is a man.

532
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,821
It's Lee Jin-soo!

533
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:29,283
<i>He's a makeup artist and a brand master.</i>

534
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:33,412
<i>He's a leading figure of Amorepacific,</i>

535
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,788
<i>the biggest K-beauty company.</i>

536
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,831
My gosh!

537
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,416
Please welcome Lee Jin-soo.

538
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,667
LEE JIN-SOO
JUDGE

539
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,341
I absolutely love Jin-soo's brand.

540
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:49,470
He's an artist
in a position above everyone.

541
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,139
<i>He must have different perspectives</i>

542
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,683
<i>as a leader of Amorepacific, a huge brand.</i>

543
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,810
<i>He participates in product development,</i>

544
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,604
<i>conducts beauty classes,</i>

545
00:23:58,687 --> 00:23:59,855
<i>leads employee training sessions,</i>

546
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,274
<i>and hosts makeup shows.</i>

547
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,652
<i>He's taken over the field.</i>

548
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,029
<i>He's an all-rounder makeup artist</i>

549
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,989
<i>in the whole makeup industry.</i>

550
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:12,701
<i>I'm the makeup master of Amorepacific,</i>
<i>Lee Jin-soo.</i>

551
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,329
As a brand makeup artist,

552
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,748
<i>I'll focus on what I know</i>
<i>from product development,</i>

553
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,376
<i>including the colors, textures, and tones.</i>

554
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,213
<i>I'll focus on an artist's ability</i>
<i>to mix and match those factors.</i>

555
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:30,469
Everyone, I present to you
the four top judges of JUST MAKEUP.

556
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,851
<i>All four judges are so different.</i>

557
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,771
<i>Even the contestants are</i>
<i>from such diverse backgrounds.</i>

558
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,399
<i>The judges seem qualified</i>
<i>to judge all of us.</i>

559
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,234
<i>Anyone would agree.</i>

560
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,861
<i>When else would we get to learn</i>
<i>from such masters?</i>

561
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,154
For free, too!

562
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:53,325
Now, let's begin JUST MAKEUP.

563
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,414
This is incredible!

564
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,082
Is this <i>Squid Game?</i>

565
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,709
I'm scared.

566
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,877
I'm getting goosebumps.

567
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,256
What's this?

568
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,426
I can't wait to see the stage.

569
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,428
I want to see the models, too.

570
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,762
- Same.
- I wonder who they are.

571
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,062
I will now reveal the first round mission
of JUST MAKEUP.

572
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,189
Here it is.

573
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,442
JUST MAKEUP

574
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:31,947
They're models!

575
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,451
They're models!

576
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,669
<i>Every model was dressed in black</i>
<i>from head to toe.</i>

577
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,129
<i>They took my breath away.</i>

578
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,214
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

579
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,134
And everyone had their hair covered!

580
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,887
- Their hair is pulled back.
- You're right.

581
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,848
<i>Seeing the hair nets...</i>

582
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,016
<i>Man...</i>

583
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,768
This is cruel.

584
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,313
Makeup shines brighter
with good hair and fashion.

585
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,066
<i>They're really judging us</i>
<i>solely on the makeup.</i>

586
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:07,983
<i>This'll be tough.</i>

587
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:08,859
WIN SOLELY WITH YOUR MAKEUP SKILLS

588
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:22,331
- What's going on?
- What?

589
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:26,794
- What's going on?
- What?

590
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,504
- What are these?
- No way.

591
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,963
That's so cool.

592
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,632
I got chills!

593
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:33,926
<i>It was quite the sight.</i>

594
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,429
<i>I'd never seen so many makeup stations</i>

595
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,847
<i>in one room.</i>

596
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,849
This is amazing.

597
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,770
<i>This is the place to let my skills shine!</i>

598
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,231
There are outlets to put plugs in.

599
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,733
<i>This is where it'll all go down.</i>

600
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,611
I need all the luck in the world
I can get.

601
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,370
The first mission is "JUST MAKEUP,"

602
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,372
where you prove yourself just with makeup.

603
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,459
Every contestant will be matched

604
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,670
with 1 of the 60 models at random.

605
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,004
It's random.

606
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:15,050
You must showcase
your best makeup look on the model.

607
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,719
Go all out and show your best makeup look

608
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,847
that you feel most confident about.

609
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,560
I chose number one.

610
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,479
<i>The number you choose</i>

611
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,731
<i>will determine the model you work with.</i>

612
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,233
Number 57.

613
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,069
<i>You must bring out</i>
<i>your model's best features</i>

614
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,156
<i>and showcase your best makeup look.</i>

615
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,491
Number 51.

616
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,536
You get 60 minutes.

617
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:45,080
- Just 60 minutes?
- That's too short!

618
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:49,293
<i>We'll divide the contestants</i>
<i>into 2 groups of 30 for this round.</i>

619
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,753
<i>Once you have completed the look,</i>

620
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,881
<i>you must put your brush down.</i>

621
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,257
THE SIGNATURE BRUSH MUST BE PUT DOWN
ONCE THE LOOK IS READY

622
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,927
<i>The judges will work in pairs</i>

623
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,137
<i>to assess each look.</i>

624
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,263
JUDGES EVALUATE IN PAIRS

625
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,016
JUNG SAEM-MOOL AND SEO OK'S ZONE
RISABAE AND LEE JIN-SOO'S ZONE

626
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,351
IF BOTH JUDGES APPROVE,
THE CONTESTANT WILL ADVANCE TO ROUND 2

627
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,187
IF BOTH JUDGES DISAPPROVE,
THE CONTESTANT WILL BE ELIMINATED

628
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,439
It's a no from me.

629
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,815
It's a yes from me.

630
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,275
IF THE JUDGES HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS,
THE CONTESTANT WILL BE PUT ON HOLD

631
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,777
<i>However, if all spots get filled</i>
<i>for Round Two,</i>

632
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,822
<i>those on hold will be eliminated.</i>

633
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,366
<i>After Round One,</i>

634
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,621
only half, 30,
of the contestants will be left.

635
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,542
I wish you all the best of luck.

636
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:35,130
JUST MAKEUP

637
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,008
<i>Contestants, please set up your stations.</i>

638
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,261
Oh, my! It's time to set up.
I'm so nervous!

639
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,555
It feels real
now that my station is ready.

640
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,226
I've never seen anything like this before.

641
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,480
<i>I was more excited than nervous.</i>

642
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,190
<i>It's really starting.</i>

643
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,816
<i>This is what I'm here to do.</i>

644
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,654
<i>It's all about getting into</i>
<i>the right mindset from here on out.</i>

645
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,407
<i>I'll focus only on my artwork.</i>

646
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,495
<i>I'll use all my best skills.</i>

647
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,497
<i>I'll pass and advance.</i>

648
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,209
The judges are here.

649
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,420
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

650
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,839
Let's begin Round One,

651
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:21,009
"JUST MAKEUP," where you prove yourself
just with makeup.

652
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,886
Get your brushes

653
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,430
and show us your makeup skills.

654
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:29,643
- Good luck!
- This is great.

655
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,520
- It's starting right away!
- Good luck!

656
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,481
- The timer started.
- Let's go!

657
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:35,941
Ten seconds have already passed!

658
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,776
It's an hourglass!

659
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,445
Please close your eyes.

660
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,284
They must be so nervous.

661
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,711
<i>What a treat it is</i>

662
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,046
<i>to watch all these artists working</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

663
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,675
- The judges are already walking around.
- Yes.

664
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,637
They're even asking questions!
They have to answer the judges, too.

665
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,599
They're talking to
the contestants as well.

666
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,144
Since it's the first round,

667
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,313
I think they're extra attentive

668
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,356
to each contestant.

669
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,151
It must be so nerve-wracking.

670
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:20,652
I'm so intrigued.

671
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,070
I also want to go and see!

672
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,613
- Do you want to come with me?
- I'd better stay.

673
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:24,948
When else would I get to watch
another artist working?

674
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,575
I know, right?

675
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,077
Someone has her beauty device out.

676
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,620
- Really?
- For the model's skin.

677
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,289
She's starting with
lymphatic drainage massage.

678
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,879
Is she bleaching her brows?

679
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,255
Yes, even her eyelashes.

680
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,175
In just one hour?

681
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,926
She seems so relaxed.

682
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,768
See how she has her hand
behind the model's head?

683
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:54,644
That's what we do at boutiques.

684
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:56,271
- Really? That's so cool.
- Yes.

685
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,441
We support the client's head like that.

686
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:05,489
Everyone has such different techniques

687
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,948
based on their backgrounds.

688
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,576
- This is fascinating.
- It's so interesting.

689
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:11,912
I'm glad we get this chance
to see everyone like this.

690
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,372
Are you standing in front of the person
you want to watch?

691
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,456
- Yes.
- This person?

692
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,625
Yes, I've been keeping up with her
on Instagram.

693
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,126
- You were always curious about her.
- Yes.

694
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,795
This is a great way to learn.

695
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,879
Indeed.

696
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,465
- We don't get to watch how others work.
- Right.

697
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,301
I'm scared.

698
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:27,886
You worked for MAC, right?

699
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,012
That's right.

700
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,680
We all used to work for MAC.

701
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,890
- Really?
- Yes, all of us.

702
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,600
There's me, her,

703
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:34,810
that person,

704
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,186
and that person too.

705
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,312
- Really?
- Yes.

706
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,606
- MAC has a distinct style.
- Yes.

707
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,860
MAC has a unique way
of grooming its artists.

708
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,114
The brand believes in training its artists
to reflect its philosophy.

709
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,282
<i>That's MAC for you.</i>

710
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,119
<i>It incorporates many colors and textures.</i>

711
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,245
<i>A true artist can unleash</i>

712
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,039

<i>I worked at MAC for about six years.</i>

715
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,715
I saw my former superiors
sitting at my table.

716
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,177
BEAUTY MASTER IM, FORMER "MAC"
I feel really nervous sitting across

717
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,846
two global artists.

718
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,722

Especially since they're right across.

719
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:13,932
The two global artists.

720
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,060
<i>I was on MAC's Team Korea</i>
<i>as a makeup artist.</i>

721
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,855
<i>So, I'm Team Korea MAC Queen.</i>

722
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,566
My main job was to prepare

723
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,110
all MAC celebrities and models for shoots.

724
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,445
Where do you work?

725
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,573
I used to be a national artist for MAC.

726
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,866
- Back in the day...
- I was with MAC.

727
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,493
- The leopard print.
- Yes, I was working then.

728
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,872
Basically, I was the main face of MAC.

729
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:38,874
- Hello.
- Team Korea MAC Queen.

730
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,791
Yes.

731
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,209
What's the theme of your look?

732
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:45,255
- I planned to go for a dark, smoky look,
- Yes?

733
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,716
but the model has
such beautiful skin and lips.

734
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,760
And the space between her brows
and eyelids isn't that wide,

735
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:54,264
so I'm preparing shallow smoky eyes
using gray

736
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,892
and a glowy look for the skin and lips.

737
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,643
- Okay, smoky eyes.
- Yes.

738

TEAM KOREA MAC QUEEN'S SEMI-SMOKY MAKEUP

739
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,981
<i>I mixed a cream and an oil for the base</i>

740
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,817
<i>and applied it to her face,</i>
<i>along with some lip balm.</i>

741
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,656
Then, I started on the brows right away.

742
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,409
<i>The model's brows were uneven.</i>

743
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,703
<i>When preparing smoky eye makeup for shows,</i>

744
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,038
<i>we shave almost all the brow hair</i>

745
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,999
<i>or leave the brows almost natural.</i>

746
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,626
So, I started on the brows first.

747
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:31,676
<i>I used gray, black, and brown eyeshadows</i>
<i>for the eyes.</i>

748
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,762
<i>I kept the gradient very subtle</i>

749
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,348
<i>without spreading the shadows too far out.</i>

750
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,064
For her skin and lips,
I went for a glowy look.

751
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,482
<i>I used light burgundy for the lips</i>

752
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:50,362
<i>and a nude, peach-toned blush</i>
<i>for her cheeks and nose bridge.</i>

753
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:54,324
I also noticed a very pretty mole
on her face.

754
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:59,412
<i>So, I used a burgundy eyeliner</i>
<i>to dot the mole to accentuate it.</i>

755
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,084
<i>I'm confident</i>
<i>I'll be at least in the top ten.</i>

756
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,294
In fact, I came here ready to win.

757
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,132
Team Korea MAC Queen is done.

758
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,928
- I wonder what she's done.
- She's ready.

759
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,641
The station platform comes down.

760
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,685
It goes down once the makeup is done.

761
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,023
<i>I can feel and notice</i>

762
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,985
<i>an artist's tips and tricks learned</i>
<i>from decades of working,</i>

763
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,279
as well as the artist's unique style
from her fingertips,

764
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:35,323
without having to watch her for long.

765
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,660
I believe everything is in the details.

766
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:42,247
<i>So, my biggest focus will be</i>
<i>on the details</i>

767
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,500
and the artist's ability to work well
with the model's features.

768
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,795
- Please explain the look to us.
- Okay.

769
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:51,798
It's a smoky eye look, but it's subtle.

770
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,718
<i>I wanted to accentuate</i>
<i>the glowy skin and lips more.</i>

771
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,553
<i>It's a gray-ish smoky look.</i>

Okay, we'll take a look now.

774
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,526
Could you look down?

775
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,326
They're examining the look so closely.

776
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,411
Did you not use fake lashes on purpose?

777
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,705
- Yes, I prepared fake lashes,
- Yes.

778
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,707
- but the model has monolids,
- Yes.

779
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,336
<i>which could've made</i>
<i>bold lashes look tacky.</i>

780
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,754
So, I scrapped it altogether.

781
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,216
The judges are assessing every detail
so meticulously.

782
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,094
- They're very thorough.
- That's crazy.

783
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,389
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yes.

784
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,308
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

785
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,065
- Will they decide on the spot?
- Yes.

786
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:52,400
Pass, fail, or on hold.

787
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,903
I'd say...

788
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,906
What will she say?

789
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,577
To be honest, I can sense everything
as soon as I look at the makeup.

790
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:04,371
<i>I can tell what details are lacking</i>

791
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,581
<i>and what features aren't harmonious.</i>

792
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,459
<i>It wasn't very hard to judge the looks.</i>

793

<i>The brow color and details in the texture</i>

I wanted to create a look

800
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:30,105
that resembled a star shining
through the clouds in the night sky.

801
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,940
<i>You made her skin glowy,</i>

802

<i>but the stars in the clouds are matte,</i>

803
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,696
so it doesn't feel like the stars are

804
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,407
shining brightly through the clouds to me.

805
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,701

<i>I didn't feel scared or anything.</i>

810
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,255
<i>I'm sure I'll make it to the top ten.</i>

811
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,299
Here's my decision.

I see.

815
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,349
Here's what I thought was
the biggest flaw.

816
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,852
I looked at the model from the start,

817
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,395
<i>and I noticed her sparse brow hair.</i>

818
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,522
<i>I looked forward to seeing what you'd do</i>

819
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,315
<i>- about it.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

820
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,025
But the final brows weren't symmetrical

821
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,861
and lacked a nice texture.

822
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,320
I had hoped
you would do something more with it.

823
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,905
That's why I made my decision.

824
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,115
Okay.

825
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,367

- Here's why.
- Yes.

835

Today's focus was
on showcasing your best look.

836
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:54,147
But your makeup looks half-done.

837
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:58,693
It doesn't look complete.

838
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,278
I'm really disappointed to say this.

839
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,655

Thank you for your work.

845

No, this can't be!

846
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,084
If she aimed to go easy on the smoky eyes

847
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:17,796
to accentuate the model's eyes,

848
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,839
she failed at that, too.

849
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,049
That's what I think.

850
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:27,180
- I just need to do well on that.
- Yes.

- Yes.

853

- Really?
- Yes.

<i>The best thing about makeup is</i>
<i>its uniqueness.</i>

857

<i>You can be free. There's no right answer.</i>

859

00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,222
It's nice to see such versatility.

864
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:14,769
<i>I've worked backstage</i>
<i>at many international fashion shows.</i>

865
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,106
<i>So, my strength is</i>

866
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,067
<i>the ability to express my unique ideas</i>
<i>in impressive ways.</i>

867
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:24,821
My technique for today in three words is

868
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,447
"whisper and splash."

869
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,408
<i>I'm using vibrant colors</i>

870
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:32,620
<i>with experimental and artistic touches</i>
<i>to achieve the look.</i>

871
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,915
<i>I used TriXera Nutrition Lotion</i>

872
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:39,043
<i>with MAC's Strobe Cream, a tone-up cream,</i>

873
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,838
<i>over the model's face, neck,</i>

874
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,340
<i>and any exposed areas.</i>

875
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,676
<i>That was my quick prep.</i>

876
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:50,305
<i>Then, I used a full coverage product</i>

877
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:54,058
<i>to prepare the skin quickly.</i>

878
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,229
After that, I didn't use

879
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:01,482
an airbrush gun or any fancy tools
to achieve the fun look.

880
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,651
<i>I just prepared the tangerine colors</i>

881
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,237
<i>of a product called Chromacake</i>

882
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,616
<i>with the water spray from Avène.</i>

883
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,410
<i>I used a watercolor paintbrush</i>

884
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,120
<i>to apply the mixture</i>

885
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,372
<i>on the sides of the eyes as a highlight.</i>

886
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,042
<i>Then, I lightly blew on them</i>
<i>using a straw.</i>

887
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,295
He's using his special trick!

888
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,006
You can totally see MACtist's style.

889
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,674
He's so inspiring.

890
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,845
It's a straw show right now.

891
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:32,138
Yes.

892
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,564
You can tell he's experienced
in artistic looks.

893
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,361
<i>I used a toothbrush to splash some color</i>

894
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:49,280
<i>to add a pop of artistry on her face.</i>

895
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:52,659
<i>It was to achieve a tasteful look.</i>

896
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,953
- You can tell
- Yes?

897
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,247
he was born to be a makeup artist
from his moves.

898
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,499
Isn't he so elegant?

899
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,962
I hope the viewers of the show

900
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,630
<i>enjoy what I come up with.</i>

901
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:09,217
<i>I hope this can also encourage them</i>
<i>to be bolder with their makeup.</i>

902
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,845
MACtist, please explain the look.

903
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,973
"Whisper and splash."

904
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:16,933
- "Whisper and splash."
- "Whisper and splash."

905
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,896
<i>I used a straw</i>

906
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,565
<i>and applicators, like a toothbrush,</i>

907
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,944
<i>to splash some colors artfully.</i>

908
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,822
- I focused on showcasing my techniques.
- I see.

909
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,578
Is there an idea
this design was meant to evoke?

910
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,831
- Or is it just about creativity?
- I paid

911
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,917
<i>special attention to applying the colors</i>

912
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:47,088
<i>so they would look good</i>
<i>on the model's facial shape and features.</i>

913
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,465
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

914
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,844
MACtist.

915
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,099
MACtist.

916
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,934
It's a yes from me.

917
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,144
Thank you.

918
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,105
As you explained, it was very unique.

919
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,565
It was very novel.

920
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,109
The look leaves a strong impact.

921
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,778
I could tell
from the direction of the splashes

922
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,864
<i>that he used the straw diagonally</i>

923
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,866
<i>to achieve a unique look.</i>

924
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,826
<i>I could feel his creativity from it.</i>

925
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:20,580
MACtist.

926
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,625
She had this angelic smile
as she opened her mouth,

927
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,627
<i>but she paused!</i>

928
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,087
Here's my decision.

929
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,881
LEE JIN-SOO: PASS

930
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,883
- It's a yes from me.
- Thank you.

931
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,968
MACTIST PASSES

932
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,096
From your basics

933
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,974
to your artistic senses and creativity,

934
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,185
I can tell you're an excellent artist.

935
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,480
You didn't get nervous at all

936
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,524
and showcased your skills perfectly today.
I'm in awe of that.

937
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:49,692
It's a yes from me. Congratulations.

938
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:51,152
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

939
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,571
MACtist has passed.

940
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,867
Please take your brush
and move to the winners' section.

941
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,327
Of course, he worked at MAC!

942
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,539
Great work!

943
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,210
He's so relaxed.

944
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,670
<i>Of course, I have to win!</i>

945
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,548
It's not about the 300 million won.
I'm here to win.

946
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,300
Well, I have to do well to win.

947
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:15,760
Yes, I'll do my best.

948
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,389
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

949
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,850
- You can sit there.
- Okay.

950
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,398
MACTIST

951
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,693
<i>I couldn't see other people's work,</i>

952
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:36,489
but I remember one look very clearly.

953
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,825
<i>It's New York Master's look.</i>

954
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,535
New York Master, Park Seong-hee.

955
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,829
<i>- New York Master.</i>
<i>- New York Master.</i>

956
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,997
I didn't even know she was in Korea.

957
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,542
<i>I really look up to her.</i>

958
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,545
New York Master is amazing.

959
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:52,088
- Hello.
- It's an honor.

960
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,422
Thank you.

961
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,715
My hands are shaking.

962
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,135
- Your hands are shaking!
- It's never happened to me before.

963
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,345
- Her hands are shaking!
- Oh, my.

964
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,347
I can't believe your hands are shaking.

965
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:03,432
Yes, that's how nervous I am.

966
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,726
<i>New York Master has been</i>

967
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,562
on Pat McGrath's team.

968
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,105
Pat McGrath is

969
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:12,483
<i>the world's most-renowned makeup artist.</i>

970
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,862
She worked on her team,

971
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,572
so you know she's very skilled.

972
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,575
<i>I was on Pat McGrath's team,</i>

973
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,785
<i>working behind the scenes</i>

974
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:26,706
<i>for many collection shows</i>
<i>in New York, Milan, and Paris.</i>

975
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,457
<i>I'm now back in Korea,</i>

976
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,710
<i>working as a professor.</i>

977
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,962
- She worked in New York.
- Yes.

978
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,839
- For us, that's our dream.
- Indeed.

979
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,132
- Something I haven't done.
- Yes.

980
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,052
- I want to see Seong-hee's look.
- Same.

981
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,597
Let's make some predictions.

982
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,974
I bet she's going to draw very long wings.

983
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,601
- The Pat McGrath style?
- Yes,

984
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,228
something simple but chic
with one bold point.

985
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,480
My strongest makeup look is

986
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,608
the point eyeliner makeup look.

987
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,278
<i>It only looks good</i>
<i>when the model's face is very clear.</i>

988
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,865
<i>So, I used my favorite facial mist</i>
<i>from Schwanen Garten.</i>

989
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:06,204
<i>Then, I chose the perfect shade</i>
<i>of Face and Body Foundation from MAC.</i>

990
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:08,664
<i>I also used a concealer</i>
<i>with the best texture</i>

991
00:45:08,748 --> 00:45:10,583
<i>from Laura Mercier.</i>

992
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,251
<i>I mixed them</i>

993
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,295
<i>to prep the skin.</i>

994
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,801
The base for the model looks

995
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,638
as perfect as a perfectly roasted egg.

996
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,389
- A roasted egg?
- Yes.

997
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,558
It looks so smooth!

998
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:29,685
I chose a good model.

999
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,605
Yes, but that's not all. It's different.

1000
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,442
<i>Then, I got to her eyes.</i>

1001
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:40,279
<i>I used a very bold black eyeliner</i>
<i>as the highlight.</i>

1002
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,533
She's preparing some intense eyes!

1003
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,119
She's using eyeliner.

1004
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,372
<i>I used a creamy black eyeliner pencil</i>

1005
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:51,999
<i>to draw the lines that I wanted.</i>

1006
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,126
<i>Then, I used a liquid eyeliner</i>

1007
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,212
<i>to make the shapes look</i>

1008
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,339
<i>sharper and bolder.</i>

1009
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,509
That's totally the New York style.

1010
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,344
<i>Then, I used a brush pen eyeliner</i>

1011
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,429
to make the lines very clean.

1012
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:08,182
I mended every part of the lines.

1013
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,521
That's her style. The bold eyeliner.

1014
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:19,610
I kept a close eye on New York Master.

1015
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:22,863
<i>Her eyeliner lines were so clean.</i>

1016
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,782
I thought,
"So that's how it should be done."

1017
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,994
<i>New York Master surely lived up</i>
<i>to her reputation.</i>

1018
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:32,456
Her eyeliner lines were
so clean and sharp.

1019
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,543
<i>That's very hard to achieve,</i>

1020
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:40,131
<i>yet she filled in the lines</i>
<i>without going too much or too little.</i>

1021
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,924
I'm in awe!

1022
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,093
The lines look great.

1023
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,639
<i>For her lips, I used a brownish shade</i>

1024
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,017
<i>to line the outside.</i>

1025
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,728
I like to mix multiple colors.

1026
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,898
So, I used 3 to 4 blushes from NARS

1027
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,900
<i>to make her cheeks look more lively.</i>

1028
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:03,279
It's time for the last touch-up.

1029
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,907
<i>You can't just let makeup be</i>
<i>a part of your life.</i>

1030
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,076
<i>You must bet your entire life on it.</i>

1031
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,411
I'll make it to the top.

1032
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,996
<i>Here I come.</i>

1033
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,040
Oh, Lord.

1034
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,501
New York Master, please explain your look.

1035
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,211
Thank you.

1036
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,131
Since she's in all black,

1037
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:25,259
I've prepared a charismatic look
using bold eyeliner.

1038
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,307
NEW YORK MASTER'S POINT EYELINER MAKEUP

1039
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:35,603
I used my favorite eyeliner from Givenchy
to line her eyes.

1040
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,272
Then, I used Tonymoly's gel liner.

1041
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,650
Finally, to perfect the details,

1042
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,861
I used the liquid eyeliner from Peripera.

1043
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,321
<i>I used three eyeliners</i>
<i>to achieve this look.</i>

1044
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,530
Its longevity must be insane.

1045
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,867
- Yes, it won't smudge.
- No.

1046
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,578
Many details go into creating eye makeup.

1047
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,455
<i>Where the lines go,</i>

1048
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:57,500
<i>and how to work</i>
<i>with the model's natural eyes</i>

1049
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,668
<i>to accentuate them.</i>

1050
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,338
Have you made your decision, Jin-soo?

1051
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,298
Yes.

1052
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,593
<i>I was very intimidated,</i>

1053
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,428
<i>as I'd never been assessed like that.</i>

1054
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,222
<i>I felt as small as a speck of dust.</i>

1055
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,141
New York Master.

1056
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,645
It's a yes from me.

1057
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,021
Thank you!

1058
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,149
How big was the brush?

1059
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,193
It was this big!

1060
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,114
<i>She believed in herself</i>
<i>to keep such a big brush in control!</i>

1061
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,448
It was perfect.

1062
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:33,160
New York Master.

1063
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,456
RISABAE: PASS

1064
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:38,958
It's a yes from me.

1065
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,626
Thank you.

1066
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,128
<i>It was clean.</i>

1067
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,839
How could she be so precise
with lining the eyes

1068
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,882
<i>in such little time?</i>

1069
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,677
You've done an excellent job.

1070
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,345
Thank you so much.

1071
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,222
- Congratulations, and thank you.
- Congratulations.

1072
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,724
New York Master has passed.

1073
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,936
Please take your brush
and move to the winners' section.

1074
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,146
Congratulations.

1075
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,233
NEW YORK MASTER

1076
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:10,614
Congratulations.

1077
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,699
- Thanks.
- Yes.

1078
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,285
- I thought you'd be bored alone.
- Yes.

1079
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,037
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1080
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:19,999
It's so fascinating.

1081
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,459
That's incredible.

1082
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,043
As expected.

1083
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,337
This is the prime spot. Everyone is here.

1084
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,257
- It is!
- It's a rare sight.

1085
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,134
I really wanted to watch her work.

1086
00:49:31,177 --> 00:49:34,805
Who is everyone standing around to see?

1087
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,557
- Detailed Hands.
- Detailed Hands.

1088
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,892
To watch Detailed Hands.

1089
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,728
This is the most popular spot.

1090
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,314
Detailed Hands,
everyone wants to watch you!

1091
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:46,150
- Sorry?
- Everyone's watching you.

1092
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,988
<i>Did everyone want to see</i>
<i>how detailed I was</i>

1093
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,239
because of my name, "Detailed Hands?"

1094
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,075
<i>I was fine with them watching me,</i>

1095
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,077
<i>but it did add some pressure.</i>

1096
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,329
<i>I'm Detailed Hands, after all.</i>

1097
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:01,040
I'll be on top of my game
with the details.

1098
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,293
<i>Some insane color gradients.</i>

1099
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,795
<i>People always ask me</i>

1100
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,257
<i>how I manage to prevent smoky eyes</i>
<i>from looking so heavy.</i>

1101
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:14,929
<i>I spread a thin layer</i>
<i>of black cream eyeshadow using my fingers.</i>

1102
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,100
<i>Then, I used the most finicky product,</i>
<i>a matte black eyeshadow,</i>

1103
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,020
<i>to add some color to her eyelids.</i>

1104
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:26,106
<i>I used gray and black eyeshadows</i>

1105
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,441
<i>to blend out the colors.</i>

1106
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,110
<i>It's about the black to gray transition</i>

1107
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,946
<i>that almost looks</i>
<i>like it's been blurred on a computer.</i>

1108
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,032
<i>It gives a chic look that looks unique.</i>

1109
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:38,285
Her blending is a work of art.

1110
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,538
<i>Detailed Hands!</i>

1111
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:44,041
<i>I was watching her smoky eye look</i>
<i>for a whole while.</i>

1112
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,377
<i>She could've done it in one touch,</i>
<i>but she gave ten touches.</i>

1113
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,463
<i>That was how she got the details right.</i>

1114
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,216
She used a tiny brush
to blend the colors nonstop.

1115
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:54,301
<i>She blended the eyeshadows</i>
<i>for a whole while.</i>

1116
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,220
<i>I wanted to observe that skill,</i>

1117
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,098
<i>so I watched her</i>
<i>almost the entire time.</i>

1118
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:03,143
When I was about halfway done
with her eye makeup,

1119
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,980
<i>I used a black gel liner to line her eyes.</i>

1120
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,481
That's beautiful.

1121
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,359
It's so clean.

1122
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,820
- I know.
- Right? It's very clean.

1123
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,488
Everything is spot-on.

1124
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,200
- The director is impressive as always.
- The director's touch.

1125
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,995
- She's something else.
- She's so talented.

1126
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,663
You can tell she's different.

1127
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:24,290
She is, indeed.

1128
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,002
Gosh, this is thrilling.

1129
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,589
<i>Then, I added a blue-ish gray shadow</i>

1130
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,924
<i>in the center of the eyelid,</i>

1131
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,135
<i>making her eyes look</i>
<i>more three-dimensional.</i>

1132
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,012
Isn't that crazy?

1133
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,638
Look at the work on the eyelids.

1134
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,891
She blended the eyeshadows
and lined the eyes.

1135
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,978
- But it doesn't feel like it's too much.
- No.

1136
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:48,439
I have 15 minutes.

1137
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,191
But I have so much to work on
for the eyes.

1138
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:52,443
Really?

1139
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,320
I'll prepare the base makeup
and everything else first

1140
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,696
before getting back to the eyes.

1141
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,782
I still have a long way to go
with the eyes.

1142
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,159
We only have 15 minutes.

1143
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,411
Yes, so I'll work on the rest

1144
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,913
in the next five minutes.

1145
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,709
<i>Why did those 60 minutes</i>
<i>feel so quick to me?</i>

1146
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,587
<i>This isn't right. I'm Detailed Hands!</i>

1147
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,632
<i>These details weren't perfect enough</i>
<i>for Detailed Hands!</i>

1148
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,009
<i>I hadn't even gotten to</i>
<i>what I wanted to do.</i>

1149
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,220
Oh, no. How did I get this on my finger?

1150
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:22,598
How did I get this on my finger?

1151
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:24,725
Oh, no!

1152
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,477
I left a mole!

1153
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,896
This is terrible.
I need to finish the look!

1154
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,899
<i>I lifted my fingers</i>
<i>after applying the mascara,</i>

1155
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,984
and there was
a blob of the gray eyeshadow.

1156
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:37,029
<i>I had a little over two minutes left</i>
<i>when that happened.</i>

1157
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,907
I'm screwed! What do I do?

1158
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,576
I was completely panicking. I was screwed.

1159
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:43,911
What was I to do?

1160
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,789
<i>I quickly fixed it with a cotton swab.</i>

1161
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,582
<i>But I didn't have enough time,</i>

1162
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,584
<i>so I covered</i>
<i>the smudged eyeshadows on her eyelids</i>

1163
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,295
<i>in one go, as quickly as possible,</i>

1164
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:57,633
<i>using a glittery silver eyeshadow</i>
<i>from Dior.</i>

1165
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,760
<i>I used the eyeshadow to blend</i>
<i>the splotches</i>

1166
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,595
<i>and covered them at once.</i>

1167
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:03,806
Today's theme was showcasing my best look,

1168
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,766
<i>so my focus was on ensuring</i>

1169
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:08,143
<i>that my techniques looked polished.</i>

1170
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,144
Six.

1171
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:10,854

00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,442
- Yes.
- Please explain the look.

1174
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:19,780
I used matte gray and black eyeshadows

1175
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,949
to create a bold look.

1176
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,285
But I kept the gradient very soft
for this smoky eye look.

1177
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,998
DETAILED HANDS' SMOKY EYE MAKEUP

1178
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:34,044
I used a peach-brown-toned blush
around her face

1179
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,587
<i>to add some shine.</i>

1180
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,340
<i>Then, I kept the lips matte</i>
<i>in a similar shade.</i>

1181
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,884
I drew each hair on her eyebrows

1182
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:42,469
to keep them very natural.

1183
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,431
I only filled in the sparse parts.

1184
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,473
<i>I see.</i>

1185
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:49,893
Can we take a closer look?

1186
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,770
Could you close your eyes?

1187
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:55,983
The gradation.

1188
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,110
Could you open your eyes?

1189
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,910
<i>The two judges were standing so closely</i>
<i>to examine the model.</i>

1190
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,371
<i>That made me nervous.</i>
<i>I didn't know what they'd say.</i>

1191
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:12,166
- Should I go first?
- Yes.

1192
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,042

Watching so many artists

00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:57,044
Her details and intentions behind her look

1209
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,879
<i>were so clear to me.</i>

1210
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,839
She was perfect.

1211
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,842
<i>From the gradient in the eye makeup</i>

1212
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,844
<i>to the reach of the gradients,</i>

1213
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,723
she nailed every detail perfectly.

1214
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:13,060
<i>She's truly a makeup master</i>.

1215
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,229
Detailed Hands has passed.

1216
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,607
Please take your brush
and move to the winners' section.

1217
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,776
Thank you.

1218
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,069
Congratulations!

1219
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,615
<i>It was a long walk from my makeup station</i>
<i>to the winners' section.</i>

1220
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,076
<i>I had to hold my tears back on the way.</i>

1221
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,829
I was very worried toward the end,

1222
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,915
<i>but it seems like</i>
<i>I've overcome a big mountain.</i>

1223
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,168
You know what's interesting?

1224
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:39,920
Everyone is almost going at the same pace.

1225
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:42,214
Almost everyone is working
on the eyes now.

1226
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:43,590
Everyone was working on the skin earlier.

1227
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,141
Is she still prepping the model's skin?

1228
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,603
That person hasn't done anything yet.

1229
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:02,651
<i>I was working on the base makeup</i>
<i>until almost 30 minutes into the mission.</i>

1230
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,695
But someone said, "You have 30 minutes."

1231
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,781
I had to tell myself,
"Snap out of it. This is a survival show."

1232
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,534
You have 30 minutes.

1233
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,456
<i>Hello, I'm Cheongdam Master.</i>

1234
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,877
About 20 years ago, when I was 21,

1235
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,130
I started working at the source
of every makeup boutique,

1236
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,798
<i>RA Beauty Core.</i>

1237
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,801
<i>After that, I worked</i>
<i>at JUNG SAEM MOOL Inspiration.</i>

1238
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:29,344
<i>I was at Yoning for a bit</i>

1239
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:30,470
<i>before moving to CHAHONG ARDOR.</i>

1240
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,181
Lastly, I worked at Bit.Boot,
another makeup boutique.

1241
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,975
I wanted to open my own shop,

1242
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:37,519
<i>so I opened A KNACK TOOL in Cheongdam,</i>

1243
00:56:37,603 --> 00:56:39,897
<i>where I'm a makeup artist to this day.</i>

1244
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,900
<i>I can pull off very versatile looks</i>

1245
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,818
now that I've worked at so many boutiques.

1246
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:47,738
<i>I'm going to cram all the skills</i>
<i>I've built over 20 years</i>

1247
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,031
<i>to work on this look.</i>

1248
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:50,908
<i>My priority is to accentuate</i>

1249
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,951
the model's natural skin base

1250
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,995
as much as possible within the 60 minutes.

1251
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,914
<i>I'm ready to accept it</i>
<i>if the judges find it too plain.</i>

1252
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,292
Regardless of the result,
my goal is to keep it natural.

1253
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,545
<i>I believe my strength lies</i>
<i>in applying the base makeup.</i>

1254
00:57:03,629 --> 00:57:05,172
CHEONGDAM MASTER'S NATURAL CONTOUR MAKEUP

1255
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,050
I wanted to accentuate
the model's natural skin.

1256
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,011
<i>The look may seem a bit weak,</i>

1257
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:13,680
but the point of the look is the base,
designed to resemble her skin.

1258
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:16,892
I tried to feature her natural skin more.

1259
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,518
<i>Okay.</i>

1260
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,695
I've made my decision.

1261
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,572
Cheongdam Master.

1262
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:34,201
Cheongdam Master, it's a yes from me.

1263
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,203
SEO OK: PASS

1264
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:39,790
First, I believe it's difficult
to line the eyes appropriately,

1265
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,751
<i>but you followed the model's natural eyes</i>
<i>for the eyeliner</i>

1266
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,378
<i>while making them look more balanced.</i>

1267
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,046
I really commend you for that.

1268
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,465
The end of the eyeliner.

1269
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,467
There's a point
at which the eyeliner can reach

1270
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,594
to make the eyes look more expansive.

1271
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,180
<i>She seemed to know that exact point.</i>

1272
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,058
It was also nice to see

1273
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,394
how considerate you were
by using cotton tips

1274
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,229
to minimize touching the model's face.

1275
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,523
<i>I didn't want the skin-to-skin contact</i>

1276
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,234
to melt her base makeup.

1277
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,070
So I used the cotton swabs
for surgical dressing

1278
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:12,864
<i>to touch her face in the process,</i>
<i>as I usually did.</i>

1279
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,742
Director Seo Ok noticed that,

1280
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,245
<i>which proved to me</i>
<i>that she was a judge for a reason.</i>

1281
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:23,083
Cheongdam Master.

1282
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,084
Yes.

1283
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,628
I'm in a pickle.

1284
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:29,631
She was my student.

1285
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:32,509
She was my student.

1286
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,349
She's an excellent artist.

1287
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:44,104
<i>I learned all my skills</i>
<i>from Director Jung,</i>

1288
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,856
<i>so I'm sure I'll get a pass.</i>

1289
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,609
It's a no from me.

1290
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:54,281
CHEONGDAM MASTER IS ON HOLD

1291
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,616
She's harsher on her former students.

1292
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:58,493
Here's why.

1293
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,620
I need to see

1294
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,123
the artist's confidence
in her use of colors.

1295
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:06,960
But your confidence was lukewarm.

1296
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:11,131
I know you went for a natural makeup look,

1297
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:14,634
but I couldn't see
any clear use of colors in the look.

1298
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:18,346
So, Cheongdam Master,
I'm putting you on hold.

1299
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,808
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1300
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,186
<i>I can't help it if I fail.</i>

1301
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,147
I also can't help it
that I couldn't show my best.

1302
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:31,818
Director Jung's feedback made me
reflect on myself.

1303
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:34,321
I love the look.

1304
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,614
- Do you?
- Yes.

1305
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,074
Thank you.

1306
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,409
I'm happy, then.

1307
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:41,828
That's good enough for me.

1308
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,497
As long as the model is happy.

1309
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,297
- Ma'am?
- Hey.

1310
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,340
Ma'am!

1311
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,512
Why aren't you in the makeup room?

1312
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,971
I quit.

1313
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,849
<i>Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room is</i>

1314
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:06,269
an old colleague of mine

1315
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,355
<i>from the makeup room</i>
<i>in the MBC News Department.</i>

1316
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,775
<i>Hello, I'm Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room.</i>

1317
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,654
<i>I worked for MBC for about 14 years,</i>

1318
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:18,406
and now, I manage my own boutique.

1319
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,034
<i>Most of my clients are from MBC,</i>

1320
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:24,704
<i>such as Kim Dae-ho and Kim Su-zy.</i>

1321
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:25,580
KIM DAE-HO
ANCHORMAN

1322
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,998
You used to work in Yeouido.

1323
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,959
- Yes, when MBC was in Yeouido.
- Exactly.

1324
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,086
- RISABAE, too.
- Yes.

1325
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,380
- She was also there.
- Yes, she was.

1326
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,048
- There have to be races there, right?
- Like what?

1327
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,508
Like "Who can wash brushes the quickest?"

1328
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:43,932
Will you show us the look
of a TV news anchor?

1329
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:47,102
Yes, I'm preparing
the look of a news anchor.

1330
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:50,897
I look forward to seeing
the sickeningly perfect symmetry.

1331
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:56,194
News anchors face the front, don't smile,

1332
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,572
<i>and deliver all kinds of news,</i>

1333
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,574
<i>so it's all about symmetry.</i>

1334
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,577
The brow bone on this side is higher.

1335
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,745
<i>But the model didn't have</i>

1336
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,874
<i>the ideal brow shape for me to work with,</i>

1337
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,085
<i>so my biggest focus was</i>
<i>on making the brows look even.</i>

1338
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,427
She seems to be working on the brows.

1339
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,599
- Hello, Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room.
- Hello!

1340
01:01:25,891 --> 01:01:28,518
You're using
a very long-lasting foundation.

1341
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:30,437
- I'm keeping it matte.
- Matte?

1342
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,690
Yes, I usually use semi-matte products

1343
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,150
to prevent light reflections.

1344
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,776
<i>When lights reflect your face,</i>

1345
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,153
that's where people's eyes go,

1346
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,988
which can be distracting
from watching the news.

1347
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:43,450
<i>That's why I use matte skin products</i>
<i>for TV shows.</i>

1348
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:47,204
<i>And if a news anchor's eyeliner wings are</i>
<i>too short,</i>

1349
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,456
<i>their eyes may look dull.</i>

1350
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,792
<i>So, I kept the wings pretty long.</i>

1351
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,252
<i>As for the cheeks,</i>

1352
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,880
blusher can be mistaken
for an emotional flush,

1353
01:01:56,963 --> 01:02:00,467
<i>which is why I've only added</i>
<i>a very light amount.</i>

1354
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:04,262
<i>As news anchors have to talk a lot,</i>

1355
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,807
<i>I applied serum to the model's lips</i>
<i>to keep them from drying.</i>

1356
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:11,978
<i>I used the highlighter on her nose bridge</i>
<i>and the inner corners of her eyes</i>

1357
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:15,732
to bring attention
to the center of her face.

MS. KIM FROM THE MAKEUP ROOM'S
NEWS ANCHOR MAKEUP

1360
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,247
As news anchors deliver news
about accidents and such,

1361
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:32,791
their makeup cannot be too colorful

1362
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,751
<i>or too sparkly with big glitter particles.</i>

1363
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,797
<i>Instead, they look best</i>
<i>with an elegant and approachable look.</i>

1364
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:42,008
This is basically the look
I apply to my clients every day.

1365
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:45,845
<i>She really looks like a news anchor.</i>

1366
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,851
Can I check if her face is symmetrical?

1367
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,608
<i>I was extra nervous,</i>

1368
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:01,403
<i>as I expected RISABAE to be extra strict</i>

1369
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,863
<i>because we were coworkers.</i>

1370
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,409
Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room,

01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,045
the quintessential news anchor makeup.

1376
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,339
<i>You made her face look</i>
<i>perfectly symmetrical,</i>

1377
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,552
and you've done a great job

1378
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,889
<i>at considering the lighting</i>
<i>and what to feature.</i>

1379
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,474
<i>You've featured all the right things.</i>

1380
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,892
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1381
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,230
Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room.

1382
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:38,356
Here's my decision.

1383
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,402
Here's my decision.

1384
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,238
- It's a yes from me.
- Thank you.

1385
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,658
- It's a yes from me.
- Thank you.

1386
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:52,954
<i>I was amazed by</i>
<i>how different the brows looked.</i>

1387
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:56,708
<i>And since news anchors have to talk a lot,</i>

1388
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:58,501
people pay a lot of attention
to their lips.

1389
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,670
So they must have very symmetrical lips.

1390
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:04,799
<i>It was as if she had used a ruler</i>
<i>to line her lips.</i>

1391
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,843
<i>The lips were perfectly symmetrical.</i>

1392
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:09,262
Fourteen years. That's...

1393
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,432
How did she work there
for 14 years, right?

1394
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,267
You can tell that she's worked there
for 14 years.

1395
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,728
- For sure.
- She's different, right?

1396
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:26,821
Hello.

1397
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:28,281
- Hello.
- Hello.

1398
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:29,783
"Two for Ji-hyo"?

1399
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,368
- Yes, I'm pregnant.
- I see!

1400
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,786
So, "Two for Ji-hyo."

1401
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,787
- Because there are two!
- Yes.

1402
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:35,038
How many months?

1403
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,498
- Nine months.
- Really?

1404
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,541
I started my makeup journey
because of you.

1405
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:39,584
Really?

1406
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:43,380
You got your makeup done
by the contestant from Busan, right?

1407
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:44,923
That's right!

1408
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,257
I always see you on TV!

1409
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,676
- I love your style!
- Thank you!

1410
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,886
Please give me a makeover someday.

1411
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,971
I named my daughter Lee Hyo-ri.

1412
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,056
- Really?
- Yes.

1413
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,641
Because I love you so much.

1414
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,142
I hope you don't get nervous.

1415
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,186
Does Pungja have a day off today?

1416
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,772
- No, but someone is filling in for me.
- I see, someone else.

1417
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,148
I apologized to her.

1418
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,234
- You're so skilled.
- Thank you.

1419
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,443
Hello.

1420
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,738
I heard there was a handsome artist.

1421
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,824
I was a student of First Man,
Park Tae-yun.

1422
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,325
- Really?
- Yes.

1423
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,620
- He's very famous.
- Yes, so famous.

1424
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,163
FIRST MAN

1425
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:18,873
I can't believe he's in front of me.

1426
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:22,710
I wanted to become a makeup artist
after watching First Man's show.

1427
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:24,003
- Really?
- Yes, as a kid.

1428
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:25,422
<i>You watched Get It Beauty, right?</i>

1429
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,173
<i>- Back in the day? Yes.</i>
<i>- Yes, back then.</i>

1430
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:30,051
There are so many contestants
from <i>Get It Beauty</i>.

1431
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:34,431
<i>There are so many master artists</i>

1432
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:37,434
whom I watched growing up
on<i> Get It Beauty.</i>

1433
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,686
<i>When I was in middle school,</i>

1434
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,729
<i>I saw those artists</i>

1435
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:43,314
<i>- on shows like Get It Beauty.</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

1436
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,358
<i>- That was how I found my passion.</i>
<i>- Same.</i>

1437
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:47,569
<i>I saw the pioneers of the industry</i>

1438
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,071
<i>who I used to see on TV.</i>

1439
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,991
<i>I couldn't believe</i>

1440
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,534
<i>they were here to compete.</i>

1441
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,537
<i>I learned a lot from her videos</i>

1442
01:05:57,579 --> 01:05:58,663
<i>back in the day.</i>

1443
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:02,709
I saw this artist and realized
I wanted to become a brand artist.

1444
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,252
<i>So, it was a huge surprise to see him.</i>

1445
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,170
BEAUTY KINGSMAN

1446
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:07,046
I feel like he doesn't need to be here.

1447
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,257
<i>Man of the Cannes.</i>

1448
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:12,302
<i>I was so blown away and excited</i>
<i>to see him.</i>

1449
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,805
<i>Hello, I'm a makeup artist of 27 years,</i>

1450
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:17,182
<i>Man of the Cannes.</i>

1451
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:20,101
I was in charge of makeup

1452
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,895
<i>for Song Kang-ho and other men</i>

1453
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,772
<i>from the Parasite cast</i>
<i>for the Cannes Film Festival.</i>

1454
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:28,151
And I recently visited Europe
to hold a masterclass.

1455
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,777
<i>I spend a lot of time</i>

1456
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:32,030
traveling around Europe
to spread K-beauty.

1457
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,282
<i>Of course, my goal is to win.</i>

1458
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,035
<i>I'm Hwang Bang-hoon, or Easy Man.</i>

1459
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:40,288
I usually take VIP clients.

1460
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,582
The clients are from the famous S Group,

1461
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,542
the H Group, and so on.

1462
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,378
<i>Hello, I'm Kim Seung-won, Beauty Kingsman.</i>

1463
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:50,590
I was the first Asian international artist
for Dior.

1464
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,219
<i>I believe I was the only artist</i>
<i>active all over the world,</i>

1465
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,763
<i>from Southeast Asia to Europe.</i>

1466
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:58,306
<i>I noticed him immediately.</i>

1467
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,392
His fashion and style are always the same.

1468
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,603
<i>He was my role model when I was little.</i>

1469
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,359
Oh, my! He's using his fingers!

1470
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,237
Seung-won is known for using his fingers

1471
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,113
- Really?
- to put on makeup.

1472
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,949
- I didn't know.
- He works incredibly quickly.

1473
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,785
<i>- He always did that on Get It Beauty.</i>
<i>- Right!</i>

1474
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,412
- He was always so fast with his fingers.
- Yes, he's really fast.

1475
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,622
That's so cool!

1476
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:23,998
- How does he do that with his fingers?
- I know!

1477
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,335
It's hard to believe it,
even as you watch him.

1478
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,963
He just swipes away. Like, what?

1479
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,341
That's fascinating!

1480
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,969
To be honest, I do enjoy some competition.

1481
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:38,555
<i>There are many competitive artists here,</i>

1482
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:41,474
<i>so I know I can't be too relaxed.</i>

1483
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,811
My makeup look is called "fashion makeup."

1484
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,272
<i>It reflects the 2025 trend, "dark siren."</i>

1485
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:50,942
<i>It's a tasteful makeup</i>
<i>that accentuates the eyes.</i>

1486
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:53,486
BEAUTY KINGSMAN'S DARK SIREN MAKEUP

1487
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:57,657
Did you purposely give
this shape and texture

1488
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,367
- to the brows?
- Yes.

1489
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,996
<i>I didn't like that the brows curved</i>
<i>when her eyes opened.</i>

1490
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:04,497
<i>But I purposely drew them</i>
<i>so they appeared straight.</i>

1491
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:14,841
- Have you decided?
- Ready?

1492
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,800
- Should we announce it?
- Yes.

1493
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:18,136
- Beauty Kingsman.
- Yes.

1494
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,471
<i>I didn't want them</i>

1495
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,015
<i>to feel uneasy about critiquing me.</i>

1496
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,017
<i>I wanted honest and objective feedback.</i>

1497
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:27,186
They must be judging the contestants, too.

1498
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,692
My theme was "the classic."

1499
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,153
<i>When I think of "classic,"</i>
<i>I think of the signature red lips.</i>

1500
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,697
<i>I used different shades of red</i>

1501
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:38,781
<i>to achieve the look.</i>

1502
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:49,917
<i>Usually, I never get nervous.</i>

1503
01:08:50,001 --> 01:08:51,711
<i>I've been on quite a lot of shows,</i>

1504
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,046
<i>so I rarely get nervous.</i>

1505
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,839
<i>But I felt so nervous on this show.</i>

1506
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,884
- We've reached a decision.
- Yes.

1507
01:08:58,593 --> 01:08:59,719
I'll announce my decision.

1508
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,389
I'll announce my decision.

1509
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,642
It's a no from me.

1510
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,977
It's a no from me.

1511
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,065
I'll announce my decision.

1512
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,278
It's a no from me.

1513
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,239
MAN OF THE CANNES IS OUT

1514
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,283
- Did he get eliminated?
- He did!

1515
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,161
Did he get eliminated?

1516
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,830
- Kyung-sik has been eliminated?
- Yes.

1517
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:31,000
It's too classic to be considered

1518
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,460
<i>a modern look.</i>

1519
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,214
<i>But it doesn't feel nostalgic</i>

1520
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,883
to be considered classic.

1521
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:41,928
<i>I also took into account</i>
<i>his years of experience.</i>

1522
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,889
Couldn't he have made the model look
more classic?

1523
01:09:45,264 --> 01:09:47,433
It would've been nice if you had
done something with her features,

1524
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,394
<i>which are crowded in the center.</i>

1525
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,771
- You're a master, after all.
- Yes.

1526
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,315
- Easy Man, you've been eliminated.
- Thank you.

1527
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:55,692
Thank you.

1528
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,985
- Beauty Kingsman.
- Yes.

1529
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:00,947
- I voted to eliminate you.
- Yes, sir.

1530
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:04,450
The brows and the eye makeup felt...

1531
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:07,954
It felt unbalanced somehow.

1532
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,289
It's all about the balance, in the end.

1533
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,291
- I voted to eliminate you.
- Yes, ma'am.

1534
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,211
I don't doubt his talent
on any other look.

1535
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,963
But just based on today's look,

1536
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:19,173
<i>his work didn't look balanced.</i>

1537
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:21,134
It didn't make my heart beat.

1538
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,344
Did he get eliminated?

1539
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:24,387
BEAUTY KINGSMAN IS OUT

1540
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,305
I was in awe of him using his fingers

1541
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,765
to add such fine details.

1542
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:29,892
But the look itself resembled

1543
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,353
the Dior look in the John Galliano days.

1544
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:34,897
But that trend hasn't returned
as vintage yet.

1545
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,358
<i>It's too early. It still looks tacky.</i>

1546
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:39,235
Seniority really means nothing here.

1547
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,154
No, it doesn't.

1548
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:44,615
Wait. Director Hwang
isn't coming here, either.

1549
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,993
I'm shocked he's been eliminated.

1550
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:47,994
Tell me about it.

1551
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:49,829
I was sure that he'd pass.

1552
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:54,167
Even the calm contestants
are getting anxious

1553
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:56,252
after seeing such masters get eliminated.

1554
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:59,380
It must feel like
there is greater pressure.

1555
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,299
- First Man.
- Hello.

1556
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,842
- Hello.
- Yes.

1557
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,511
- What's the theme of today's look?
- Today,

1558
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:08,431
I'm preparing the look
of a supermodel in the 1990s.

1559
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,016
He's also prepared

1560
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,560
a look of the 1990s.

1561
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,645
The challenge behind a classic look is

1562
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:16,439
that it can look very outdated.

1563
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,399
He's also going for the classic look.

1564
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,195
Will he pass?

1565
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,321
Let's see.

1566
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:28,993
First Man.

1567
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,661
I did not see that coming.

1568
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:33,331
- Not at all.
- What a surprise.

1569
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,932
