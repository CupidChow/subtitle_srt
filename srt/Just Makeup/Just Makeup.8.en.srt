1
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:08,475
A world transformed by makeup,
JUST MAKEUP.

2
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,144
Welcome to the semifinals.

3
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,251
You all look nervous and excited.

4
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:21,087
Today, the top three finalists

5
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,656
will be decided.

6
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,527
MACtist, you are dressed up
in a suit today.

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,029
Is there any special reason?

8
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,999
I wanted to look decent and serious today.

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:37,037
I've prepared to show you
a new side of myself

10
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,339
- that you haven't seen yet.
- All right.

11
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:40,774
I look forward to it.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,076
The New Face Round is a mission

13
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,611
that will determine

14
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,312
the top three finalists of JUST MAKEUP,

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,014
where you must create

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,151
a new face that has never existed before
with makeup.

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,961
Amazing.

18
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,431
What do we do now?

19
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,332
<i>My heart almost stopped.</i>

20
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,501
So, this is the joy of creation.

21
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,870
<i>They are true artists. It's crazy.</i>

22
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,339
<i>This is no joke.</i>

23
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,308
<i>How can makeup make someone cry like this?</i>

24
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,877
<i>- We have to choose just one here.</i>
<i>- What do we do?</i>

25
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:18,912
ONLY THE 1ST PLACE ADVANCES TO THE FINALS
<i>We're in trouble.</i>

26
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,314
The contestant
to advance to the finals is...

27
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,282
Congratulations.

28
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,419
Saem-mool.

29
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,556
What is the significance of this round?

30
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,593
This is a mission to showcase
the creativity of makeup artists

31
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:39,032
and bring to life
the images you have always imagined.

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:44,437
I look forward to seeing some shocking,
never-before-seen new faces.

33
00:01:45,138 --> 00:01:47,974
Some shocking,
never-before-seen new faces.

34
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,409
Did you all hear that?

35
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,677
- Yes.
- Yes.

36
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:54,347
Now, we will reveal the makeup room

37
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,484
where New Face, the semifinals,
will take place.

38
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,119
What? Is it here?

39
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,124
- What?
- My gosh.

40
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,692
What? What's going on?

41
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,129
- The back is opening.
- It's behind us.

42
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,165
- What?
- My gosh.

43
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,404
This is so cool.

44
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,974
<i>The beautiful makeup room has opened.</i>

45
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,176
<i>There are only ten spots.</i>

46
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,645
<i>We have tables for just ten contestants.</i>

47
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:28,915
<i>In there, you can fully display</i>
<i>your unique talents</i>

48
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>and create beautiful new faces.</i>

49
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,954
- This is so cool.
- Yes!

50
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,057
I wish I could go there too.

51
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,460
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

52
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,803
Everyone's so cool today.

53
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,371
- Why do I feel so touched
- Yes.

54
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,807
- as I see their backs?
- They're so cool.

55
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,945
So, this is my stage.

56
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,082
<i>Why am I feeling so nervous in this round?</i>

57
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,152
Isn't MACtist being too quiet today?

58
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,420
He looks so gentle.

59
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,658
<i>I felt pressured to do better</i>

60
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:15,095
<i>on behalf of my teammates,</i>
<i>whom I respected.</i>

61
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,597
I'm at war right now.

62
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,668
The first mission of New Face.

63
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,805
WHEN THE SEMIFINAL MISSION WAS REVEALED
You must all be dying to know the topic.

64
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,609
I will show you the first theme.

65
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,419
What is it?

66
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,056
Is it a fashion show?

67
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,665
The first theme is high fashion.

68
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,934
- High fashion?
- Oh, I see.

69
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,574
<i>It is the work of designer Park Youn-hee,</i>
<i>a pioneer in the fashion world.</i>

70
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,944
<i>This series brings together</i>
<i>the intense cultural fever of the 1970s</i>

71
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,948
<i>and the essence</i>
<i>of 21st-century modern design.</i>

72
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,085
<i>This print goes</i>
<i>beyond simple floral motifs</i>

73
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:16,122
<i>to visually express</i>
<i>love, peace, and freedom.</i>

74
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,924
MISSION 1: HIGH FASHION, CREATE A NEW FACE
WITH GREEDILOUS 2025 SS COLLECTION

75
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,628
Now then, please bring in the models.

76
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:24,064
MISSION 1: HIGH FASHION

77
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,270
All right, let me see.

78
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,216
They're all so cool.

79
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:45,652
- Hello.
- Hello.

80
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:48,722
Hello.

81
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,394
These stunning models,
whose mere presence is enough to impress,

82
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,529
are here to join us today.

83
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,099
The time limit for this mission
is 60 minutes.

84
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,204
And only one contestant
will survive after this mission.

85
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,506
ONLY 1 CONTESTANT WILL SURVIVE

86
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,808
The first mission is High Fashion.

87
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,578
Please start the mission now.

88
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,387
Let's do this.

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,662
- Your skin is a little dry, isn't it?
- Yes.

90
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,732
I really like this product nowadays.

91
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,567
I like that as well.

92
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,036
- This brand is good, right?
- Yes.

93
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,871
A lot of people use it.
Please close your eyes.

94
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:42,809
What we're looking for
isn't just a pretty face, right?

95
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,511
- Yes. It's high fashion.
- Right.

96
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,913
They have to create a new face.

97
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,884
And the models are
all wearing the same patterns.

98
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,586
The makeup must match
the look of their outfits.

99
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,390
<i>To match this outfit,</i>

100
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:02,295
<i>I thought a slightly classic look</i>
<i>would be more appropriate for the makeup.</i>

101
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,764
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who expressed this theme properly.</i>

102
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,801
- Did you make this yourself?
- Yes.

103
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,569
I went to a shopping mall,

104
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:13,239
- bought some sequins, and glued them on.
- I see.

105
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,408
<i>After an overseas collection is finished,</i>

106
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,244
<i>I create trendy makeup to match the look.</i>

107
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,680
<i>That's what I've been doing for decades.</i>

108
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,815
<i>So,</i>

109
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,485
the theme I'm most confident in
is High Fashion.

110
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,021
This is very colorful.

111
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32,859
I will mainly use the key colors
of the Greedilous look.

112
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:35,095
I think they are going
with two completely different themes.

113
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,465
<i>They are either using objects</i>
<i>or the play of colors.</i>

114
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,767
<i>Right. Objects or colors.</i>

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,503
This must be really tough.

116
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,942
MISSION 1: HIGH FASHION
JUDGING BEGINS

117
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:52,345
Thank you all for your hard work.

118
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,483
Before we check your work,

119
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,019
there is a special guest we need to meet.

120
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,054
She must be here.

121
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,457
She's the designer of our first theme,
High Fashion.

122
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,961
<i>A fashion pioneer</i>
<i>known for her unique glamor</i>

123
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:12,332
<i>and groundbreaking designs,</i>
<i>Designer Park Youn-hee is here.</i>

124
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:16,970
She's so cool.

125
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,272
- Hello.
- Hello.

126
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,743
She looks amazing.

127
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,878
Hello.

128
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:28,415
Hello. I'm Designer Park Youn-hee.

129
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,654
We will now see
how Designer Park Youn-hee's outfits

130
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,391
have been completed with your makeup.

131
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:43,496
Let's take a look at your work
for the first mission, High Fashion.

132
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,166
I'm so curious to see how it turned out.

133
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,434
- I know.
- Right.

134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,836
Even with 20 minutes left,

135
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,605
a lot of the contestants
were only halfway done.

136
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,342
- I wonder if they have completed it.
- Right.

137
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,744
Please bring in the models.

138
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:03,049
I bet they will look amazing.

139
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:13,093
- How cool.
- My goodness.

140
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,196
- Like this?
- What?

141
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,697
- My gosh.
- This is amazing.

142
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:30,310
So pretty.

143
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,478
Looks great.

144
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,382
Whose work is this?

145
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,916
Oh Dolce Vita.

146
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,693
It's pretty. It looks nice.

147
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,163
This is unconventional.

148
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,265
Is this Golden Hand in Paris's work?

149
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,633
No. It's First Man's.

150
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,442
My goodness. This is a killer.

151
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,212
I love it.

152
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,716
This is crazy, seriously.

153
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,553
It's shooting laser beams.

154
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,121
Did you add LED lights?

155
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,490
This is crazy!

156
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,224
They look pretty.

157
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,198
- So cool.
- That was amazing, everyone.

158
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,866
Let's give them a big hand.

159
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:07,507
Since this is the round of New Face,
you have created ten different new faces.

160
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:10,977
Let's hear the designer's thoughts first.

161
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,047
I designed this series

162
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,082
- inspired by the 1970s.
- Yes.

163
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,786
It was a truly revolutionary era,

164
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,621
both culturally and fashion-wise.

165
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,458
And what is all this?
This is like a revolution in makeup.

166
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:28,294
- Thank you.
- I was really shocked.

167
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,197
The designer seems very satisfied.

168
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:36,002
Now, we will begin the judging in earnest.

169
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,537
Is this the evaluation stage?

170
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,775
- My goodness.
- It lights up as well.

171
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,910
I didn't know we'd be going up there.

172
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,248
MACtist, please come up to the platform
with your model.

173
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,991
He's walking like his model.

174
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,929
He prepared this.

175
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,764
Yes, I think he prepared it.

176
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,534
Did he get the same kind of jacket
on purpose?

177
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,071
He has worked with us
on a lot of our collections.

178
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,273
- He's so funny.
- He's hilarious.

179
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:19,079
MACtist made a cool appearance
as if he were walking

180
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,847
on the catwalk.

181
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,183
This is MACtist's work.

182
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,187
It's so cool.

183
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,089
The close-ups are taken
in such high definition.

184
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:32,525
When I received the outfit,

185
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,494
I first considered how to make

186
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:37,764
the designer's work stand out even more.

187
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,034
My goal was to make the model's face

188
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,771
<i>blend into the look</i>
<i>without standing out too much.</i>

189
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,974
So I expressed the perfection

190
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,411
of the colors and the tailored jacket
with the eyebrows.

191
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,214
<i>I used red powdered blush</i>

192
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,549
<i>to create a structure for the eyebrows.</i>

193
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:02,055
<i>Then I used liquid lipstick</i>
<i>to define the texture of the eyebrows.</i>

194
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:07,427
<i>I focused on the eyebrows.</i>

195
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:11,698
I've completed
very elaborately tailored eyebrows.

196
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,834
Now, the judges will go up on the stage

197
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:19,139
and take a closer look
at the model's face.

198
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,009
We can see it clearly
even without looking up close.

199
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,412
Why bother looking so close
when we have such a big close-up?

200
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,592
The pale skin makes the red
stand out even more.

201
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,796
I think he worked on the base
with a good understanding of lighting.

202
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,065
- It looks perfect even on screen.
- Right.

203
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,868
He also expressed the texture
of the eyebrows well.

204
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,504
The texture is slightly powdery.

205
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:56,476
Did you use any special products
to enhance the blush or skin tone?

206
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:02,248
I added a very fine highlighter here

207
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,784
<i>and then sprayed the oil mist by HERA.</i>

208
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:08,021
<i>I wanted to create a slightly more glossy,</i>

209
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:10,690
<i>satin-like finish, but from a distance,</i>

210
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,360
- I wanted it to look incredibly smooth.
- I see.

211
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,096
The texture looked soft and fuzzy,

212
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,232
but it seemed somehow different.
That's why I asked.

213
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,934
- Okay.
- Thank you.

214
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,339
- It's pretty.
- It is. He did a good job.

215
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,042
What do the judges think?

216
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:34,614
How you highlighted the eyebrows
and expressed the texture of the skin

217
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:40,453
was delicately expressed
under the intense runway lighting.

218
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,858
I have a slightly different opinion.

219
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:49,396
Even though this is a high-fashion runway,

220
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:51,631
it is still a makeup competition.

221
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:54,634
competition. And I had high expectations

222
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,103
for MACtist's potential.

223
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,307
So I wish there had been something
more intense.

224
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,308
I see.

225
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,011
What do you think, Youn-hee?

226
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:09,916
I've closely observed the makeup style

227
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:13,486
and direction of MACtist,

228
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:17,724
so I can really feel the intensity

229
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:21,661
that this burgundy eyebrow color conveys.

230
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:23,763
It shows a broad spectrum.

231
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,500
I think it's been a while
since he's shown such serious makeup.

232
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:30,704
This is the first time
I've seen you look this serious.

233
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:35,742
It's not like you, MACtist.

234
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:37,243
I see.

235
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,512
MACtist, please go back to your seat.

236
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,348
- Thank you for your work.
- Thank you.

237
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,486
That was cool.

238
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,590
I think it was a perfect look.

239
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:58,098
Makeup Trendsetter, please come up
to the platform with your model.

240
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,570
This is Makeup Trendsetter's work.

241
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,139
It's pretty.

242
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,844
The 1970s were a time
of many different trends.

243
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,613
But among all those trends,
I focused on naturalism.

244
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,817
I created a soft, natural expression
around the eyes,

245
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:19,652
like a blooming flower.

246
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,189
And I wanted to express
feminine strength on the lips.

247
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,791
I tried to express

248
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:27,627
<i>an edge in simplicity</i>
<i>and a beauty embraced by freedom.</i>

249
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,631
So, did you use

250
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,967
- the powder you had on the lips?
- Yes.

251
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:37,737
<i>I wanted to express the natural look</i>
<i>of dandelion seeds.</i>

252
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:40,040
<i>- For a fluffy texture?</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

253
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,375
- The lip makeup is beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

254
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:46,012
I think the look really stands out
because the intense energy

255
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,615
and vibrancy of the red color
really shine through.

256
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:52,585
Swag Maker, please come up
to the platform with your model.

257
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,723
The vibrant colors.

258
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,558
They're so pretty.

259
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,696
I tried to capture
the overall vibe of the 1970s,

260
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,732
like punk and disco, through makeup.

261
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,135
For the lips, I also tried to capture

262
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:12,572
<i>the retro feel of the 1970s' lip liners.</i>

263
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,909
Next is Makeup Model Student's work.

264
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:22,215
I thought it would be nice

265
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:27,053
to express love, freedom,
and peace together.

266
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,757
<i>With the red color, I expressed love.</i>

267
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,260
<i>The heart shape is unusual</i>
<i>and free-spirited.</i>

268
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:40,734
<i>And the white part between</i>
<i>the red lips and lines represents peace.</i>

269
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,138
<i>That's how I came up with the makeup</i>
<i>that shows love, freedom, and peace.</i>

270
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,775
The makeup looks
very thorough and meticulous.

271
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,076
- She's diligent.
- Right.

272
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,545
Just like her nickname,

273
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:56,016
Makeup Model Student applied
her makeup thoroughly and diligently.

274
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,553
Oh Dolce Vita, please come up
to the platform with your model.

275
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:11,865
<i>For high fashion, it's important</i>
<i>to complete the outfit with makeup.</i>

276
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:14,534
<i>Actually, that's</i>
<i>what I'm most confident about.</i>

277
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,705
- The model looks so cool.
- It's amazing.

278
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,140
The look is very androgynous.

279
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,877
She looks charismatic.

280
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,247
When you look at Designer Park's clothes,

281
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,383
the patterns are incredibly flashy,
and the colors are so pretty.

282
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:34,220
So it easily reminds you
of using colorful blushes.

283
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:37,791
Which is why
I didn't want to try that today.

284
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:41,528
Everyone was so good
at creating the look with blushes.

285
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:44,998
...like a blooming flower.

286
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:47,067
With the red color...

287
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,003
The intense cultural fever of the 1970s...

288
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,772
I wanted to try something different,

289
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,908
so I didn't use any red colors
on the face.

290
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:58,445
Hang on. I need to really focus now.

291
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,415
<i>For the underliner,</i>

292
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,884
<i>I added a clear green tone,</i>
<i>like the one in the outfit,</i>

293
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,588
<i>and an edgy eyeliner</i>
<i>with a touch of green,</i>

294
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,490
<i>a color that symbolizes peace.</i>

295
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,094
<i>I wanted to create eyes</i>

296
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,496
<i>that were rebellious and determined,</i>
<i>reminiscent of the 70s.</i>

297
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,832
<i>That's why I came up</i>
<i>with that kind of makeup look.</i>

298
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:25,071
Did you intentionally apply

299
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:27,674
matte eyeshadow to the eyelids?

300
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:32,178
I wanted to emphasize the glitter
under the eyes,

301
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:36,616
so I used matte liner
and matte eyeshadow on the lids.

302
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,453
Does the eyeshadow have glitter in it?

303
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,822
- It does.
- Really?

304
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,225
When Oh Dolce Vita's model

305
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,361
was the first to show up on the catwalk,

306
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,631
<i>the makeup looked simple</i>
<i>and yet quite impactful.</i>

307
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:56,069
I thought it really stood out
and made me focus on the catwalk.

308
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,905
Up close, I could see that

309
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:02,776
<i>the matte texture on the eyelids</i>
<i>was meticulously applied</i>

310
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:06,046
to create a harmonious overall look,

311
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:07,480
which I appreciated.

312
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:11,685
There's one thing
I find a little disappointing.

313
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,220
The skin was beautifully rendered,

314
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,690
but it would've been nice
if you'd also done some body makeup.

315
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,793
I think that would have really captured

316
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,995
that intense, tough image.

317
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:24,397
Thank you.

318
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,003
There's more variety than I expected.

319
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,104
You're right.

320
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,907
I'm curious
where everyone got their inspiration from.

321
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:37,877
Designer Collector, please come up
to the platform with your model.

322
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,387
- This outfit has a different vibe.
- Right.

323
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,225
This is Designer Collector's work.

324
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,866
As soon as I saw
the outfit I was assigned,

325
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:03,703
I thought it was very different
from the other ones.

326
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,240
While the other outfits had vivid,
prominent patterns,

327
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:10,043
<i>mine felt classic,</i>
<i>with simple dress slacks</i>

328
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,746
<i>and a see-through shirt</i>

329
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,881
<i>with visible patterns.</i>

330
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:18,151
So, I thought I should reinterpret
the 1970s' glow makeup

331
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,120
with a modern sensibility.

332
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,288
Since it was for a fashion show,

333
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,424
I thought the colors would look washed out

334
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:26,459
if I didn't use vibrant ones.

335
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,662
<i>So I made the inner corners bright</i>
<i>and the outer corners dark</i>

336
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,065
<i>to create a lot of contrast</i>

337
00:20:32,132 --> 00:20:34,868
<i>and a sense of three-dimensionality.</i>

338
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,803
<i>That's the look I tried to create.</i>

339
00:20:38,772 --> 00:20:40,707
- It's pretty.
- Yes.

340
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,677
- The colors are pretty.
- I agree.

341
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,146
I think we can do
a lookbook shoot right away.

342
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,815
- Yes, it's so pretty.
- It's so classy.

343
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,129
You know, the theme of this mission
is New Face.

344
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:05,832
- Yes.
- Which part of this look is new?

345
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,033
A new face?

346
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,102
To create a new face,

347
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:13,940
I used wide red blush highlights
on the sides

348
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:17,844
<i>and unique pearl colors like these</i>

349
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:21,548
to create that colorful mood,
focusing on the theme, New Face.

350
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,384
Could you please step onto the platform
and lift her hair a bit?

351
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,285
Sure.

352
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,354
On the sides...

353
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,988
You mean, they are applied like this?

354
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,156
- Yes. That's right.
- I see.

355
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:33,426
This is quite novel.

356
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,696
When she has her hair
tucked behind her ears,

357
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,032
- the colors stand out a bit
- The look becomes a bit modern.

358
00:21:39,099 --> 00:21:41,101
and yet create a certain mood.

359
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:42,969
That's the look I tried to create.

360
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,071
I want to try it on my face.

361
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:46,373
Thank you.

362
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,375
- Thank you. I enjoyed it.
- Yes.

363
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,876
Thank you.

364
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:51,144
- Isn't it so pretty?
- Yes.

365
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:52,545
With the hair tucked behind her ears,

366
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,447
the lines stand out better.

367
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,618
It goes well
with the silk texture of the outfit.

368
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:01,588
- Actually, it's the most natural outfit.
- Yes.

369
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,690
- It must've been difficult.
- Among all the outfits here.

370
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:06,426
When I first saw the makeup look,

371
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,361
I thought it looked

372
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:12,565
a bit like the usual contouring makeup
we often see.

373
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:14,367
But when the hair was tucked
behind her ear,

374
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:19,072
<i>the contours of the model's face</i>
<i>looked even more impactful.</i>

375
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,976
<i>The hues and textures of the eye makeup</i>

376
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:25,311
<i>were particularly beautiful.</i>

377
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:28,548
<i>The detail and contrast</i>
<i>were also excellent.</i>

378
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,985
The shading and color contours

379
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:35,488
really captured the model's essence.

380
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:36,790
I really liked it.

381
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,158
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

382
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,427
Youn-hee whispered in my ear,

383
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:44,664
"We can do a lookbook shoot right away."

384
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:47,133
- Are you satisfied with the makeup?
- That's insane.

385
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,437
Yes. The blouse is made with organza.

386
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,405
She did a great job

387
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:56,376
of layering the makeup textures
to express the sheer material.

388
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:59,412
- It's glamorous and voluminous.
- Yes, it's pretty.

389
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:03,483
I even wondered
why I hadn't thought of that.

390
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,286
- That was excellent.
- Thank you.

391
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:09,289
<i>I think my intention</i>
<i>was perfectly conveyed.</i>

392
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:11,491
I felt the judges appreciated

393
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,060
the classic, high-quality makeup.

394
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:18,164
Golden Hand in Paris, please come up
to the platform with your model.

395
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,271
- As expected, the Paris vibe.
- Right.

396
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,544
This is Golden Hand in Paris's work.

397
00:23:37,017 --> 00:23:38,118
It's so pretty.

398
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:47,293
The first model walk
for the 2025 SS collection,

399
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,095
the Greedilous look,

400
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,664
<i>was the combination of LEDs and clothing.</i>

401
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:55,235
<i>- And you collaborated with LG Display.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

402
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:59,906
So, it was a mix of 1970s fashion
and 21st-century postmodernism,

403
00:23:59,973 --> 00:24:02,208
with technology intertwined.

404
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,511
I thought
incorporating a little technology

405
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:08,615
would better convey the designer's message

406
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,151
<i>for the season.</i>

407
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:12,986
I need to check this.

408
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:19,626
<i>The special highlight of my look</i>
<i>is the LED lighting.</i>

409
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,995
- I have to show this.
- Okay.

410
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,999
I'm so nervous.
I'm most nervous when I do this.

411
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,437
<i>I connected the LED wires</i>
<i>to the back of the head</i>

412
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:33,573
<i>and firmly attached the switch</i>
<i>at the back.</i>

413
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,642
<i>And I thought that</i>
<i>attaching the LED lights</i>

414
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:38,511
<i>along the lines in a two-tone pattern</i>

415
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:42,115
<i>would not only look pretty, but also</i>
<i>create a more technological feel.</i>

416
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,518
It's like exposed concrete.

417
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:49,022
The lines of the LED lights
are all exposed here.

418
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,758
By showing all of this,
I expressed a sense of freedom.

419
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:58,932
Golden Hand in Paris,
about the LED lights.

420
00:24:59,265 --> 00:25:03,203
Did you design it and get it order-made?

421
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:07,040
You know, since I'm a makeup artist,

422
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,843
I just buy all kinds of materials I see.

423
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:12,679
- I see. So you've bought these before?
- So... Yes.

424
00:25:12,746 --> 00:25:15,081
I have a bag full of stuff,
like a peddler.

425
00:25:15,148 --> 00:25:16,983
<i>I have a lot of stuff in the bag.</i>

426
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,285
I just used one of them.

427
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,755
I thought it would go well with this look.

428
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:23,790
- That's how I came up with it.
- It worked perfectly.

429
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:26,126
- Yes.
- So I thought you got it order-made.

430
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,160
Thank you.

431
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:30,063
How did you determine
the color of the eyeshadow

432
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,498
you used on the eyelids?

433
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,734
I thought that some glitter would go well

434
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:36,836
with the LED lights.

435
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,172
<i>I layered a shimmery shade</i>

436
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,975
<i>that matched</i>
<i>the emerald-hued outfit on the inside</i>

437
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,444
<i>and then added two very thin layers</i>

438
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:48,281
<i>of MAC's really shimmery</i>
<i>emerald shade on top.</i>

439
00:25:48,348 --> 00:25:51,718
<i>I thought it would create</i>
<i>a summery feel for the SS collection.</i>

440
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:55,288
For the lips,
I muted the color and applied a gloss

441
00:25:55,355 --> 00:25:58,124
to create a spring-summer feel.

442
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,093
That's what I tried.

443
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,095
I don't think
she will do the second and third missions.

444
00:26:02,162 --> 00:26:03,963
- What?
- I think she will survive here.

445
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,667
Golden Hand in Paris, I think

446
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:10,970
you are really amazing.

447
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:13,173
- Thank you.
- Here's why.

448
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:16,376
You analyzed
designer Park Youn-hee's collection

449
00:26:16,443 --> 00:26:18,511
in great detail

450
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,547
and cleverly expressed

451
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:24,084
what she wanted to convey through makeup.

452
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,353
It felt like you conveyed

453
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:30,256
the 1970s through postmodernism,

454
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:33,360
past the present, and into the future.

455
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,996
I thought it was truly remarkable.

456
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:37,964
- Thank you.
- Yes.

457
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:42,736
Golden Hand in Paris, I'm a huge fan

458
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,904
and study your work all the time.

459
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:48,074
And I think you're an artist
who has achieved so much.

460
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:51,778
But, to be honest,
I wasn't as impressed by this makeup

461
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:55,882
as I'd been with your previous work,

462
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:57,384
because it seemed more like

463
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,423
you applied something already existing
to your makeup,

464
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,092
rather than relying on your skills
in handwork.

465
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:08,228
I enjoyed it, though.

466
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,831
Then, let's hear the designer's opinion.

467
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:16,002
Actually, the look
could've been too plain.

468
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:18,938
I wondered if
just this t-shirt and skirt would work.

469
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:24,077
I think you've done a really great job
of expressing the look in a compact way.

470
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:28,214
I want to go to New York
with this look right now.

471
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:30,717
You did an excellent job
of expressing the novel

472
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:32,419
and contrasting materials.

473
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,889
I see. Youn-hee seems to like it a lot.

474
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:36,990
Good!

475
00:27:37,924 --> 00:27:38,892
Thank you.

476
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,828
I really want to borrow
those LED lights on the eyes

477
00:27:41,895 --> 00:27:44,597
for my concert someday.

478
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,832
They look great.

479
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:50,770
<i>How could she</i>
<i>think of something like that?</i>

480
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,473
<i>Where can I buy those LED lights?</i>

481
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,541
<i>I thought she was amazing.</i>

482
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,210
<i>I don't think I have the courage</i>
<i>to use stuff like that.</i>

483
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:06,286
First Man, please come up
to the platform with your model.

484
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:35,982
I don't think they used
a lot of colors in the 1970s.

485
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:39,285
Since color TV was not yet widespread,

486
00:28:39,352 --> 00:28:40,954
makeup with lines was more common.

487
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:43,556
<i>It was a time when things like</i>

488
00:28:43,623 --> 00:28:47,160
eyeliner and eyelash extensions
were used to create a look.

489
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:50,864
The designer's outfit has a lot of colors.

490
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:54,868
<i>So I used monochromatic colors</i>
<i>for the makeup,</i>

491
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,904
<i>but if it were completely monochromatic,</i>

492
00:28:57,971 --> 00:29:00,073
there would be no drama, so I...

493
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:02,676
These are eyelashes I made myself.

494
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,145
The sparkle

495
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,314
and the glamour of this kind of sequins...

496
00:29:08,381 --> 00:29:09,916
<i>I tried to make the sparkle itself</i>

497
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:13,053
<i>look more dramatic on the catwalk.</i>

498
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,562
I needed something
that would work well with this outfit.

499
00:29:22,629 --> 00:29:24,731
- She's crying.
- Oh, no.

500
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:26,366
Her eyes must be hurting.

501
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:28,268
Her eyes are irritated.

502
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:30,103
The model is shedding tears.

503
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:34,674
The model is shedding tears right now.

504
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,510
I have a feeling that

505
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:40,280
those heavy eyelashes and tears
are really showing

506
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:44,384
the emotional time of the 1970s.

507
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,653
Is that because I was born in the 1970s?

508
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,823
You made a good point.

509
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:53,226
This makeup needs to be removed

510
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,961
right after stepping off the stage.

511
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,865
There are makeup looks that require that.

512
00:29:58,932 --> 00:30:00,834
It does happen in fashion shows.

513
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:06,306
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

514
00:30:07,874 --> 00:30:09,476
- I almost cried with her.
- I know.

515
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:12,712
- Things were tough in the 1970s.
- Right. It was hard.

516
00:30:13,346 --> 00:30:15,348
- We wanted to be glamorous.
- Right.

517
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:17,350
- But we didn't know what to do.
- Exactly.

518
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:21,821
Was the contrast between the base

519
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,891
and the eyelashes intentional?

520
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,659
I thought the glossy eyelashes

521
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:29,295
would stand out more
if the background were matte.

522
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:31,398
- That's why I arranged it this way.
- I see.

523
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:33,833
It's really beautiful.

524
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,137
It doesn't look scary at all. It's cute.

525
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,805
- It's sparkling.
- Yes.

526
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,975
The parts around the eyes, too.

527
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:45,045
First Man, you are someone
I always look forward to.

528
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,814
You have a keen understanding of the era.

529
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:52,152
<i>On the matte, well-balanced skin tone,</i>

530
00:30:52,218 --> 00:30:54,788
<i>the glowing, sparkly eyelashes.</i>

531
00:30:54,854 --> 00:30:59,025
<i>I loved the exaggerated, intense contrast.</i>

532
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:01,061
Design-wise,

533
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,862
I really enjoyed

534
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:04,998
the way you used materials
from the clothing for the eyelashes,

535
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:08,935
and the process and intention
behind it were so impressive.

536
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,170
I really liked it.

537
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,404
Thank you for your comment.

538
00:31:11,471 --> 00:31:12,706
Let's hear from the designer.

539
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,775
Your eyes are teary now.

540
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:17,644
Well... I...

541
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:23,416
I think you've captured
the 1970s vibe so well.

542
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:26,453
The tiered dress is free-spirited

543
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:29,055
and evokes the freedom of that era.

544
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:34,194
It's so touching
how the professional makeup artist

545
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,129
neutralized all the textures

546
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:41,735
and captured the era
with just those sequins.

547
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,503
I find it very touching.

548
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,339
And I...

549
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:48,808
Why am I getting so emotional?

550
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:52,212
I find it very inspirational.

551
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:54,080
It is really good.

552
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:55,115
Thank you.

553
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:56,349
Thank you for your hard work.

554
00:31:58,818 --> 00:31:59,819
Let's go.

555
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,157
Well done. Thank you.

556
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:05,759
- Thank you.
- It must've been hard.

557
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,328
- You are very emotional.
- It's so moving.

558
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,497
- I'm a sensitive person.
- What year were you born in?

559
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:11,865
I was born in 1978.

560
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:13,033
You're one year older than me.

561
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,934
- I am?
- Yes. I was born in 1979.

562
00:32:15,502 --> 00:32:17,337
- I thought I was younger.
- We're close in age.

563
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:18,405
What?

564
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,608
- I do look younger.
- We were born in the 1970s for sure.

565
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:24,477
Those who were born in the 1970s
tend to be sensitive.

566
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:30,183
We are done evaluating
the ten contestants' work.

567
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,952
The judges will now begin the meeting

568
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:35,388
to select the winner for this mission.

569
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,257
I think I should go
and get ready for Round Two.

570
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,558
Right.

571
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:39,893
This is hard.

572
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:44,564
The ten artists may go
to the makeup room and wait.

573
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:46,533
First, shall we each

574
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,835
choose a card for the winner?

575
00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:51,237
All right. Let's pick
three contestants first.

576
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,406
- I want this one.
- I see.

577
00:32:54,274 --> 00:32:55,775
I really liked it.

578
00:32:55,842 --> 00:32:58,078
I liked this one better than this one.

579
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,647
I think it was a better fit
for this round.

580
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:03,283
You said you wanted to see a face
you'd never seen before.

581
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,085
I think I've seen this before.

582
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:08,655
Right. I want to choose this one
and see these two again.

583
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:10,957
We're in trouble. It's hard.

584
00:33:11,024 --> 00:33:12,058
What do we do?

585
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:16,596
I should eat and get ready for Round Two.

586
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:20,800
Let's move on to the cow now.

587
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:23,503
Let's move on to the blue cow.

588
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,438
Get ready for the blue cow.

589
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,774
Let's work hard to get ready.

590
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:29,943
MISSION 1: HIGH FASHION

591
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,912
We are about to announce
the results of the first mission.

592
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:35,248
I watched the judges discuss it,

593
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:38,885
and it seemed they've put a lot of thought
into it and shared their opinions.

594
00:33:38,952 --> 00:33:42,422
I'm really looking forward to seeing

595
00:33:42,489 --> 00:33:44,457
who will advance to the final round.

596
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,994
Now, I'll announce
the top three contestants

597
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:52,098
for the first mission of New Face,
High Fashion.

598
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,335
The first contestant
who may go to the finals is...

599
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,071
Designer Collector.

600
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:00,073
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF HIGH FASHION
DESIGNER COLLECTOR

601
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,408
Congratulations.

602
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:05,812
Congratulations.

603
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,013
The next candidate

604
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:08,915
is Golden Hand in Paris.

605
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,083
Congratulations.

606
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,584
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF HIGH FASHION
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

607
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:16,923
Here's the last candidate.

608
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,926
It's MACtist. Congratulations.

609
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:22,295
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF HIGH FASHION
MACTIST

610
00:34:22,362 --> 00:34:23,430
Congratulations.

611
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:25,932
Saem-mool,

612
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:29,069
please explain
why these candidates were chosen.

613
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,237
Designer Collector

614
00:34:31,304 --> 00:34:33,173
<i>beautifully captured</i>

615
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,242
<i>the emotions of the past</i>
<i>through textures and colors,</i>

616
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:39,279
<i>creating a beautiful harmony</i>
<i>with the fashion.</i>

617
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,282
Golden Hand in Paris

618
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,651
boldly and accurately expressed

619
00:34:44,718 --> 00:34:47,821
<i>the past, present, and future of fashion</i>

620
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:49,823
<i>with precision,</i>

621
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,259
<i>which was both sophisticated and original.</i>

622
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:55,228
Lastly, MACtist's work

623
00:34:55,295 --> 00:34:57,497
<i>captured our eye</i>

624
00:34:57,564 --> 00:35:01,267
<i>solely with the bold red eyebrows.</i>

625
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:02,869
<i>If you saw the look at a show,</i>

626
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:06,239
<i>you'd instantly recognize</i>
<i>the fashion week.</i>

627
00:35:06,306 --> 00:35:08,775
I think he showed
a high-quality makeup look.

628
00:35:08,908 --> 00:35:11,244
Since I'm just a candidate yet,

629
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:13,813
I can't say I'm entirely happy.

630
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:15,215
I'm scared.

631
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:19,319
I'm afraid my face would disappear
among these three.

632
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:23,656
Being a final candidate like this
has given me confidence,

633
00:35:23,723 --> 00:35:25,692
and I'm very grateful.

634
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,461
I'm really nervous.

635
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:30,630
Are you feeling even more nervous
because you're in the top three?

636
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:33,533
I can't think of anything right now.

637
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,335
I'm just nervous.

638
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:36,870
I really am.

639
00:35:37,404 --> 00:35:42,275
Then who will be the first
to advance to the final round?

640
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:47,047
We will now announce the winner
of the High Fashion mission.

641
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:48,615
Oh, my...

642
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:53,753
I have a headache.

643
00:35:55,088 --> 00:35:57,257
What do we do? They seem really nervous.

644
00:35:57,991 --> 00:35:59,459
I'm feeling nervous too.

645
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,361
I'm nervous for no reason.

646
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:04,230
<i>How great would it be</i>
<i>to finish in Round One?</i>

647
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:07,100
<i>I really hope they call my name.</i>

648
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:10,904
<i>I need to receive energy</i>
<i>from the universe.</i>

649
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,172
<i>I should receive it again today.</i>

650
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:14,140
<i>Makeup is all about spirit.</i>

651
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:15,875
<i>I will make it.</i>

652
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,645
The winner of the High Fashion mission.

653
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,380
Golden Hand in Paris?

654
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:21,981
MACtist?

655
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:23,783
Designer Collector?

656
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,619
The winner is Golden Hand in Paris.

657
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:29,356
THE FIRST OF THE TOP 3
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

658
00:36:29,422 --> 00:36:31,991
- Really?
- Congratulations.

659
00:36:32,325 --> 00:36:33,326
Seriously?

660
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:35,829
The winner is Golden Hand in Paris.
Congratulations.

661
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:43,370
- You will advance to the finals.
- Thank you so much.

662
00:36:43,803 --> 00:36:45,205
Thank you so much.

663
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:48,608
Thank you so much.

664
00:36:51,411 --> 00:36:53,913
Among the many artists,

665
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,784
she introduced a very bold
and unique expression.

666
00:36:57,851 --> 00:37:01,788
I also think it fits
the theme of New Face.

667
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:03,690
<i>She has a great understanding</i>
<i>of this collection.</i>

668
00:37:03,757 --> 00:37:06,326
<i>And I think her work</i>
<i>stood out on the catwalk.</i>

669
00:37:06,393 --> 00:37:08,762
I'm actually a little disappointed.

670
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:11,197
She just found a useful object

671
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:13,767
and used it for her makeup.

672
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,836
- She just used it, and that's all.
- I think that's the point.

673
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:19,973
She chose something
that seemed to fit this look,

674
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,543
and that very idea
completed the theme, New Face.

675
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:26,312
There are people
who didn't even know it existed.

676
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:29,349
If you think about it that way,
you're right.

677
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:32,018
<i>I talked about what I found disappointing,</i>

678
00:37:32,085 --> 00:37:32,952
but it's just that

679
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:35,989
I wanted Golden Hand in Paris
to show something with her hand.

680
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,091
But it's definitely a new face.

681
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:41,261
The mission was to create a new face.

682
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,797
Instead of using a common look,

683
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:46,700
<i>you used specific objects</i>

684
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:48,735
<i>to make the look stand out.</i>

685
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:51,338
<i>I think it was a great idea.</i>

686
00:37:51,404 --> 00:37:53,673
And it wasn't just about using objects.

687
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,178
<i>The basic eyeliner shape</i>
<i>under the LED lights was also perfect.</i>

688
00:37:58,545 --> 00:38:01,114
I think the part
where you expressed the color

689
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:05,552
<i>beautifully and delicately</i>
<i>to match the LED lights on the eyelids</i>

690
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,787
increased the level of completion.

691
00:38:08,188 --> 00:38:12,025
That's why we chose you
as the winner of the New Face mission.

692
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:13,827
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

693
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:15,395
Golden Hand in Paris.

694
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,697
You've become the first finalist.

695
00:38:17,764 --> 00:38:19,532
How are you feeling?

696
00:38:19,866 --> 00:38:21,668
Seriously, I can't think of anything.

697
00:38:21,735 --> 00:38:23,303
I'm just grateful.

698
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:27,841
Thank you so much

699
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:30,310
for appreciating my work.

700
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:32,579
All right.

701
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,715
Golden Hand in Paris,
please come forward and receive the brush.

702
00:38:35,782 --> 00:38:38,918
You may go to the seats for the finalists.

703
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,889
Thank you so much.

704
00:38:42,956 --> 00:38:43,957
- Thank you.
- I'll be with you soon.

705
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:46,026
Congratulations.

706
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,028
Thank you.

707
00:38:48,094 --> 00:38:50,130
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

708
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,932
- Take this.
- Thank you so much.

709
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,602
You did a great job.

710
00:38:56,636 --> 00:38:58,338
Thank you so much.

711
00:39:07,981 --> 00:39:10,383
<i>I'll work hard until the very end.</i>

712
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:13,053
<i>I'll show you something new.</i>

713
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:17,023
I want to make it fun and surprising.

714
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:21,227
Now, as you can see,

715
00:39:21,294 --> 00:39:23,463
there are only two seats left
for the top three.

716
00:39:23,797 --> 00:39:26,199
The remaining nine contestants,
excluding Golden Hand in Paris,

717
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:28,868
should now prepare for the next mission.

718
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:37,277
The doors are opening again.

719
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:38,712
Are we going in again?

720
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:40,680
Are we doing the next mission right away?

721
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:42,482
It's open again?

722
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:45,218
It must be painful.

723
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:46,586
You've got this!

724
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,760
WHEN THE SEMIFINAL MISSION WAS REVEALED
Please reveal the second mission.

725
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,365
What?

726
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:03,069
The second theme is a painting.

727
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:07,474
<i>This painting is by artist Koh Sang-woo,</i>
<i>who emphasizes</i>

728
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,109
<i>the coexistence of humans and animals</i>

729
00:40:09,175 --> 00:40:12,012
<i>and the balance of the ecosystem</i>

730
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,747
<i>through portraits of endangered animals.</i>

731
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:16,916
<i>The title of the work is "Ka-madhenu."</i>

732
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,753
<i>"Ka-madhenu" is the mother of all cows</i>

733
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,055
<i>and a miraculous cow</i>
<i>that grants your wishes.</i>

734
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:23,923
<i>It symbolizes a goddess.</i>

735
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:27,894
You will need to complete
a new face with this painting.

736
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:30,730
<i>When I saw the second mission,</i>
<i>I thought, "Are you kidding me?"</i>

737
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,733
<i>It was too intimidating and too blue.</i>

738
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,203
<i>It has to be expressed</i>
<i>abstractly and visually.</i>

739
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,239
This is so hard.

740
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:41,141
<i>My heart was pounding.</i>

741
00:40:41,207 --> 00:40:42,542
I thought it would be fun.

742
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,412
<i>In this round, you'll need to complete</i>
<i>your Ka-madhenu look</i>

743
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:46,746
<i>within 120 minutes,</i>

744
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:50,450
<i>creating your own makeup,</i>
<i>hair, and even costumes.</i>

745
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,220
Now, please grab your brushes
and get started.

746
00:40:58,124 --> 00:41:01,027
THE MODELS FOR MISSION 2: PAINTING
WERE SELECTED BY THE MAKEUP ARTISTS

747
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:02,696
Let's have you change
into the outfit first.

748
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,098
I wanted to do the cow thing.

749
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:07,567
Let's do this right.

750
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:09,903
<i>For the High Fashion theme?</i>

751
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,905
I wanted to lose.

752
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:14,641
<i>I wanted to give my all</i>
<i>to the "Ka-madhenu" mission.</i>

753
00:41:15,041 --> 00:41:16,443
<i>When I saw the cow,</i>

754
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:20,380
<i>I got the idea to create a human</i>
<i>who doesn't look human.</i>

755
00:41:20,447 --> 00:41:23,750
<i>I wanted to express</i>
<i>the beautiful texture on a human face.</i>

756
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:26,286
<i>I wanted to express the animal fur.</i>

757
00:41:26,353 --> 00:41:28,021
<i>So I drew it, strand by strand.</i>

758
00:41:28,855 --> 00:41:31,491
She is drawing on the face.

759
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:36,930
<i>It's not like I didn't try my best</i>
<i>in Round One,</i>

760
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:40,734
<i>but honestly, I felt like</i>
<i>I was taking a break.</i>

761
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,937
Round Two is where I put the most effort.

762
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,506
<i>It has to be absolutely beautiful.</i>

763
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:48,308
<i>I have to make it look beautiful.</i>

764
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:50,677
<i>I think I tried to show</i>

765
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:54,414
<i>the perfection of the makeup</i>
<i>rather than performing art.</i>

766
00:41:55,448 --> 00:41:58,685
<i>It has to be sacred,</i>
<i>mysterious, and gorgeous.</i>

767
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:01,354
<i>I kept those keywords in mind.</i>

768
00:42:01,421 --> 00:42:02,856
<i>They say Koh Sang-woo</i>

769
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:06,326
<i>is a pioneer of blue photography,</i>

770
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:08,395
<i>so I got an idea from that</i>

771
00:42:08,461 --> 00:42:10,697
<i>and used blue in my makeup.</i>

772
00:42:11,965 --> 00:42:15,435
I think they are all using
some blue colors.

773
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:19,873
<i>The blue hair caught my eye first.</i>

774
00:42:19,939 --> 00:42:22,242
<i>From hair to face,</i>

775
00:42:22,308 --> 00:42:25,145
<i>I chose a strong blue as the main color,</i>

776
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:27,514
<i>and I tried to create</i>

777
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,884
<i>a mythical, ancient mood</i>

778
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,219
<i>with my own unique approach.</i>

779
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,356
I think he's trying to create
the exact same color.

780
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:41,294
I don't think simply incorporating colors
from the graphic art

781
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:44,631
<i>makes for great makeup.</i>

782
00:42:44,698 --> 00:42:48,234
<i>I thought a lot about what to do</i>
<i>to clearly convey the theme</i>

783
00:42:48,301 --> 00:42:49,636
<i>with my makeup.</i>

784
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:53,406
All the models
have unique characteristics.

785
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,976
Some of the contestants
selected the models themselves.

786
00:42:57,744 --> 00:42:59,846
Did you see Oh Dolce Vita's model?

787
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,948
Is she a senior model?

788
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,517
- I think she's her acquaintance.
- Or is she her acquaintance?

789
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:06,319
I bet it will look cool.

790
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:08,688
The second mission will be more difficult.

791
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:13,593
I have a feeling that everyone
will do better than on the last mission.

792
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,328
The first one was easier for us.

793
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:17,297
- This is a really tough one.
- I think so.

794
00:43:17,364 --> 00:43:19,032
We're in big trouble now.

795
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:24,104
We will need to focus a lot
on our judging criteria.

796
00:43:24,904 --> 00:43:27,507
MISSION 2: PAINTING
JUDGING BEGINS

797
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:31,344
I'd like to thank the nine contestants
for their hard work.

798
00:43:31,411 --> 00:43:34,481
Your faces look much thinner
than they did on the last mission.

799
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:37,784
Compared to this morning.
I know you've given it your all.

800
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:42,622
Before we check your work,
we will bring in another special guest.

801
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:45,458
He's the artist who painted "Ka-madhenu."

802
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:47,560
Painter Koh Sang-woo, please come on out.

803
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,237
Hello. I'm Koh Sang-woo,

804
00:43:57,303 --> 00:44:00,507
an artist who has been working
on the theme of life and coexistence.

805
00:44:00,573 --> 00:44:02,442
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

806
00:44:04,177 --> 00:44:07,080
I hear that "Ka-madhenu" is your new work,

807
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:10,116
specially presented for JUST MAKEUP.

808
00:44:10,183 --> 00:44:11,718
- That's right.
- We are very honored

809
00:44:11,785 --> 00:44:13,853
<i>that we got to see your work first.</i>

810
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,992
I'm so curious to see how Ka-madhenu,
the miraculous cow, will turn out.

811
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:22,462
We will reveal it right away.

812
00:44:24,064 --> 00:44:26,099
I guess they will be on the catwalk
like the last mission.

813
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,874
My goodness. This is so cool.

814
00:44:39,412 --> 00:44:42,415
My goodness. This is so cool.

815
00:44:47,787 --> 00:44:49,522
This looks amazing.

816
00:44:55,628 --> 00:44:57,397
This is a work of art.

817
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:59,466
- It's beautiful.
- It's amazing.

818
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:04,337
- My goodness. It's unbelievable.
- Oh, dear.

819
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:05,739
It's amazing.

820
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,042
My gosh. What do we do now?

821
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,946
My heart felt like it was going to stop.

822
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,647
I want to take a picture.

823
00:45:15,482 --> 00:45:17,250
<i>I couldn't believe it was a makeup stage.</i>

824
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:20,787
<i>It is something only possible</i>
<i>on JUST MAKEUP.</i>

825
00:45:20,854 --> 00:45:23,656
They're all real artists. This is crazy.

826
00:45:25,525 --> 00:45:26,760
This is amazing.

827
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:28,962
Each look is very interesting.

828
00:45:29,029 --> 00:45:30,196
They all look different.

829
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:31,798
My gosh. In only two hours,

830
00:45:31,898 --> 00:45:33,867
how did they perform such perfect makeup?

831
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:36,036
They should be displayed
as a complete set.

832
00:45:36,102 --> 00:45:38,672
- I know. It looks so cool.
- All of them together.

833
00:45:38,738 --> 00:45:39,973
They all look amazing.

834
00:45:40,306 --> 00:45:43,143
<i>I wanted to bring</i>
<i>the entire thing in a frame</i>

835
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:45,912
into my home.

836
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,416
This is the first time
makeup has been displayed

837
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:51,851
- on stage like this.
- I know.

838
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:53,453
What do we do now? We're in trouble.

839
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,988
They all look great.

840
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:56,289
What do we do?

841
00:45:57,524 --> 00:46:00,694
My goodness. This is truly surprising.

842
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:02,796
It feels like looking at a painting

843
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:05,298
or a beautiful set of sculptures.

844
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:08,401
It's truly a beautiful work of art.

845
00:46:08,468 --> 00:46:11,705
Sang-woo, what do you think

846
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:14,541
of the nine Ka-madhenus
created by the nine contestants?

847
00:46:15,542 --> 00:46:17,177
It is really surprising.

848
00:46:17,944 --> 00:46:21,948
Actually, reinterpreting
a two-dimensional work in this way

849
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:24,918
is a truly challenging mission.

850
00:46:25,251 --> 00:46:28,421
I'm deeply touched to see

851
00:46:28,488 --> 00:46:32,125
how much thought and effort
the contestants put

852
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:33,727
into reinterpreting the original.

853
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:34,861
I see.

854
00:46:34,928 --> 00:46:37,797
I can't wait to see them up close.

855
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:41,501
Now, we'll begin judging
the Painting mission.

856
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:44,704
Are you going to make your choice here?

857
00:46:44,771 --> 00:46:46,072
We have to pick only one.

858
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,707
- Only one?
- Yes.

859
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,709
What do we do, Director Jung?

860
00:46:50,076 --> 00:46:51,911
What's with the contestants?

861
00:46:53,213 --> 00:46:54,447
They seem rather laid-back.

862
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:55,615
- I know.
- Right?

863
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,751
It's like they're saying,
"I've done my job."

864
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:59,185
The contestants

865
00:46:59,252 --> 00:47:00,787
- are not stressed at all.
- They have no regrets.

866
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:02,489
While we're going crazy here.

867
00:47:02,856 --> 00:47:04,357
Thank you.

868
00:47:04,424 --> 00:47:06,326
I can't believe
I'm seeing this with my own eyes.

869
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:11,297
First Man, please come up
to the platform with your model.

870
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:17,203
He hired a male model.

871
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:20,540
How charismatic.

872
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:23,677
The model's shoes and legs
look somewhat unique.

873
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:26,046
- He's wearing heels.
- You're right.

874
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:28,448
He's wearing heels.

875
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,786
This is First Man's work.

876
00:47:34,054 --> 00:47:35,455
This is so cool.

877
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,994
First,

878
00:47:41,061 --> 00:47:43,163
- let me explain why I chose
- It's so impactful.

879
00:47:43,229 --> 00:47:46,466
a male model to express a goddess.

880
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:50,770
In ancient Mesopotamia and Hinduism,

881
00:47:50,837 --> 00:47:54,941
there were gods who were incarnated
as both male and female.

882
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:57,610
It is expressed as diversity nowadays,

883
00:47:57,911 --> 00:47:59,379
called gender fluidity.

884
00:47:59,446 --> 00:48:03,283
<i>Whether the model was a man or a woman</i>
<i>didn't matter to me.</i>

885
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,418
<i>I considered this human being itself</i>

886
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:07,821
to be my canvas.

887
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:10,290
- How cool.
- That's amazing.

888
00:48:10,657 --> 00:48:13,727
I expressed
the continuity of mythical time

889
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:15,095
through the texture.

890
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,230
In oil paintings,

891
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,366
the value of a masterpiece

892
00:48:19,432 --> 00:48:22,569
is revealed as the colors fade.

893
00:48:23,737 --> 00:48:27,507
I want this hair to look
as if it hasn't been washed forever.

894
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:30,243
- Do you want it to look a little clumpy?
- Yes. That's it.

895
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:34,481
<i>To create a somewhat aged, mythical mood,</i>

896
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:36,583
I used a technique called matière.

897
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:38,018
<i>It's an art term.</i>

898
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:40,387
<i>I intentionally created</i>

899
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:42,522
<i>a vintage, dry texture</i>

900
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:45,859
<i>by cracking and peeling the makeup.</i>

901
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:49,062
<i>I applied a little glue to it,</i>

902
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:51,664
<i>crushed the colors on the face,</i>

903
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:55,201
<i>and added marks of dripping liquid,</i>

904
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:57,704
<i>creating intentional cracks.</i>

905
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,240
Can you frown very deeply here?

906
00:49:00,306 --> 00:49:02,475
To ruin the makeup here.

907
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:04,611
A little more.

908
00:49:06,646 --> 00:49:08,648
It's not wrinkling enough
because you're young.

909
00:49:09,649 --> 00:49:10,850
That's enough.

910
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:14,220
This is an important moment.

911
00:49:14,521 --> 00:49:17,023
I needed something for the makeup
that would remind you

912
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,858
of a cow.

913
00:49:18,925 --> 00:49:21,027
<i>I thought I needed something powerful.</i>

914
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:24,064
<i>The complementary color of blue is yellow.</i>

915
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,198
Don't move.

916
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:29,302
<i>I quickly drew a line in gold.</i>

917
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:33,173
<i>I added a gold nose ring as decoration.</i>

918
00:49:34,341 --> 00:49:36,042
<i>It's beyond my imagination.</i>

919
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:39,112
Isn't the gold line so cool?

920
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:42,549
<i>- The line perfectly centers the makeup.</i>
<i>- Exactly.</i>

921
00:49:42,615 --> 00:49:44,017
<i>This is crazy.</i>

922
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,553
- The hands.
- Let me see your hands.

923
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:47,787
Look at the hands.

924
00:49:48,455 --> 00:49:49,956
Can you raise your hand for us?

925
00:49:51,725 --> 00:49:53,326
Even on the hands.

926
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:56,196
<i>I applied some glue</i>

927
00:49:56,262 --> 00:49:57,931
<i>and covered it in gold.</i>

928
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,166
Dip your fingers
like how you dip food in soy sauce.

929
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:02,902
Raise them without shaking off the liquid.

930
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:05,538
<i>Rather than applying</i>
<i>a thin layer on the hands,</i>

931
00:50:05,605 --> 00:50:09,009
I gave it a sticky, flowing feel

932
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:12,412
to create some texture and volume.

933
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,348
There will be a surprise

934
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:17,083
when the model exits the stage.

935
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,653
I hope you understand that
as part of body makeup.

936
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,756
- Okay.
- I can't wait to see it.

937
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,226
- This is so cool.
- It's brilliant.

938
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,195
I didn't expect him
to express a cow like that.

939
00:50:29,362 --> 00:50:32,132
- It's like something out of a cartoon.
- He's so creative.

940
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:33,533
That was very creative

941
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,301
and very artistic.

942
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:38,738
It made me realize that a Korean artist

943
00:50:38,805 --> 00:50:41,841
could have this level of skill.

944
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:43,443
It was really amazing.

945
00:50:43,843 --> 00:50:47,881
I was deeply amazed
the moment he appeared.

946
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:49,816
<i>It's truly magnificent.</i>

947
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:52,552
<i>It felt like watching</i>

948
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,755
<i>an animated character of "Ka-madhenu."</i>

949
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:58,758
I don't know how you achieved such quality

950
00:50:58,825 --> 00:51:01,428
with such simple elements.

951
00:51:01,494 --> 00:51:04,698
I'm so grateful to have seen it in person.

952
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:06,666
It was brilliant.

953
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:08,568
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

954
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,737
- Will there be a performance?
- Oh, my...

955
00:51:10,804 --> 00:51:12,772
- I see.
- So, this is the surprise.

956
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:14,474
- Will there be a performance?
- Oh, my...

957
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:16,142
- I see.
- So, this is the surprise.

958
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:17,210
My goodness.

959
00:51:20,847 --> 00:51:23,917
- That's so cool.
- Even the back is a work of art, right?

960
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:26,953
- Until the very end...
- That's what he meant by body makeup.

961
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,188
That's it.

962
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:29,622
Shocking.

963
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:33,727
I'm really impressed.

964
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,263
- It was very impactful.
- It can't be like this from the start.

965
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:40,867
But the others also look so cool.

966
00:51:42,736 --> 00:51:44,204
All I can do is be amazed.

967
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,238
This is crazy.

968
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:47,440
- It's crazy. I mean it.
- Beauty Heiress.

969
00:51:47,507 --> 00:51:49,709
Please come forward with your model.

970
00:51:54,714 --> 00:51:58,251
<i>I wanted to express</i>
<i>the word goddess literally.</i>

971
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:00,020
<i>I wanted to make it look beautiful.</i>

972
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:02,389
So pretty.

973
00:52:03,089 --> 00:52:04,290
It's beautiful.

974
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:06,993
This is Beauty Heiress's work.

975
00:52:09,696 --> 00:52:11,364
- My goodness.
- It's gorgeous.

976
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:13,233
- My goodness.
- It's gorgeous.

977
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:28,048
<i>What I most wanted to emphasize</i>

978
00:52:28,114 --> 00:52:32,285
was to express a truly beautiful goddess.

979
00:52:32,352 --> 00:52:37,190
<i>So, I emphasized</i>
<i>the mysteriousness on the eyelids</i>

980
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:41,294
<i>to create a sense of immersion</i>
<i>in the eyes.</i>

981
00:52:42,395 --> 00:52:44,764
- The eyes look mysterious.
- Yes.

982
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:46,866
The yellow color stands out.

983
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:52,906
<i>And by adding this bindi on the forehead,</i>

984
00:52:52,972 --> 00:52:55,442
<i>I wanted to convey implicit meanings</i>

985
00:52:55,508 --> 00:52:58,578
<i>like protection, freshness, and blessing.</i>

986
00:52:58,645 --> 00:53:01,614
<i>I also used the colors</i>
<i>used in the painting</i>

987
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:03,216
<i>to accentuate the lips.</i>

988
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:07,253
It's pretty. She looks like a doll.

989
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:09,422
It's beautiful.

990
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:11,157
What do we do?

991
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:12,926
It's gorgeous.

992
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,961
You look incredibly pretty.

993
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:18,565
It's so beautiful.

994
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:21,634
- I'm speechless.
- It looks pretty on screen,

995
00:53:21,701 --> 00:53:24,004
- and it's even prettier in the flesh.
- Right.

996
00:53:24,938 --> 00:53:26,940
I want to see the profile too.

997
00:53:33,313 --> 00:53:35,181
- It's so beautiful.
- It's so beautiful.

998
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:41,187
- I have no questions.
- Me neither.

999
00:53:42,455 --> 00:53:43,757
- It's just pretty.
- So pretty.

1000
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:46,059
I should get ready for Round Three.

1001
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:48,728
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1002
00:53:48,795 --> 00:53:49,929
- Thank you.
- I enjoyed it.

1003
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,498
- It's so pretty.
- What do I do?

1004
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:53,566
- She's just a goddess.
- It's just beautiful.

1005
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:56,169
- I'm happy.
- It's gorgeous.

1006
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,038
This is hard, but I'm happy.

1007
00:53:58,271 --> 00:53:59,773
It looks so good.

1008
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:02,175
The judges seem to face

1009
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:05,612
an increasingly difficult situation now.

1010
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:08,281
It's so beautiful and mysterious.

1011
00:54:08,348 --> 00:54:11,718
I can tell a lot of thought
was put into the meticulous preparation

1012
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:14,254
from head to toe.

1013
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:18,458
I'm just grateful.

1014
00:54:18,525 --> 00:54:21,661
It's beautiful.
Thank you for giving us a hard time.

1015
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:28,501
The only word that comes to mind
is "beautiful."

1016
00:54:28,568 --> 00:54:31,171
<i>When I saw the makeup process</i>
<i>in the middle,</i>

1017
00:54:31,237 --> 00:54:33,306
<i>it was already beautiful</i>
<i>even before it was finished.</i>

1018
00:54:33,373 --> 00:54:34,708
<i>The colors were well-chosen,</i>

1019
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:36,876
<i>and I hoped it would</i>
<i>all come together beautifully.</i>

1020
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:38,611
I waited with this thought.

1021
00:54:38,678 --> 00:54:41,314
I'm so happy that

1022
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:44,484
it turned out as beautifully
as I expected.

1023
00:54:44,551 --> 00:54:47,554
All right. The judges gave it
favorable reviews.

1024
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,089
The symmetry is perfect.

1025
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:50,824
It lines up in the middle.

1026
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:54,627
Beauty Heiress,
you may return to your seat and wait.

1027
00:54:54,694 --> 00:54:55,795
Thank you for your hard work.

1028
00:54:55,862 --> 00:54:57,130
It's really beautiful.

1029
00:54:57,597 --> 00:54:58,965
The back is also beautiful.

1030
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:01,935
<i>The judges understood well</i>

1031
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:04,037
what I was trying to express,

1032
00:55:04,104 --> 00:55:05,638
so I was very satisfied.

1033
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,408
We're in trouble now.

1034
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:09,676
I know.

1035
00:55:09,743 --> 00:55:11,945
I've already chosen two contestants.

1036
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,616
Makeup Model Student,
please explain your work.

1037
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:19,552
I did some research on the artist.

1038
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,354
<i>I read an article that said</i>

1039
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:24,057
<i>how he was intrigued by the way</i>
<i>yellow turns blue when inverted,</i>

1040
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:27,193
and that was why he had
a lot of paintings with blue colors.

1041
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,595
Inspired by this,

1042
00:55:28,661 --> 00:55:31,297
I created the makeup look

1043
00:55:31,364 --> 00:55:33,166
<i>while observing the inverted colors.</i>

1044
00:55:33,233 --> 00:55:35,835
When the image is inverted like this...

1045
00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:40,306
- Do you see this?
- It turns yellow like that.

1046
00:55:40,373 --> 00:55:42,142
So, that's how it looks.

1047
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:44,577
As a makeup artist myself,

1048
00:55:44,644 --> 00:55:47,080
I don't think I've ever seen

1049
00:55:47,147 --> 00:55:49,549
my own look inverted like that.

1050
00:55:49,616 --> 00:55:52,786
I think the idea of preparing the look
was very good.

1051
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:56,156
Even without inverting the colors,
it seems to capture

1052
00:55:56,222 --> 00:55:58,291
the Ka-madhenu look well.

1053
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:00,393
I think this is a great work

1054
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,429
that allows us to see two different looks.

1055
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:05,465
Now it's Swag Maker's turn.

1056
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:07,934
I tried to capture
each element of the painting

1057
00:56:08,001 --> 00:56:10,070
in my makeup look.

1058
00:56:10,136 --> 00:56:12,472
<i>I expressed the white fur of the cow</i>
<i>with the petals of a chrysanthemum.</i>

1059
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,607
<i>And the beads on the lips</i>

1060
00:56:14,674 --> 00:56:19,045
<i>symbolize the good luck and life</i>

1061
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:20,814
<i>of a marigold.</i>

1062
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,482
- The hands...
- Look at her hands.

1063
00:56:24,584 --> 00:56:27,754
What does the nail art symbolize?

1064
00:56:28,021 --> 00:56:30,924
I saw an image of a cow's claw,

1065
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,393
<i>and it looked like this.</i>

1066
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,063
She must've been busy
getting all this done in just two hours.

1067
00:56:37,263 --> 00:56:39,432
The very pale skin tone,

1068
00:56:39,499 --> 00:56:41,434
<i>the irregular hair patterns,</i>

1069
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:44,871
<i>and the geometric drawing patterns</i>
<i>are beautifully expressed.</i>

1070
00:56:44,938 --> 00:56:46,706
I think the harmony of the colors

1071
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:49,175
is also very exquisite.

1072
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:54,581
- It's MACtist, right?
- Yes, MACtist.

1073
00:56:54,914 --> 00:56:57,017
This is MACtist's work.

1074
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:01,321
Actually, I think "Ka-madhenu" was

1075
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:06,326
a difficult piece to interpret for me.

1076
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:10,797
Ka-madhenu, the cow goddess,

1077
00:57:10,997 --> 00:57:14,801
has an elegant, gorgeous,
and majestic image.

1078
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:18,538
And I found it difficult
to capture all that

1079
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:20,273
with makeup.

1080
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:24,444
Actually, the makeup I initially planned

1081
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:26,980
failed backstage.

1082
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:29,916
...failed backstage.

1083
00:57:30,383 --> 00:57:31,384
Here's why.

1084
00:57:33,353 --> 00:57:36,790
<i>When I saw the cow,</i>
<i>I thought it was happy.</i>

1085
00:57:36,956 --> 00:57:41,161
<i>But I couldn't capture the feeling</i>
<i>with my makeup.</i>

1086
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:45,165
<i>I don't think I was perfectly in sync</i>
<i>with the painting.</i>

1087
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,301
Darn it. This isn't right.

1088
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:52,739
<i>It didn't look pretty for some reason.</i>

1089
00:57:53,306 --> 00:57:54,908
<i>I kept touching it up.</i>

1090
00:57:54,974 --> 00:57:56,976
<i>And I wasn't making any progress.</i>

1091
00:57:57,844 --> 00:58:02,182
The other contestants
had many stories to tell

1092
00:58:02,248 --> 00:58:04,150
and were confident in their looks,

1093
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:06,586
but unfortunately,
that wasn't the case for me.

1094
00:58:06,953 --> 00:58:10,924
The final decision I made here

1095
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,561
was to create the image of a goddess

1096
00:58:14,627 --> 00:58:16,062
through ethnic patterns and gold.

1097
00:58:16,129 --> 00:58:18,298
I think that was it.

1098
00:58:18,965 --> 00:58:20,433
Again, I'm sorry,

1099
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,369
but I can't go into more detail

1100
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:25,739
about the makeup look.

1101
00:58:25,972 --> 00:58:26,973
I'm sorry.

1102
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:32,412
<i>I could have probably come up</i>
<i>with a few words to describe the makeup,</i>

1103
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:35,982
but I didn't want to justify
my makeup look

1104
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:38,651
by doing such things.

1105
00:58:38,718 --> 00:58:41,688
MACtist, you always sounded so confident,

1106
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:46,092
so it is surprising to hear you
speak so calmly of such things.

1107
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,294
His honesty is so cool.

1108
00:58:49,796 --> 00:58:51,831
He's very true to himself.

1109
00:58:51,898 --> 00:58:52,732
That's cool.

1110
00:58:52,932 --> 00:58:54,567
That's really cool.

1111
00:58:55,468 --> 00:58:56,836
He doesn't like his own work,

1112
00:58:56,903 --> 00:58:58,304
so it can't be helped.

1113
00:58:58,371 --> 00:59:01,274
You had a long time
to get your makeup done.

1114
00:59:01,441 --> 00:59:04,944
Did things not work out the whole time?

1115
00:59:05,311 --> 00:59:07,480
I came up with the look,

1116
00:59:07,547 --> 00:59:09,249
- But you did not like it?
- but I couldn't quite

1117
00:59:09,315 --> 00:59:12,318
grasp the story behind it.

1118
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:13,219
I see.

1119
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:15,855
That can happen.

1120
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:21,961
It's colorful, and yet very neat.

1121
00:59:22,028 --> 00:59:23,763
The technique is excellent.

1122
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:27,434
While trying to express Ka-madhenu,

1123
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,202
you got lost in the middle

1124
00:59:29,269 --> 00:59:30,737
and started over.

1125
00:59:30,804 --> 00:59:34,874
You just followed your heart's lead
and finished a new project.

1126
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:37,110
I highly appreciate it.

1127
00:59:37,177 --> 00:59:38,945
I think that's professionalism.

1128
00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:42,816
Thank you for your honesty.

1129
00:59:43,216 --> 00:59:44,718
You managed to finish it anyway.

1130
00:59:44,784 --> 00:59:47,620
Thank you. I enjoyed it.

1131
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:51,324
As I listened to you speak,

1132
00:59:51,791 --> 00:59:53,293
I kept thinking

1133
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,797
you had a mindset
that's closest to that of an artist.

1134
00:59:58,031 --> 01:00:00,934
We artists find it incredibly difficult

1135
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,803
when we're given a set amount of time
to work on a project.

1136
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:08,108
I was glad to feel the anguish
of that creative process with you.

1137
01:00:08,174 --> 01:00:10,510
I really appreciated your honesty.

1138
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:11,578
Thank you.

1139
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,149
MACtist, please go back to your seat.

1140
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:17,684
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1141
01:00:24,491 --> 01:00:27,360
- You did well.
- I cried, you know.

1142
01:00:27,427 --> 01:00:30,597
You are so cool.
You were so brave to say things like that.

1143
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:32,065
I just genuinely didn't get the theme.

1144
01:00:32,132 --> 01:00:35,035
It's really cool. You did a great job.

1145
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,809
- It's the attitude that matters.
- The attitude.

1146
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:44,077
Attitude.

1147
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:47,280
- The model is doing a great job
- She poses beautifully.

1148
01:00:47,347 --> 01:00:48,848
expressing the theme.

1149
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,253
Detailed Hands,
please come forward with your model.

1150
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:56,823
Shall we?

1151
01:00:59,392 --> 01:01:02,862
<i>I wanted to express "Ka-madhenu"</i>
<i>in a picturesque way.</i>

1152
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:05,098
A cow is walking toward us.

1153
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:07,667
Right. It does feel like that.

1154
01:01:08,101 --> 01:01:10,804
<i>A goddess who seems</i>
<i>to have jumped out of a painting.</i>

1155
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:12,939
Oh, my god.

1156
01:01:13,907 --> 01:01:15,842
This is Detailed Hands's work.

1157
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:21,448
Featuring a Black model is very bold.

1158
01:01:22,182 --> 01:01:23,850
She's truly an Indian goddess.

1159
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:26,419
When I first saw the painting,

1160
01:01:26,486 --> 01:01:29,089
I noticed the blue tones and its majesty.

1161
01:01:29,155 --> 01:01:32,292
The texture of each strand caught my eye,

1162
01:01:32,492 --> 01:01:34,127
and I wanted to express that.

1163
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:36,896
I found the animal's texture beautiful,

1164
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:40,266
so I focused a lot on drawing the texture.

1165
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:44,771
It feels like a real-life cow.

1166
01:01:49,275 --> 01:01:52,479
I practiced every single day without fail.

1167
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:54,447
<i>I tried to make it short, long,</i>

1168
01:01:54,514 --> 01:01:56,182
<i>and even spread it out.</i>

1169
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,185
<i>And when I saw the painting,</i>

1170
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:00,920
<i>I thought the hair should start</i>

1171
01:02:00,987 --> 01:02:04,090
<i>from the bridge of the nose like this.</i>

1172
01:02:05,592 --> 01:02:07,127
<i>It was a bit artistic,</i>

1173
01:02:07,193 --> 01:02:10,163
<i>so I tried to draw them</i>
<i>with a more irregular and rough texture,</i>

1174
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:12,365
<i>while maintaining</i>
<i>the same level of detail.</i>

1175
01:02:17,604 --> 01:02:18,838
You're doing a good job.

1176
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,441
Thanks.

1177
01:02:22,742 --> 01:02:26,413
And I thought long and hard
about how to create the shape

1178
01:02:26,479 --> 01:02:29,482
of horns and ears with the hair.

1179
01:02:29,582 --> 01:02:31,017
That's how I came up with this look.

1180
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:34,087
And I added this flower to highlight

1181
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:35,689
the back of the head.

1182
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:38,124
Even the outfit is amazing.

1183
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:39,826
The outfit is unbelievable.

1184
01:02:40,293 --> 01:02:43,697
The outfit is made of human hair.

1185
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:46,166
Overall, from head to toe,

1186
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:48,902
she's a human,
but she doesn't seem like a human.

1187
01:02:48,968 --> 01:02:50,337
<i>I wanted to dress her</i>

1188
01:02:50,403 --> 01:02:52,839
<i>in something truly magnificent</i>
<i>and overwhelming.</i>

1189
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,442
From today on, I'm no longer human.

1190
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,144
I'm not human.

1191
01:03:01,514 --> 01:03:04,718
Is the touch on the tip of the nose
intentional?

1192
01:03:04,784 --> 01:03:09,622
I tried to express the tip of a cow's nose

1193
01:03:09,689 --> 01:03:11,891
<i>with the shape.</i>

1194
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,060
It is very detailed.

1195
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:16,529
I like how it is complete.

1196
01:03:16,863 --> 01:03:19,332
<i>So, that's how it can be interpreted.</i>

1197
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:22,202
<i>Detailed Hands has a side</i>
<i>that touches people's hearts.</i>

1198
01:03:22,268 --> 01:03:24,537
<i>She is such a renowned figure,</i>

1199
01:03:24,604 --> 01:03:26,940
<i>but I could see how desperate she was.</i>

1200
01:03:27,007 --> 01:03:28,608
<i>I reflected on myself a lot.</i>

1201
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:32,178
It was really amazing.

1202
01:03:32,245 --> 01:03:34,147
As the model walked out,

1203
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:38,785
I felt like Ka-madhenu was truly alive

1204
01:03:38,852 --> 01:03:40,754
<i>and approaching me.</i>

1205
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:44,357
And the drawing on the eyes,
the eyelashes,

1206
01:03:44,424 --> 01:03:48,261
<i>and even the white mascara underneath</i>

1207
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:51,398
<i>made it feel like the cow was</i>

1208
01:03:51,464 --> 01:03:54,601
really sending me a message,
blinking her eyes.

1209
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:56,469
She's a human,
but she doesn't look like one.

1210
01:03:56,536 --> 01:04:00,173
She's like a special being
that has emerged from nowhere.

1211
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,242
I'm so happy to have seen

1212
01:04:02,308 --> 01:04:04,511
such a wonderful piece of work. Thank you.

1213
01:04:04,577 --> 01:04:07,013
Sang-woo, how did you like the look?

1214
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,481
Please give us your take.

1215
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:11,518
Yes. It is truly amazing.

1216
01:04:11,584 --> 01:04:12,585
Thank you.

1217
01:04:12,652 --> 01:04:14,788
I was also at a loss

1218
01:04:14,854 --> 01:04:17,190
for where to place the marigold,

1219
01:04:17,257 --> 01:04:18,958
and ended up placing it on the nose.

1220
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:21,327
It's brilliant that you placed it
on the back of the head,

1221
01:04:21,394 --> 01:04:23,430
where we can't see it.

1222
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:26,933
It made me wonder
why I couldn't think of that.

1223
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,069
- I really liked it. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1224
01:04:29,135 --> 01:04:32,305
I think the model
is contributing to the look a lot.

1225
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:36,309
She really kept up the mood
from start to finish.

1226
01:04:36,543 --> 01:04:38,912
I think that's very sweet.

1227
01:04:39,012 --> 01:04:40,714
You seem to be thirsty to put on a show.

1228
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,382
Why don't you twirl around

1229
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:46,486
and show off your look
as much as you want?

1230
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:00,000
Thank you.

1231
01:05:02,836 --> 01:05:04,037
She's so lovely.

1232
01:05:04,104 --> 01:05:05,338
Right. She's cute.

1233
01:05:05,405 --> 01:05:08,575
The harmony between the two of you
is really beautiful.

1234
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:10,110
I was happy to see it.

1235
01:05:10,176 --> 01:05:11,311
Thank you.

1236
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:13,613
Detailed Hands,
you may go back to your seat.

1237
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,315
- Thank you.
- I'd like to thank the model too.

1238
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:16,583
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1239
01:05:18,451 --> 01:05:19,853
Well done.

1240
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:25,492
When the model moved her head like this...

1241
01:05:25,558 --> 01:05:26,659
The eyelashes were beautiful, right?

1242
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:28,228
I mean, a cow...

1243
01:05:28,294 --> 01:05:31,331
I know what it is like
because my family raises cows at home.

1244
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:33,199
When she raised her head like this,

1245
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:34,901
it felt so much like a cow's movement.

1246
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:35,969
It was really surprising.

1247
01:05:36,036 --> 01:05:39,072
I guess the model studied it.

1248
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:41,041
What? Next up is Oh Dolce Vita.

1249
01:05:41,307 --> 01:05:44,744
She's striking a great pose.

1250
01:05:45,311 --> 01:05:48,448
Oh Dolce Vita,
please come forward with your model.

1251
01:05:56,856 --> 01:05:58,425
They look alike, don't they?

1252
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:01,561
- Right. They look alike.
- They do.

1253
01:06:07,267 --> 01:06:08,435
She looks so cool.

1254
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:10,537
She looks beautiful.

1255
01:06:19,412 --> 01:06:25,118
This is my mother's face,
the first face I saw when I was born.

1256
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:28,254
This is my mother's face.

1257
01:06:28,355 --> 01:06:31,458
- She's her mother?
- Is she really her mother?

1258
01:06:31,524 --> 01:06:33,593
- Her mother?
- I think she's her mother.

1259
01:06:34,594 --> 01:06:36,129
When I did some research

1260
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:39,933
about Ka-madhenu and its mythology,

1261
01:06:40,533 --> 01:06:43,770
I realized that
I could not imitate it with anything.

1262
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:46,172
In Sang-woo's painting,

1263
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:49,642
I also saw the endless depth
in the eyes of the cow,

1264
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:52,479
<i>the colors, and stuff like that.</i>

1265
01:06:52,746 --> 01:06:56,149
The idea of imitating all of them
was just...

1266
01:06:56,783 --> 01:06:59,552
Because I have my own Ka-madhenu,

1267
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:01,154
I couldn't imitate them.

1268
01:07:01,921 --> 01:07:03,256
My goodness.

1269
01:07:03,656 --> 01:07:05,225
I didn't want to do this.

1270
01:07:05,859 --> 01:07:06,860
So...

1271
01:07:15,802 --> 01:07:17,737
Thinking of my mom always makes me cry.

1272
01:07:17,804 --> 01:07:18,872
Me too.

1273
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:22,308
She is 70 years old.

1274
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,611
She turned 70 this year.

1275
01:07:25,445 --> 01:07:26,680
My mother

1276
01:07:28,248 --> 01:07:30,417
has beautiful wrinkles.

1277
01:07:42,529 --> 01:07:46,933
My own Ka-madhenu, which can show
the passage of time beautifully,

1278
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:50,937
is completed in this makeup look.

1279
01:07:52,706 --> 01:07:54,974
I feel bad for my mom.

1280
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:56,676
- I'm too old for this.
- No.

1281
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:58,244
You have really nice skin, ma'am.

1282
01:07:58,311 --> 01:07:59,546
Right. She has nice skin.

1283
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:03,516
When a broken vessel has cracks in it,

1284
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,418
you can fill the cracks with gold

1285
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:07,554
<i>to create a new piece of art.</i>

1286
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:10,223
<i>It's a technique called kintsugi.</i>

1287
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,791
KIMTSUGI: A TECHNIQUE
THAT RECONNECTS THE CRACKS

1288
01:08:11,858 --> 01:08:14,094
IN BROKEN VESSELS,
TRANSFORMING FLAWS INTO BEAUTY

1289
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:16,496
<i>I applied this technique to my mom,</i>

1290
01:08:16,563 --> 01:08:18,932
<i>creating a makeup look</i>

1291
01:08:18,998 --> 01:08:20,734
<i>that didn't try to hide</i>

1292
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,869
<i>her deep wrinkles,</i>

1293
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:25,472
<i>wide hairline, and gray hairs,</i>

1294
01:08:25,538 --> 01:08:27,140
<i>but rather highlighted them</i>

1295
01:08:27,207 --> 01:08:30,110
<i>so they could stand out even more.</i>

1296
01:08:32,112 --> 01:08:34,681
This blue on the lips

1297
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,083
is a color of indecipherable depth.

1298
01:08:37,150 --> 01:08:40,620
It seems like it could embrace anything.

1299
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,889
I found the color fascinating.

1300
01:08:42,956 --> 01:08:44,691
That's how I felt.

1301
01:08:45,692 --> 01:08:49,229
So, I tried to express the color

1302
01:08:49,295 --> 01:08:51,998
of Ka-madhenu on my mom's lips.

1303
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,001
She was waiting for a long time.

1304
01:08:55,335 --> 01:08:58,138
But she kept looking only at me.

1305
01:09:02,942 --> 01:09:04,878
<i>I thought, "She really is</i>
<i>my own Ka-madhenu."</i>

1306
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:06,880
<i>She only looks at me.</i>

1307
01:09:11,618 --> 01:09:13,386
Today,

1308
01:09:13,853 --> 01:09:16,656
I gathered my courage

1309
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,925
to bring my mom here

1310
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:21,161
and create my look with her.

1311
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:32,005
The judges here

1312
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:34,074
and even the contestants

1313
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:37,911
- are all in tears now.
- Seriously.

1314
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:42,048
I tried not to cry this time. Really.

1315
01:09:44,718 --> 01:09:48,221
Judges, you must still
evaluate the look fairly.

1316
01:09:48,288 --> 01:09:50,023
- Of course.
- Please come forward

1317
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,092
and take a closer look now.

1318
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:57,597
We thought you two kind of looked similar,
and it turned out to be true.

1319
01:09:57,764 --> 01:09:58,798
We were right.

1320
01:09:58,865 --> 01:10:00,934
She is very beautiful.

1321
01:10:21,087 --> 01:10:23,456
My mom didn't know the theme of the look.

1322
01:10:23,523 --> 01:10:24,657
I see.

1323
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:26,559
I'm sorry.

1324
01:10:26,893 --> 01:10:29,195
Don't cry. You should look pretty.

1325
01:10:32,832 --> 01:10:34,768
Your mother has eyes

1326
01:10:34,834 --> 01:10:37,137
that could touch people's hearts.

1327
01:10:40,006 --> 01:10:41,841
- Yes.
- This kind of situation...

1328
01:10:43,009 --> 01:10:44,377
I keep crying the more I look.

1329
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:46,780
My goodness.

1330
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:55,689
What do we do?

1331
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:57,724
She's also...

1332
01:10:58,892 --> 01:10:59,826
Oh, no.

1333
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:05,098
I never knew makeup
could make people cry like this.

1334
01:11:05,165 --> 01:11:06,833
- Oh, no.
- What do we do?

1335
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,335
That's the power of makeup.

1336
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:14,107
It's like a cheat code. I miss Mom.

1337
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:18,345
Saem-mool, why did you shed so many tears?

1338
01:11:19,379 --> 01:11:20,347
The thing is,

1339
01:11:22,015 --> 01:11:25,018
your mother's expression, wrinkles,

1340
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:26,319
and...

1341
01:11:27,754 --> 01:11:29,155
Her gestures.

1342
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:32,425
BACKSTAGE BEFORE JUDGING

1343
01:11:32,492 --> 01:11:33,727
How should I pose?

1344
01:11:33,793 --> 01:11:36,363
Try to look cool. Do this with your hands.

1345
01:11:36,763 --> 01:11:38,531
- Like this? With one hand?
- Yes.

1346
01:11:45,071 --> 01:11:47,407
This is Oh Dolce Vita's work.

1347
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:56,182
<i>She kept</i>

1348
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,551
<i>striking a pose,</i>

1349
01:11:58,952 --> 01:12:02,222
stretching out her hands like this
for her daughter.

1350
01:12:02,288 --> 01:12:03,857
It made me cry.

1351
01:12:05,992 --> 01:12:08,995
Oh Dolce Vita is demonstrating

1352
01:12:09,062 --> 01:12:12,132
the intensity of motherhood
most powerfully,

1353
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:15,135
more than anyone else

1354
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:17,504
at this very moment.

1355
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:20,640
I never thought I'd cry like this.

1356
01:12:21,074 --> 01:12:23,076
You might be a bit embarrassed
when you watch the show.

1357
01:12:23,143 --> 01:12:26,046
I know. I think I'll be embarrassed.

1358
01:12:26,112 --> 01:12:28,481
- Thank you for the beautiful work.
- Yes.

1359
01:12:30,784 --> 01:12:33,653
Ma'am, did your daughter
ask you to do this with your hands?

1360
01:12:34,387 --> 01:12:37,223
You maintained the pose until the end.

1361
01:12:37,457 --> 01:12:40,560
I think the fingertips
are really beautiful.

1362
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,096
- Is this your first time seeing this?
- Yes. It's my first time.

1363
01:12:43,163 --> 01:12:46,666
The work and the explanation about it
were totally unexpected.

1364
01:12:46,866 --> 01:12:49,302
So, this is what a mother means to us.

1365
01:12:49,369 --> 01:12:52,138
It's a person who grants all our wishes.

1366
01:12:52,772 --> 01:12:57,077
The way she expressed motherhood
so succinctly

1367
01:12:57,143 --> 01:12:58,745
stuck me so powerfully.

1368
01:12:58,812 --> 01:13:00,413
- I really liked it.
- Thank you.

1369
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:04,284
Oh Dolce Vita,
you may go back to your seat.

1370
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:05,652
Thank you.

1371
01:13:09,622 --> 01:13:11,224
I wasn't going to cry.

1372
01:13:12,258 --> 01:13:13,626
You shouldn't cry.

1373
01:13:16,696 --> 01:13:18,164
You should go sit.

1374
01:13:18,231 --> 01:13:19,466
I will.

1375
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:22,402
MISSION 2: PAINTING
JUDGING OVER

1376
01:13:22,469 --> 01:13:23,737
What do we do?

1377
01:13:24,204 --> 01:13:25,305
What do we do?

1378
01:13:27,574 --> 01:13:28,575
I think...

1379
01:13:29,609 --> 01:13:30,710
This was so pretty.

1380
01:13:31,378 --> 01:13:35,181
But I think this was
a very symbolic performance.

1381
01:13:35,248 --> 01:13:37,717
These two are very powerful.
What do you think?

1382
01:13:37,784 --> 01:13:41,187
I think these two will do well again.

1383
01:13:41,454 --> 01:13:43,523
I like this candidate.
When I saw the work,

1384
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:45,725
I was glad that the candidate
didn't win Round One.

1385
01:13:45,792 --> 01:13:47,861
<i>If they survived,</i>
<i>we wouldn't have been able to see this.</i>

1386
01:13:47,927 --> 01:13:49,362
Actually, I like this one.

1387
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:52,265
- What do we do?
- It touched my heart.

1388
01:13:52,332 --> 01:13:54,167
Opinions are divided again.

1389
01:13:56,636 --> 01:13:58,038
What should we do?

1390
01:13:58,438 --> 01:13:59,939
I can't pick one.

1391
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:01,508
This is driving me crazy.

1392
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:07,280
We're all cleaning up,
so everyone's quiet.

1393
01:14:07,547 --> 01:14:08,848
We're all exhausted.

1394
01:14:09,549 --> 01:14:13,219
Now we need to go into hibernation mode
and save our energy.

1395
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:21,161
They must be exhausted.

1396
01:14:21,227 --> 01:14:22,595
- They look tired.
- They're all...

1397
01:14:24,931 --> 01:14:26,232
It must be hard.

1398
01:14:27,934 --> 01:14:32,172
Now we have only two seats left
for the top three.

1399
01:14:32,906 --> 01:14:35,475
Before we announce the second survivor,

1400
01:14:35,542 --> 01:14:37,577
we will reveal the three candidates

1401
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:40,413
for the winner of the Painting mission.

1402
01:14:41,047 --> 01:14:42,949
The Painting mission of New Face.

1403
01:14:43,316 --> 01:14:45,418
The candidates for the final are...

1404
01:14:51,124 --> 01:14:53,126
Detailed Hands. Congratulations.

1405
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:57,497
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF PAINTING
DETAILED HANDS

1406
01:14:57,997 --> 01:14:59,332
The second candidate.

1407
01:15:00,033 --> 01:15:02,035
First Man. Congratulations.

1408
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:04,170
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF PAINTING
FIRST MAN

1409
01:15:04,437 --> 01:15:05,572
Thank you.

1410
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:08,742
The third candidate.

1411
01:15:10,443 --> 01:15:13,113
Beauty Heiress. Congratulations.

1412
01:15:13,179 --> 01:15:15,448
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF PAINTING
BEAUTY HEIRESS

1413
01:15:15,515 --> 01:15:17,017
We have three candidates

1414
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:20,587
for one of the three finalists

1415
01:15:20,653 --> 01:15:21,888
who will advance to the finals.

1416
01:15:21,955 --> 01:15:23,189
RISABAE.

1417
01:15:23,256 --> 01:15:26,259
Please explain why
these three were chosen as candidates.

1418
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,730
The impact that First Man first showed

1419
01:15:30,797 --> 01:15:34,000
when he appeared with his model
was incredible.

1420
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:36,302
<i>The perfection he displayed,</i>

1421
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:39,539
<i>as if it were completed with just</i>
<i>three touches, was truly amazing.</i>

1422
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,244
<i>Beauty Heiress's mysterious look,</i>

1423
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,447
<i>which was like the epitome of K-beauty,</i>

1424
01:15:47,514 --> 01:15:49,115
<i>was truly beautiful.</i>

1425
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:52,452
<i>And Detailed Hands' work</i>

1426
01:15:52,519 --> 01:15:56,289
perfectly matched her name.

1427
01:15:56,356 --> 01:15:59,693
From selecting the model
to executing the look,

1428
01:15:59,759 --> 01:16:01,594
<i>everything was excellent.</i>

1429
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:04,297
The three contestants
are still just candidates,

1430
01:16:04,364 --> 01:16:05,899
but Beauty Heiress,

1431
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:07,334
how are you feeling now?

1432
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,504
Actually, I'm confident
in making my work look pretty.

1433
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:14,140
But I think the judges
recognized it so well.

1434
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,709
Thank you.

1435
01:16:16,309 --> 01:16:19,779
Everyone has done such wonderful work,

1436
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,749
so I'm just grateful

1437
01:16:22,816 --> 01:16:25,085
to be one of the candidates.

1438
01:16:25,151 --> 01:16:26,453
I see. First Man.

1439
01:16:26,686 --> 01:16:28,054
Are you tired?

1440
01:16:29,956 --> 01:16:31,057
How are you feeling?

1441
01:16:31,224 --> 01:16:33,860
I've been feeling a lot of self-blame

1442
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:37,764
and reflecting on myself
because of the last mission,

1443
01:16:37,997 --> 01:16:39,899
so I'm incredibly grateful right now

1444
01:16:39,966 --> 01:16:43,203
and feel very fortunate
to be one of the candidates.

1445
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:45,405
So, these three

1446
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:47,707
have been nominated

1447
01:16:47,774 --> 01:16:49,109
for one finalist spot.

1448
01:16:49,342 --> 01:16:53,780
Which contestant will be
the second to make the top three?

1449
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:57,684
The winner of the Painting mission
of New Face

1450
01:16:58,118 --> 01:16:59,619
to advance to the finals is...

1451
01:17:03,857 --> 01:17:05,225
Why am I feeling nervous?

1452
01:17:06,393 --> 01:17:07,961
<i>I've worked really hard.</i>

1453
01:17:08,028 --> 01:17:09,896
<i>It would be great</i>
<i>if I advanced to the finals.</i>

1454
01:17:09,963 --> 01:17:12,432
<i>Maybe I'll be able to sit up there.</i>

1455
01:17:13,166 --> 01:17:14,367
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

1456
01:17:15,168 --> 01:17:17,804
<i>I was very satisfied with my makeup.</i>

1457
01:17:17,871 --> 01:17:19,472
<i>I'm sure I'll make it.</i>

1458
01:17:22,375 --> 01:17:24,544
They all did a great job.

1459
01:17:27,047 --> 01:17:28,014
I'm nervous.

1460
01:17:28,515 --> 01:17:30,150
I think I'll pass out staring at that.

1461
01:17:35,221 --> 01:17:36,189
The winner is...

1462
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:37,851
