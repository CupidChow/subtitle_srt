What is it, exactly?

222
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,270
You must've come for a reason.

223
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:23,950
What? You think I came to sleep with you?

224
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,370

Let me ask this time.

Why did you change your number and disappear?

239
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,150
F***. Thinking about it again pisses me off.

What did I say to you?

242
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,820
Did I take advantage of you and leave?

243
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,380
Choi Jin Hwan, get your facts straight.

244
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,690
You're the one who took advantage of me.

245
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,680
You kept testing the water afterward.

246
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,320
How was I testing the water?

247
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,470
I was embarrassed to say, "We're dating now."

248
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,220
But we kissed.

249
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,180
I thought that meant we were together.

Weren't you guys together, then?

255

He gave me relationship advice. Come on now.
