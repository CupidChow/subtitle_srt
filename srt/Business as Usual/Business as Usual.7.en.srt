1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,914
(Kim Min Jun / Chae Jong Hyeok)

2
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:19,300
(Chae Jin Hwan / Seong Seung Ha)

3
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:32,743
"Business as usual"

4
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:38,457
This feels nice.

5
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,071
Your head's heavy.

6
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:44,443
You like it though.

7
00:00:46,643 --> 00:00:48,243
Chae Jin Hwan!

8
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:51,000
Look over there.

9
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,843
What?

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,629
The sunset.

11
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,757
I didn't know it was this pretty.

12
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:06,657
It's beautiful, right?

13
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:09,371
It really is.

14
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:16,643
What?

15
00:01:16,957 --> 00:01:18,429
You too.

16
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,100
What?

17
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,829
You're beautiful too.

18
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,612
Oh, come on.

19
00:01:25,843 --> 00:01:27,557
What should we eat for dinner?

20
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:31,186
Mm...

21
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:37,371
How about this?

22
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:39,899
What's that supposed to mean?

23
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:41,126
You know exactly what I mean.

24
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:42,186
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,326
You don't even blink anymore before

26
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:45,633
asking bold stuff, huh?

27
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,186
Oww!

28
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,343
If you want to know...

29
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,557
I'll tell you if you give me a kiss.

30
00:01:59,657 --> 00:02:00,857
That's it?

31
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:31,643
(Episode 7: We are really dating now)

32
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:46,014
That day was the perfect ending.

33
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:48,391
And now, we became the couple

34
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:49,924
we had dreamed of.

35
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:53,516
Even if we fight again, get tired,

36
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,541
and beg each other to let go,

37
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:58,231
We will never let go

38
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,347
of each other's hands.

39
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,824
(Today)
Today, too, as sweet and

40
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:02,271
(Today)
romantic as ever,

41
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,500
Yeah right.

42
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:06,357
The truth is

43
00:03:06,857 --> 00:03:08,814
we're still fighting.

44
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:18,671
So what's the problem?

45
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,257
The apartment.

46
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,677
I want to renew the lease,

47
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:26,382
but the deposit went up.

48
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,383
Plus, houses with great prices

49
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,926
like this are only available here.

50
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,579
And I don't have the money.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,100
Why is life so damn complicated?

52
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:41,071
Then just borrow from me.

53
00:03:42,157 --> 00:03:44,957
- Hey, I can't.
- Then live with me.

54
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:47,914
Seriously.

55
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:50,386
- Let's just live together.
- Chae Jin Hwan.

56
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:52,517
Do you know that what

57
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:54,124
you are saying shows that

58
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:56,149
you don't understand anything?

59
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,986
I messed up again.

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,455
Sorry.

61
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:12,743
‘Sorry'?

62
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:14,211
You say it like it's nothing, huh?

63
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,229
I said I'm sorry.

64
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,514
Never mind. You don't get it.

65
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,743
You say whatever you want.

66
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,229
You're a rich boy, so you probably

67
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:30,905
don't think about anything.

68
00:04:30,929 --> 00:04:32,714
Anyone can just say it like that.

69
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,349
If it were that simple, I wouldn't be

70
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:35,947
sitting here stressed out like this.

71
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,217
You want me to just go

72
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:39,398
and sign the lease right now?

73
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:40,986
You're always so positive

74
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,451
about everything.

75
00:04:52,314 --> 00:04:53,634
Sorry,

76
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:57,267
maybe we should talk about this later.

77
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:06,429
I shouldn't have said that much.

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,543
(I'm almost there)
(Hurry, I miss you)

79
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:28,029
(Arriving in 5 minutes)
(Just got home)

80
00:05:28,057 --> 00:05:30,643
(Jin Hwan)

81
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,650
(What are you doing?)

82
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:08,542
(I'm in front of your place)

83
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,957
Next time, I have to be more careful.

84
00:06:51,843 --> 00:06:53,800
Is he stop being mad now?

85
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,329
(What are you doing? I'm in front of your place)
What are you doing?

86
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:07,203
(What are you doing? I'm in front of your place)
I'm in front of your place.

87
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,400
Min Jun!

88
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,329
Why didn't you dry your hair?

89
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:44,043
You'll catch a cold.

90
00:07:44,157 --> 00:07:45,600
You were right outside.

91
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:48,886
Sorry.

92
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:51,257
Forget it.

93
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:53,857
I knew you'd been on edge lately.

94
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:55,686
No, still.

95
00:07:56,529 --> 00:07:58,771
I shouldn't have acted like that.

96
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,271
It's my fault.

97
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:04,883
Just because you're my boyfriend doesn't

98
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,402
mean you have to deal with my moods.

99
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,046
If I don't take your moods,

100
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
who else will?

101
00:08:12,286 --> 00:08:14,614
That's exactly what boyfriends are for.

102
00:08:16,157 --> 00:08:19,043
So I don't mind if you're moody.

103
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:22,057
What gets to me is…

104
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,239
It always feels like you're

105
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,392
thinking about the end.

106
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,757
I am?

107
00:08:27,957 --> 00:08:30,100
Even if it's just lip service,

108
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,191
Can't you just say,

109
00:08:31,216 --> 00:08:32,305
“Okay, let's live together,”

110
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,450
and let it go?

111
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:36,571
I'm not asking you to lie.

112
00:08:37,757 --> 00:08:40,629
Just don't be so serious all the time.

113
00:08:42,343 --> 00:08:44,286
Even if we break up

114
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,430
or one day I get so upset when I see

115
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:47,463
your toothbrush that

116
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,910
I have to throw it in the trash.

117
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,843
Right now, we're together.

118
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,571
That's what relationships are.

119
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,400
I'll try. Really.

120
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:04,729
But I...

121
00:09:05,857 --> 00:09:09,057
I'm not like that.

122
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,959
I overthink everything because

123
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:16,406
I didn't want to break up.

124
00:09:17,514 --> 00:09:19,029
Sorry.

125
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:24,342
What were you gonna do

126
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,570
if I didn't come out today?

127
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,414
I would've kept coming until you did.

128
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:28,638
Wow.

129
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:30,995
A cake?

130
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,786
It's our anniversary. One year.

131
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,043
I'm touched.

132
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,429
What's this?

133
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,211
I think you can eat it just by

134
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,647
adding the ingredients.

135
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:41,051
Oh, I think I saw that.

136
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,576
With cheese, right?

137
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Yeah, and sausages.

138
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,714
Well we've got that right here.

139
00:09:45,914 --> 00:09:48,614
Stop. Don't be gross.

140
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:52,129
What if someone hears us?

141
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,986
So what? Come here.

142
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:56,704
From now on, dry your hair

143
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:57,924
before coming out.

144
00:10:17,671 --> 00:10:19,271
Hey, Chae Jin Hwan.

145
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:30,771
It's already really cold out.

146
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:32,486
Yeah.

147
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,814
Feels like it's going to snow soon.

148
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,714
Should I buy a new toothbrush?

149
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,114
Why?

150
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,243
Is mine still here?

151
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm joking, it's a joke.

152
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,014
Then you better behave

153
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:58,586
before I scrub my sneakers

154
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,293
with your toothbrush.

155
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,171
Okay, okay. I love you.

156
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:06,157
What? I didn't hear you.

157
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,400
Hear what?

158
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,343
I didn't hear you, say it again.

159
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:13,943
What? Don't act like you don't know.

160
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:15,463
You say it all the time

161
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:16,923
when we're in bed.

162
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,243
Dummy.

163
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:20,440
If it weren't for that moment,

164
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:21,494
you'd never have said it.

165
00:11:21,518 --> 00:11:22,717
I love you.

166
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:28,029
Geez.

167
00:11:28,914 --> 00:11:30,557
I love you too.

168
00:11:38,386 --> 00:11:39,929
Let's eat.

169
00:12:04,343 --> 00:12:06,171
Are you almost done?

170
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,114
Not yet.

171
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,286
I'm not letting go.

172
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,729
- Let go!
- No. You hugged me first.

173
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:17,214
- The tteokbokki's getting cold.
- Then let's eat it cold.

174
00:12:17,443 --> 00:12:19,242
We still have to add the sausage!

175
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:20,267
Let go!

176
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:22,886
Okay, okay.

177
00:12:25,357 --> 00:12:26,857
Make it delicious.

178
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:28,300
You too.

179
00:12:45,786 --> 00:12:48,486
- Happy 1st anniversary to us!
- Happy anniversary!

180
00:12:53,786 --> 00:12:55,171
How about you try this?

181
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:03,400
How is it? Good?

182
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:05,086
What a relief.

183
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,700
The cake is so cute.

184
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:08,957
Right?

185
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:10,329
I picked it myself.

186
00:13:12,886 --> 00:13:14,157
Looks so yummy.

187
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,043
How was it?

188
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,286
Mmm, yummy.

189
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,571
Cheers.

190
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:35,914
It's so nice.

191
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,314
Are you going somewhere tomorrow?

192
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,600
Umm... tomorrow?

193
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,429
I'm not going anywhere. Why?

194
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,443
We have somewhere to go tomorrow.

195
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:51,900
Where?

196
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:54,434
I'd looked it up long before

197
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,700
but never got to go.

198
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,629
Long before?

199
00:13:59,114 --> 00:14:00,114
Where?

200
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:02,343
It' somewhere.

201
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:05,282
Anyway, I want to go there

202
00:14:05,307 --> 00:14:06,987
for our anniversary.

203
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:10,343
Okay, let's go.

204
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,357
For real?

205
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:14,957
Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

206
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:26,450
Even if we fight by the little

207
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:27,675
and big things…

208
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:30,686
Because we're honest about how we feel,

209
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:32,682
We always manage to make up

210
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:33,975
and love each other again.

211
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:31,457
Wow, how nice!

212
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:32,657
It's really pretty.

213
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:34,800
What do you think, Min Jun?

214
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:36,000
It's nice.

215
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:38,400
You already guessed it, right?

216
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:39,629
Mm.

217
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,257
- Min Jun.
- Hmm?

218
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:42,457
Stand over here.

219
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:43,657
I wanna take a picture.

220
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,229
Right there!

221
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,043
Okay,

222
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,357
one, two, three!

223
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,729
Why are you so cute?

224
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,200
Why do you keep saying I'm cute?

225
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,543
Because you are.

226
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:03,571
Let's take one together.

227
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Great.

228
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,757
- You hold the camera.
- Press here, right?

229
00:16:05,786 --> 00:16:06,571
Yes.

230
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Okay.

231
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,257
One, two, three.

232
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,786
Min Jun, look here.

233
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:20,100
Cute, right?

234
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:21,643
This one's really nice too.

235
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,286
That turned out great.

236
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,057
I love you.

237
00:16:31,086 --> 00:16:32,257
What's with you?

238
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:33,757
I love you, too.

239
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:37,986
The picture is beautiful.

240
00:16:38,014 --> 00:16:39,914
Yeah, you're so cute.

241
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:59,171
"Business as usual"
