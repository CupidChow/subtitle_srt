00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,590
You were cute then, too.

189
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,530
What's so cute, anyway-

190
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,510
The way you're acting now.

191
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:37,870
I'll go to the next lecture, then.

192
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,290
Okay. See you.

193
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,900
I'll be in touch.

[Choi Jin Hwan]

195
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,510
<i>Min Joon, what are you up to?</i>

196
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,040
<i>I'm going home now.</i>

197
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,570
<i>How about you?</i>

198
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,570
Huh? Jin Hwan.

199
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,840
Let's go to the club, I said.

200
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,920
I don't want to.

201
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,240
You always say no these days.

202
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,900
Why do you hate clubbing?

203
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,510
No one goes to pick-up bars anymore.

204
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,170
A pick-up bar is better.

205
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,290
It's bright in pick-up bars.

206
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,740
You're better off somewhere dark.

207
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,890
<i>What are you saying?</i>

208
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,750
Let's eat.

209
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,320
<i>Seriously, you don't get it.</i>

210
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,080
Ask Choi Jin Hwan later, then.

211
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,560
What's taking him so long?

212
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,010
Guys, look.

213
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,420
Isn't the sky* so pretty today?
(Sky is "haneul" in Korean)

214
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,910
Geez, what are you doing?

215
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,040
Don't do that.

216
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,160
I'm just saying the sky is pretty. Why?

217
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,320
Look at the sky.

218
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,260
The sky does look pretty.

219
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,740
- Shit.
- Hey, hey.

220
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,640
Let's leave Choi Jin Hwan.

221
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,310
Let's go on our own.

222
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,800
You'll find someone prettier than Ha Neul.

223
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,640
The wind feels nice.

224
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,570
It is.

225
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,540
I love weather like this.

226
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,760
It clears your mind.

227
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,500
Let me have a bite of the sausage.

228
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,290
- I don't want to.
- Just a bite.

229
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,000
I said I don't want to.

230
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Give me some. Who bought you that?

231
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,120
- You should've-
- It was me, wasn't it?

Aren't you picking up?

235
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm sure it's not important. I can call back later.

236
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,800
Hello?

237
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,380
<i>Kim Min Joon, you're with Choi Jin Hwan, right?</i>

238

Well, yes.

<i>I need to talk to him, but I can't reach him.</i>

<i>Tell him to answer my call.</i>

241
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,530
Should I put him on the phone?

242

<i>No, I'll call his phone.</i>

243
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,720
I'll go when I feel like it.

244
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,180
Don't they have homework?

245
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,500
They always want me to go out.

246
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,350
<i>Guys are flipping out since you aren't coming.</i>

247
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,480
<i>Just show up briefly.</i>

248
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,880
You ran away earlier, too.

249
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,010
You can go see them.

250
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,320
You seem close to your friends.

251
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,940
It's nice, and I'm envious, too.

252
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,090
Really? Want to come with me, then?

253
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,590
No. Not really.

254
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,180
I'm not close to them.

255
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,990
Come on. Who cares?

256
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,750
You're friends once you know their names and faces.

257
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,400
I won't go, either.

258

Choi Jin Hwan, I haven't seen you lately.

00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,410
You came because Woo Hyeok called.

264
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,300
I brought my Min Joon today.

265
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,310
Hi, Min Joon.

266
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,540
Hi.

267
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,100
Your Min Joon?

268
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,450
You hurt my feelings.

269
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,570
Kim Min Joon, don't trust Choi Jin Hwan.

270
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,130
He'll betray you later.

271
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,230
What do you mean?

272
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,770
Min Joon is different than you guys.

273

What's wrong with us?

274
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,770
We can't pick up girls without you, Choi Jin Hwan.

275
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,710
We lost a few already. You'd better take care of it.

276
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,520
Why would I? Just be grateful I came.

277
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,630

286
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,940

I was right, wasn't I?

296
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,230
They bother me so much.

297
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,900
What's this?

298
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,110
You're sitting so closely.

299
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,210
Don't answer, Min Joon.

300
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,370
He's not worth it.

301
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,850
What?

302
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,340
Ditch him and join me, Min Joon.

303
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,500
Let's have a drink.

304
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,550
Give me a break.

305
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,400
It's my loss to be nice to you.

306
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,750
Are you jealous right now? Choi Woo Hyeok is?

307
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,520
I'm not jealous. I'm telling the truth.

308
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,680
Are you jealous, my Woo Hyeok?

309
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,370
Stop pretending. It's annoying.

310
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,600
Are you really jealous?

311
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,950
- I said I'm not.
- You are. You are.

312
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,310
Come on.

00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,970
Geez.

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,360
I can't calm down.

00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,880
Why?

316
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,590
They all have boyfriends.

317
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,020
Why hang out at a place like this, then?

318
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,690
Hey, let's just drink among us. Let drink.

319
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,130
Okay, let's drink.

<i>If they don't call when they're with friends,</i>

342

What are they doing outside?

381
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,660
Are they dating or something?

382
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,040
Bullshit. They're friends. Come on.

383
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,990
Hey, Min Joon might actually believe you.

But there's definitely something going on.

385

They never said so, but they've been

386
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,140
close for a long time.

387
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,360
Since mysterious Choi Jin Hwan treats him like that,

388
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,890
their relationship must be special.

389
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,830
It must be this!

390

391
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,550
arranged partner or something?

392
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,470

<i>Why not?</i>

401
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,540

406
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,310
<i>Isn't that your specialty?</i>

407
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,070
<i>What are you so unhappy about?</i>

408
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,570
<i>You must've come for a reason.</i>

409
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,180
<i>You think I came to sleep with you?</i>

410
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,150

<i>Everything changed already, Choi Jin Hwan.</i>

415
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,100
<i>You're good at talking now.</i>

416
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,980
<i>Why were you like that then if you can speak up?</i>

417
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,390
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

418
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,650
<i>Make yourself clear.</i>

419
