Yes.

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,140
When Jin Hwan was a freelancer,

59
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,300
we worked together once.

60

That's how we met.

62
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,910
And I fell for him at first sight then.

63
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,360
I begged Jin Hwan to introduce me to him so hard.

64
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,020
I didn't know you'd actually get married.

65
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,210
I know. You said you can introduce me,

66
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,240
but you can't guarantee anything. I remember.

67
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,740

69

71
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,170

72
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,860
If I didn't ask you to introduce me to him,

73
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,210

85

94
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,960
Since it's a dating book,

95
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,070
the cover is an eye-catching pink and

96
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,660
the title pops immediately.

97
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,490
The manual book concept was expressed by

98
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,970
a couple playing games on their phones.

99
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,850
The target is the young generation

100
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,160
who initiate dates on their phones.

101
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,480
That's how we visualized the couple.

102
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,020

communicates a successful relationship.

104
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,490
It was designed to make the readers

105
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,600
believe their dating wishes will come true.

106
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,360
Relationships aren't easy.

107
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,860
No, I don't think so.

108
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,040
It might sound easy,

109
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,180
but the courtship process is harder than you think.

110
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,370
Jin Hwan is obviously handsome,

111
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:05,700
but I don't think you're skillful at dating.

112

113
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,800
No, I don't think so at all.

I'm sure you know lots of men.

184
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,080
- What?
- Invite him, too, then.

185
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,930
Why bother?

186
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,500
I don't want too many people.

187
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,830
You like socializing.

188
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,240
I do?

189
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,540
Didn't you like hanging out with people?

190
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,640
You felt awkward being alone with me.

191
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,220
But you were curious about my friends.

192
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,040
It wasn't like that.

193
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,440
I went because you invited me.

194
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,580
Drink slowly. You haven't eaten.

195
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,180
It's okay. I'm fine.

196
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,750
I heard drunk people say that.

197
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,570
Should we go home if you're tired?

198
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,740
You've been working late without eating.

199
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,880
It's okay. I'm totally fine.

200
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,990
How was studying abroad?

201
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,330
I don't know.

202
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,560
It was an escape.

203
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,610
Escape?

204
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,230
Nothing went my way in Korea.

205
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,870
I didn't want to work at my dad's company, either.

206
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,060
I'd like to ask you something.

207
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,710
Why did you get the wrong idea?

208
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,220
You told your friend about me.

209
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,850
What do you mean?

210
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,320
You slept with me and

211
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,360
called Choi Woo Hyeok, didn't you?

212
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,390
What did you tell him then?

213
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,980
I think we're mistaken about something.

214
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,820
Let's make this one thing clear first.

215
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,470
What is it?

216
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,850
I never gossiped about you.

217
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,410
One of the girls my friends invited

218
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,240
for a drink kept clinging to me.

219
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,470
Nothing happened with her,

220
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,520
but she kept telling Woo Hyeok she needed to see me.

221
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,380
So, I did meet her once because he begged me.

222
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,220
I didn't want you to worry about it,

223
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,810
so I wanted to deal with it without telling you.

224
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,810
I remember this.

225
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,180
You disappeared on me after I turned her down,

226
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,800
so Woo Hyeok and I drank to oblivion.

227
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:15,670
I'm not sure what you heard and misinterpreted.

228
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,240
I don't remember exactly since it was long ago.

229
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,490
But what I'm angry about is

230
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,160
why didn't you talk to me about it then?

231
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,400
How could I-

232
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,950
Hey, Kim Min Joon.

233
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,950
"What was that about? Was that about me?"

234
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,500
Was asking that so difficult?

235
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,160
We weren't just ordinary friends.

236
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,810
Why did you run away?

237
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,770
I get scared...

238
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,100
when I like someone too much.

239
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,730
Why couldn't I say anything to you?

240
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,810
Because...

241
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,290
I didn't want you to tell me I meant nothing to you.

242
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,450
Disappearing without a word

243
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,770
is something to be angry about.

244
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,590
I'm sorry.

245
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,000
I thought you were...

246
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,230
Kim Min Joon,

247
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,510
what do I do with you?

248
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,120
You're going to Yeonhadong, right?

249
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,570
Yes.

250
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,040
We'll leave now.

251
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,460
Sir, could you drive slowly?

252
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,070
Sure.

253
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,200
Are you awake?

254
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,320
I got so drunk.

255
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,640
Where are we?

256
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,320

00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,690

Should we go out since we're both free tomorrow?

Somewhere nearby is fine, too.

265

271
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,900
Me?

272
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,580
I'm with Kim Min Joon. Why?

273
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,040
You know Park Min Ji, right?

274
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,060
The one who joined me when we were with

275
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,750
Jae Cheol and the other guys.

276
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,690
She wants to see you so badly right now.

277
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,720
<i>She says to stop evading her and wants to talk.</i>

278
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,320
She said that?

279
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,550
I was nice to her, and she thinks I'm interested.

280
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,390
Did something happen between you two?

281
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:08,490
She's been spewing nonsense like you were a couple.

282
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,000
<i>I thought something happened.</i>

283
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,150
Come on. She obviously likes me.

284
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,330
I just humored her a few times out of pity.

285
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,710
<i>She'll go to your place if you don't come.</i>

286
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,720
I think you'd better come.

287
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,400
That's enough. Stop.

288
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,240
I didn't want it to last, anyway.

289
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,550
