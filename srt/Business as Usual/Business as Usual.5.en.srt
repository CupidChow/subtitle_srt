I said I'll drive you.

6
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,570
I said I'm fine.

8

Hey.

Min Joon,

10
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,440
let's do that thing.

11
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,720

15
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,300
Didn't you want this?

16
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,040
I did?

17

18

You wish you had one.

20
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,930
I didn't.

21
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,140

26

I probably meant the couple, not the key chain.

You still remember that?

28
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,420
Still, take it.

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Choi Jin Hwan, look.

30

What did you think of me, then?

35
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,520
I liked you from the start.

36
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,660
I liked you way more than you thought.

37
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,810
That's why I was scared.

38
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,630
But I had no confidence.

39
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,770
You were so popular,

40
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,830
but I was ordinary.

41
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,530
That's why...

42
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,440
whenever we were together, I kept wondering

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,740
when we'd break up.

44
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,070
You told me that...

45
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,480
you don't like people clinging.

46
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,180
You liked me since I was detached
and had no complaints.

47
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,980
- Hey, that was-
- But I'm not.

48
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm not detached at all.

49
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,140
I said things were fine
so you wouldn't dislike me.

50
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,920
How could you be detached when you like someone?

51
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,990
To be honest,

52
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,770
I understand what you must've found

53
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,560
frustrating about me.

54
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm still bad at talking.

55
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,090
That's why I'm a pushover at work.

56
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,640
But Choi Jin Hwan,

57
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,610
why didn't you tell me?

58
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,430
We spent enough time together.

59
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,800
You knew I liked you.

60
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,430
But you've been sounding me out.

61
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,720
Am I wrong?

62
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,360
Am I mistaken and confused about this, too?

63
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,170
Hey, how do you remember all that-

64
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,650
Yes, you're right.

65
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,340
I remembered everything, but I couldn't speak up.

66
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,120
Like a fool.

67
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,480
I wasn't confident, either.

68
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,520
You never suggested doing anything with me first.

69
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,560
How could I've been so sure?

70
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,000
- And-
- That's why...

71
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,350
That's why...

72
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,130
we were incompatible from the beginning.

73
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,070
Kim Min Joon.

74
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,250
Min Joon?

75
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,370
Excuse me, Min Joon.

76

77

You crazy bastard.

78
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,040
What are you doing tomorrow?

79
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,800
We're going to the wedding.

80
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
Let's have breakfast and go together.

81
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,810
Please stop now.

82
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,640
Stop what?

83
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,610
Hey, you think I'm joking?

84
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,890
No.

85
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,680
Anyway, we know what the issue was now.

86
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,080
Can't we be friends again, then?

87
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,860
I can't.

88
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,070
Why not?

89
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,830
You might be able to do that,

90
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,520
but I can't.

91
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,140
I just wanted to...

92
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,100
sort out the built-up emotions today.

93
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,960
We can give it a try this time, then.

94
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,060
You can't think you're the first ex

95
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,770
who reached out again, right?

96
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,710
Friends?

97
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah, right.

98
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,010
A relationship like that is nice, too.

99
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,610
What?

100
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,550

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,330
You said I upset you in a lot of ways.

103
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,490
I wasn't aware of a lot of things, too.

104
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,800
I'm in the same boat.

105
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,240
You say that now?

106
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,030
Why am I saying that now?

107
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,670

Of course, I loved the 20-year-old Kim Min Joon, too.

111

I lost you while goofing around then.

112

185
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,650
Where are they going for honeymoon?

186
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,370
<i>- The wedding is starting soon.</i>
- How do you feel now?

187
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,490
<i>- Please take your seats.</i>
- It's okay.

188
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,800
- Just one second.
- Okay.

189
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,360
Yes, we'll hear a congratulatory speech next.

190
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,710
Let me introduce you to this person.

191
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,230
He's the son of the CEO of the company

192
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,160
where the groom's father works.

193
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,200
They grew up close as kids
through the employee gatherings.

194
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,300
And they're best friends now.

195
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,660
Please welcome Mr. Choi Jin Hwan.

196
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,530
It's an honor to say congratulatory words today.

197
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,670
I've been observing Woo Hyeok's
relationship from the side.

198
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,200
That's why this is so special.

199
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,980
My company is working on a dating manual right now.

200
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,770
The term "dating manual" might sound strange,

201
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,410
but I think a lot of people struggle
in relationships.

202
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,520
But these two inexperienced people

203
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,690
ignored all the dating tips that are out there

204
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,470
and focused on each other's feelings.

205
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,960
They're finally getting married now.

206
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,650
I was moved by how forward they are.

207
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,830
It made me think this must be true love.

208
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,950
I also want to be free
from those rules and tips I hear

209
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,710
and focus on my heart completely.

210
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,440
Lastly, I want to applaud them for their courage.

211
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,660
Since they're sincere toward each other,

212
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,670
I'm sure they can overcome any obstacles.

213
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,000
I hope they maintain this spirit
and live beautifully.

214
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,670
I congratulate them once again.

215
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,390

366
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,900
<i>Do they feel the same way as you do?</i>

367
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,480
<i>You know, too.</i>

368
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,980
<i>You and I are really incompatible.</i>

369
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,630
<i>I wish Choi Jin Hwan well.</i>

370
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,400
<i>I want him to stop acting out</i>

371
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,420
<i>and return to his father's company.</i>

372
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,210
<i>Maybe that means you like him that much.</i>

373
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,660
<i>He's wrapping things up and moving abroad.</i>

374
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,690
<i>The person I like asked me to disappear.</i>

375
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,020
<i>I have to do that for him.</i>

376
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:17,320
<i>You know how it'd end, too.</i>

377
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,140
<i>And I know, too.</i>

378
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,850
<i>The first love needs to be left as a memory.</i>

379
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,710
<i>Do you mean that?</i>

380
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,120
<i>Yes.</i>

381
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,020
<i>Please let me be free now.</i>

382
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,180
<i>He decided not to quit.</i>

383
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,050
<i>He was supposed to come to pack last night.</i>

384
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,570
<i>You must've missed him.</i>

385
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:37,390
<i>Thinking now,</i>

386
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,950
<i>I've always been running away.</i>
