1
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,540
The pain of time continues

2
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,900
Long invisible

3
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,340
But covered by tears

4
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,900
Thank you today, little bear.

5
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,780
Give me such an expensive bag

6
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,140
What a coincidence

7
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,540
You bought a bag too.

8
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,620
Why is it still a lady's?

9
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,440
I didn't get photographed when I bought the bag.

10
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,380
Whether this is a special hobby or bought as a gift, it's a headache.

11
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,540
Your new bag

12
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,940
This bag was bought for me.

13
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,260
Mr. Gu

14
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,220
Obviously, some things are more surprising when two people achieve them together.

15
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,780
Assistant

16
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,100
As my assistant

17
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,060
How can there not be a complete package?

18
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,740
This will damage my image.

19
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,020
So I bought this for my image.

20
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,220
Understand

21
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,980
OK, thank you Mr. Gu

22
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,220
I'll try it first

23
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,580
Why would I put my work in someone else's bag?

24
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,000
It's just for packing stuff.

25
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,620
It's obvious that he likes the bag I gave him more.

26
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,900
do you mean this

27
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,560
Oh, no, no

28
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,520
I just carried this bag.

29
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,700
So my assistant can only carry the bag I gave him.

30
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,220
Mr. Gu, you are boring.

31
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,060
According to the notice

32
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,860
Aren't you supposed to be filming now?

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,620
I work very hard on filming every day

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,300
You are the boring one.

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,740
Okay, stop arguing.

36
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
Xiao Yan

37
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,700
What

38
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,660
Dad's condition suddenly worsened.

39
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,860
Ms. Xu, we are preparing for surgery for your father.

40
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,060
His current condition

41
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,380
Not very optimistic

42
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,740
You have to be mentally prepared

43
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,900
Come in

44
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,860
Director Liang

45
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,300
I shouldn't have bothered you.

46
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,280
But Dr. Zhang said my father needs surgery.

47
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,340
The situation is not good now

48
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,620
I am worried about my father's condition

49
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,340
So can you go meet my dad?

50
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,860
I won't go

51
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,980
Since the past cannot be repeated

52
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,420
There is no meaning

53
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,860
Should I go see your father?

54
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,500
It won't have any impact on now.

55
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,840
If you still want to work in the crew

56
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,060
It's best to keep your personal feelings to yourself.

57
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,900
Anything else?

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,380
It's ok. I'm busy.

59
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,100
Find me, director.

60
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,460
I have some ideas I want to discuss with you.

61
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,020
I don't know if this is more in line with the character.

62
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,180
Facing it coldly won't change anything

63
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,060
It's never too late to be honest

64
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,260
Because many things

65
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,220
Once lost

66
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,620
I can never come back again

67
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,940
This is different from the original line in the script, right?

68
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,260
Just change the lines

69
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,020
When did actors who came back from the United States also have this bad habit?

70
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,140
I'm not covering up the lines randomly

71
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,540
I am expressing my understanding of the character.

72
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,460
This scene

73
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,900
It's the heroine

74
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,740
Unwilling to face the past

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,820
Always choose to escape

76
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,100
I think these words

77
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,660
This is what Professor Xu wanted to say to him the most.

78
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,820
do you think so

79
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,440
snort

80
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,380
It seems that what you want to express is not the City of Time.

81
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,420
I used to try to figure out the role

82
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,900
I went to the mining site with Professor Xu

83
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,780
Professor Xu told me

84
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,660
Xu Zhen is a

85
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,380
Looks lively and cheerful

86
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,060
A girl who longs for family affection

87
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,720
Director Yang

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,660
Although we are not friends

89
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,940
But we are work partners anyway.

90
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,380
I sincerely hope you

91
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
Able to face

92
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,980
Facing Professor Xu

93
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,540
Stop running away

94
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,620
Stop pushing them away with a cold attitude.

95
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,299
I booked a movie at the cinema

96
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,619
I hope you will be able to enjoy it

97
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's go

98
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,700
Are you a water monster?

99
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,460
It's because I drink too much water

100
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,300
Need to get out of the eyes

101
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,620
My dad

102
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,660
The surgery is very risky.

103
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,620
But my mother didn't want to see him.

104
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,660
Drink some water first

105
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,300
Otherwise, you will hear my plan for today.

106
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,500
I can't even cry

107
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,020
Do you have any good ideas?

108
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,060
Because you worked so hard before.

109
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,340
I can help you once

110
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,060
The condition is

111
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,460
Throw away the bag Lin Jinxiu gave you

112
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,740
Hello Mr. Wang

113
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,260
Please help me book a VIP room

114
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,620
Thanks

115
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,420
My plan is

116
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,700
I went to help you

117
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,860
Thank you for coming here, Director Liang.

118
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,820
Just this once

119
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,700
Once is enough

120
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,300
Please sit down.

121
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,300
This is indeed a very old film.

122
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,800
that

123
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,780
honestly

124
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,100
I didn't know you were coming

125
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,620
I'm really happy to see you here today

126
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,820
Uh, this is

127
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,960
My favorite movie as a child

128
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,980
I still like it when I grow up

129
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,300
Do you remember

130
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,260
When we were a family of three

131
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,100
We often watch the Ice Age animation together

132
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,980
Dad often imitates Diego's speech

133
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,260
My favorite is the little squirrel

134
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
Which role do you like?

135
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,860
They often tell me what kind of personalities they have.

136
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,860
The time is almost up

137
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,660
Let me show you a photo of us back then.

138
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,420
I hope you know

139
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,460
The happiness and joy of the past

140
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,140
It will always exist in my father and me.

141
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,020
Forever in life

142
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,580
I will never forget the happy times we three had together.

143
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,660
ah

144
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,740
Don't run around GM

145
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,060
Obey the rules

146
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,380
Come catch me, sloth

147
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,420
You should call me sir.

148
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,100
Learn to respect

149
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,420
Beautiful things

150
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,660
It won't disappear

151
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,560
of

152
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,860
Hey, it's my turn to draw. It's time to draw. I draw, I draw, I draw, I draw.

153
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,020
Stop

154
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,700
Qiao Rui, let's go to the hospital.

155
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,100
Good leadership

156
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,900
But do I need to park my car at the hospital this time?

157
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,460
It's up to you

158
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,320
one two

159
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,160
one two

160
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,480
Wanting

161
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,980
Wanting, is that you?

162
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,540
it's me

163
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,940
I really didn't expect it

164
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,940
I opened my eyes

165
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,980
I can see you

166
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,660
Mother

167
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,180
You finally came to see Dad.

168
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,060
This time Manniside and Tiago have made great contributions

169
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,380
Doctor, thank you for your help.

170
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,480
We have been friends for many years.

171
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,780
Not so polite

172
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,260
This is what should be done

173
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,880
Your whole family is here today.

174
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,700
We are just discussing the surgery time.

175
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,980
Professor Xu's surgery has been scheduled for 3 days later.

176
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,860
I hope your family can be prepared.

177
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,900
Doctor Zhang

178
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,620
What is the success rate of my father's surgery this time?

179
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,120
Xiao Chen

180
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,420
No matter what

181
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,740
We all want to thank Dr. Zhang first

182
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,780
Thank you, Dr. Zhang

183
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,320
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

184
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,080
I'll go to other wards first.

185
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,340
Take care, Doctor Zhang.

186
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,620
Walk slowly, okay

187
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,220
Before surgery

188
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,140
I think

189
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,180
Let's go back to the restaurant where we stayed.

190
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,060
Your body can't handle this now.

191
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,500
I suggest you wait until after the surgery before going back.

192
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,140
Recently

193
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,780
suddenly I

194
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,940
I really miss the taste of the restaurant

195
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,660
I miss every little bit of where I was

196
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,780
After all, there are some precious things

197
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,220
Wait and you'll miss it.

198
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Xiaozhen

199
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,940
Advise your father

200
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,540
You are an adult

201
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,780
If you can't change this thing

202
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,180
Then you just have to accept him.

203
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,340
If you act sad

204
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,420
I believe your couple will be even more sad.

205
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,020
so

206
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,180
In the remaining days

207
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,860
Accompany him well

208
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,820
Make the rest of his life easier.

209
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,080
Dad

210
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,860
I support you

211
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,760
The more precious something is, the less time you have to wait.

212
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,120
I'll take leave immediately and go back to clean up my old house.

213
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,460
I'll pick you up after I've packed up.

214
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,100
Mother

215
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,660
I know you are worried about my father's health.

216
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,060
I wanted to be like you.

217
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,500
But a friend of mine once said

218
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,300
Changed my previous thinking

219
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,740
So I decided to support my dad.

220
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,180
Our old home has many memories.

221
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,700
Why don't you come back with us to our old home and take a look?

222
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,140
Mom, I beg you.

223
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,140
All right

224
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,380
Been with you for so long

225
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,100
This is the first time I see the sunrise through this window

226
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,560
Jinyang

227
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,700
The sunshine here is so beautiful

228
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,340
Yeah

229
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,460
Any sunlight

230
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,820
In my eyes, I am not even 1/10,000 of you

231
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,580
rhetoric

232
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,300
But I just love to listen

233
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,580
As a bonus

234
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,180
Gaia

235
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,940
Make breakfast for you

236
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,180
OK

237
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,220
But

238
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,060
Any food

239
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,300
Not as delicious as you

240
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,420
Come and try the first breakfast I made for you

241
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,100
How about trying it?

242
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,820
Don't say it's not delicious.

243
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,500
Gaia's Craftsmanship

244
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,420
Many people are envious but it’s too late

245
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,340
How dare I say it's not delicious?

246
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,460
let me try

247
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,180
I really didn't expect this, Ziqing

248
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,620
Your craftsmanship is so great

249
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,820
Ah, as a girlfriend

250
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,420
There are many more good things you haven't seen.

251
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,820
But as a boyfriend

252
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,900
You can't even see these

253
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,180
Is this a bit too realistic?

254
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,620
So how do you want me to compensate you?

255
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,060
Isn't this what you guys are thinking about?

256
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,880
What surprise are you preparing?

257
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,340
Fireworks Confession

258
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,100
I like public displays of affection.

259
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,540
Goodbye

260
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,080
These are all plots from third-rate TV dramas.

261
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,180
Haven't you performed enough every day?

262
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,060
It will happen again in life

263
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,860
Besides

264
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,860
These are all tricks to deceive stupid girls

265
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,940
But in love

266
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,420
I'd like to be a silly girl, but I like smart ones.

267
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,220
Smart women don't think too much.

268
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,700
Not greedy

269
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,220
This is why I like you

270
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,480
Purple

271
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,540
Please help me push all the announcements.

272
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,700
go home directly

273
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,940
Sister Ziqing, Director Wang sent a message to ask you to meet

274
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,820
See you another day. I want to take a rest.

275
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,620
Sister Ziqing, Director Wang, this is it

276
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,700
I think you'd better be more cautious.

277
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,740
I heard that he recently got a large investment and bought several super IPs.

278
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,300
If we get along well with him at this time

279
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,020
I think this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

280
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,180
what do you think

281
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,340
Okay, let's go.

282
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,960
Come into my room tonight to talk about the script.

283
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,500
Okay, hahaha. Thank you, director. Thank you, director.

284
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,260
Hahaha

285
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,700
Come drink

286
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,700
Oops hahahaha

287
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,060
So beautiful hahahahaha

288
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,120
Wang Dao

289
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,360
oops

290
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,820
Ziqing is here

291
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,420
Gaia's sister

292
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,540
The goddess in my mind

293
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,660
Haha, come over here, come and sit, sit, sit, sit

294
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,460
Come on, come on, come on, sit on, sit on, it's okay, hahaha

295
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,860
Hey Director Wang

296
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:02,420
I heard that you have a lot of big projects to start recently. Let me congratulate you first.

297
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
You've heard this.

298
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,460
This circle is really small

299
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,980
Today

300
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,720
Just call you

301
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,020
It's for this

302
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,100
Our company's first project

303
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,460
I want you to be the female lead, hahaha

304
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,000
Thank you, Director Wang.

305
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,840
Please send the script to my agent first.

306
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,660
I'll try to figure out the role first.

307
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,740
Are you reading any script? Haha

308
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,180
This character is in my mind.

309
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,860
Gaia wants to cultivate feelings

310
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,020
I'll tell you the story myself, haha

311
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,880
Hey Director Wang

312
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,280
Talk about projects

313
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,920
You're breaking the rules.

314
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,380
Why are you angry? Hey, don't go.

315
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,340
Hey hey Ziqi hey hey

316
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,700
Let Qin Ziqing go

317
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,940
What are you so proud of?

318
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,200
I let you play the leading female role because I think highly of you.

319
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,360
Please be respectful

320
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,660
Otherwise I'll call someone.

321
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,640
Let go and still shout

322
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,900
I wonder who dares to rescue you?

323
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,540
I wonder who dares to rescue you.

324
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,740
release

325
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,060
Lin Lin Zong

326
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,340
Why are you here?

327
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,020
uncle

328
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,380
you're drunk

329
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,980
Are you OK

330
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,280
Belief

331
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,980
Fortunately you just showed up

332
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,920
Otherwise, I really don't know what to do.

333
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,940
Stay away from that person from now on.

334
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,060
Jingyang, you really care about me the most in your heart

335
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,660
Thank you

336
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,460
I came here by chance today.

337
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,680
I don't know if you'll be so lucky next time.

338
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,900
Hey Jingyang

339
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,100
Please don't go. Can you stay with me for a while longer?

340
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,580
There will be another meeting later

341
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,020
I go first

342
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,560
Jinyang

343
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,460
No matter what he says

344
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,260
I don't believe it

345
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,500
I know he has me in his heart.

346
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,100
I will definitely let him know

347
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,580
How much does he care about me?

348
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,340
Fang Chang is in a good mood

349
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,240
Lin

350
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,420
I'm so sorry. I really didn't know Miss Qin was

351
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,980
It's yours

352
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,420
Since you took my money

353
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,740
Just arrange something for me.

354
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,060
Don't play tricks

355
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,880
From now on, stay away from Gaia's people.

356
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,320
You know I have more ways to shut you up than just giving you money

357
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,500
Yes Yes Yes Yes

358
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,820
There won't be a next time. There won't be a next time.

359
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,720
Finally home

360
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,660
Kitayama small rock

361
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,100
I never thought that my parents and I could be together again here.

362
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,680
I'm really happy

363
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,980
Xiaozhen, I'm so happy for you

364
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:54,800
You are covering it

365
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,120
I've suffered so much

366
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,460
Now the goal of family reunion is finally coming true.

367
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,460
Okay, okay, nostalgia is enough. Look at how dusty this room is.

368
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,340
It will definitely take a long time to clean.

369
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,100
If it's later, Dad and Liang Wen

370
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,140
Director Liang lost his mood as soon as he saw it.

371
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,560
ah

372
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,460
It's a miracle that your brother can live this long.

373
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,780
How did he manage to make people want to beat him up as soon as he opened his mouth?

374
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,780
Why do you talk so much when you are working?

375
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,880
Xiaoyan is right.

376
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,020
Let's get started, sister.

377
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,100
Go here

378
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,580
Where is Xu Zhen?

379
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,380
Why didn't he come?

380
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,900
Xu Zhen had some business these days and asked for a few days off.

381
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,680
Then why didn't he tell me that Xu Zhen was just a small assistant

382
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,400
I'll let my direct supervisor handle this kind of thing.

383
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,320
You are a big star

384
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,380
If everything bothers you, can you still handle it?

385
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,500
Actually, Yingge can prepare and start filming right away.

386
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,540
Xu Zhuan helped me push the lyrics

387
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,880
A little assistant

388
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,320
Taking leave without reason

389
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,460
I don't know if this affects the work of this big star.

390
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,700
Uh, how about

391
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,380
I'll help you with the remark

392
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,980
This character is a female

393
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,380
You are not suitable.

394
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,240
That

395
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,020
Is this appropriate?

396
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,620
Mr. Guo, what do you need?

397
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,200
Please help me find something to cover his face.

398
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,060
I really can't stand looking at this face.

399
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,780
Boss, do you think this is okay for me?

400
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,460
I'd better go to the scene and read the script.

401
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,780
Sister Xiaofei, this is your outfit today.

402
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,480
Are you kidding me?

403
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,140
How can I wear such shabby clothes?

404
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,980
Is there any difference between these two and what Xu Zhen is wearing?

405
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,020
Take it back and change it for me

406
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
But these two pieces were personally selected by Mr. Kobayashi and Director Liang.

407
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,700
Would it be bad if we just change it randomly?

408
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,900
He thinks this dress is nice.

409
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,300
Well, I heard that Mr. Kobayashi specifically requested to keep it.

410
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,060
Xiongxiong likes this type of clothes

411
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,940
Remember

412
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,380
I will wear this type of clothes in the future

413
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:21,418
Why did the hot water pipe choose this time to get mad?

414
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:25,638
This water heater is older than us.

415
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,918
You better not fix it.

416
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:31,658
I have to fix it before my parents come back. My mom always takes a bath before going to bed.

417
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,020
It's been so many years.

418
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,560
Even people's hearts have changed

419
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,460
Maybe the habit has changed a long time ago.

420
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,918
Xiaoyan, don't say that. I believe my mother's heart has not changed.

421
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,178
It's just that his way of expressing it is different.

422
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,998
I have ignored you for so many years.

423
00:34:49,998 --> 00:34:51,358
Not even a stranger

424
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,099
Is this the way Director Liang expresses himself? Xiaoyan, you don't understand.

425
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,980
I don't understand what sister

426
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,400
This pliers is broken.

427
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,380
I think I must buy a new one together with the water pipe.

428
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,260
Xiao Yan, come with me to buy it.

429
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,080
Make a wish

430
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,320
Will you give it to me?

431
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,700
My car keys

432
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,960
Xiao Yan

433
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,120
Be careful when you speak next time.

434
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,700
Don't be so hostile to Liang Dao in front of the town.

435
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,020
But I'm telling the truth.

436
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,800
To be honest, how many times have you met Liang Dao?

437
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,860
Do you know the real reason why Liang Dao and Uncle Xu broke up?

438
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,100
You are so cold and mean to me without knowing anything. How hurtful to Xiaozhen!

439
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,700
Am I feeling sorry for my sister?

440
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,060
Xu Zhen was obviously worried about the success rate of Uncle Xu's surgery.

441
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,880
But he still pretends to be fine.

442
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,460
If you really love him

443
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,020
Don't dwell on the past anymore.

444
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,540
Let's go

445
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,680
boss

446
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,420
What are you doing? You are drawing riding a dinosaur and chasing Xu Zhen.

447
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,860
What is Xu Zhen?

448
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,880
Why do I draw him?

449
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,140
No, no, no, no, no

450
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,380
Let me guess Let me guess

451
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,820
You are not thinking about Xu Zhen, are you?

452
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,860
I'm Shi Yu

453
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,340
Is your imagination a bit big?

454
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,300
And what kind of coffee did you buy?

455
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,540
So hard to drink

456
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,260
That's not right, boss.

457
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,240
I strictly follow your request to buy 1/10 sugar and 1/9 milk

458
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,400
The coffee beans have to be flown in from Ethiopia.

459
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,220
The water content will never exceed 3.5 cm from the cup mouth

460
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,100
I don't think the coffee is bad.

461
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,140
It must be the wrong person who bought it.

462
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,700
I'm going to read the script.

463
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,100
Don't bother me.

464
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,420
Shiyu

465
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,860
You are so smart

466
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,100
I have a question for you. Wait a minute.

467
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,500
Uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle

468
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,100
What did you say just now that I am smart?

469
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,140
You're changing too fast.

470
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,340
My scalp goes numb when I hear this

471
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,180
This is a very important question

472
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,860
In this script it is written

473
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,340
Professor Xu to witness the miracle of life

474
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,100
Before the Eruption

475
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,420
He desperately took a branch and stirred the magma

476
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,300
What kind of feeling is this

477
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,100
I read the script many times.

478
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,900
I still don't understand

479
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,660
Can you answer this?

480
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,760
Hehe Boss

481
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,060
Tell you the truth

482
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,620
So many years

483
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,540
The farthest distance from you is 100 meters.

484
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,280
I've never seen this volcano.

485
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,240
How would I know?

486
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,860
Don't make it hard for me

487
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,420
Since you can't answer

488
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,100
I can't understand it either

489
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,980
Who should we ask then?

490
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,480
I see

491
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,720
I know who to ask.

492
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,140
Oh, but boss, since I'm so good at guessing your thoughts, don't you have to give me a raise?

493
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Hello, that's it. That's it.

494
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,480
In the script?

495
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,120
Chijun was not particularly clear about a problem in the script.

496
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,900
Maybe you need to answer this question.

497
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,900
When a volcano erupts

498
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,460
Why did Professor Xu use a bamboo pole to stir the magma?

499
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,100
Ahh ...

500
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,980
Very, very anxious

501
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,460
What are you doing?Xu Zhen

502
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,020
How about you come to the set?

503
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,340
can not come

504
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,980
WeChat reply me

505
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,460
Xu Zhen, listen to me, this matter is right

506
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,300
As my assistant, Xu Zhen should be on call 24 hours a day

507
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,060
No matter what the reason

508
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,460
I'll be back on set soon.

509
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,960
Xu Zhen

510
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,160
Hello

511
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,700
Hello Xu Zhen

512
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,940
A little assistant dared to hang up on me

513
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Don't be angry first

514
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,540
Maybe he has his reasons.

515
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,540
No matter what the reason

516
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,700
Tell him where the rescue is.

517
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,300
I really don't know this

518
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,360
You don't know where an assistant's old home is.

519
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,900
How do you become your agent?

520
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,880
Don't be angry first

521
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,340
I want to find a way to

522
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,920
Why

523
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,120
Hello, boss.

524
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,160
Isn't this Mr. Kobayashi?

525
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,340
What's he doing next?

526
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,620
I drove a sports car

527
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,580
A car full of pink balloons

528
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,580
Isn't this a confession scene?

529
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,580
Who is he going to confess to?

530
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Needless to say

531
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,460
Of course it's Xu Zhen

532
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,220
Xu Zhen

533
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,320
I've already warned him.

534
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,060
Keep him away from this kind of people.

535
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,540
I didn't expect it would still give him fantasy

536
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,660
Hang up my phone now

537
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,660
Looks like it's time for me to help him clean up the mess.

538
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,920
Hey Zhiyu, have you seen Xu Zhen?

539
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,000
Why didn't I see him today?

540
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:33,600
Xiaolin is always like this

541
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,140
Xu Zhen is there today

542
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,560
ah

543
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,780
Oh thanks
