1
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,880
Look, this is a hot egg that has just been cooked.

2
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,160
Can be used for hot compress

3
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,780
Here are some ice cubes for cold compress

4
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,900
There are also some blood-activating and blood-stasis-removing plasters.

5
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,980
I saw that the boss had a muscle strain while rock climbing yesterday. He might recover faster with some medicine.

6
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,980
Why don't you give it to him yourself?

7
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,900
He seems a little mad at me.

8
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,040
Yesterday he went rock climbing with me and Xiaoxiu

9
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,060
I left him alone and ran away

10
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,060
Ah, so that's how it is

11
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,340
No wonder he recently said he wanted to get fit and was addicted to rock climbing to challenge himself

12
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,700
That's how it is, haha

13
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,740
Ah, it's okay, it's okay, I'll give it to him.

14
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,540
Thanks

15
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,100
What are you doing?

16
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,860
Don't you know I hate eggs?

17
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,620
Hey, it's not for you to eat, it's for you to warm up.

18
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,980
Get well soon.

19
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,100
Zhang Daxingjieren

20
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,940
how old are you

21
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,020
You believe such childish things?

22
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,260
I hate the kind of pseudoscience that comes in the name of traditional culture.

23
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,140
Take it away from me now. Take it away from me.

24
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,420
Oh, I forgot that you don't believe these unscientific things.

25
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,580
Well, that's a bargain for me. I'll eat it, but...

26
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,060
It's a pity that Xu Zhen's heart

27
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,540
What did you say

28
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,900
Come, come, let me take a look

29
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,460
Forget it, you don't believe these unscientific things.

30
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,860
Anyway

31
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,180
Something passed down from our ancestors for 5,000 years

32
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,540
Even if you don't believe it, we have to try it, right?

33
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,900
Comfortable

34
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,820
Look, these are the photos my colleagues took at the opening ceremony.

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,140
This is all first-hand information.

36
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,340
Yeah, look.

37
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,040
Something seems wrong

38
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,120
what's wrong

39
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,860
You see, both of them are looking at the clock.

40
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,980
Impossible, you see?

41
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,700
Really

42
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
Oh my god!

43
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,220
Could it be that both the big star Gu and the second son of Gale are paying attention to our little Zhenzhen?

44
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,740
Oh, such big news.

45
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,260
As a gossip reporter working on the front line of the entertainment industry, I had no idea

46
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,220
Oh, is there any justice?

47
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,500
Tell the truth

48
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,900
what happened

49
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,100
Which one should you pay attention to?

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,340
That's impossible. Xiao Xiu and I are friends, and you all know that.

51
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,300
As for Gu Chijun, that's even more impossible.

52
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,700
How can I say nonsense? Look, look, look.

53
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,620
We are all looking at each other, and you still say nothing

54
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,260
Look at Mr. Kobayashi's expression.

55
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,940
My heart is broken

56
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,820
No wonder he insisted on helping us fix the water splash when he came to our house last time.

57
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,100
I felt something was wrong.

58
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,140
You mean these two people?

59
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,300
One is a rich second generation who is uneducated and unskilled

60
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,780
One is a big star who doesn't look very attractive.

61
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,060
Not so good yet

62
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,100
But you said that these two people both like my sister

63
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,540
I just want to ask

64
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,720
Is there something wrong with their vision?

65
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,520
you

66
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,060
Look, look

67
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,420
Such a fierce person

68
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,580
How to find a boyfriend?

69
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Why

70
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,340
It's almost time to go.

71
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,280
pledge

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,560
You go to the set first.

73
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,620
I have something to do

74
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,060
ah

75
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,340
I'm done

76
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,740
Hey, you finished eating so quickly.

77
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,680
There was a problem with the special effects team.

78
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,280
My knowledge of paleontology can help.

79
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,900
My mother asked me to go and support them if I have time.

80
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,740
My mom, my mom calls me in a very affectionate way

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,020
Don't you see how he treated you before?

82
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,260
A meal and a rabbit will buy you off, little rabbit, be good.

83
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay, you're out.

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,380
Bye, I don't want to eat anymore.

85
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,680
Hey, little master, tell me, if you were asked to choose, which of these two would you choose to be your brother-in-law Xu Zhen?

86
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,020
Well, I think both are not good.

87
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,460
But that Gu Chijun

88
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,180
Because he helped my sister put together that fierce horse

89
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,100
Give him 0.5 points.

90
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,100
Well, I think people who like Lego toys are at least not bad people.

91
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,300
but

92
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,700
He's a big star.

93
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,060
So many temptations

94
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,220
I want to give a bad review

95
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,820
All bad reviews

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,440
One is the successor of Gaia Entertainment

97
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,500
One is a popular star

98
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,780
No matter which of these two people ends up with Xiaozhen

99
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,200
As Xiaozhen's dearest girlfriend

100
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,100
I hahaha all the opponent's information hahaha

101
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,620
Ah, I seem to see countless gossips flying towards me with their little wings wide open

102
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,259
Hey

103
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,979
Selling out my sister for a little gossip

104
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,100
This is so disloyal.

105
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,680
Love what you do

106
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,900
I call this dedication

107
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,020
Oops, luckily my colleague didn't find this photo yesterday.

108
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,860
This is a guarantee for the start of your future career.

109
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,500
I have to think of a title for it.

110
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,900
What title should I write?

111
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,980
Today is the hottest

112
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,660
Popular stars prefer assistants

113
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,100
Or is it because the second son is infatuated with the young employee?

114
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,460
Ahhh

115
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,300
Ah, don't say don't kill. Are you stuck?

116
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,760
I

117
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,380
My Photo

118
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,940
My gossip

119
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,100
I even got a raise

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Please keep the last piece of pure land in this world away from gossip for your bestie.

121
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,040
All news about Gu Chijun cannot be published

122
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm leaving yeah

123
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,820
Sister, remember to have dinner together tonight.

124
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,180
How did you come

125
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,840
I'm here to pick up the small town for work.

126
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,900
What are you doing here?

127
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,680
Ah, why are you all here?

128
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,780
Pick you up at work

129
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,300
Xiaojuan, come with me, don't pay attention to him

130
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,900
Gu Shijun, please move your car out of the way.

131
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,240
How can it be

132
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,660
Xu Zhen is my assistant

133
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,200
Of course you should listen to me.

134
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,700
Xu Zhen Gou Get on the Car

135
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,620
Come with me in the car.

136
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,380
I'll be at the set soon. I have other things to do. I'll leave first.

137
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,960
Lin Junxiu

138
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,180
You know I don't like people getting too close to me.

139
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,900
Not even my assistant.

140
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,100
Why do you take advantage of Xu Zhen every day?

141
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,420
Because I like him

142
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,540
Yes, you heard it right.

143
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,060
I like him

144
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,200
Nurse

145
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,460
Please, besides work,

146
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,980
Don't go near the town anymore

147
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,480
search

148
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
ah

149
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,420
Open your mouth to speak

150
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,540
The monk is recording

151
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,140
Hahahaha I'm a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Are you scared?

152
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,560
Do you like the gift your father gave you?

153
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,140
Director Liu Director Liu

154
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,220
Li Qian, Director Liu

155
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,660
Please help me

156
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,340
You brought me up, you know me best.

157
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,900
The media reports about me and Director Wang are not true.

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,300
Everything was planned by Lin Jingyao.

159
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,200
My parents are worried about my condition.

160
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,360
Drive over to see me

161
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,980
But there was a car accident on the road

162
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Now I can't get any notifications.

163
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
Please save me

164
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,000
Please save our family.

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,540
Xiaoqing, don't worry.

166
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,620
If you have anything to say, please speak slowly. Come and sit down first.

167
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,940
What are you going to do?

168
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,940
Stop, Director Liu

169
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,620
We are also the deadly

170
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,020
Please understand us

171
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,320
Director Liu, you must help me

172
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,420
You must help me, Director Liu

173
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,020
Don't always be here.

174
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,260
Come in

175
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,760
Lin

176
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,660
Just let him go about Li Qianya's matter.

177
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,460
He is still young after all.

178
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,100
Now his mother has been in a car accident

179
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,600
Lying in the hospital

180
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,260
He can't even afford the medical bills.

181
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,020
He has received enough education.

182
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,540
If this continues

183
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,800
His whole family will be ruined.

184
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Please

185
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,140
Please give him another chance.

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,900
It turns out that Director Liu is such a compassionate person

187
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,820
This is the first time I discovered

188
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,380
But I remember the tragic explosion 8 years ago

189
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,900
Mr. Wang was also affected

190
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,720
I heard that he is living a hard life now.

191
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,880
Very miserable

192
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,780
Why didn't I listen to Director Liu asking me to help him?

193
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,820
But I almost forgot

194
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,740
The explosion that year

195
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,660
Director Liu also participated

196
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,020
That's why you have gone from being a small clerk to where you are today.

197
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,380
Became the Artist Director of Gaia Entertainment

198
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,820
how

199
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,580
You are used to having a good life

200
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,940
Now you suddenly have a sense of justice, right?

201
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,260
Director Lin Liu

202
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,820
Do Big Things

203
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,060
Someone will definitely have to sacrifice

204
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,540
Maybe Li Qian'er

205
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,020
It could also be

206
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,380
other people

207
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,420
But I, Lin Jinyang, am a nostalgic person.

208
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,460
Always remember the good things about others

209
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,980
So Li Qianer's matter

210
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,100
I advise Director Liu

211
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,180
Don't be too sacrificial

212
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,220
There is something

213
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,340
I need you to help me with this.

214
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,920
Ishiyu

215
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,360
Did you see where Xu Zhen is?

216
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,760
Xu Zhen went to the special effects team

217
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,980
I'll come back after I pack up.

218
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,020
Hey, didn't you go out a long time ago? Why are you here just now?

219
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,140
Hey Xiao Zhan

220
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,300
Boss Guo is looking for you

221
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,420
Why do that?

222
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,660
Did I do something wrong?

223
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,460
Why are you so close to Lin Jinxiu?

224
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,780
Didn't I tell you to stay away from him?

225
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,520
Why

226
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,320
Xiao Xiu and I have known each other since childhood.

227
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,500
It's normal to be close.

228
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,540
Don't you think it's childish to care about this?

229
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,980
Brother Shiyu, I'm going downstairs to see if the makeup artist has arrived.

230
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,380
Childish. He actually said I was childish. Did you hear that?

231
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,180
Then I heard

232
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,780
But I think he's right.

233
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,699
In fact, you are childish

234
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,040
Just like kindergarten kids

235
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,940
Seeing my deskmate getting too close to other kids

236
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,340
You are unhappy and hide away, you are petty

237
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,380
I

238
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,020
I'm like a kindergarten kid.

239
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,300
I just don't like my assistant being too close to people I hate.

240
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah

241
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,460
I wonder if you care so much about being so close to Mr. Kobayashi?

242
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,640
It seems that I have to maintain a good relationship with Mr. Kobayashi in the future.

243
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,500
So that you can also realize my existence

244
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,900
Do you know what happened today?

245
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,580
Do you know what I said to school today?

246
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,260
What he said he

247
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,020
He said he likes Xu Zhen

248
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,940
Why are you looking at me?

249
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,580
Uh, did you discover something?

250
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,500
You

251
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,660
I like someone.

252
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,580
Who is Xu Zhen?

253
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,180
Xu Zhen

254
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,580
You're not mistaken.

255
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,820
I like him

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,180
Did you know that I was voted one of the top ten male celebrities that a magazine wants to marry?

257
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,580
People who like me go from Shanghai to Beijing and then take a detour to Suzhou

258
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,920
I like him

259
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,860
What kind of international joke are you playing?

260
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,600
Have you ever heard of liking someone?

261
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,280
I just want to see him all the time and be around him

262
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,260
I feel happy when I see him with other people.

263
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,800
My heart starts pounding when I think of him

264
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,580
Seeing him is like seeing the whole world.

265
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,780
Touch the heartbeat

266
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,500
Very stable

267
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,420
Look into my eyes again

268
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,100
Only two words

269
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,140
Cold

270
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,820
Um

271
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,020
Hey, do you think my angle is perfect?

272
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,460
So pretty

273
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,200
360 degrees without blind spots, haha, are you photoshopping the picture?

274
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,900
Yeah, another one.

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,900
Why are you so excessive?

276
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,340
In photoshop, you only photoshop yourself, not me.

277
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,100
Can we be friends?

278
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,480
No, you chopped it off.

279
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,180
Hum, I think you made my eyes smaller.

280
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,060
I have your ugly photo

281
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,040
I sent him out

282
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:08,060
Hey, if I can’t send it, I’ll send it. If I can’t send it, I’ll send it. Okay, okay, okay, stop arguing.

283
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,500
Although our plan did not succeed last time

284
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,700
But I think your idea is still good.

285
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,140
Hey just

286
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,740
There is a new annoying follower around our Xu Zhen

287
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,180
Our plan couldn't go on.

288
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,820
How about now, who among you has a better plan? Tell me.

289
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,100
Mr. Xiaolin, you said your conditions are not bad

290
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,260
Why do you keep clinging to Xu Zhen?

291
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,420
Last time I asked you to buy him a facial mask to make him beautiful, but you didn't buy it.

292
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,860
Since he can't be beautiful

293
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,140
Otherwise, you can just change one

294
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,260
These are my sisters.

295
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,380
Pure natural little beauty

296
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,940
Didn't move at all

297
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,140
Pick one and introduce them all

298
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,020
These photos

299
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,860
Isn't it a person?

300
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,740
Oh no no no

301
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,580
I'm not me 200

302
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,140
Next

303
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,460
Xiaolin, I don't know if you have ever heard this sentence.

304
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,700
Diamonds are forever

305
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,060
A forever legacy

306
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,120
This diamond

307
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,820
It represents longevity and eternity

308
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,660
Women all like diamonds, right?

309
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,720
It seems like you like that Miss Xu

310
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,120
I don't like facial masks

311
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,600
I don't like bags either.

312
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,380
I don't like hyaluronic acid anymore

313
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,420
So, in my opinion

314
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,060
She's sure to like this

315
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,980
diamond

316
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,380
Actually, I have a lot of side jobs.

317
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,900
Just like this diamond

318
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,140
Look at the color and luster

319
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,980
Even though he made it by hand

320
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,860
But he is no different from the real one.

321
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,640
You can just pick out eight or ten and give them to him.

322
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,860
He will definitely not refuse.

323
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:34,380
Besides, if he accidentally rejects you

324
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,260
The money you spent isn't a big loss, right?

325
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,540
Eternal, right?

326
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,740
I think our little Jane would like fossils more.

327
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,980
Hey Mr. Kobayashi

328
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,740
Women are the most susceptible to gossip

329
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,880
Like his bestie

330
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,580
What a friend's parents say may be influenced by him at any time.

331
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,500
So what do you mean?

332
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,600
Find his closest friend

333
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,040
Then pull in batches

334
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,300
Defeat them one by one

335
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,940
Then integrate it into your hands

336
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,780
This way it won't be easy to disappear

337
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,940
Smart, just do as you say.

338
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,800
Do you think if Xiaoxiu sees this bowl of soup, will she think I am a good woman who is both capable of housework and cooking?

339
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,740
That's absolutely true.

340
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,380
What is this

341
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,440
outside

342
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,300
Takeaway receipt

343
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,320
Please stick this takeaway receipt on it for me

344
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,060
If you are careful, you will know that this bowl of soup was bought from outside.

345
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,040
How could he still love me?

346
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,900
How can I give birth to a child of the third generation of rich people?

347
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,180
I'm sorry, Sister Xiao Fei, I was wrong.

348
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,260
I didn't notice. I'll go on and on. Is that helpful?

349
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,240
You've been following me for so long, didn't you hear what Director Liang said to Gu Shijun?

350
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,900
Dedicated Dedicated Dedicated

351
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,740
Do you know what dedication is?

352
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,880
Dedication is the basic quality of an enterprise's management and a person

353
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,180
Yes Yes Yes Yes

354
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,880
Bear

355
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,000
Why are you going?

356
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,240
This is the soup I made for you.

357
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,220
I've been waiting for 14 hours. Do you want to try it?

358
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,640
Sorry, I have something else to do and I have to leave first.

359
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,900
Don't send it to me anymore.

360
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,900
He asked me not to give him candy anymore.

361
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,180
Sister, are you okay?

362
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,560
How can it be okay?

363
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,940
People say love can make people happy

364
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,100
But why do I feel so painful since I fell in love with Xiaoxiuxiu

365
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,360
Sister Xiao Fei, you can't give up so easily.

366
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,740
Haven't you heard?

367
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,380
Without a bone-chilling cold

368
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,540
How to get the plum blossom fragrance

369
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
A good sword is forged from the experience of grinding

370
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,760
The fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the bitter cold.

371
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,940
Sister Xiaofei, you must hold on.

372
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,200
You must hold on to me.

373
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,180
I want to work hard and impress my little bear with my sincerity.

374
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,040
Um

375
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,520
By the way, what is my line today?

376
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,920
Check with me, ok

377
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:55,100
Don't worry, I have marked out your lines for today. There are 5 lines in total.

378
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,540
5 sentences. I have so many lines today.

379
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,660
Quickly recite

380
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,940
Is the first sentence true?

381
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,780
The second sentence is I am afraid

382
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,460
The third sentence is I don’t want it

383
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,860
The fourth sentence is help

384
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,260
The fifth sentence is yes

385
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,620
Don't stop, keep reading.

386
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,020
There are so many missing

387
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,820
Why do I have the same line every day?

388
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,820
Forget it, forget it.

389
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,380
No, let's go get instant noodles.

390
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,860
oh

391
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,560
huh

392
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,600
Why are you alone?

393
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,860
Where's the makeup artist?

394
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,560
What's wrong? The makeup artist said they were stuck in traffic and asked me to give you the most basic cleansing first.

395
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,400
Apply makeup

396
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,340
Waiting for them to come can save some time

397
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,020
Have you discovered something?

398
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,140
you

399
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,260
In love with someone

400
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,860
Who is Xu Zhen

401
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,240
Xu Zhen, have you ever heard of liking someone?

402
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,900
I just want to see him all the time and be around him

403
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,900
I feel unhappy when I see him with other people.

404
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,460
My heart starts pounding when I think of him

405
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,660
Seeing him is like seeing the whole world

406
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,680
Why

407
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
What's wrong with you?

408
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,660
Where are you going?

409
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,180
I haven't finished my makeup yet, Xiao Fei.

410
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,620
This is Shijun's dressing room, Xiaofei

411
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,780
Wait for me, where are you going? Help him with his makeup.

412
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,380
Tell me, sister, did you feel that the time just now was a little strange?

413
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,560
Not just now

414
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,940
He seems to be awake.

415
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,940
Impossible, really.

416
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,060
Didn't you just see it?

417
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,400
His face turns red

418
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,700
Watery eyes

419
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,620
It's all a mistake

420
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,620
I can still feel his heart pounding.

421
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,180
have no idea

422
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,020
This is the sign of falling in love with someone

423
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,500
You put it this way.

424
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,420
It seems so

425
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,660
But why but

426
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,460
Didn't you see him shake off Xu Zhen's hand in front of me?

427
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,500
When did Xiaoxiu do this?

428
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,020
It must be like this

429
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,900
He must like you.

430
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,340
come on! Come on

431
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,140
come on, come on, come on

432
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,380
come on! Come on

433
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,740
come on! Come on

434
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,700
ah

435
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,460
Hahaha

436
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,120
Xiao Yan

437
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,160
Ah, it's getting better and better.

438
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,740
I'm getting better at playing basketball

439
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,380
How come you are here? Hello everyone

440
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,280
I am Xiao Yan's future brother-in-law. Our Xiao Yan is very well behaved. Please support and help him in the future.

441
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,420
Incoming water

442
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,320
Thanks

443
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,960
How about it

444
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,780
What are you doing here?

445
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,860
I'm here to support you.

446
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,460
what is this

447
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,620
Hey, hey, hey, don't go yet

448
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,340
Let's take a selfie together. Come on, come on, come on

449
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,060
Be more affectionate, smile one, two, three

450
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,940
Hey, not bad, not bad, okay? Hey, Xiaoyan, why did you leave? Let's have dinner together.

451
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,940
No time left

452
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,220
Ah, my topic

453
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,620
I wish I could build my happiness on the pain of others.

454
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,420
What kind of gossip should I report this month?

455
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,340
Can you please come up with a new flying kiss right now to help me get through my current predicament?

456
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,300
Is there anyone

457
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,100
I secretly went for plastic surgery but it failed

458
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,060
Is there anyone who is divorced but still pretends to be together and pretends to be Mr. Good?

459
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:35,580
Is there anyone who changes girlfriends faster than he changes clothes?

460
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,900
There is a new one

461
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,500
any left

462
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,020
Is there any more?

463
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,780
Hello, who are you, Miss Weishan?

464
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,460
I am

465
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,620
Hello, Mr. Jinxiu asked me to bring you something.

466
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,480
Then I'll go first

467
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,720
Wow, so romantic.

468
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,620
Who is Weisheng'an Town?

469
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,620
Director Yang, it's so hot, come and have a drink

470
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,220
Well, where do I put it?

471
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,380
You must be tired too.

472
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,060
Get an ice wipe to wipe the sweat off

473
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,760
Thanks

474
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,480
etc.

475
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,220
According to your plan, the cost is too high.

476
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,460
What is the cost?

477
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,280
Hey, what are you talking about in front of Liang Dao?

478
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,060
Talking about money is an insult to art

479
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,340
From now on, everything will be based on Liang Dao's plan.

480
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,360
oath

481
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:10,060
You said that Lin Jinxiu tried so hard to please the two islands.

482
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,940
What is the purpose?

483
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,019
Hey, I just want to please him.

484
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,380
Sister Xiaofei, I think it's still a bit strange

485
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,980
I heard from others that Gucci came here just to pursue Qin Ziqing.

486
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,460
How come I'm secretly in love with you again?

487
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:44,940
Think carefully about what has happened between Chi Jun and Qin Ziqing since he came to Gaia?

488
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,239
Absolutely not

489
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:51,199
Instead, Qin Ziqing repeatedly posted this on our Chi Jun during the interview with Li Wang.

490
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,699
How did our Chi Jun behave?

491
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,100
Completely live outside the door

492
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,540
Well, what you said seems to make sense.

493
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,740
What a pity that Chijun has done so much for me.

494
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,700
I just discovered it now

495
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,780
It's all your fault, Lin Jinxiu

496
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,080
It's been confusing me since the first day I started doing this

497
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,620
That's so annoying.

498
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,560
oops

499
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,140
Xiao Fei

500
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,700
I think I left my script in the car.

501
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,660
Go get it quickly.

502
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,340
Like me or not like me

503
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,680
Um

504
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,540
Your elevator is here.

505
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,220
The elevator has arrived

506
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,000
Well

507
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,980
You guys go first, I'll wait for the next class

508
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,180
Just be obedient.

509
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,660
OK OK

510
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,660
Hey, don't be so obedient, hahaha

511
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,580
He must like me.

512
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,760
Why

513
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,660
Brother, why did you give up the elevator to the customer just now? Don't you hate him very much?

514
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,140
There was a kid in the elevator just now and it was too noisy

515
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,480
correct

516
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,700
You said that Lin Jinxiu was trying to please both parties.

517
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,960
Why

518
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Ha, it's obvious.

519
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,660
The route of surrounding the cities with the countryside

520
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,560
That is to say, using profit-driven means to win over everyone around you.

521
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,620
Let them speak for themselves then.

522
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,080
In order to achieve the purpose of fortune and luck

523
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,100
Hey, keep going.

524
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,580
I really didn't expect that someone near the construction site could do such a despicable and shameless thing.

525
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,300
look

526
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,300
What should I do about this matter?

527
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,900
I see

528
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,820
You don't like Xu Zhen at all

529
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,400
To be exact, I have no feelings for Xu Zhen at all.

530
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,260
But you are an honest, loving and responsible boss.

531
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,160
Seeing Xu Zhen being so irresponsible about his own future

532
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,720
You can't just sit back and do nothing.

533
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,020
In this way, everyone can see the Mingying people at a glance

534
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,280
Lin Jinxiu is not suitable for Xu Zhen at all

535
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,780
So you can't just watch Xu Zhen fall into Lin Jinxiu's clutches.

536
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,360
At this time, you must stand up bravely and offer a helping hand.

537
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,140
Free Xu Zhen from Lin Jinxiu's clutches

538
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,300
What do you think

539
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,800
Shiyu has been my agent for so long.

540
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,460
This is the first time I play you so smart

541
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,500
Do you have any good ideas?

542
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,660
It's simple. Give the teacher a taste of his own medicine.

543
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,100
Lin Junxiu can do this, why can't we?

544
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,180
He went to win over the party. OK

545
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,220
Then we'll go get his friends.

546
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,000
We are all the same age

547
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,340
We have a common language when we talk.

548
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,180
At the crucial moment

549
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,380
If you want to talk to someone like that,

550
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,380
Maybe this kind of patriarch will even cause Xu Zhen to feel rebellious.

551
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,360
good

552
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,180
Let's go now

553
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,280
Why

554
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,900
Isn't this the girl I met in the hospital that day?

555
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,980
I only saw your back that day

556
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,940
I didn't expect the front side to be so beautiful

557
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,900
This combo is so mean.

558
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:13,600
Even Xu Zhen's brother and best friend were not spared. That's right. Too despicable, too shameless, too vulgar.

559
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,780
Total scumbag.

560
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,260
October starts now

561
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,740
You're chasing and setting up a siege 24 hours a day

562
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,300
Whatever he wants to take pictures of

563
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,580
Magazine or interview

564
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,660
No matter what

565
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,820
Unconditional promise

566
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,520
And that Shen Qingye

567
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,940
We will give him whatever he likes.

568
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,500
But the little brat should be easy to deal with.

569
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,780
I don't believe it.

570
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,940
I won't be able to defeat Lin Jinxiu

571
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,220
Excuse me

572
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,740
You think too much

573
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,300
Now everyone around Xu Zhen is my teammate

574
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,340
I'm going to treat him to a meal at this time.

575
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,640
oath

576
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,260
Let's try a mantis catching a cicada

577
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,100
The oriole is behind

578
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,320
Thank you so much today, Xiaozhen

579
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,540
I've got you helping me out for another day.

580
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,680
It's okay, I should do it.

581
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,420
Well, I'll leave first.

582
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,320
Bye-Bye

583
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,220
Xu Zhen, are you free tonight?

584
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,600
In addition to the two islands

585
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,080
My colleagues from the director team said they wanted to have a small gathering in the evening

586
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,380
Do you want to come over together?

587
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,720
Thank you, Miss Xiaorui

588
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,280
But I have already made an appointment with my good friend and my brother to have dinner together in the evening

589
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,480
There may not be time.

590
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,920
It's okay. If they don't mind, just come over.

591
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,700
Anyway, everyone wants to relax.

592
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,840
Really? Then they must be fine.

593
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,140
Sister Xiaorui, I will go with you today

594
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,400
Uh, Mr. Kobayashi

595
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,560
We are all colleagues from the director team gathering here

596
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,020
I'm afraid it's not appropriate for you to come here.

597
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,560
What's this?

598
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,680
Are you all colleagues in the same group?

599
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,780
As a producer, I also need to work with the students in the director team.

600
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,500
If everyone goes

601
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,820
Then I have to go too.

602
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,260
I have to thank Liang Dao for his support

603
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,740
Tonight I ask

604
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,560
Uh, yeah

605
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,960
In fact, you see, all the ten armies of our family have gone.

606
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,040
I should go, too. Why?

607
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,860
Because I want to thank the director team for their concern and care for our Tenth Army

608
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,460
Come come come

609
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,300
How many broken hearts

610
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,300
Where have I seen you?

611
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,460
It's not my business

612
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,140
I can't remember it for the moment
