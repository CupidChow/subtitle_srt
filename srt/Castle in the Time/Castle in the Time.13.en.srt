1
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,980
The pain of time has always been invisible

2
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,920
Why

3
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,160
go out

4
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,780
Didn't you say today that you were going to Xu Zhi's place after the schedule?

5
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,980
I just called him

6
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,340
Persuade him to come back

7
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,460
He ignores me

8
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,060
I'll go find him now

9
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,020
Doesn't he have the demeanor of a big star?

10
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,160
This is the assistant information I compiled.

11
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,660
Pick one as Xu Zhen's good brother

12
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,440
What are you picking?

13
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,180
Come and see Xiaojunjun.

14
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,300
I have lost my appetite these days because of you.

15
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,620
Depressed

16
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,980
I have suicidal tendencies every day.

17
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
What did you do?

18
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,620
Boss, please don't wrongly accuse me.

19
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,740
Xiao Junjun is under my care

20
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,020
Their food intake is twice that of an average puppy.

21
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,540
Don't you know that a sudden increase in appetite is also a sign of depression?

22
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,540
When Xu Zhen raised him

23
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,940
He is not like that.

24
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,940
Xiao Junjun, have you not seen Xu Zhen for a long time?

25
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,940
So he couldn't think straight for a while.

26
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,900
Yeah

27
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,620
Xiaojunjun, you are sick and your illness is very, very, very serious.

28
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:04,880
Boss, I think the most important thing you should do now is to bring Junjun to Xu Chen.

29
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,320
Maybe what will happen after Junjun sees Xu Chen?

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,420
Possibly body

31
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,600
Hold Xu Zhen

32
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,060
Maybe the young man's illness will be cured. Goodbye, boss. I won't see you off.

33
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,880
Xu Zhen

34
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,100
Xiaojun is sick

35
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,400
Come out and see him.

36
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,740
He needs you

37
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Xiao Juanjuan

38
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,460
Remind you that it's holiday time

39
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,900
Hurry up and call twice

40
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,340
Seriously ill.

41
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,220
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

42
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,140
Hurry up and listen

43
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
Bluff

44
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,140
I take back my words about firing you.

45
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,700
Come back

46
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,620
Come back to take care of Xiaojunjun

47
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,220
He only recognizes you

48
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,660
Gu Chijun

49
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,400
No matter if you fired me

50
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,520
Or I resigned on my own. I have nothing to do with Gaia anymore.

51
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,140
It has nothing to do with you anymore

52
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,560
Like you said

53
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,140
No matter what I do, I can't turn back time.

54
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,060
So nothing can ever go back to the beginning just because you take it back.

55
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
We both made it clear to each other.

56
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,380
Don't keep persuading me.

57
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,060
I don't have the energy to repeat these words anymore.

58
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,660
Xu Zhen, please stop being so stubborn.

59
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,220
I know you are sad about Professor Xu's incident.

60
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,380
But you can't just fall like this.

61
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,980
The dead cannot be resurrected

62
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,140
But when people are confused, they may turn back.

63
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,440
Xu Chen

64
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,980
Imagine if Professor Xu saw you like this.

65
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,740
How can he be at ease?

66
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,300
Sorry, I want to be alone.

67
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,580
Xu Zhen

68
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,500
Xu Chen I can't understand

69
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,620
Why did the professor I played be in the volcano before the eruption?

70
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,180
Don't go against the current

71
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,540
Take a branch to wring the lava

72
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,420
Isn't this dangerous?

73
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,700
Maybe the professor in the movie is like your dad

74
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,660
Not a person who fears death either.

75
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,740
Death to them

76
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,380
Just another adventure and journey

77
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,260
Dad said this is the throbbing of life

78
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,940
Everything Begins and Ends

79
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,500
Everything ends and begins

80
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,180
Maybe

81
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,500
This is the kind of romance and open-mindedness that the character wants to express, which is unique to scientists.

82
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,060
So I'm thinking

83
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,100
Since you can capture this character and your father's mentality so delicately

84
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,180
So why can't you be like them?

85
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,980
Be stronger

86
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,820
Take a few more steps

87
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,020
you must know

88
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,260
The outer beauty of the dark clouds is the sunshine

89
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,539
I understand everything you said.

90
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,620
But because

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,660
He is my dearest father.

92
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,980
So I can't be so free and easy

93
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,740
Wanting, I've been looking for you for a long time.

94
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,540
Wanting Sometimes I really envy Professor Xu

95
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,860
There is such a good woman beside him

96
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,300
I'm not a good woman

97
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,940
I'm just a

98
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,020
Just a selfish person who understands oaths

99
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,160
No

100
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,420
You are not like this

101
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,300
I never thought you were as indifferent as your indifferent appearance

102
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,780
On the contrary, you have a fire in your heart

103
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,260
Meet someone you want to warm up

104
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,360
You would rather burn

105
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,380
Burn Yourself

106
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,900
Otherwise you wouldn't be so depressed.

107
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,660
Watching the animation over and over again to torture myself

108
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,300
Don't pretend you understand me.

109
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,460
We have known each other for so many years.

110
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,860
I'm not pretending to understand you.

111
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,420
I'll understand whatever you want.

112
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,100
Do you remember when we applied for the City of Time project?

113
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,940
I know that the soul of this movie is Professor Xu

114
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,260
At that time, I felt a little uncomfortable.

115
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,380
But later I figured it out

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
Rather than saying that you two are in love

117
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,340
It's more like a family that clings to each other.

118
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,500
You never come close

119
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,380
But between

120
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,340
There is a tacit understanding

121
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,800
Even if Professor Xu is gone

122
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,240
I will definitely support you in completing this film

123
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,140
Use the City of Time to commemorate him

124
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,260
Why are people so fragile?

125
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,260
Why

126
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,860
Why did life disappear?

127
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,940
Just slowly

128
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,820
Slowly alienating

129
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,500
I don't have time to say more, haha

130
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,080
ha

131
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,980
Everything will be fine with me here.

132
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,860
Okay, I have so much to say to him.

133
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,340
Okay, it's okay.

134
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,540
Stop crying.

135
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,380
elder sister

136
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,520
elder sister

137
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,040
Junjun

138
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,240
Mini Yoga

139
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,480
Brother Gu Zhijun

140
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,920
My father in the company got off work.

141
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,700
Can you let Xiao Linjun play with me for a while?

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,220
Brother Xu Zhen, sister didn't come today?

143
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,320
he

144
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
He probably won't come again.

145
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,300
why

146
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,100
because

147
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,140
Because he's in a bad mood

148
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,000
Brother, it seems you are in trouble.

149
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,860
My sister is probably not just in a bad mood.

150
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,620
You two must have had a fight.

151
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,100
How did you know

152
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,140
Do you have any good ideas?

153
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,440
Of course you know that?

154
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,500
I found that beautiful girls like food the most

155
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,000
Sister Time is so beautiful, it must be the same

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,500
In front of the food

157
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Any unhappy things will be forgotten

158
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,700
In order to see my beloved sister Xu Zhen again

159
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,680
In a few days I will ask my father to invite you and Sister Xu Zhen to our house for dinner.

160
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,480
meal

161
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,260
Who did you learn this from, my dad?

162
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,960
Yuanxiao dad is calling me and I have to go back

163
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,680
Brother Guo Zhijun, don't worry.

164
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,220
I will definitely help you

165
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,340
Come on, brother

166
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,540
Goodbye

167
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,220
Lantern Festival, dad is off work, let's go home

168
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,260
Although Yuanxiao's method is unreliable

169
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,540
But I really need to think of a solution.

170
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,660
How can I restore my assistant?

171
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,340
Smile, what do you want to buy?

172
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,660
Hey, why is it gone?

173
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,260
What are you looking for, kid?

174
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,320
How come the talking dinosaur recording you sold a while ago is gone?

175
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,380
That recording dinosaur is sold out.

176
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Otherwise, you see, although this one can't speak, every joint can move

177
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,680
It's fun too.

178
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,580
Yes, Lantern Festival

179
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,860
How about Dad buy this for you?

180
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,920
I can talk. I already have one.

181
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,100
I want the kind that can talk

182
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,560
How about this?

183
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,000
I contacted the merchant and asked him if he still had it.

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,400
If I have any, I will send it to you directly, okay?

185
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,620
Okay, okay, thank you, Auntie.

186
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,680
Xiao Juan

187
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,880
Xiao Juan

188
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,920
Xiaoxiu, I am really tired today

189
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,700
I'm really not in the mood to play with you.

190
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,060
But if you are here to persuade me to return to the company

191
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,000
You don't have to waste your energy here.

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,580
You'd better go back early.

193
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,640
I came to see you today, not to play with you.

194
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,660
I don't want to bring you back to the company.

195
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,220
After all, it is your freedom to return to the company or not.

196
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,380
So why did you come here?

197
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,180
They are all for healing a sad person.

198
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,400
Hey, just put the vase inside the sofa

199
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,620
Put the fish tank there

200
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,780
The chair is over there.

201
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,980
Coffee machine in the kitchen

202
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,380
be careful

203
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,140
The table is placed in the living room

204
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
When I was alone abroad

205
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,740
I especially like to go to the furniture market

206
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,940
Like the clean and comfortable feeling

207
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,120
I always feel that if I live in such an environment

208
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,260
No matter what troubles you encounter outside

209
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,880
When I get home, I treat my worries like chewing gum.

210
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,320
Throw it directly into the trash

211
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,780
That's it.

212
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,820
Thank you Bear

213
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,480
Xiaozhen

214
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,180
Give me your hand

215
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,020
I lost my mother when I was a child

216
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,340
At that time, I felt like my whole world was falling apart

217
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,060
Until later

218
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,700
I met you

219
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,020
Encountered this four-leaf clover amber

220
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,100
I found happiness again.

221
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,380
Ms. Yang Rui had a cheerful personality during her lifetime.

222
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,940
Gentle and kind

223
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,540
She is a good wife to her husband

224
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,579
She is also a good mother to her son.

225
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,220
It's a pity she's gone

226
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,220
Let us send her off today.

227
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,420
Presenting flowers to Ms. Yang Rui

228
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,040
Where are mom and dad?

229
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,820
Why did you put it in the box?

230
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,780
son

231
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,220
Mommy is asleep

232
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,340
Ah, I want my mother, give her back to me.

233
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,660
I want my mother

234
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,180
Give me my mother back

235
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, your mother will be unhappy if you do this.

236
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,680
Listen to me, son. Listen to what your father says.

237
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,740
Obedient son

238
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,140
Zhao and you help

239
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,820
help me

240
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,260
Oh, I want my mother.

241
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,640
snort

242
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,360
snort

243
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,700
Huh, mommy, little bear, little bear, don't cry.

244
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,480
what is this

245
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,180
This is Clover Amber

246
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,080
My father and I found it when we went up the mountain to look for cultural relics.

247
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,860
Dad said this is the code to unlock happiness. I give it to you.

248
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,460
Maybe this piece of four-leaf clover amber is really spiritual

249
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,900
When you are at your lowest

250
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,260
I found you again

251
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,980
Now

252
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,840
I intend to follow his words

253
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,900
Give him back to you

254
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,980
I hope you'll be like me one day.

255
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,740
Regaining happiness

256
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,740
But this piece of amber is really important to me.

257
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,320
When you find happiness again

258
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,740
Remember to give it back to me

259
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,780
Come in

260
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,880
lead

261
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,140
Can I talk to you?

262
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,940
Come sit here

263
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,940
Speak

264
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,600
Mr. Yang

265
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,980
I have always admired you

266
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,940
You can always find a way to

267
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,460
Treat each character so delicately.

268
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,660
But I never thought

269
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,540
You in life

270
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,060
You are so considerate to your family.

271
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,460
Mr. Gu, as I recall, you are not someone who is particularly interested in other people's private affairs.

272
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,900
I'm not interested

273
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,460
but I do not know

274
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,100
You are my assistant

275
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,300
Your daughter Xu Zhen

276
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,340
Is it a simple statement of not being interested?

277
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,860
Just skip it

278
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,080
Director Yang

279
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,060
Your daughter

280
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,940
The person who once wanted to have everything to warm others

281
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,900
Now closing myself

282
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,100
Suppress all your emotions

283
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,860
I think any mother

284
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,100
I can't bear to see my daughter become like that.

285
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,460
So I have a small request for you.

286
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,060
I hope you can help him now when he is most vulnerable.

287
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,340
Like an ordinary mother

288
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,180
Give him some encouragement

289
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,980
A little comfort

290
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,780
Will suffice

291
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,500
alright

292
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,460
I'm done talking.

293
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,220
I hope I didn't disturb you. Bye.

294
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,760
How can I be so stupid?

295
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,260
Can't even spell this.

296
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,940
What are you doing here again?

297
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,300
I hope you can do me a favor

298
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,940
Help Xu Zhen get out of the trough

299
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,020
You don't need to take care of our family affairs.

300
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,060
But if you want to take advantage of the situation

301
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,860
I will never let you go

302
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,560
Old Pond Residence

303
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,160
Why did you come to see Shen Qingyan?

304
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,100
He must have not given you a good look.

305
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,220
I can understand his feelings.

306
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,260
But I really want a way to help Xu Zhen get out of this

307
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,180
I just need your help.

308
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,500
If you could help me with this,

309
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,060
I accept the interview on your website unconditionally

310
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,020
In fact, even if you don't accept the interview

311
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,580
I must help with this.

312
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,220
I don't want to see my best friend continue to be sad like this.

313
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,020
As for Xiao Yan, he actually cares about Xu Zhen more than anyone else.

314
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,440
Maybe it's because I care too much.

315
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,040
So he is more afraid of others hurting him

316
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,840
rescue

317
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,980
Guo Daming, don't worry

318
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,160
As long as you can make Xiaozhen return to the way she was before

319
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,420
I will definitely let Xiao Yan add me

320
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,460
dad

321
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,300
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival

322
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,500
It's your birthday too

323
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,860
Mom, do you remember Dad's birthday?

324
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,620
To forget someone

325
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,580
It's not an easy thing

326
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,700
Because of his memory

327
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,420
Will appear at any time

328
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,660
In this maze of memory

329
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,860
The lost person is the prisoner

330
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,300
Dare to break

331
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,900
The one who grinds the wall with memory is a free man

332
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,640
Xiao Chen

333
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,300
You followed your father on adventures since you were a child.

334
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,900
I think this is not only to cultivate your healthy physique

335
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,700
And this strong mentality of not being afraid of walking alone

336
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,260
As Xu Zhengyao's daughter

337
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,380
I believe I know what choice I will make.

338
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,420
There will be a press conference for the launch of City of Time next week.

339
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,980
I am a director

340
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,060
I want to invite you back to the crew.

341
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,540
I hope that by then

342
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,780
I can see you adjust your status

343
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,900
Back to work

344
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,020
Hey, why are you here again?

345
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,520
Ah, don't go.

346
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,620
Why is it him again? Stop being so angry, young master.

347
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,400
Since everyone is here to help Xu Zhen

348
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,060
Why don't we figure it out together?

349
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,220
I am not interested

350
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,720
Why

351
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,340
What's this

352
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,360
This is the last gift Professor Xu left for Xiaozhen.

353
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,180
But on the day when Professor Xu was hospitalized, he accidentally broke his

354
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,620
If we can put it together and return it to Xiaozhen, maybe

355
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,780
It can also cheer up Xiao Chen

356
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,620
But Xiao Yan

357
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,520
He has been working hard for many days without sleep.

358
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,140
No invasion at all

359
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,840
Don't worry, I'm ready to find someone to help

360
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,700
I will definitely restore this mammoth and return it to my sister.

361
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,700
It's better like this

362
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,620
Let's make a bet

363
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,140
If I could restore this mammoth

364
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,900
You guys will participate in my plan.

365
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,660
If I can't do it

366
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,380
I promise I will never show up in front of you.

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,900
Including your sister

368
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,460
Hey Xiao Yan

369
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,460
Hey, I'll take it as your promise.

370
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,180
Our original intention is the same

371
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,300
I hope Xu Zhen can be happy

372
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,380
That's why I want to gather everyone's strength.

373
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,740
Let's get back the Xu Zhen of the past

374
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,260
So Minister Gu

375
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,460
Next step

376
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,100
How do you need us to cooperate with you?

377
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,000
What's wrong with you

378
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,700
Why are you wrapping yourself in a bath towel in my house?

379
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,120
boss

380
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,900
It's already late at night and you just came back

381
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,960
I said you've been suspicious lately.

382
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,220
Disappearing mysteriously for an hour every day

383
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,980
To be honest

384
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,540
Are you dating some artist behind my back?

385
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,480
Boss, I don't care if you are in love or not.

386
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,560
Even if I'm wanted

387
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,580
Please tell me in advance so that I can be mentally prepared.

388
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,020
If you keep talking like this

389
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,780
Believe it or not, I will change my password tomorrow.

390
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,140
If my guess is wrong,

391
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,040
boss

392
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,900
You won't be

393
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,360
Boss, please tell me.

394
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,380
I like giants the most, please, please, keep it secret

395
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,940
Really boring.

396
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,380
Dear, the clover I love so much recently has released a hot NMD

397
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,700
How about I go shopping with you?

398
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,660
I'm not in the mood

399
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,180
Don't want to go out

400
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,340
Sister, I have a girlfriend.

401
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,060
I really have a girlfriend

402
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,700
There is a chopping

403
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,060
I made an appointment with him

404
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,700
Would you like to come and help me with some reference?

405
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,080
Xiao Yan

406
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,020
You guys had your first date in such a gloomy place.

407
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,620
Hey, Xiao Yan, Health

408
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,280
Xiao Chen

409
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,900
Dad is actually quite satisfied with his life.

410
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,300
Free like an eagle

411
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,099
Via Beautiful Fossils

412
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,340
Literature specimens

413
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,659
Talking to different time and space

414
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,580
I feel like I have entered a time travel like in that online novel you often talk about.

415
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,499
But on the free screen

416
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,900
Because of your arrival 20 years ago

417
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,180
My little daughter Xu Zhen

418
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,860
It makes me feel like a weary bird returning to its nest

419
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,700
You have grown from such a small thing to now.

420
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,180
Dad feels that time passes so fast

421
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,260
I can't get enough of you

422
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,980
But your strength

423
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,260
Your optimism

424
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,740
Your kindness

425
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,660
This is what my father is most proud of in his life.

426
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,780
Xiao Chen is not a good enough father

427
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,940
I didn't accompany you into the palace of marriage

428
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,140
I didn't personally put your hand

429
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,100
Hand it over to the man you choose

430
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,320
My dear little town

431
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,260
Baby girl

432
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,220
Can you forgive your father who can no longer accompany you?

433
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,020
Dad loves you

434
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,220
dad

435
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,280
Xu Chen

436
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,140
We'll show you these

437
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,460
I hope you don't run away from yourself anymore.

438
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,900
Stop being stubborn

439
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,980
if you need

440
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,660
My shoulder is always there for you to lean on

441
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,620
We all hope

442
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,820
Can you go back to the Xu Chen you once were?

443
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,660
I believe Professor Xu also hopes so.

444
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,780
This is what Professor Xu left me.

445
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,980
I put it together with Xiaoyuan

446
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,260
Now I give it to you

447
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,560
Xu Chen

448
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,940
Time

449
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,140
There are too many emotions in your family

450
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,780
Professor Xu

451
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,260
Good way

452
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,100
So I hope you can come back

453
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,420
Together with everyone

454
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,460
Can you finish this movie?

455
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,880
Director Liang, I accept your offer.

456
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,000
I will immediately return to work in the City of Time.

457
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,280
I will definitely try my best

458
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,420
Please give me more advice

459
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,980
welcome back

460
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,020
I want to learn

461
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,620
Welcome to Gaia Films' annual blockbuster movie

462
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,160
The opening ceremony of City of Time

463
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:44,700
Then I will officially announce the start of the filming of the movie City of Time.

464
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,660
Let us witness this exciting moment together

465
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,580
3 21

466
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,040
The little dinosaur got out

467
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,380
Our movie City of Time has finally started filming

468
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,200
The concept trailer released by Director Liang before was very intense

469
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,580
Let everyone be full of expectations for the City of Time

470
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,280
I feel like this is a groundbreaking film.

471
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,340
Can you share your creative inspiration with us?

472
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,700
First of all, thank you very much for your anticipation for this movie.

473
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,580
this movie

474
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,780
I'm here to commemorate a

475
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,460
An old friend of mine who has passed away

476
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,700
So, all along

477
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,860
I want to make this film a sincere one.

478
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,980
Me and my team

479
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,620
I put a lot of effort into this play.

480
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,100
Everything you see now is my team.

481
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,100
With my fellow crew members

482
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,460
Working day and night

483
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,220
There are also some people who have made efforts for this play

484
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,020
Far exceeded my expectations and imagination

485
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,580
At this point

486
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,980
I was very touched

487
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:51,220
So I am very happy and honored to be able to work with this group of enthusiastic

488
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,180
Excellent and progressive

489
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,580
Partners who are full of ambition

490
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,740
Working together towards the same goal

491
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,780
So thank them again

492
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,580
especially

493
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,820
Those ones

494
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,220
The staff who are silently working behind the scenes

495
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,260
I am really grateful to them

496
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,780
Thanks

497
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,180
Wei Chen

498
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,340
Let me go, let me go, brother Wei Chen
