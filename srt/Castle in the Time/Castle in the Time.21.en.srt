1
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,540
The pain of time has lasted all night

2
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,140
Wow sister

3
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,260
They dared to send wreaths

4
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,460
Are all these boxes filled with ghost money?

5
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,980
Look, there's even a mirror.

6
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,800
what does it mean

7
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,480
Look in the mirror and see how you look

8
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,020
Stop dreaming

9
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,180
You really can think of it.

10
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,660
Who is it?

11
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,860
Xu Zhen bitch

12
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,240
unacceptable

13
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,660
Is this the end?

14
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,580
The fans are really persistent.

15
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,820
Xiao Yan, I'm going to the crew first.

16
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,680
Sister, please take care of these first.

17
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,780
Let's go together

18
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,920
wrong password

19
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,340
please enter again

20
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,680
The password you entered is incorrect

21
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,180
Please answer the questions with numbers to unlock the code

22
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,480
Question: Is Alphacera a single-celled animal?

23
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,300
The answer is one, two, and no.

24
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,660
The password you entered is incorrect

25
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,460
You have two more chances

26
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,020
Please answer the question with numbers. Is Brontosaurus a carnivorous dinosaur or a herbivorous dinosaur?

27
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,580
1 carnivorous dinosaur 2 herbivorous dinosaur

28
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,800
The password you entered is incorrect

29
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,600
You have one more chance to answer

30
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,080
Please answer the code question with numbers. What period did the duck-billed dinosaurs belong to?

31
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,260
A White Crocodile 2 Jurassic

32
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,160
Congratulations on completely freezing your password

33
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,220
Welcome to the Planet of the Replicants

34
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,780
No gain

35
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,900
You've always known

36
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,300
I hate people who don't know how to be grateful.

37
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,740
I hope you don't forget

38
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,900
Today's things

39
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,300
I can not argue with you

40
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,540
But you must remember what you said

41
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,380
Someone as enthusiastic as your daughter

42
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,980
It doesn't seem suitable to stay here.

43
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,940
What to do next

44
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,300
You decide

45
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,320
Could it be

46
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,740
I can turn around for you today

47
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,420
But next time

48
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,580
It's hard for me to guarantee

49
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Come in

50
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,300
Mom, I came here today to talk to you.

51
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,620
Please call me Director Liang at work.

52
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,540
I don't like my children's personal affairs affecting my work status

53
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,460
Director Liang

54
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,580
I

55
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,900
I really hope to stay in the crew

56
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,440
For these previously caused

57
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,420
I'm really sorry about this.

58
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,600
But I will pay attention to it later

59
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
I will never cause such trouble again.

60
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,580
I hope

61
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,260
I hope you can accept my continued work in the crew.

62
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,520
What does it matter whether I accept it or not?

63
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,940
You've already decided to stay.

64
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,060
Get out

65
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,379
Director Liang, I really don't want to leave for my dad. I'm so sorry.

66
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,860
Hey Xiaojuan

67
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,900
Come here

68
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,080
What are you doing? Yesterday it was a massage chair. What is it today?

69
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,320
Of course it's work.

70
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,660
I'm calling you so seriously, why else could it be that you come here?

71
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,780
really

72
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,220
Here's what's going on

73
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,040
What about our crew's expenses last month?

74
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,300
It's so big that I can't calculate it. Can you help me calculate how much it is?

75
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,740
Yeah, take a look.

76
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,540
Yeah, this

77
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,260
Add this

78
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,180
How did you figure it out?

79
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,480
5.2 billion a month late is too much.

80
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,340
Hey, think about it again.

81
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,020
Does 5205201314 have any special meaning?

82
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,180
Mr. Kobayashi, as your assistant, shouldn't you do some more meaningful work?

83
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,220
I think it is very meaningful to express my feelings through numbers.

84
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,980
Hey hey hey

85
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,860
I have one more thing I want your help with.

86
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,940
Of course, work is work.

87
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,280
Oh, that's it.

88
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,300
They sent me a script.

89
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,760
You know there are a lot of words I don't understand.

90
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,500
So as an assistant, shouldn't you help me answer my questions?

91
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,820
OK

92
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,140
Forget it, let's go

93
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,440
Hey Hey hey

94
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,260
The hero likes to be with the heroine

95
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,780
What does this mean?

96
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,420
It means always being together.

97
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,980
Well

98
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,400
That

99
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,020
That means we two are stuck together now.

100
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,840
Work doesn't count.

101
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,040
I didn't say that the boss and the employees are tired of being together. You can't understand it this way.

102
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,900
Is there an antonym for "tired"?

103
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,100
Kobayashi

104
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,680
Antonyms for "not"

105
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,180
It's gonna be greasy.

106
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,280
Xiao Chen

107
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,780
What did you just say?

108
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,120
Are you saying I love you

109
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,060
Oh my god, Xiao Chen

110
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,540
I really like you

111
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,540
When you gave me the four-leaf clover amber that year, I felt that all the luck in the world had come to me.

112
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,300
Xiaoxiu

113
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,140
You were only 10 years old at that time. I gave you an amber and I thought it was candy to put in your mouth. What do you know?

114
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,740
Xiaoxiu, you are my favorite friend

115
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,980
But Xiaojuan

116
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,620
I really, really want to be your boyfriend

117
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,420
If Mr. Kobayashi doesn't confirm it, I'll go get busy.

118
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,820
You have been very bad recently. You need to know your only two advantages. Come on.

119
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,380
Xiaofei

120
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,180
That scene you just played was really good

121
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,260
Thank you for the compliment, Brother Qujing

122
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,220
Why don't we take a photo to commemorate it?

123
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,220
Thank you, Army Brother

124
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,780
Hey, are you okay?

125
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,420
Are you okay?

126
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,980
Oh, it's ok, thank you, my lover.

127
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,580
It's a gentleman's behavior to take care of a lady. Please sit down.

128
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,120
Finally found out who exposed the photos of you and Gu Shijun

129
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,400
It turned out to be Xiao Fei

130
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,420
Absolutely true

131
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,620
Oath, come here

132
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,940
I know Xu Chen cares about me.

133
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,540
You see, the way he looked at me and Xiao Fei just now was completely different

134
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,620
No

135
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,020
It's very normal.

136
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,660
I am a pilot.

137
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,620
Your dinosaur eggs have been delivered. Please check them.

138
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,820
Great. What's wrong?

139
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,780
The dinosaur eggs I ordered have arrived

140
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,700
It's time to defeat Lin Jinxiu

141
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,500
But I support you.

142
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,660
He just hugged me, did you see that? He just hugged me, his eyes were full of tenderness

143
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,640
It seems my plan worked.

144
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,680
Don’t just focus on the rich second generation

145
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,540
Big stars are my real choice

146
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,420
I must seize the opportunity

147
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,660
Brother Chijun just

148
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,820
It's quite gentle.

149
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,500
He must be interested in me.

150
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,660
Do you think I should buy him a gift to thank him?

151
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,700
God is so kind to me

152
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,880
I must

153
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,180
Seize the opportunity

154
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,620
Will Sister Xiaofei make you think too much?

155
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,060
It must be like this

156
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,680
I don't wear this dress anymore

157
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,500
Give me a new set.

158
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,460
Zhijun

159
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,460
What's wrong

160
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,940
Thank you for your gift

161
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,900
No thanks

162
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,260
Ah, wait, my brother Qianjun

163
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,080
ah

164
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,480
ah

165
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,580
Hey, thank you

166
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,580
It would be strange if I didn't fall down wearing such high shoes.

167
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,200
The shoes were temporarily repaired but there were already signs of damage.

168
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,100
I suggest you don't wear it anymore.

169
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,180
Many things are like this, whether it is good or bad

170
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,480
As long as you do it, it will leave traces

171
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,460
Fossils look like this, so do photos.

172
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,120
Nature cannot erase

173
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,900
Not to mention humans

174
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,920
what are you saying

175
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,060
I did not understand

176
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,020
It was you who sent the photo of Gu Zhijun and I to the reporter, right?

177
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,580
Well, you can't say anything nonsense.

178
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,540
Just now when I was helping you pick up your phone, I saw the photo

179
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,240
What has happened cannot be reversed.

180
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,620
I don't want to pursue it any further.

181
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,500
I just hope that the City of Time can continue to move forward smoothly and not be affected by me.

182
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,820
Sister, what's wrong with you?

183
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,980
What’s wrong with you

184
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,420
Are you OK

185
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,040
Oh I'm fine

186
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,340
I just fell down.

187
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,460
Xu Zhen, help me up. Sister Xu Zhen

188
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,820
He's pretty good.

189
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,380
Just bad luck

190
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,320
oh

191
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,700
Let's go

192
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,620
Come to the east side of the studio to find the light

193
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,660
Go to the east side of the studio to find the light

194
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,640
What the hell is Gu Chijun?

195
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,340
Hey, Xiao Chen, ignore him. Uh, I know there's a good movie. Let's go watch it together.

196
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,220
I'd better go and have a look.

197
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,280
Well

198
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
Well, in that case, I'll go with you.

199
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,140
After all, I am your boss and I am responsible for your safety.

200
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,220
Well, let's go.

201
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,140
Cockroaches Cockroaches calling cockroaches

202
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,180
Cockroach Cockroach

203
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,700
Received the sparrow, please tell me.

204
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,040
Cockroach Cockroach

205
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,300
Isn't it cured?

206
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,740
It's not cured. Can you give me a new code?

207
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,300
The cockroach stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. Do you have any objection to such a cultural code?

208
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,540
Now keep silent and wait for the opportunity

209
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,700
understand

210
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,340
Hey, you learned Chinese in Hollywood and you are pretty good with the opposite sex.

211
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,140
Cockroach eh

212
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,660
What's this

213
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,300
These must be tricks played by the story army.

214
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,780
Let's go and see.

215
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,540
Lin Jinxiu

216
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,420
How did you come

217
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,260
I'm coming

218
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,020
Xiaozhen is my assistant

219
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,540
In case some strange person does something strange, I can rush out to protect him immediately.

220
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,140
How could I be a weird person?

221
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,840
Let's go to the town. It seems that there is nothing to do.

222
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,900
Wait till you come

223
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,460
Don't forget

224
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,300
I gave you a chance in the hospital.

225
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,780
You're not afraid of losing, are you?

226
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,560
Xiao Chen, you better be careful with him.

227
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,300
He is not only an actor but also an actor

228
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,840
You can't believe anything he says.

229
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,240
You have to learn to reject him decisively, you know?

230
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,060
ah

231
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,160
Mr. Jiang Li, oh, that's right

232
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,680
I have the project City of Time

233
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,140
I have a very important question that I would like to ask you. How about we go over there and talk about it?

234
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,580
Come on, Xiaoxuan, let's go.

235
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,060
I have a gift for you.

236
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,580
Isn't this a dinosaur egg?

237
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,240
Mr. Guo, you got this.

238
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,380
Do you know that it is illegal to buy books privately?

239
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,780
Don't worry

240
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,340
It won't be what you think.

241
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,140
ah

242
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,340
Are you going to hit him with this hammer?

243
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,480
Do you know how much scientific research value such a complete dinosaur egg has?

244
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,940
You're gonna smash him.

245
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,100
You just put it where you want to look at it.

246
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,820
Put these 4 together.

247
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,100
This is what I drew

248
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,420
This is also the first time

249
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,980
The reason why I like you

250
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,180
I carried you on my back that day

251
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,580
It's like carrying the whole world on my back

252
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,980
If there had been no volcanic explosion 200 million years ago

253
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,980
There would be no us

254
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,060
so now

255
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,980
Let this dinosaur egg

256
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,380
Witness our happy moment

257
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,980
Xu Chen

258
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,660
I like you

259
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,300
Gu Zhijun, we can't be together

260
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,380
Why

261
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,520
If we are together, it will affect your career

262
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,760
Will affect the future development path of the City of Time

263
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,220
Do you know that it will affect Gaia's reputation?

264
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
I do not care

265
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,620
But I care

266
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,840
Xu Zhen

267
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,860
I just want to be with you

268
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,820
You just need to take a step towards me

269
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,660
I will take all 9,999 steps in the world

270
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,860
Don't be afraid of anything

271
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,020
Leave it all to me, okay?

272
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,060
The dinosaurs have been extinct for a long time.

273
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,060
But their fossils

274
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,060
To prove to all humans that they existed

275
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,500
All ancient creatures have become fossils to tell us about their past experiences

276
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,700
Kuchi-kun, you worked so hard to get a dinosaur egg

277
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,300
It really touched and made me happy.

278
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,220
But I'm sorry

279
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,680
Xu Zhen

280
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,180
Xu Zhen Xiao Zhen Xu Zhen

281
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,660
Okay, give him some time.

282
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,100
Oh well

283
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,900
Just give him one more day.

284
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,760
Xiao Chen

285
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,620
Are you sure you want to reject Story?

286
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,580
I can't let the City of Time fail because of me.

287
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,700
I want to make the City of Time

288
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,660
Come and witness the existence of Dad

289
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,140
This is also the first time

290
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,780
The reason why I like you

291
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,020
I carried you on my back that day

292
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,420
It's like carrying the whole world on my back

293
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,380
If there had been no volcanic explosion 200 million years ago

294
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,100
There will be no partners

295
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,740
so now

296
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,460
Let this dinosaur egg

297
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,820
Witness our happy moments

298
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,540
Xu Chen

299
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,220
I like you

300
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,620
dad

301
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,940
I encountered a very difficult multiple-choice question.

302
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,380
How should I choose

303
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,660
you say

304
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,820
What should I choose?

305
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,040
I really didn't expect this.

306
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,780
Our Gaia sister came to my house and became a beautiful cook

307
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,420
What an honor I am.

308
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,380
This is a new dish I learned.

309
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,020
President of Gaia

310
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,960
Hello

311
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,020
No problem. 4 o'clock

312
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,560
Recently, there have been a series of announcements

313
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,980
I'm so busy

314
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,300
Isn't it a good thing to be busy?

315
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,500
This shows that we and my auntie are becoming more and more popular.

316
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,740
But I also need jewelry for these announcements

317
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,060
Otherwise you go with me.

318
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,300
I don't like going to jewelry stores alone.

319
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,540
OK

320
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,380
Beautiful company

321
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,300
Why not do it

322
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,660
Miss Qin, these are our latest models

323
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,480
Why

324
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,420
Ziqing, what do you think of this set?

325
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,220
I love so much

326
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,099
I think it would look good on you.

327
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,860
Could you try it, please?

328
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,859
Please help Miss to try it on.

329
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,660
See if you like it

330
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,020
Jingyang, you have a good eye for necklaces

331
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,019
Yeah

332
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,620
I choose women's eyes

333
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,700
It's also very good

334
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,860
Where is good

335
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,220
Smart and ambitious

336
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,940
Never hide your desires

337
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,060
It's really great

338
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,380
What attracted me more was

339
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,140
Speak with discretion

340
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,060
Know the boundaries of doing things

341
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,900
I hope to be with this woman forever.

342
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,100
Never leave each other

343
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,180
That depends on Mr. Lin.

344
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,140
Your sincerity

345
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,300
Things that can be done with money

346
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,060
To me, Lin Jingyang, these are all trivial matters.

347
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,860
Please help me pack this South African necklace

348
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,420
Okay, thank you Mr. Lin.

349
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,700
Send Miss Qin home

350
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,860
It's Lin

351
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,460
Jinyang where are you going

352
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,220
You go home first

353
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,980
I'm already late but I still have to rush over

354
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,460
What kind of woman is so important?

355
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,920
Mr. Lin follows your instructions.

356
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,020
The jewelry that Miss Qian just selected is already in the car.

357
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,740
Good to drive

358
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,600
Xu Zhen

359
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,240
I have something to tell you.

360
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,540
I suddenly remembered that I need to go to the props department to get something.

361
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,820
Xu Zhen, stop right there!

362
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,860
Not found at home

363
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,500
There is no poison either.

364
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,700
I'll take a look again.

365
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,080
Xu Zhen, how long are you going to hide?

366
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,300
I'm not hiding. I'm working now.

367
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,560
Do you hear Sister Xiaorui calling you?

368
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,460
Don't interrupt

369
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,700
When will you finally look into your own heart?

370
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,160
ah

371
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,980
Are you okay?

372
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,180
Oh, I'm not injured.

373
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,180
Just a little scratch on the skin

374
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,020
Ah, story, your forehead is bleeding.

375
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,660
Let me take a look

376
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,540
Boss, what are you doing?

377
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
Mr. Gu

378
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,800
Have you become someone's love interest?

379
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,020
Mr. Gu, please explain the comprehensive lesson just now.

380
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,700
Mr. Gu does not recommend

381
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,600
Dear audience friends,

382
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,920
We are now outside the Time City crew.

383
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,160
Mr. Gu Chijun just walked past me with his assistant

384
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,420
It seems that their relationship is dead.

385
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,040
The scratch is a bit serious

386
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,300
The wound is a bit deep

387
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,580
I suggest that the patient stay in the hospital for a few more days for observation.

388
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,340
You also need to be careful with your head.

389
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,700
Dr. Xie

390
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,920
There were so many reporters outside just now.

391
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,740
You shouldn't hold me.

392
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,420
In fact, I have confessed to you until now

393
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,180
15 hours, 35 minutes, 20 seconds have passed

394
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,580
Enough time to be shy

395
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,100
Unbelievable joy

396
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,460
So

397
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,380
Give me an answer now.

398
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,020
Mr. Gu, I am still a patient.

399
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,940
Just know that you are a patient.

400
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,420
So you need a boyfriend to take care of you now

401
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,680
Is there something I did wrong?

402
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,700
you tell me

403
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,260
I can change

404
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,780
You are really very good

405
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,580
It's me. I'm really sorry for causing you trouble during this period of time.

406
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,860
I understand your concerns

407
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,660
I also understand your concerns

408
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,260
Please give me a chance, please?

409
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:26,420
Ah, I have a headache. I want to rest.

410
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,100
Xu Zhen, stop running away

411
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,620
I'm still a patient

412
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,400
You hurt your leg.

413
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,620
It's not the head

414
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,280
Oh, my throat hurts a bit and I can't speak.

415
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,620
I want some water

416
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,460
Please don't make such childish excuses.

417
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,620
Answer my question and I'll give you a drink

418
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,820
Otherwise, everything you want to say will flow back into your stomach along with the water forever.

419
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
Hey Gu Chijun

420
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,640
Are you childish or am I childish?

421
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,440
I want to drink
