1
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,400
Hey, drink this quickly, what is this for?

2
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,540
I went to ask for bleach to induce vomiting so that I could vomit out what I ate this morning.

3
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm fine, I just need to bear with it. No, it will be very dangerous if we continue like this.

4
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,340
I finally asked someone to borrow you, but now I can only steal you.

5
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,980
Wait a minute.

6
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,380
I seem

7
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,500
never mind

8
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,400
You're OK

9
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,980
Hey, it's okay.

10
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,780
Yeah, a little bit.

11
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,420
Click like this

12
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,460
Xu Chen, can you help me get a cup of hot water?

13
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,500
Ah go ahead

14
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,600
how

15
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,820
come here

16
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,940
Do you know what it's like to have a strong assistant?

17
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,940
Ah, what is it when you want to pretend to be sick?

18
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,619
He'll pour bleach in your mouth without hesitation

19
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,260
Okay, this isn't important.

20
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,420
The important thing now is that I don't want to see Qin Ziqing today no matter what.

21
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,100
Please help me think of a solution.

22
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,880
Big Brother

23
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,340
Give you hot water

24
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
ah

25
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,580
Go buy me two more cups of Starbucks

26
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,100
oh

27
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
Brother, are you okay?

28
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,040
You asked me to go find him yesterday.

29
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,780
Make him see you.

30
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,760
You asked me to find him again today.

31
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,460
Let him not see you, you play with me

32
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,780
Yesterday was yesterday

33
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,180
Today is today

34
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,180
I've been rejected three times.

35
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,660
This is the stain I have never had in my life.

36
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,020
Do you still have the nerve to meet him?

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Where did you go yesterday

38
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,120
Went to dinner with my boyfriend

39
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,300
Where did you eat?

40
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,860
I ate that set meal at Pizza Hut

41
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,960
They won't know about my relationship with my child, right? Well, you're overthinking it.

42
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,740
I got up late this morning and came in late

43
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,900
There was a big thing in the entertainment news, but it has nothing to do with you.

44
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,460
No matter how big the matter is, it is not as important as mine. Go quickly.

45
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,500
This is a pretty good painting.

46
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,860
Let's go a little deeper here

47
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
I heard that Miss Qin doesn't like coffee with milk.

48
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,940
I prepared this especially for you.

49
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,700
Please go out first, thank you.

50
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,780
If you have anything to say, just say it.

51
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,580
Uh, Miss Qin

52
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,780
I know you are a very responsible person at work.

53
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,100
The City of Time is also a very important project for you.

54
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,000
You definitely don't want Chijun to bring too much personal emotion into work.

55
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,220
So that it brings trouble to the entire project

56
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,760
After what happened yesterday

57
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,340
I think giving each other some space might be beneficial to everyone's future work.

58
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,860
How long do you think it will take him?

59
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,420
It can't always be like this.

60
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,840
You can rest assured about this

61
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,220
I will persuade him.

62
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,020
Give him a day.

63
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,540
You know he can be a little weird sometimes.

64
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,960
Give him time to think it over.

65
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,920
Wait until he thinks it over before acting with you.

66
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,020
This will produce better results

67
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,120
After all, both of you are very strict with yourselves.

68
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,460
You all want to show your best to the audience, right?

69
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,220
ok, I get it

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,700
It's hard for you to work with Shi Jun.

71
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,800
I just received an advertisement today.

72
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,940
I felt really sorry for changing the time yesterday.

73
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,660
Now that it's all right, I can go and return the favor.

74
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,620
Then I'll go first

75
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,580
Xiaolu, come in and help me pack my things.

76
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,520
Sister Ziqing

77
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,620
What are you doing?

78
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,980
I have something to ask Sister Ziqing

79
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,740
You are here for Gu Chijun, right?

80
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,620
Sister Ziqing has made it very clear that she doesn't want to have any contact with Gu Chijun

81
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,940
Please go back.

82
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,740
I am not here today for Gu Chijun

83
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,660
I think

84
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,020
This matter is not over yet

85
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,480
I believe that Ziqingjie chose to be with Mr. Gu

86
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,760
It must be because I have a lot of feelings for him.

87
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,360
Even if we break up, many things must be made clear.

88
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,620
This situation is not the best outcome for both of them.

89
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:37,878
Fawn

90
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,439
Um

91
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,660
What do you want to say?

92
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,000
What I want to say

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,800
yes

94
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,580
Mr. Gu is not a truly selfish person.

95
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,800
There are things he just doesn't realize.

96
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,540
In fact, he already understood

97
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,380
The harm you have caused to self-cleaning

98
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,260
But I don't have the courage to face self-cleaning

99
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,180
I think

100
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,580
Let the child clean

101
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,040
Give Mr. Gu another chance to make amends.

102
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,460
Do you think it is okay

103
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,780
Director Liang's Ziqing Festival is here

104
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
All departments, please take note!

105
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,060
Next we will shoot the scene where the hero and heroine meet again

106
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,740
what's the situation

107
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,940
Sister Ziqing

108
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,100
You arranged all this, right?

109
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,040
Didn't I tell you?

110
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,260
I told you to mind your own business.

111
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,620
Why are you still hiding from Ziqin?

112
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,140
I know but I need time

113
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,740
I can't face him now.

114
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,520
Is it because I'm sad or because what Sister Ziqing said is right?

115
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,060
You feel so guilty that you can't face him.

116
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,980
Why should I answer your question?

117
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,400
boss

118
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,700
I don't think you can escape

119
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,020
My father often told me

120
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,520
It's not scary to make mistakes

121
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,260
The terrible thing is not admitting that you have made a mistake

122
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,740
As a man you should have your own responsibilities

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,440
In fact, I know you feel guilty towards Sister Ziqing.

124
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,520
You also feel that you haven’t done well.

125
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,780
But I don't know how to face him

126
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,360
You always want to be a perfect person

127
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,100
I can't accept that I made such a mistake.

128
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,020
But maturity is to face and accept an imperfect self.

129
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,240
Think about it carefully.

130
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,460
What do you really think in your heart? Is it because you feel so painful after a breakup?

131
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,060
Or is it because I didn't treat this relative well and feel guilty?

132
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,740
I admit I'm embarrassed

133
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,780
I don't know without my knowledge

134
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,860
Brought so much harm to Ziqing

135
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,780
Although the word "I'm sorry" is simple

136
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,500
But every time I see him

137
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,820
I don't know how to start

138
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,020
Are you laughing at me?

139
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,400
No

140
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,700
Maybe you won't believe it even if I tell you

141
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,620
Maybe I'm sorry

142
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,180
I have said it many times in my mind.

143
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,660
Work is about to start. Come back soon.

144
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,360
who

145
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,180
Who is speaking

146
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,220
You're cheating me

147
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,780
Otherwise, how can you tell Sister Ziqing what you really want to say to her?

148
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,980
I remember you said

149
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Do you wish you were an actor?

150
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,800
More than just a star

151
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,520
As an actor, acting is your unshirkable mission.

152
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,860
How can you back off because of something like this? Everyone is waiting for you to come over here.

153
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,660
Xu Zhen

154
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,660
You are dead

155
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,740
You probably know what we're going to shoot today, it's a concept trailer.

156
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,700
Of course, love is the main thing

157
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,940
But I hope you can present something suspenseful, okay?

158
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,660
Yeah, it's very simple

159
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,100
The boy said I loved you very much before

160
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,720
Girls say I am the same

161
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,400
These two sentences are very simple

162
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,260
If that's possible, we'll actually shoot it.

163
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,380
Are you ready? All departments are in place.

164
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,300
Apple once in

165
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,680
action

166
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,260
Kakaka

167
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,680
This honor

168
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,000
You should look at this girl affectionately because you haven't seen each other for a long time.

169
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,600
And you have to pay attention to every detail of her

170
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,380
Do you understand? OK sorry

171
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,020
One more

172
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,420
Action has been twice

173
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,640
sorry

174
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,620
I was too naive before.

175
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,660
I couldn't protect you

176
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,340
I know

177
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,880
he

178
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,420
Could it be that they didn't follow the script?

179
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,620
It's ok. I think this one is pretty good and well acted.

180
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,620
Thank you, Director

181
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,280
Yeah, next one.

182
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,020
Hmm, ok.

183
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,380
The performance was so good just now.

184
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,700
You are fired

185
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,100
sorry

186
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,500
I was too naive before.

187
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,220
I couldn't protect you

188
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,300
Great acting

189
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,820
How come there is someone as perfect as me in this world?

190
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
This is unfair to other people.

191
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,860
unfair

192
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,500
Is it Xiaojun?

193
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,320
oops

194
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,260
Even if he is right

195
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,260
so what

196
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,340
How can I let an assistant decide what I should do?

197
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,980
I can never forgive him.

198
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,020
Is it Xiaojun?

199
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,400
You came back first

200
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,740
I'll just bring your stuff back to you.

201
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,620
Because this is my last time and I need to hand everything over to you clearly.

202
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,720
Your script is in the black bag.

203
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,520
All the lines are already marked.

204
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,160
The notice is placed on this box

205
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
I have sorted out your part for you.

206
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,920
The other folder contains the work you did for the script.

207
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,140
I also added some expertise in paleontology

208
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,380
Why are you telling me this?

209
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,060
These are things the assistant should know.

210
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,420
Tell me what

211
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,040
Aren't you going to fire me?

212
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,420
I'm here to resign.

213
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,900
You were so disobedient on the set just now.

214
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,420
Why are you so obedient now?

215
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,980
What are you standing there for?

216
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,700
Xiaojunjun is going to poop

217
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,980
Take him down quickly.

218
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:22,020
I'm afraid he'll pull me onto the sofa. Well, then, then, aren't you going to fire me?

219
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,260
I am doing this for Xiaojunjun's sake.

220
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,420
Give you one more chance

221
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,280
Hello, may I ask when did your extramarital affair with Director Wang begin?

222
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,680
Does it have something to do with Director Wang's mood?

223
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,960
What do you think about other people's marriages?

224
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,340
Excuse me, did you point out the muteness because you sent Wang Dao?

225
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,740
I would like to ask if these are all operations for mute speech.

226
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,960
Including your size and uterus inspection

227
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,540
You need to answer me soon.

228
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

229
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,020
What's wrong with him? Does he need help?

230
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,980
It's ok, I just drank too much

231
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,740
Why don't you go soon?

232
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,060
Oh, got it

233
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,420
gone

234
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
I really don't know how this happened.

235
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
I went to the hotel that day to meet Director Wang to talk to me about something that was on my mind.

236
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,580
I don't know why it became like this

237
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,620
Could you please explain it to me clearly?

238
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,620
There was a problem with the hotel's surveillance

239
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,940
There is no evidence to prove any of this.

240
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,860
But I'm afraid it's hard to bear the weight of explanation

241
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,580
sorry

242
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,220
because

243
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,180
My consciousness is weak

244
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,660
Betrayed my family

245
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,340
It brought a lot of negative impact to everyone

246
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,180
I'm really sorry

247
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,180
I hope everyone will raise their hands

248
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,480
Don't bother my family.

249
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,900
my wife

250
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,420
It's already very sad

251
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,420
but

252
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,380
As long as he wants

253
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,660
I won't leave him

254
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,580
A momentary misstep

255
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,600
I

256
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,220
I'm really sorry

257
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,340
Ahhhh

258
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,940
Ahhhh

259
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,260
ah

260
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,500
Mr. Li, time has come

261
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,620
Here I come. That's good.

262
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,040
that is

263
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,400
Everyone

264
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,900
There have been rumors about the pressure for some time.

265
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,300
The pressure has remained silent

266
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,220
Who and our company have always been adhering to

267
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,820
The innocent will be cleared

268
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,340
The work attitude of those who are turbid is turbid

269
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,740
The reason why I stand up and speak out now

270
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,540
Because it is well known

271
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,900
Li Xian is the artist we should love

272
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,300
Although everything he does now is his private matter

273
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,020
But it has seriously affected social commentary

274
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,580
Failed the society's expectations of Li Qianer and the company

275
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,660
So now I am only representing the company to the public

276
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,300
A solemn apology

277
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,460
As a model entertainment company

278
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,200
We should establish good public moral values ​​for the public

279
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,020
This time something like this happened

280
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,620
It was Gaia's fault.

281
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,260
It's my own fault.

282
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,740
So our company has now decided to take responsibility

283
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,900
On behalf of the company, I officially announce

284
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,620
from now on

285
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,700
We will terminate the contract with Li Qian

286
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,460
And completely draw a line

287
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,100
In the future, we will consider character as the key factor in selecting artists.

288
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,260
thank you all

289
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,860
at the same time

290
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,140
Richer's earlier accusations against Gaia were probably just a publicity stunt

291
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,500
As an artist, this is so unethical.

292
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,020
How credible are his words?

293
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,300
If the purpose is to attract attention by slandering the name of the film and television company

294
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,740
It's really disgusting

295
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,940
In contrast

296
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,420
Gaia's performance and integrity in this matter are admirable

297
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,100
Jin Ying really turned the tide this time

298
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,340
Public opinion has completely turned

299
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,540
The stock price also rose a lot

300
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,500
I just got back from the board of directors

301
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,580
The directors were full of praise for him. Zhang He

302
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,300
Are you considering bringing him back?

303
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,980
But I'm still worried about this

304
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,980
I think he handled it a little too smoothly.

305
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,300
Dad, I have something to talk to you about.

306
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,140
Uncle Ji, you are here too.

307
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,040
brother

308
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,140
You talk to your dad

309
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,500
I have something else to do

310
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,220
I'll go first

311
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,600
dad

312
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,720
Dad, look how well I did on this matter.

313
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,700
Should you let me come back?

314
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,880
It's really hard to be a producer.

315
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,720
The phone was ringing non-stop every day.

316
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,540
It takes dozens of times to charge

317
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,200
I can't do it

318
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,700
You should let me come back to do it.

319
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,520
If you can't do it, don't do it.

320
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,100
When faced with difficulties, you retreat.

321
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,960
Do your own thing first

322
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Don't mind the company's business.

323
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,800
Hey, dad, why are you like this?

324
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,960
The whole company is managed.

325
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,940
You're being really unfair to him.

326
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,400
I'll consider this.

327
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,660
Don't worry about it

328
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,960
I heard your crew had another accident.

329
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,500
Go back and have a look

330
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,160
Xiaoqiu, hey

331
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,100
What's going on with you lately?

332
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,780
I just want to do a good job on the crew recently.

333
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,460
But I always feel powerless

334
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,100
Xiaoxiu, you are already great now

335
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,400
The crew is so complicated

336
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
You're pretty quick at getting started.

337
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,440
When I first came to the crew, I was also in a mess.

338
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,540
It's much better after you get familiar with it. I believe you will get better and better.

339
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,820
I just want to do the things in front of me well.

340
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,220
So when I return the crew to my brother

341
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,240
The crew is also in a very good state

342
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,340
My brother wouldn't have so many worries.

343
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,340
do not know why

344
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,820
The relationship between my dad and my brother has become strained recently.

345
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,940
I want their relationship to get better.

346
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,780
But I don't know how to

347
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,540
Why

348
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,280
Hey, I remember Uncle Lin’s birthday is coming soon.

349
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,820
What do you say we throw him a party?

350
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,660
Have a party

351
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,680
Um

352
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,480
when I was young

353
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,340
The uncles from the exploration team went into the mountains to investigate for several months.

354
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,420
When you go home, you often feel a little strange because you haven't seen your family for a long time.

355
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,660
This is when my dad would hold a family gathering.

356
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,440
Xiaoxiu, do you know what Uncle Lin likes to eat?

357
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,180
Then we can show off our skills

358
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,060
My dad doesn't seem to have much interest in food.

359
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,060
I know what he likes to eat.

360
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,720
But the man who cooked for him was already very old.

361
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,860
I guess I'll never find that flavor again.

362
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,380
it does not matter

363
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,560
I'm going to take a day off tomorrow.

364
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,740
I'll go with you to look for it. I believe we can find it.

365
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,060
Uh-huh

366
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,280
Hey, hello.

367
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,300
I want to ask if there is a Yao Ji beef soup here

368
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,960
Oh sorry, I'm not sure

369
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,140
Thank you. Otherwise, let's go to the front and take a look.

370
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,340
Oh, not at all.

371
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Hey, how about this?

372
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,400
The party is about to start

373
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,260
Time is running out, why don't you go home first?

374
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,800
Since we are going to have a party, we must do it well

375
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,660
Uncle Lin rarely has this wish, so let's try again.

376
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,360
If that doesn't work

377
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
You go back first

378
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,320
I'll look for it somewhere else.

379
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,460
Okay, I'll go with you.

380
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,560
That should be correct.

381
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
I lived near here when I was a kid.

382
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,980
This should be it.

383
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,460
Ah, let's go over there and ask.

384
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,240
welcome

385
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,220
You two can sit anywhere.

386
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,420
Boss, do you know of a food truck nearby that sells beef offal soup? It's called Yao Ji Beef Offal Soup.

387
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,980
That's my grandpa's.

388
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,580
But he stopped doing it more than ten years ago.

389
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,660
What's wrong? Do you have anything to do with him?

390
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,320
Then you are the descendant of Grandpa Yao.

391
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,440
My friend's father, Uncle Lin, had eaten the beef offal soup made by your grandfather for many years.

392
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,080
I really miss this taste now

393
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,000
I wonder if it would be convenient for you to come over and make a new one for us.

394
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,140
That's right, you may not know

395
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,740
More than 20 years ago, your grandfather gave a young man a bowl of beef soup.

396
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,940
I also told this young man that if I warmed my body, my heart would be warmed. This young man is my father.

397
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,560
Later, my father started a very successful business.

398
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,260
But he still misses the grandfather who gave him this bowl of beef offal soup.

399
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,800
This is our little thought

400
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,580
Please accept it. No, no, no, no. Please accept it. No, no, no, no.

401
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,740
Your grandfather helped us more than 20 years ago.

402
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,660
We have another favor today and we want his help

403
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,180
Please, my grandpa is here.

404
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,900
Hello, hello, hello, hello, it's like this

405
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,340
I want to ask

406
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,260
Do you recognize the person in the picture?

407
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,740
Wait a minute, young man.

408
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,660
young people

409
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,480
Life in the World

410
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,120
There will always be difficulties

411
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,560
Sometimes you just grit your teeth and get through it

412
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,960
Have some soup

413
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,260
Warm up

414
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,580
My heart is warm

415
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,620
thanks, thanks

416
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,540
Thanks

417
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,940
I remember, of course I remember

418
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,920
It's been more than 20 years.

419
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,500
My father often tells me about that incident

420
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,560
The day you met him

421
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,040
He failed in his business.

422
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,780
My mother is pregnant again

423
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,340
The baby is about to be born, but they don't even have enough money to go to the obstetrics and gynecology hospital.

424
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,320
So my dad acted on impulse

425
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,780
He would be without you

426
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,380
There would be no infection today.

427
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,440
Okay, from that time till now

428
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,260
Your father is not simple.

429
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,700
I'll go with you guys.

430
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,900
Thank you so much

431
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,900
Hi, I haven't paid yet.

432
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,180
Keep your voice down

433
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,060
Thank you.

434
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,660
Could you please pay first next time? Everyone knows we came here by taxi.

435
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,940
Well, I have to seize this good opportunity today.

436
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,700
Decide on Xiaoxiu's zodiac sign

437
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,940
I feel so happy just thinking about it

438
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,340
Hey, what are you laughing at?

439
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,320
Walk

440
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,440
This is where our little Xiu Xiu grew up.

441
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,260
I need to get familiar with it.

442
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,260
Why do you want to pick up?

443
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,220
This is my home too. Let's go later.

444
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,700
What on earth is Xu Zhen doing?

445
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,180
Why did they call us over so early in the morning to attend a party?

446
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,740
Where are the people now?

447
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,500
No one's figure is there

448
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,900
Processing like this

449
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,460
There is only one way

450
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,380
Expelled Oops

451
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,100
Expel Hum

452
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,100
If you were going to fire me, you should have been fired long ago. Why wait until today?

453
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,860
Hey, Boss Gu, could you please stop bluffing like that?

454
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,340
Why is it Xu Zheng again?

455
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,900
Why are you always with Xiaoxiuxiu, talking and laughing?

456
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,980
Isn't this Xu Zhen?

457
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,980
OK

458
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,140
It turns out that he was with Lin Jinxiu

459
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,340
no

460
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,140
We need to find a way to separate them.

461
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,480
snort

462
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,420
Whose is he?

463
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,060
Swear to call him over to me

464
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,960
Just now you said you wanted to fire him.

465
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,840
Now let me go and call someone

466
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,880
Call yourself.

467
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,300
I'll go over there, please.

468
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,880
Why didn't I see the training?

469
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,380
Hey, this kid Jinxiu is really a little unreliable

470
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,740
I still have a sense of responsibility as a producer.

471
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,040
Let's have a party to strengthen the cohesion of the crew

472
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,940
Take a look

473
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,100
What time is it?

474
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,700
Until now, I can't even see a single person.

475
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,540
Dad, don't worry.

476
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,780
Traffic jams are common.

477
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,660
Dad, look who's here.

478
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,840
Brother Yao

479
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,660
It's me! It's me

480
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,060
Brother Yao, this still tastes like it did 20 years ago

481
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,640
Everyone

482
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,140
I want to tell you guys

483
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:13,059
This is definitely not an ordinary bowl of beef offal soup

484
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,659
He used to accompany me

485
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,420
Going through hard times

486
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,500
I believe everyone has had an unforgettable taste in their life.

487
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,260
starting today

488
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,860
City of Time

489
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,140
All the staff are me

490
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,100
A member of the Gaia family

491
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,380
I hope everyone can support each other

492
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,700
Spend these unforgettable years together

493
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,580
Okay, let me introduce the first part of our party.

494
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,800
That is free combination allocation

495
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,100
To complete the most unforgettable

496
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,420
The most delicious taste

497
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,340
Let's have a big competition

498
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,340
Start now

499
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,740
Xiaoxiu, what kind of food do you like to eat?

500
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,920
I prefer to eat food that I don’t have to make myself.

501
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,380
Food haha

502
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,020
Dad, why don't we make boiled fish?

503
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,100
I want to try

504
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,500
I remember when I was little

505
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,900
Because of busy work

506
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,300
So I travel a lot.

507
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,700
Sometimes when I come back late, I take my daughter Wen Xiaoxiu out to eat.

508
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,340
One of our most common dishes is boiled fish

509
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,340
At that time, it was really happy for the family of three to sit together, eat and chat.

510
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,620
Can I cook boiled fish?

511
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,440
Okay, Xiao Xiu, why are you still standing there?

512
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,420
Go get the food.

513
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,460
Good

514
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,500
Wash this, cut it and put it on a plate

515
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,300
What are you doing?

516
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,120
Please let me cook a meal with such a big bowl. It's expensive, okay?

517
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,680
I don't have time to play this kind of game with them.

518
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,240
Think about what you want to do.

519
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,580
It was late and the food was taken away.

520
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,600
Yes, boss, what is your favorite food?

521
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,020
Let's get ready

522
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,860
Of course, Kobe beef from Japan

523
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,800
to be honest

524
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,660
Xiangtan stinky tofu

525
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,220
What do you like to eat

526
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,140
Xiangtan stinky tofu with chili sauce

527
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,220
What do you like to eat stinky tofu? Keep your voice down.

528
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,660
But there is no time to make stinky tofu now. Are you stupid?

529
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,420
How can I let others know that I like to eat stinky tofu?

530
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,760
We just need to make a delicious

531
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,720
Sounds fashionable

532
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,740
Just order dishes that suit your temperament.

533
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,580
Go

534
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,440
Boss, what are you going to do?

535
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,660
If we don't start now, it will be too late.

536
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,240
Oh, by the way, don't you particularly like Kobe beef?

537
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,980
How about you just have a fried chicken steak?

538
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,700
There are too many people who love to eat steak

539
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,500
It doesn't reflect my taste

540
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,460
Let's change to a simple

541
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,540
Just have some fried eggs with tomatoes

542
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,500
This vegetarian healthy red and yellow combination

543
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,460
It suits my fashion style

544
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,940
let's start

545
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,980
Hey, if you put soy sauce, don't put salt, it's too salty.

546
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,540
No onions

547
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,820
What onions should be added to scrambled eggs with tomatoes?

548
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,900
Wow, the pot is boiling

549
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,040

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,660

Which team are you from?

559
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,820
I'm rooting for Xiaoxiu.

560
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,220

561
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,620

00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,540
I declare that the winner is our blue team.

574
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,700
Please invite our blue team to come on stage to receive the award

575
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,560
The prize for our winner today is this very beautiful glowing bird lamp in my hand.

576
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,540
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, hey, you can take the gift you ordered yourself

577
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,060
its not right

578
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,660
But we won

579
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,000
Hey, how about the person who wins like this?

580
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,820
Hey, how was the show? Hello everyone.

581
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,860
Hey, sell it to me

582
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,720
Then I represent the three of us, the Lin family, father and son.

583
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,320
I will perform a song for you called Forgotten Time

584
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,260
Is this okay

585
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,260
Thank you for your hospitality today, Brother Jiang.

586
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,860
Then I'll go first.

587
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,140
You are too polite. Xiao Xiu, go and see Xu Zhen off.

588
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,540
Hey, Xiaoxiu, wait for me for a moment. I have something to ask Brother Jinyang.

589
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,100
Brother Jinyang, I suddenly remembered something very strange

590
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,120
I read a report online saying that the director Wang who cheated with Li Qianer was a middle-aged fat man.

591
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,060
But that day I saw a very tall and thin man with Li Qian'er in the hotel

592
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,160
I don't know what's going on.

593
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,700
Is the online report wrong?

594
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,460
Brother Jinyang, what do you think?

595
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,520
What
