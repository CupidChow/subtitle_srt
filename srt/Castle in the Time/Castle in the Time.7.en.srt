1
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,320
Physical discomfort

2
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,720
Hey, can the time of this announcement be changed at will?

3
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,880
You really don't take me, the producer, seriously.

4
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,580
This is what happened last night

5
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,540
Then we couldn't contact you.

6
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,340
I see

7
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,600
How many times have I told you not to buy me pancakes?

8
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,940
Did you hear that I want to buy a Starbucks combo?

9
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,640
Sister, don’t you love to eat pancakes with sausage?

10
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,060
Eat corn sausage, not sausage

11
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,900
Don't buy me pancakes when you have announcements next time.

12
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,500
Forget it. I won't tell you this anymore.

13
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,760
How am I feeling today?

14
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
Mm, the goddess' breath is blowing

15
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
Yeah, that's the feeling I want.

16
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,420
Well, today I can't lose the show with Qin Zixin.

17
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,440
But you guys don't seem to have any rivalry.

18
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,540
Qin Ziqing won't be here until the afternoon.

19
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,000
Goddesses are ready 24 hours a day

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,660
What if you encounter it?

21
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,860
Why

22
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,500
Why did Xiaoxiu come so early today?

23
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,080
I heard that Mr. Kobayashi came to the set early in the morning.

24
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,480
The whole person is very positive

25
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,580
Oh, and I also treated everyone from the former crew to breakfast. Really?

26
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,740
Well, I have to come early.

27
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,200
Oh, by the way, if there is any such incident again, please inform me immediately.

28
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,740
Early in the morning, two people met by chance

29
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Hand in hand

30
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,400
So romantic

31
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,940
Sister Hand

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,820
Minor repair

33
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,640
Martial arts wine, right?

34
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,300
Hey, I want to ask when our Weiya will be ready.

35
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,420
Please don't delay our filming progress.

36
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,300
Okay, let's go first.

37
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,500
Sure enough, men at work are the most attractive

38
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,320
Sister Fei, I have marked all your lines for today.

39
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,620
Do you need me to help you with the rehearsal?

40
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,300
What's right? Just one sentence.

41
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,660
Why bother filming if you marry the right man?

42
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
Go dress up quickly.

43
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
What are Xiaoxiu's plans for today?

44
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,580
See if we can have a date or something cache

45
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,420
World famous paleontology lectures

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,820
This town should be of interest.

47
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,340
Hey Wang Zhiping

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,420
Could you help me get two tickets for this world-famous paleontology lecture?

49
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,420
no problem, thank you

50
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,180
Qin Ziqing likes spicy food but not spicy food

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,180
I like Chongqing hotpot but not Sichuan hotpot

52
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,200
He likes sweets but doesn't like to drink anything related to milk

53
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,840
The reason is that he was weaned when he was very young.

54
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,280
Because his mother was more careless and mistakenly thought that the child should be weaned early.

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,260
So he didn't even drink milk later on. That's impossible.

56
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,720
I remember when he was with me, I brought him milk tea every day.

57
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,500
Did you see that he drank it all?

58
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,100
I remembered

59
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,240
My suggestion is to first understand the character of the person involved.

60
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,620
Looking forward to tailoring a unique confession plan for him

61
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,180
I understand. Of course I understand.

62
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,300
Then he likes

63
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,220
Korean Drama

64
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,460
American TV series, British TV series, or Japanese TV series?

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,220
You said so many things

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,500
Can you come up with something useful?

67
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,240
Can you show me that you are more valuable than Zhang Shiyu?

68
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,460
Come up with some valuable proposals

69
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,260
I have also collected some good county towns. Do you want to read them all?

70
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,700
Um, playing hard to get

71
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,960
First, silently give him meticulous care in life

72
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Don't mention being together, don't mention not being together

73
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,960
Until he has gotten used to your sudden disappearance from his side, making him feel uncomfortable and contact you actively.

74
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,660
Then you put on a painful look

75
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,620
It's too painful to be his friend. In fact, you have always loved him.

76
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,400
Zhiqing

77
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,860
I can't be friends with you

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,860
too painful

79
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,660
too painful

80
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,380
No, this won't work.

81
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,380
It's so unlike me.

82
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,900
this is not OK

83
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,980
I'll see what else

84
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,700
Tacky

85
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,060
Hypocritical

86
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,700
This doesn't reflect my excellence at all.

87
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,420
Appreciate the taste

88
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,180
Please give me the best one.

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,820
boss

90
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,340
You don't know as much about Miss Qin Ziqing as I do from Baidu

91
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,100
You are the one who is in love with him. Can you try to recall what he likes?

92
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,400
oh

93
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,260
He likes flowers

94
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,840
There is a sea of ​​roses in the park

95
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,640
This is the blooming season

96
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,720
All over the mountains

97
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,220
The scene must be spectacular.

98
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,140
I heard it's a great place to confess your love

99
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,820
As long as you confess your feelings in this place, everything will go well.

100
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,620
This is what you call holy land.

101
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,220
oops

102
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,260
Where is the holy place?

103
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,360
ah

104
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,300
At their feet.

105
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,340
The sea of ​​flowers you mentioned

106
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,980
Flower Sea Tweed

107
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,140
Ah, doesn't this just prove that confession here is very effective?

108
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,920
Look at this place, there are so many people

109
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
I hate crowded places.

110
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,280
Are you looking at the people or the scenery? Look, this person seems to be Gu Shijun.

111
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,100
It's Gu Shijun. It's Gu Shijun. It's him.

112
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,020
Ahhh

113
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,720
ah

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,840
ah

115
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,280
ah

116
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,600
ah

117
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,360
Where to go

118
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,480
Be

119
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,220
This place is so weird.

120
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,100
How about we hide somewhere else?

121
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,640
But there are so many people outside and if I run out I will be recognized

122
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,960
Let's hide here for a while, boss.

123
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,700
You're not scared, are you?

124
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,300
How could I be afraid?

125
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,700
I, Gu Shijun, have never been afraid.

126
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,940
I have acted in more than a dozen horror movies. Will I be scared if they become popular?

127
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
Um

128
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,220
What kind of haunted house is this?

129
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,860
There's nothing to be afraid of, right?

130
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,460
Don't be afraid

131
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm just afraid that you'll be scared

132
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,900
So come and protect me.

133
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,080
It's okay. This haunted house is too fake.

134
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,880
It doesn't matter

135
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,860
Brother is walking in front

136
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,180
Just follow me.

137
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,060
Ahahahahaha

138
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:16,420
You and I will walk behind you to protect you, you walk in front, okay?

139
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,180
Can't see, can ...

140
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,440
Invisible

141
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,820
Hey, hey, hey, it's ok, I'm out

142
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,140
Out

143
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,000
ah

144
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,980
Scared me

145
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,380
Scared me

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm scared to death.

147
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,520
Please wait here for a moment. I'll go over there and see if anyone has left.

148
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,900
Wait a minute.

149
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,380
How do you hang up on me?

150
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,380
If you are any later, you won't be able to watch the lecture on the age of dinosaurs.

151
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,580
Where did you go, town?

152
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,720
Yesterday's event

153
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,780
Thank you

154
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,920
I got two tickets for the paleontology lecture

155
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,080
Do you have the time

156
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,940
Let's go listen together.

157
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,340
I'm working with my boss, don't bother me

158
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,020
Gu Chijun obviously didn't film any scenes today and didn't receive any notices.

159
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,100
Why spend your time then?

160
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,860
This person is too much

161
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,780
Otherwise, I'll transfer you away from him.

162
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,920
You just want to transfer Xu Zhen away from me.

163
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,020
Haha, do you know who is Xu Zhen's boss now?

164
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,960
Gu Chijun is the best boss in the world

165
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,840
Intelligent, gentle and considerate

166
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,760
Handsome

167
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,740
Extraordinary charm

168
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,020
Working with him is the greatest happiness in the world

169
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,940
You better mind your own business.

170
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,540
How do I answer the phone? Who are you?

171
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,620
Gu Shijun Bar

172
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,020
How did you get Xiaozhen's phone number?

173
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,100
You are outside

174
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,000
Where are you

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,540
Why did you take Xiaozhen out?

176
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,220
do not you know

177
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,220
Taking care of the celebrity boss's health is also part of the assistant's job

178
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,700
Where are you and why does the sound so strange?

179
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,900
As an excellent actor

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,500
Before every performance, I have to experience life and understand the characters.

181
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,360
Of course, an amateur producer like you won't understand.

182
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,060
Experience Life

183
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,860
I think you guys went to the haunted house to experience life.

184
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,240
Gu Shijun, you actually dared to pretend to be sick and kidnap Xiaozhen

185
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,540
Can't come to the haunted house if you're sick?

186
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,560
I am honing my mind and practicing my acting skills.

187
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,260
Besides, where I take my assistant is none of your business.

188
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,920
Don't call Xu Zhen again.

189
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,620
You call me once, I hang up once

190
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,300
stay home

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,820
Did someone just call me?

192
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,780
Ah, it was a harassing call. I have hung up for you.

193
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,180
I've already watched that part. The people in that part have already left. We can go out now. Okay.

194
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,320
Assistant

195
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,940
This confession plan was a complete failure. Shouldn't you reflect on yourself?

196
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,860
Let so many people influence the plan

197
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,500
My foot was seriously injured.

198
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,460
They still force me to take screenshots.

199
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,220
Force me to have plastic surgery

200
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,540
Even forced me to accompany drinking

201
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,660
Doing it in my heart

202
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,140
We are just a tool to make money.

203
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,220
What time is it?

204
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,860
What time is it? Why haven't you come out yet?

205
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,860
Ah, this is also your good, why don't you come?

206
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,300
Ah, it's coming, hurry up, hurry up, hahaha

207
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,080
Gaia is suspected of owing one person’s salary

208
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,560
Is this true?

209
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Does your company provide training for each individual?

210
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,880
I heard that slapping and corporal punishment often occur.

211
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,240
How do you explain this?

212
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
Would you force someone to have plastic surgery?

213
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,420
Did Li Qianer have surgery on her nose because shareholders were dissatisfied?

214
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,420
As a leading company in the film and television industry, Gaiya unexpectedly broke out in such a scandal

215
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,840
How are you accountable to the public?

216
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,760
why are you not replying

217
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,100
Is there an engine in it?

218
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,840
Director Liu, please answer my question

219
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,320
Director Liu, please answer our questions directly

220
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,340
Director Liu, please answer our questions directly so that we can achieve today's success.

221
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,800
It’s all the hard work of our employees.

222
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Changed

223
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,300
Any attack against us with ulterior motives

224
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,180
We will never tolerate

225
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,500
We must get to the bottom of this

226
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,940
I don't know where these so-called pains come from

227
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,800
But I believe that kind and simple Li Xianer is innocent

228
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,340
I brought him up by myself.

229
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,460
I know him

230
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,900
There must be a third party doing this deliberately.

231
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,540
Our public security team held an emergency meeting to discuss

232
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,680
I found several artists under Gaia

233
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,860
Let them stand up for the company

234
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,460
Find a few more news media to publicize that Gaia started from scratch

235
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,300
Change the company's image

236
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,580
But what is that

237
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,940
But currently no media outlet is willing to read our PR releases.

238
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,820
Worse

239
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,780
We have worked with some great media before.

240
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,260
Now, to avoid suspicion

241
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,380
He won't speak for us.

242
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,180
Current concerns

243
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,460
very dangerous

244
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,019
This is the solution you came up with.

245
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,500
I don't want to complain for you.

246
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,780
I don't want to know how bad this is.

247
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,940
I want a solution

248
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,080
Why

249
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,860
Mr. Lin, please don't be angry.

250
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,139
The media is driven by Simon

251
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,260
The company has such a big problem

252
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,780
There is no good solution at the moment

253
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,660
This is understandable.

254
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,440
so

255
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,820
The company had a lot of public relations crises before, and they were all well resolved.

256
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,700
Today's matter

257
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,820
I want to hear your opinion

258
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,620
This happened

259
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,420
It must have something to do with my previous role.

260
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,940
I am reflecting

261
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,460
I would also like to hear the opinions of shareholders.

262
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,960
No, I think this might not be good for my mom.

263
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,100
I always feel like this, but

264
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,460
Everything is ready, okay?

265
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,660
Now that the fire has started

266
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,380
Let him burn more vigorously.

267
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,100
Director Jiang, I heard that you have a new play coming out soon.

268
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,220
What actors have been chosen?

269
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,640
Please give me a chance

270
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,900
We have always had good cooperation before.

271
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,340
There will be no problem with Gaia.

272
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,580
All right

273
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,660
Li Qianer, is your acting career over just like that?

274
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,360
Hello

275
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,460
Hello, you are

276
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,460
Is it Director Wang?

277
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,180
I particularly like your play

278
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,540
Do you have a suitable role for me?

279
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,420
Really

280
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,180
I have time recently.

281
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,180
Tomorrow

282
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,660
At Yuedu Hotel

283
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,140
OK OK

284
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,900
See you then.

285
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,320
elder brother

286
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,160
I just saw the news report about Li Qianer

287
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,560
Saying that our company exploits artists

288
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,520
what happened

289
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,460
Domineering, just been losing temper

290
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,700
What's wrong? Dad is mad at you.

291
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,280
That's not the case.

292
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,200
But I haven't seen my dad so angry in a long time. Is this matter serious?

293
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,460
It's okay, don't worry.

294
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,960
Just ignore the rumors like this.

295
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,700
It will calm down after a while.

296
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,740
Don't let this affect your shooting.

297
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,780
Are you really okay?

298
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,740
Then I'll go talk to the executive producer about tomorrow's progress. Come on,

299
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,060
Sister Qing, your family was not well off when you were a child.

300
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,860
My father is a craftsman.

301
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,460
I usually do some small business

302
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,000
The business situation is not particularly good.

303
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,840
Although life is hard

304
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,660
But the atmosphere at home is very problematic.

305
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,300
But there is a hotel not far from home.

306
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,180
That hotel is like a castle.

307
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,420
Every time my father took me past that place on his bike

308
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
He would tell me a story.

309
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,980
he told me

310
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,420
I'm a princess

311
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,100
And that hotel is my castle

312
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,620
One day

313
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,540
The castle gate will open to me

314
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,500
If I get married one day

315
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,380
I particularly hope to hold my wedding in that hotel

316
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,540
Castle Princess

317
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,940
In self-awakening

318
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,020
The most important things are these

319
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,440
Dad

320
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,200
I told you last time

321
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,100
You must take a good rest later

322
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,240
Don't keep doing this

323
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,860
Why don't you always listen?

324
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,940
Hi

325
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,460
I'm afraid I don't have much time left.

326
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,120
I put him together.

327
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,720
In the days to come

328
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,500
Let him accompany you more

329
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,900
Dad, don't say that.

330
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,020
I don't want you to say that

331
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,060
You will be absolutely fine.

332
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,760
Come on girl

333
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,980
Come to Daddy

334
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,940
My daughter

335
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,500
In this world

336
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,940
actually

337
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,020
The most important thing is not to be alive

338
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,580
It's love

339
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,220
My whole life

340
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,380
Got a lot of love

341
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,260
Someone you love deeply

342
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,020
There is also a dear belonging to you

343
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,340
My whole life

344
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,260
Doing what I love

345
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,300
I feel very satisfied

346
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,100
Very happy too

347
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,660
So don't feel sad for me.

348
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,100
I think you are very strong these days.

349
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,380
I know you have an expectation in your heart

350
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,820
Just looking forward to

351
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,260
Dad will get better one day.

352
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,900
But the child

353
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,140
You've grown up

354
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,140
Learn to accept

355
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,700
Not everyone's expectations can become reality.

356
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,820
Dad wants you to grow up.

357
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,060
Especially after I left

358
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,340
I hope you

359
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,340
To be able to live a truly strong life

360
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,780
With dad's love for you

361
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,620
Do you also have a fondness for your father?

362
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,020
Okay, okay, don't cry, don't cry

363
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,520
How about it

364
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,820
What do you think of this place?

365
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,460
You want to bring him to the hotel.

366
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,700
How can you have such dirty thoughts?

367
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,700
Oh, is this

368
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,340
Ah Qin Ziqing's favorite hotel

369
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
What's the point of playing so many tricks?

370
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,300
In the end, I have to take action

371
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,420
There are warm memories of childhood here

372
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,740
And his little girl's sweet dream

373
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,140
It blends perfectly with my old love

374
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,500
Make him feel that I belong to him all his life, hehe

375
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,500
So what do I need to do next?

376
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,780
Romantic, elegant and stylish

377
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,700
This time, no matter what, I have to get over this feeling.

378
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,460
You remember

379
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,860
Don't tell anyone about what happened today, understand?

380
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,740
Hey where are you going?

381
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,220
Of course there are more important things to do.

382
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,820
Hello

383
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,780
Uh, there's some equipment over there in the factory that needs your stunt team to go over and take a look, okay?

384
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,540
It's up to you to witness the love moment between me and Ziqing

385
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,180
Someone come quickly

386
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,660
Miss Li

387
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,340
Hello, Miss Asia

388
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,440
Mr. Shi Ju, I have some personal questions that I would like to discuss with you in private.

389
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,460
I don't know if you have time.

390
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,620
You go wait for me first.

391
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,880
I guess there's nothing left for him and I to talk about.

392
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,520
Uh, Miss Qin

393
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,100
I have to say that I really admire your serious and responsible attitude towards work

394
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,880
I know very well

395
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,100
City of Time is also a very important project for you.

396
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,580
But frankly speaking

397
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,820
The reason why Shijun signed the contract with City of Time was entirely because of you.

398
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,900
I believe you don't want to see him bring too much personal feelings to the City of Time.

399
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
So as to bring trouble to the City of Time

400
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,160
Is it right

401
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,760
No matter what you think or what you think about him, let's sit down and have a good chat.

402
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,380
Separate the problem

403
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,360
This might be good for everyone's work.

404
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,420
what do you think

405
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,180
thank you

406
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,220
Okay, okay, we'll be there soon.

407
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,660
Oh, I'm sorry.

408
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,980
What's wrong with him? Does he need help?

409
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,620
It's ok, I just drank too much

410
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,640
Ziqiang

411
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,660
The whole world knows that you are my favorite person

412
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,420
Destined

413
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,820
We should be together

414
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,860
I know there are a lot of misunderstandings between us.

415
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,980
I also have a lot of things I do poorly.

416
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,100
I didn't have fame before

417
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,420
No status

418
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,380
Can't give you the life you want

419
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,660
Now I am working hard

420
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,900
Success

421
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,100
Ziqing, I can give you the life you want.

422
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,900
I remember you once said

423
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,460
I want to hold a princess-like wedding in this place.

424
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,020
So I choose to confess to you here

425
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,700
I also decided to propose to you here

426
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,140
When you like me

427
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,820
I do not like you

428
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,460
When you fell in love with me

429
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,420
I like you

430
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,220
When you left me

431
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,820
I'm in love with you

432
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,680
Purple

433
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,100
Give me another chance, please

434
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,100
Gu Shijun

435
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,660
Do you really think that I broke up with you because you weren't famous or popular?

436
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,060
of course not

437
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,900
You keep saying you love me

438
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,700
But do you really understand what love is?

439
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,900
Do you still remember the movie about Kashima three years ago?

440
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,380
I begged him to get you an audition opportunity, but what about you?

441
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,500
Just saw it off if you don't like it.

442
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,180
But you know

443
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,080
I waited in the rain for three hours for this opportunity

444
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,100
I had a high fever for half a month.

445
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,780
Have you ever taken care of me for a day?

446
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,060
Then why didn't you tell me what you were supposed to tell me

447
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,040
Some things need to be carefully observed

448
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,540
Don't wait for others to tell you everything.

449
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,500
You've been pestering me since you returned to China.

450
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,300
But have you ever thought about

451
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,640
What will happen to me if I am photographed by a reporter?

452
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,500
Have you ever thought about me?

453
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,100
I'm not like this the first time you date me

454
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,820
You played your winning video

455
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,060
the second time

456
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,500
You stole my car keys

457
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,840
Today you tricked me here again to see how you act cool

458
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,700
Do you really think this is the right attitude to redeem yourself?

459
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,740
In the year I've been with you, I've never been truly happy for a single day

460
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,380
Gu Shijun, please stop saying you love me

461
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,020
A childish and selfish person like you

462
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,420
You don't know what love is

463
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,020
I was rejected again

464
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,700
Why did he come here if he was going to reject me?

465
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,220
Because of

466
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,020
I told him that as long as he comes today, you won't bother him anymore.

467
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,460
Zhang Shiyu, how can you slander my feelings like this?

468
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,980
How can you slander me than slander you?

469
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,080
World, look at what you are like now

470
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,420
How can you have a heartbroken attitude?

471
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,440
And what Qin Ziqing said is quite right

472
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,239
You just can't let go of your face

473
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,499
Please wake up

474
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,820
Stop fooling yourself, okay?

475
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,100
Does sadness have to show on your face?

476
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,699
Do you know how heartbroken I am?

477
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:37,559
What

478
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:39,139
Wait a moment

479
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,680
There are notifications from you all day today

480
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,580
If you don't leave now, you'll be late.

481
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,520
Um

482
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,580
Please ask for leave from the crew and tell them I won't be going this year. Why?

483
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,340
ah

484
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:22,380
I didn't get enough rest last night

485
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,500
I have some dark circles under my eyes today

486
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,780
I am a person who strives for perfection

487
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,900
How could such an imperfect image appear in the camera?

488
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,700
It's not my style.

489
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,580
I have to call Director Liang right away.

490
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,820
ah

491
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,660
What causes dark circles?

492
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,460
I think you are suffering from embarrassment cancer

493
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,380
What's embarrassing?

494
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
What embarrassing

495
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,820
Where's the embarrassment?

496
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,620
I am in pain from a broken heart, do you understand?

497
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,500
I didn't sleep last night

498
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,920
Why did Miss Qin hit the nail on the head? You don't dare to face him, right?

499
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,020
Don't worry, there is no announcement from Miss Qin today.

500
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:13,500
Xu Zhen immediately married him to the room to change clothes. If he didn't change clothes, he would be late.

501
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,280
Don't talk to me today.

502
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,680
Oh, then how do I report to you?

503
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,040
Can't you write?

504
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,500
Oh, what about the script?

505
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,300
I've already prepared the script.

506
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,220
The boss is in a really low mood today.

507
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,140
Humph, you're not trying hard enough.

508
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,100
He is not a business opportunity at all. I tell you, he just can't afford to lose face.

509
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,020
You see how sad I am

510
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,900
Wow

511
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,800
The eyes have improved

512
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,620
let me tell you

513
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,060
You have to keep this state when we shoot later, okay?

514
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,780
Hello

515
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,620
Oh, express delivery.

516
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,220
Well, you can put it at the front desk.

517
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,540
What does it mean to give me a reason to forget the language you loved me so much

518
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,640
Are you mocking me?

519
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,020
Change my ringtone now.

520
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,020
ah

521
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,620
Why is it Apple's default ringtone?

522
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,620
Are you acknowledging that I'm heartbroken?

523
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,220
Then Mr. Gu, please put on your makeup quickly, it will start soon.

524
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,060
Can you take a break?

525
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,180
Why

526
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,040
Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong with you?

527
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,460
Hey, what's wrong? Isn't Jin Ziqin Messi today?

528
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,920
Well

529
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,260
Ah, I just received a notification.

530
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,400
The shooting cycle is relatively tight

531
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,420
Let's shoot them together today and finish them quickly.

532
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,180
You two are teaming up to deceive me now, right?

533
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,300
Uh no, haha

534
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,940
Haha Boss

535
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,420
But you have to work, you can't live without seeing him forever

536
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,880
Why

537
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,900
Hey, hey, hey, boss, what's wrong with you?

538
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,260
My stomach hurts so much. I was fine just now. Why do I suddenly feel uncomfortable? I think I ate too many oysters yesterday.

539
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,940
Eat oysters early in the morning

540
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,660
ah

541
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,620
Oh no, it might be food poisoning

542
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,860
Wait a minute.

543
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,980
Hey, go eat.

544
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,460
No no no no no no, I'm going to the studio, I'm going to the studio

545
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,160
ah

546
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,700
Oh, is it him? Is it him?

547
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,860
Hey, it's him, it's him

548
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,620
When did this happen?

549
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,820
What's going on

550
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,320
Hey, you came out well.

551
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,200
Run to the back

552
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,920
May I ask when did the song "You are the one behind Director Wang" start?

553
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,320
Is this related to Director Wang's information?

554
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,120
How do you feel about interfering in other people's marriages?

555
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,460
Excuse me, you are the guide for taking photos, so he only uses dry and dumb?

556
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
I wonder if these are all hype planned by Dumb?

557
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,680
Including your directions and this inspection

558
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,120
Do you think lightning can answer us?

559
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,460
Don't be nervous, miss, step back.

560
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,740
You said that Li Qianer has this incident again.

561
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,820
How will this make the outside world view us Gaia?

562
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,400
Don't they think that we, Gaia, are the only ones with moral problems?

563
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,580
Yes, Gaia has been in so much negative news recently.

564
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,620
We can no longer sit idly by.

565
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,080
Waiting for media attention to shift

566
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,700
Be proactive

567
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,660
Everyone here

568
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,700
Is there any good solution?

569
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,860
Otherwise

570
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,100
Let's deal with the media.

571
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,500
Give them some benefits

572
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,420
Then find a way to be red

573
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,840
Now Li Xian's affairs have become the focus of everyone's attention

574
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,620
Everyone's eyes are on that.

575
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,100
Now spend money to buy

576
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,820
Once things fail

577
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,700
It will make things worse

578
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,140
I have an idea

579
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,180
I don't know if it's appropriate

580
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,560
What

581
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,340
Why don't we stand up and apologize?

582
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,460
This is Li Qianer's private matter.

583
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,420
Our company was greatly affected by this.

584
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,900
Why should we apologize?

585
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,900
Because Li Qian'er is Gaia's artist after all.

586
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,500
Although this matter is his private matter

587
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,340
But it had a very bad impact on the public.

588
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,020
I think we should set an example for the media

589
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,620
Let everyone know

590
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,720
We should not only have the responsibility but also the obligation to handle this matter well.

591
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,940
We are not afraid of the dirty water thrown by others

592
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,340
A scandal caused by one person

593
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,140
We also dare to take responsibility

594
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,540
But if we really stand up, we won't be afraid

595
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,180
Of course there are risks in taking action.

596
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,700
But I think it's worth a try

597
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,180
Besides, Director Chu Wenzhong and I have some personal relationship

598
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,540
I would like to persuade him to admit his mistakes.

599
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,420
This matter is not only about the interests of the company

600
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,980
More about the company's fertility

601
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,220
As an industry leader

602
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,300
We believe that we should establish good moral values ​​for the public

603
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,140
It is our unshirkable obligation

604
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,820
I think we should have responsibilities, obligations and more responsibility.

605
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,700
Set a good example for the public
