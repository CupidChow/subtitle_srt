1
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,740
The pain of time cannot be seen with one eye

2
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
Jinyang

3
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,980
I heard the chairman just announced

4
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,180
I want to send your brother to be the producer of City of Time.

5
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,440
You've put so much into this project.

6
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,620
It took three years to prepare

7
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,340
He does this

8
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,580
Maybe that's a bit unfair.

9
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,700
we are brothers

10
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,760
What is fair or unfair between brothers?

11
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,940
Besides, Xiaoxiu just came back from abroad.

12
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,980
I am not familiar with Gaia's nights.

13
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,300
The City of Time is a very good opportunity to exercise

14
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,380
I can also teach him.

15
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,500
Jinyang, you are really a perfect man

16
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,780
I want to tell the world

17
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,740
This perfect man

18
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,860
That's my boyfriend

19
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,100
Let's eat the food

20
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,300
The food is cold

21
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,700
In fact, recently

22
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,660
Gu Chijun has been chasing me

23
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,340
I heard you weren't boyfriend and girlfriend before?

24
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,700
He does this

25
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,820
I don't think it's strange.

26
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,620
I trust you

27
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,900
Just do as you see fit.

28
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,060
But recently, gossip and entertainment have been following my love life very closely.

29
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,780
Otherwise, let's make this public as soon as possible.

30
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,380
It will also save you from a lot of troubles in the future.

31
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,900
It's better to keep a low profile on emotional matters.

32
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,700
Why tell the world?

33
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,420
Besides, you are now Gaia's number one sister

34
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,260
If it is announced, it will have a huge impact on the company.

35
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,860
Let's wait a little longer.

36
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,940
This can't be eaten

37
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,420
Oh my god, Gu Shijun

38
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,420
Am I not dreaming?

39
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
How come he came to us?

40
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,220
I must have seen it wrong.

41
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,180
Hello everyone, I am Gu ShijunGu Shijun

42
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,420
Oh my god, it's a Gucci drama

43
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,240
My daughter is your biggest fan.

44
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,740
Can you give me a signed photo?

45
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,060
No problem, but I want to ask you for a favor.

46
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,480
Do you have any questions?

47
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,860
My assistant accidentally broke your prop dinosaur.

48
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,220
We'll be using this prop at tomorrow's press conference. The dinosaur is very important.

49
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,420
So could you please work overtime today and make another one?

50
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,840
I know you guys are working hard.

51
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,880
I will treat everyone to dinner tomorrow

52
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,700
Then give everyone a small gift

53
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,680
How do you guys see it?

54
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,500
OK, I will go and ask for help from a matchmaker now. Thank you.

55
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,240
I'm already in the parking lot

56
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,580
No parking space found

57
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,280
okay, I get it

58
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,160
I suggest you go downstairs.

59
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,500
Go up immediately

60
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,160
Hey, Chi Jun's press conference is about to start, but the styling hasn't been done yet

61
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,980
It will be too late if you don't come now

62
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,340
I know, I'm here.

63
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,020
I'll take a nap in the car and then go up right away

64
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,340
what happened

65
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,180
How come it suddenly got better?

66
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,980
I can't get out if I park my car randomly.

67
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,760
Ah, Mr. Gu

68
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,300
My model is fixed.

69
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,380
It's not good to repair it.

70
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,900
What time

71
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,120
Has the vehicle I need arrived?

72
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,260
I see

73
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,020
Send directly

74
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,660
ah

75
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,340
It was so broken at the beginning

76
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,700
How come it's the same as new now?

77
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,360
Xu Shan

78
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,260
You repaired

79
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,840
Actually, I'm also weird.

80
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,200
I was still a mess when I fell asleep last night.

81
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,860
I woke up this morning and it got better.

82
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,020
You're still not happy after it's been fixed

83
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,700
Do you want to leave?

84
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,460
The press conference is about to begin

85
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,700
As my assistant, why don't you go and see if there is anything I need to prepare?

86
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,740
Okay, I'll go right away.

87
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,620
oops

88
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,220
Hey, Shijun, um

89
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,260
You said he broke so much that day

90
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,980
How come it was fixed overnight?

91
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,540
Why do you want him to leave?

92
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,100
How dare I do that without me?

93
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,760
I see. Huh.

94
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,100
Someone doesn't want him to go.

95
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,320
Hey, you're right, right?

96
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,460
Call me Junjun

97
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,400
Hello, Director Liang

98
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,160
it is known

99
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,860
The City of Time is a large-scale action-adventure film about exploring prehistoric creatures on a mysterious island

100
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,820
而您呢一直是以细腻温婉的文艺片著称的导演

101
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,000
Then I also understand that you had a life experience related to excavating ancient fossils.

102
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,420
So is the subject you chose this time related to your experience?

103
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,100
Um

104
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,580
I've had this experience before.

105
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,820
It was a very beautiful time in my life.

106
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:32,340
I was deeply touched by the kindness of those paleontologists and their pursuit of science.

107
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,580
So I want to show you this side of them.

108
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:42,380
I hope this movie can help everyone understand this unknown industry.

109
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,760
And these kind and lovely people

110
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,740
In addition, I also introduced new elements such as science fiction adventure in this new movie.

111
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,340
It’s also a new challenge for me.

112
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,120
Thank you leadership

113
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,540
Looking forward to your excellent work

114
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,300
Mr. Gu Chijun, the image you showed us on the screen before was always a handsome male god.

115
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,940
But in this film you play a professor of ancient sociology

116
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,540
What do you think of this difference in role positioning?

117
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,520
first

118
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,420
I am an actor

119
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,300
For an actor

120
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,260
No fixed role positioning

121
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,340
Naturally there is no difference

122
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,060
But in order to play this role in the City of Time

123
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,140
I need to acquire some knowledge in some professional fields.

124
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,100
For example, learn about the daily life of paleontologists and their work content and methods.

125
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,140
In order to achieve the effect of being influenced by what you see and hear

126
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,460
I also specially invited a student from the Department of Paleontology

127
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,700
Be my assistant

128
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,360
Hello Mr. Lin Jingxiu, I heard that you just returned to China and had no experience in this field.

129
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,080
So, I became the producer of this film.

130
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,300
Do you feel a lot of pressure?

131
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,960
There is also a film called "City of Time" which involves a lot of virtual scenes about prehistoric creatures.

132
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,360
The fusion of virtual and real is the biggest selling point of this film.

133
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,740
This has resulted in a surge in production budgets.

134
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,500
I would like to ask how you balance this matter?

135
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,660
Ahhh

136
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,420
I will answer this question

137
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,380
The City of Time is Gaia's annual drama

138
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,180
So we spent a long time preparing for this.

139
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,019
There is only one goal

140
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,140
Make a truly sincere work

141
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,380
As for the question you just raised

142
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,700
We want to make a really good movie.

143
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,660
So we've reached out to the digital team in Hollywood.

144
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,620
Built a virtual scene

145
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,120
And we will go through a month of rehearsal

146
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,820
To achieve the best viewing effect

147
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,580
OK, thanks

148
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,280
Mr. Lin, what about the City of Time project?

149
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,560
You have been in charge since the beginning of the idea

150
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,280
And you have invested a lot of experience in it

151
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,240
Why did you suddenly change to your brother?

152
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,820
Can you explain this?

153
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,380
City of Time is a project of Gaia Corporation

154
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,540
I'm not the only one

155
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,300
Xiao Xiu, he is my brother

156
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,460
I know him very well.

157
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,040
I feel very relieved to have him as the producer

158
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,580
And I will spare no effort to help him

159
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,220
I hope you

160
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,380
Give him more help

161
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,540
thank you all

162
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,300
Why did you change Lin Jinxiu to be the producer?

163
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,500
It's a good idea to change the producer

164
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,980
do not understand anything

165
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,800
Didn't you hear what Mr. Lin said?

166
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,280
Lin Jinxiu is his younger brother. They are the same as brothers.

167
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,660
Can this be the same?

168
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,640
ah

169
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,520
No experience at all

170
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,320
Wouldn't it be better to give such a big project as the City of Time to him?

171
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,560
Yes, yes, Boss Gu, your analysis is correct.

172
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,100
Who can be as profound as you, right?

173
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,400
correct

174
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,220
Go down and drive my car out.

175
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,620
In front of the car next to me

176
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,900
why why

177
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,920
Parking randomly without any sense of public morality

178
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,300
I have to teach him a lesson.

179
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
Can't you just talk to him nicely and that's it?

180
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,360
Why do you have to block the traffic?

181
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,840
How can I not experience it myself?

182
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,400
Can you empathize?

183
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,860
I'm doing this for his own good.

184
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,840
You go down first

185
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,980
There's no need for this. Boss Gu, go now.

186
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,960
OK

187
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,980
I can't do anything about you.

188
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,340
When that person comes down, give me a call. Got it.

189
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,860
Director Liang

190
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,060
I heard everything that was said in the press conference.

191
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,700
The male lead is

192
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,380
Researcher at the Institute of Bone and Spine and Paleoanthropology

193
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,340
Engaged in the research of Mesozoic dinosaur fossils and related stratigraphy

194
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,460
The main research direction is the morphology of horned dinosaurs

195
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,100
Taxonomy and phylogeny Bird origins

196
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,020
The male protagonist, Mom, is clearly the incarnation of Dad.

197
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,440
I see

198
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,580
It turns out that the City of Time has such a meaning to you.

199
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,420
It symbolizes all the happy times we have together as a family.

200
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,140
You said before that you didn't want to see me again

201
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,740
I don't want to have anything to do with my father anymore.

202
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,060
I think this isn't true, right?

203
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,300
I don't know what happened 8 years ago.

204
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,980
You left me and my dad.

205
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,540
But I think you must have your own reasons.

206
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,540
I have fixed the dinosaur model

207
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,960
I have also obtained permission from Mr. Gu Chijun.

208
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,700
You can officially stay.

209
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,020
Me and Dad

210
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,860
I will always wait for your mother

211
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,900
Waiting for the day of reunion

212
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,300
Then I'll go first

213
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,020
Goodbye, Mom

214
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,440
Xiao Rui

215
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,820
How is the arrangement I asked you to transfer Professor Xu to another hospital?

216
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,020
Is it arranged?

217
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,460
I've called Dr. Zhang and everything has been arranged.

218
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,060
okay, I get it

219
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,660
Excuse me, is this car yours?

220
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,140
Uh, no.

221
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,660
But someone asked me to stop here.

222
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,940
Please move aside. My car can't get out like this.

223
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,340
But I can't leave

224
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,780
How about this, you wait a moment, the owner will be down soon, okay?

225
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,740
Hey, let's go

226
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,740
This is your car, right?

227
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,140
Why stop here?

228
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,340
I can't get out if you stop here.

229
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,140
Why stop here?

230
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,660
You should ask yourself.

231
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,580
Have you ever considered other people's feelings when you park your car randomly in the morning?

232
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,940
It's your car that's blocking the road this morning.

233
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,380
Sorry, I didn't pay attention because I was in a hurry this morning.

234
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,420
Sorry, forget it?

235
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,380
You are the only one in urgent need. Are others not in urgent need?

236
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,860
Do you know that you are being irresponsible?

237
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,940
It may delay other people's important matters.

238
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,900
I am wrong

239
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,340
But you're not good.

240
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,280
If you have anything to say, can't you just tell me?

241
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,700
I think you have no sense of public morality.

242
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,100
Forget it, forget it.

243
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:33,420
If we all talk it out and make concessions, the problem will be solved, right?

244
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,300
As a producer, he is so unprofessional

245
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,560
I didn't expect that people are so careless.

246
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,940
Story, no wonder people call you Rex

247
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,580
Being so rude

248
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,940
What's the difference with a leopard?

249
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,620
Rex

250
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,980
How did he know my name was Rex?

251
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,660
This way of fighting

252
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,260
Just give me a nickname.

253
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,980
In fact, there is noise everywhere

254
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,940
Ouch!

255
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,100
Calm down easy easy

256
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,620
Hey, look, all your students have left.

257
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,820
Is it possible that your ideological and political class is over?

258
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,340
Looks like I have to give another person a political lesson.

259
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,500
Hello, hello, boss

260
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,500
Are you crazy?

261
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,020
Qing'er, please think about this matter carefully.

262
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,580
After all, it was Gan who brought you out.

263
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,980
When dealing with people and doing things, you should always leave some room for yourself.

264
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,240
If things get really bad, it won't be good for anyone.

265
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,600
Mr. Liu, you don't need to persuade me anymore.

266
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,920
You also know what my Gaia lives like.

267
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,900
I am a little star that everyone sees

268
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,260
But I don't know that I am suffering more than anyone else.

269
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,500
Gaia only sees us as a tool to make money

270
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,820
Never consider our feelings

271
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,180
Last time I was injured filming

272
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,700
The doctor told me to stay in bed for two months.

273
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,080
But within a week, I was allowed to participate in the live performance.

274
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,300
My ligaments haven't recovered yet.

275
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,660
We are not allowed to have any contact with the outside world.

276
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,340
Even including their own relatives

277
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,220
I haven't seen my parents for half a year.

278
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,740
I'm really tired

279
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,700
I don't want to go on like this anymore

280
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,180
But you also know

281
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,740
The contract I signed with Gaia is like a body selling tool.

282
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,500
Locked me tightly

283
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,180
I can't afford so much compensation.

284
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,500
Want to leave

285
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,260
Only by using the power of public opinion

286
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,380
I understand what you said.

287
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,260
But imagine that you are alone against a company as big as Gaia.

288
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,500
This is not an easy thing to do.

289
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,300
I think that's fine.

290
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,880
I'll go talk to Mr. Lin.

291
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,660
This matter is over.

292
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,740
I know Gaia is very powerful.

293
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,780
But I don't believe all the media are on his side

294
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,780
There must be someone willing to stand by my side

295
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,880
Mr. Liu

296
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,380
Is your asthma still not healed?

297
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,340
Come drink some water

298
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,540
Pay more attention to rest when you have time.

299
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,340
Are you okay?

300
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,140
This is an old problem of mine.

301
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,420
Qian'er, no matter what

302
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,820
I still advise you to think about it carefully

303
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,080
You know Mr. Lin.

304
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,680
He is soft-hearted and not hard-hearted.

305
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,020
He hates others to be against him.

306
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,020
Whatever you do

307
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,220
You have to think twice before you act.

308
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,860
Mr. Liu, you don't need to persuade me anymore.

309
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,140
I know what to do

310
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,820
The City of Time is a very good training opportunity for him.

311
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,460
Although it makes me feel a little sad

312
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,220
But it's also good for him to have a chance to grow.

313
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,340
But I'm worried that after doing this

314
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,700
My position in the company is no longer guaranteed.

315
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,820
Li Qing'er's affairs can no longer be covered up.

316
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,860
but

317
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,420
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

318
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,580
If it's handled well

319
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,420
This might be our chance.

320
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,700
Li Qing'er is a fire

321
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,660
We can put it out

322
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,820
Of course, you can also make it burn more vigorously

323
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,140
It depends on how we do it

324
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,660
Better for us

325
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,700
Go and arrange for Li Qianer to expose the news immediately

326
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,260
Let's satisfy Li Qian'er's wish to expose the news.

327
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,500
You are less than a woman as CEO

328
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,500
I didn't expect this to happen.

329
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,940
Is there any engine?

330
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,520
Dad, the City of Time is our Gaia's biggest project this year.

331
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,400
It was Ge who brought it up. How can you just leave it to me?

332
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,940
If I didn't do this

333
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,560
You can learn what responsibility is.

334
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,280
What is responsibility?

335
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,780
This is really unfair to me.

336
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,200
I have decided

337
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,740
It's no use what you say

338
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,860
Just do your best for me.

339
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,260
elder brother

340
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,740
What's wrong? I'm in a bad mood.

341
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,620
No, when did you come in?

342
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,000
Don't play with me.

343
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,180
I know you always play this song when you are in a bad mood

344
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,380
Don't go away depressed

345
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,860
Let's do it together

346
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,900
How about going to the boxing gym?

347
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,980
Stop, stop, stop

348
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,700
Oh, I don't want to play anymore

349
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,580
You are so awesome

350
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,460
I can't beat you at all

351
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,300
How can I be so good?

352
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,660
You only know how to attack but not how to defend

353
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,460
That'll let me see the flaws.

354
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,060
I'm telling you

355
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,580
Sometimes

356
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,900
The best defense is the best offense

357
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,520
elder brother

358
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,580
I also attended the launch of City of Time today and I know how much you think our project is worth.

359
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,980
Dad does that.

360
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,620
It's really inaccurate.

361
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,620
I'm telling you, don't talk like that.

362
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,900
Dad did this because he wanted his son to be successful.

363
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,580
Besides, what's the difference between us two brothers?

364
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,060
is not it

365
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,100
But you are the only one who has taken care of me since I was a child.

366
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,220
In the past, when I was bullied, you always helped me fight back.

367
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,460
Brother, now that I have grown up, if someone bullies you in the future

368
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,140
I will protect you just like you protected me

369
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,580
So don't worry

370
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,780
I will definitely return the City of Time project to you.

371
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,260
And protect me

372
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,480
I think you should protect yourself first.

373
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,300
Oh, I give up.

374
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,620
Hey, another round.

375
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,400
Didn't it say it opens at 8 o'clock?

376
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,280
It's 9:30, why isn't the door open yet? What's going on?

377
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,460
Yeah, this is too unreliable.

378
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,580
Come, come, come

379
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,240
What happened to you guys? Didn't you read the announcement?

380
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,900
I don't know if we're shooting a trailer today.

381
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,980
Being late by an hour and a half today is too much.

382
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,080
See the notice

383
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,500
But Mr. Kobayashi told me that today's shooting was cancelled.

384
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,880
Besides, today is the weekend

385
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,860
Open the door now

386
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,100
Director Yang opened the door

387
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,740
This annoying guy again

388
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,540
Be prepared for customers

389
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,100
Everyone put their phones on silent mode

390
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,460
keep quiet

391
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,620
Good Time City starts with a three-game match

392
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,460
The boss has a problem and can't pull it

393
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,460
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

394
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,380
Sorry, pretty boy.

395
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,400
There might be something wrong with Wei Ya's pulley.

396
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,820
We need to change the group again.

397
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,240
What did you do?

398
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,760
Didn't you check it out beforehand?

399
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,800
We also came here at short notice.

400
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,440
Xiao Ling originally said that today's shooting plan was cancelled.

401
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,100
We were not prepared in advance

402
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,860
Sorry, leader, let's solve this problem immediately.

403
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,080
Forget it

404
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,660
No more filming today.

405
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,380
You adjust your equipment.

406
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,900
We shot it right away

407
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,940
Come

408
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,060
Come here

409
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,500
Good Time City 2nd Game 2nd Interview 2nd Time

410
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,220
If you want to escape

411
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,899
You have to stay with me, understand?

412
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,240
Put down everything in your hands

413
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,580
Come to me, come quickly

414
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,740
I found out this morning

415
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,100
No one is working

416
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,780
The thing I hate most is

417
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,380
Working with a group of unprofessional people

418
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,980
In this crew

419
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,380
If something like this happens again

420
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,180
Please leave on your own accord

421
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,980
So Ms. Xu Zhen

422
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,900
You leave the crew now.

423
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,660
I don't want to see you again when I'm shooting

424
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,740
Uh, Mr. Yang, I hope you can listen to my explanation

425
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,260
Keep shooting

426
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,400
Hello Mr. Kobayashi

427
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,560
Come here quickly

428
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,780
Xu Zhen is in trouble

429
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,420
Natural Selection

430
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,300
Survival of the Fittest

431
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,620
These are the codes hidden in the animal's genes.

432
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,160
pass

433
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,800
What's wrong, Mr. Liang?

434
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,340
Yeah, that's it.

435
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,700
I think this scene needs some rethinking.

436
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Do you think there is something wrong with my performance?

437
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,060
You acted very well and you are very charming

438
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,260
Which point

439
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,700
Something is wrong

440
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,500
What exactly is the problem?

441
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,420
I can't really tell what I mean.

442
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,300
Anyway, it's not the same as the archaeologist I imagined.

443
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,740
So how to adjust it?

444
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,180
I think I'll go back and think about it and then tell you

445
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,260
It's about time. I think I'll just stop here for today.

446
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,300
It's a good job.

447
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,820
Uh, good morning, Xu Zhen. Let's have dinner together.

448
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,580
I want to apologize to Liang Dao first.

449
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,020
You should apologize first.

450
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,340
let's go

451
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,320
gentlemen

452
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,840
Hello sir, hello, hello, hello

453
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,580
How was that prop that day?

454
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,260
No problem, right?

455
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,680
No problem, thanks to you.

456
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,580
Oh, I should thank you for letting me bring so many people to visit the set.

457
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,240
This is my daughter

458
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,200
He's your biggest fan.

459
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,160
He hasn't missed any of your plays.

460
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,240
Watched them all

461
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,780
Hahahaha, he came to take a photo with his idol.

462
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Thank you very much.

463
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,300
You're welcome, Mr. Gu.

464
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,620
This is my second aunt

465
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,460
He likes you very much. Can you sign an autograph for him? Yes, yes, I really admire your work.

466
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,060
Can you recommend me one, bro?

467
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,720
I'm going to ask everyone to wait until we finish eating and then come one by one, okay?

468
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,960
Come on, everyone, be quiet for a moment.

469
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,200
Let Mr. Gu eat first and then we can sign, okay?

470
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,140
Okay, okay, everyone, please go away.

471
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,580
Hey, thank you

472
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,840
Oops, after all this time, it was you who asked someone to repair the road that Xu Zhen damaged.

473
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,580
Why did you return the book so resolutely that you dared not admit it?

474
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,100
And he insisted on firing Xu Zhen

475
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,660
I am strict with him.

476
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,060
But essentially

477
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,280
I am also a good boss who cares about my employees.

478
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,100
What is compassion for employees?

479
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,460
Why didn't I find any compassion for me?

480
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,900
The traditional virtue of the Chinese nation is to do good deeds without leaving a name.

481
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,620
You have to feel my love for you from every little bit of life

482
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,780
Hehehe

483
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,980
Hey Xiaojuan

484
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,820
Why don't you go eat?

485
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,140
Ah, my phone rang when I was shooting just now

486
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,680
The leader is very unhappy

487
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,300
I want to apologize to him first.

488
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,460
You are also thinking about this question

489
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,660
Tomorrow Aunt Liang

490
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,820
Why don't you let Xu Zheng go to eat?

491
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,400
Kobayashi's crew is the working environment

492
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,300
Please call me Good Guide

493
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,460
Besides, I didn't stop him from eating.

494
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,420
I just asked him to reflect on the mistakes he made today.

495
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,020
Xu Zheng, go eat.

496
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,580
Mr. Kobayashi is just as I just said.

497
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,380
The crew is a workplace

498
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,940
No one should forget their professional identity.

499
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,280
I want to remind you here.

500
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,900
As a producer

501
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,420
What you should care about is how to mobilize the maximum resources to support the work of the crew.

502
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,860
Instead of asking me how to manage the crew members

503
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,420
Frankly speaking, I am very disappointed and angry about what happened today.

504
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,740
What I can't tolerate the most is working with a group of unprofessional people

505
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,540
I hope what happened today is the last time

506
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,400
Cool, I think.

507
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,160
There's nothing worth your effort today.

508
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,740
If you really have any other suggestions or dissatisfaction,

509
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,900
You can report it to the company

510
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,740
I can't make the decision here and tell you that it won't happen again next time.

511
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,460
I'll take your suggestion into consideration.

512
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,660
This story shows that you are really nice to your assistant.

513
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,880
He didn't blame the assistant for breaking the props

514
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,100
Just let us fix it

515
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,200
No wonder everyone calls him a warm-hearted single man.

516
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,640
Yes, for this matter, they also agreed to let us bring our family members to visit the set.

517
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,340
It's really heartwarming.
