1
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,560
Brother Wei Cheng

2
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,160
You can't go in. Brother Wei Cheng, please get out.

3
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,580
Wei Chengge

4
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,220
Let me go, let me go

5
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,500
Mr. Lin Jinqiu

6
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,780
I heard that there were some twists and turns before the crew started developing the show.

7
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,540
Is the cooperation between you and Director Liang going smoothly?

8
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,720
Ah, the cooperation with Director Liang is going very smoothly now.

9
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,340
Because "City of Time" is my first drama as a producer.

10
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,420
I also feel a great sense of responsibility

11
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,560
Of course, this is also because this is the first play

12
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,340
Many things in experience are not particularly well prepared.

13
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,420
So it caused a lot of trouble for the crew at the beginning.

14
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,520
But with the help of the two parties and my colleagues in the crew

15
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,140
I have passed this most difficult period of adjustment.

16
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,700
Now we are getting along very happily.

17
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,080
Which character do you like in Time City?

18
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,860
What do you think of this character?

19
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,580
Which character do you like most?

20
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,440
ah

21
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,340
Ah, because that's the case

22
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,040
What about the City of Time?

23
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,820
It's like my own child.

24
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,440
I am as fascinated by every role in it.

25
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,580
Like it very much

26
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,160
But if I had to name a favorite character?

27
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,500
That must be the role of the professor played by Mr. Gu Zhijun

28
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,720
It is very hard for actors to create characters

29
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,400
Why don't we interview Mr. Gu Zhijun?

30
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,860
See what exciting things he has to share with you

31
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,200
Mr. Gu, what do you think of this role?

32
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,220
Is he different from the characters you've portrayed before?

33
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,640
This is the first film you took on after returning to China.

34
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,300
Why did you choose this movie?

35
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,340
What is the difference between Chinese crews and Hollywood crews?

36
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,400
Director Yang, you are a very thoughtful female director.

37
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,220
Were there any special sparks when you worked with him?

38
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,940
Mr. Gu, please say a few words to your fans who love you.

39
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,160
Xiao Juan

40
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,520
I'm glad you came to this press conference today.

41
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,400
I was worried that you wouldn't be able to come.

42
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,540
Now it seems I was overthinking

43
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm fine, thank you for your concern.

44
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,880
My father once told me that what is important in this world is not just being alive.

45
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,380
But to leave something behind

46
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,240
The City of Time has too many memories of my parents when they were young.

47
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,960
The best way to pay tribute to my father is to complete this film with you all.

48
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,440
I will pick myself up again

49
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,120
Well, this is the energetic and invincible Xu Zhen that I know.

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,020
Hey, from now on we will officially become ashes in the group, and you must take good care of me.

51
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,740
Come on, yeah

52
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,100
Where is your hair?

53
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,380
I can't do my hair myself.

54
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,320
Gu Chujun

55
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,320
The press conference ended so quickly

56
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,540
So many questions answered so quickly

57
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,260
Kobayashi must not understand

58
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,120
I always answer questions carefully.

59
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,220
Should get to the point

60
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,660
Of course soon

61
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,620
Oh hum

62
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,920
ah

63
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,860
I'll go try on clothes after I deliver the things.

64
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,900
Come here as soon as you finish delivering the things.

65
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
besides

66
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,220
Don't hang out with irrelevant people.

67
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,760
Xiao Zhan, ignore him

68
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,020
Meeting intentionally

69
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,700
fine

70
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,600
Hey, it seems that Xu Zhen is really different now

71
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,700
He has completely walked out of Professor Xu's shadow

72
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,660
I see he is still smiling today

73
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,700
Of course

74
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,420
My little brain can solve the problem with just a little thought.

75
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,980
Now Xu Zhen has devoted himself to the filming of City of Time.

76
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,980
I want to take a good picture of it.

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,800
correct

78
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,780
Do you feel

79
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,060
Lin Jinxiu feels something is wrong with Xu Zhen

80
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,380
Is he a little bit interested in Xu Zhen?

81
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,660
Too enthusiastic too enthusiastic

82
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,300
Lin Jinxiu is more enthusiastic about Xu Zhen

83
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,900
This doesn't mean Xu Zhen is popular.

84
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,500
This is the real master, but I quarreled

85
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,900
Oh, I didn't expect that I have such a good eye for people.

86
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,820
Why

87
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,820
I said there's something wrong with you.

88
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,860
me

89
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,240
What questions can I have? What questions can you have?

90
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,040
I haven't answered all the questions from the reporter just now.

91
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,820
There is no problem if you run down quickly.

92
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,300
I am Xu Zhen's boss.

93
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,100
As his leader

94
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,740
We must care about all aspects of his work, life and study.

95
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,080
Although Xu Zhen's work ability is not outstanding

96
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,760
I am usually careless in doing things.

97
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
Carefree

98
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,420
But she is still a kind girl at heart.

99
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,260
I don't want his kindness to be taken advantage of by people with ulterior motives.

100
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,060
If any trouble arises, I, as the boss, will have to deal with it.

101
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,059
oops

102
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,840
It seems to make sense.

103
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,660
but

104
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,580
is that so

105
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,460
The press conference just ended

106
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,780
The Long March has just begun

107
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,040
What is the mission of this song?

108
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,860
It's on you again.

109
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,460
I heard that Xiaozhen

110
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,360
Later, he also appeared at the press conference

111
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,860
You should be relieved now.

112
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,100
This child is really not easy

113
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,620
Over the years

114
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,780
Only his father is with him.

115
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,100
Now I have lost my dearest one

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,220
He can convince himself to get back on his feet.

117
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,140
I'm actually quite happy.

118
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,580
Don't say that

119
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,900
You are his mother after all.

120
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,460
He can be so brave

121
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,420
It's also your good qualities that you passed on to him.

122
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,180
We've been apart for so long.

123
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,500
I always feel

124
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,500
I have no idea

125
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,660
I don't know how to face him

126
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,500
I always feel

127
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,280
I won't be a good mother.

128
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
Don't say that

129
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,960
How can a mother be incompetent?

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,140
As long as you love her with all your heart

131
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,700
You are a good mother

132
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,640
After all, no one is born to be a parent.

133
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,020
We also learned how to be parents through the bumps and bruises with our children.

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,340
Don't worry, there will be no problem between you and Xiaozhen.

135
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,580
Although that's what I said

136
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,900
I'm still a little worried

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,540
Of course you also know my two sons

138
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,300
Each has its own personality

139
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,520
What about Jin Yang and I?

140
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,900
There has been some misunderstanding

141
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,060
I once had the same trouble as you.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,820
But we just need to trust without reservation

143
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,860
Isn't everything good now?

144
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,380
It's a real child.

145
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,140
Natural mellowness

146
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,740
Very accessible

147
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,220
You don't have to be restrained

148
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,580
Just get along with him with a normal heart

149
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,260
I believe you will become closer and closer

150
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,500
Thank you Zhang Heng

151
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,480
Okay, all the tasks assigned by Sister Xiao Rui have been completed.

152
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,140
Thank you, Xiaoxiu.

153
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,300
Why are you being so polite to me?

154
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,400
Hey, Xiao Chen, are you free later?

155
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,560
Let's have a meal together

156
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,460
I still have a lot to tell you.

157
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,660
I said that the 3D models you made have problems with their proportions.

158
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,340
Also, the color of the rock layer where the fossils are buried is too different.

159
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,660
You know we take this movie very seriously.

160
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,780
We also invited several senior scholars in related disciplines to serve as technical consultants.

161
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,540
I ask you why you keep making this mistake over and over again.

162
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,100
Director Yang, please take a look

163
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,740
Although we are all professionals in special effects

164
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,540
But I really don't know anything about paleontology.

165
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,120
Although these experts can always provide some professional advice

166
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,680
But they all have their own jobs.

167
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,580
It's impossible to be with us all the time

168
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,460
They don't fully understand film and television.

169
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
There are bound to be some mistakes in the connection between the two sides

170
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,180
Poor care

171
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,020
I also thought about it

172
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,300
The best solution

173
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,420
We invited a professional paleontologist to stay in the group.

174
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,620
We are working together in a long-term cooperative state

175
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,100
This will achieve the best results

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,620
Oh, but such people

177
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,460
Where to find it?

178
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,620
Actually, it is not impossible to find it if you want to

179
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,780
Go to the live studio to have a look

180
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,720
Ah, you can make this place a little greener.

181
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,160
According to our script settings

182
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,800
This land should be the first scene of the death of dinosaurs

183
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,720
The dinosaurs here died by the lake.

184
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,360
So the surrounding area should be light gray

185
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,620
Green fine-grained sandstone

186
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,200
Professionals are different.

187
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,260
Yes, if you can keep helping us like this, it will save us a lot of effort.

188
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,900
The color is right this time

189
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,340
Hey, boss, this is all thanks to Xuezhen's help.

190
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,520
Xu Zhen

191
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,020
This special effects team really needs a helper with professional knowledge

192
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,820
You just happen to understand this.

193
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,100
Well, I don't know if you are willing to finish your work with Gu Chijun.

194
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,940
Come to the special effects team to help

195
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,420
I would. I would very much like to.

196
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,100
Ah, over there

197
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,940
Hey, Xiao Chen, why are you in such a good mood today?

198
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,880
My mother came to me just now and asked me to help my colleagues in the special effects team deal with some professional issues.

199
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,840
I feel so fulfilled that I can help my mother.

200
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,000
Since we are so happy today, why shouldn't we eat here? We should go out and celebrate. No need

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,320
I think the food here is delicious.

202
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,460
I feel my appetite whetted just by looking at it

203
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,780
Hey, why are you here again?

204
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,460
How can you say again?

205
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,380
Xu Zhen is my assistant

206
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,620
Now you should take care of

207
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,140
Xu Zhen, I'm hungry.

208
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,340
Go get me something to eat.

209
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,500
Hmm, Xiaoxuan

210
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,740
Don't pay attention to him. He is clearly exploiting you. Let's sit somewhere else.

211
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,060
How is this exploitation?

212
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,100
Xu Zhen is my life assistant and should take care of my life

213
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,980
Mr. Lian, please don't set a wrong example for your employees.

214
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,560
Ah, Xiaoxiu, it's okay. I can eat later.

215
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,860
Boss, what do you want to eat now?

216
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,140
For vegetables, I want beef and eggs.

217
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,740
Fruit I want bananas and grapes and some dessert

218
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,940
remember

219
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,500
As for water, I only drink sparkling steamed bread.

220
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,100
And summer is here

221
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,860
Give me some soup or something.

222
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,500
Summer

223
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,060
OK, Xiaojuan, I'll go with you.

224
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,220
Ah, boss, do you need anything else?

225
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,940
Okay, Gu Daxingxing

226
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,480
Enjoy your meal

227
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,060
But don't waste it

228
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,580
Xiaozhen, let's go

229
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,140
Oh, Xu Zhen

230
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,220
I suddenly have a severe headache.

231
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,280
You packed all this stuff.

232
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,600
Let's go back to the lounge to eat.

233
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,380
Xiaozhen, ignore him, he must be pretending

234
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,780
How could I be pretending?

235
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,160
Do you know that as a great performing artist

236
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,620
Every scene requires full commitment

237
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,300
Every scene needs to be carefully considered

238
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,980
So headaches are normal.

239
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,980
Ah, I almost forgot

240
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,140
How can a rich second-generation like you understand the exhaustion of wisdom like me?

241
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,300
Kobayashi General Kobayashi General

242
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,160
I have already invited the emotional experts you asked me to invite for you.

243
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,500
They are waiting for you in the office now. That's great.

244
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,960
How about this one?

245
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,160
You look best

246
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,620
This photo has a good angle and good lighting. Who took this photo?

247
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,380
Oh, a handsome boy

248
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,560
Really?

249
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,599
Still a handsome guy

250
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,019
This one is also good

251
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,920
This is the situation now, everyone.

252
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,760
Well, I know you are all masters of emotions.

253
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,140
Experts among experts

254
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,420
So how to get the donation is up to you.

255
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,380
Oh, what you said is useless.

256
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,440
Do you know

257
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,900
This woman's mind is the hardest to understand.

258
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,700
No matter how hard you try

259
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,500
It also doesn't meet their requirements.

260
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,260
So what do you say we should do?

261
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,900
Why don't you try me?

262
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,000
Hey Mr. Kobayashi

263
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm sorry

264
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,700
This is a mistake

265
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,040
Errors

266
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,140
Hey, you admit defeat

267
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,580
Kobayashi

268
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,720
Do you know women?

269
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,260
They all love beauty

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,120
If you make it beautiful

271
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,700
He will love you

272
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,980
I am an emotional expert.

273
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,980
Occasionally, I also sell facial masks.

274
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,520
Our facial mask

275
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
That's excellent

276
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,100
It will be refreshed after use

277
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,540
Such a good thing

278
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,820
I believe I can win Miss Xu's heart.

279
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,180
Give me some boxes.

280
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,560
Excuse me

281
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,220
Our Xu Zhen has good skin

282
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,420
No need for secrets

283
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,060
Xiaolin, I don't know if you have ever heard of a saying

284
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,300
What are you talking about?

285
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,020
this

286
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,940
If you recognize him, you must love him well

287
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,180
More important than love

288
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,180
Oh yeah yeah

289
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,620
Actually, my side job is being an emotional expert

290
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,320
My main job

291
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,560
It's selling bags.

292
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,900
I'm telling you

293
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,480
Our bags are all shipped from the Hermès factory.

294
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,980
And it also supports counter inspection

295
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,220
Many styles are not even available in the British royal family.

296
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,100
Imagine sending such a unique bag to Miss Xu.

297
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,720
Can he reject you?

298
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,860
Xu Juan is not a person who is greedy for dreams and needs

299
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,980
So no need

300
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
What bag?

301
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,940
Masks are just external things.

302
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,220
What does the new century need?

303
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,180
It's technology, like our hyaluronic acid

304
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,080
Just inject it into the skin

305
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,740
That bang bang bang light

306
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,240
Hey Master Lin, do you know

307
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,280
Love a woman

308
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,500
Just let him shine under the spotlight.

309
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,220
Master Lin, buy 100 tubes of hyaluronic acid

310
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,760
I love Xu Zhen

311
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,980
Not a light bulb

312
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,680
None of the methods you mentioned last forever.

313
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,340
So now someone can provide a practical and effective solution

314
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,900
Kobayashi's love is the one-minute surge of dopamine

315
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,140
This minute is crucial

316
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,800
When love happens

317
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,260
The body secretes dopamine

318
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,380
Stimulate your organs

319
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,540
Of course, when human organs are stimulated

320
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,060
It also secretes dopamine

321
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,540
This means that people feel the feeling of love appearing.

322
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,460
So some people say

323
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,060
Fear of love

324
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,220
It's an emotion

325
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,980
So is there any way to make Miss Xu Zhen feel fear?

326
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,140
You can take him to a dangerous place.

327
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,520
Then he will be afraid

328
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,900
Fear of screaming

329
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,020
the love for you

330
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,700
I can't tell the difference.

331
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,440
high

332
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,180
It's really high

333
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,220
This sounds like a good idea.

334
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,020
But remember

335
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,420
Don't turn thrill into fright.

336
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,980
Otherwise dopamine will turn into adrenaline

337
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,360
What happened then?

338
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,700
I can't say

339
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Or you can choose something less thrilling

340
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,540
Not that difficult

341
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,500
For example, diving

342
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,940
Rock climbing is possible

343
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,460
rock climbing

344
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,780
Rock climbing is good

345
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,340
I'll go now, thank you.

346
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,580
OK Card

347
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,540
It's time to call it a day

348
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,140
Wait, this scene isn't being filmed anymore?

349
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,340
No need to shoot it tomorrow then let’s shoot it tomorrow

350
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,660
Xiaoxue, thanks to your help today

351
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,060
You are awesome.

352
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,760
Thank you for your support

353
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,300
No more No more

354
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't be so polite.

355
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,880
Paleontology is my major and I am a member of the crew. These are what I should do.

356
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,060
Okay, you go ahead and do your work.

357
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,620
Xu Zhen is a really nice girl.

358
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,160
Wait, tomorrow is a holiday.

359
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
You have half a day off

360
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,700
How do you plan to spend this half day?

361
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,940
Do you want me to invite some media to do an interview?

362
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,860
Let me promote my city of time

363
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,200
Oh no thanks

364
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,880
Don't arrange anything for me tomorrow.

365
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,560
I have something to do, so I'll leave first.

366
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,300
Please help me clean up.

367
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,060
Stop looking and pack your things quickly

368
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,540
I don't have work tomorrow

369
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,280
I want to go back and take a rest

370
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,380
Xiaojuan, I see that you have tomorrow off, so why don't we go rock climbing together? What do you think?

371
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,500
Why do you suddenly want to play this?

372
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,680
I see you like sports, don't you?

373
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,540
I've recently become fascinated with rock climbing.

374
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,400
But some of the technical moves are not very proficient

375
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,080
You're definitely better than me at surviving in the wild.

376
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,780
So why don't you take me with you to practice?

377
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,760
Yeah, okay

378
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,740
Go with you

379
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,260
Pan Yan is too dangerous

380
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,700
No Go to Gu Zhijun

381
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,420
Why do you always interfere in my private life?

382
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,420
Xu Zhen is my assistant

383
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,340
His job is to serve my creatures

384
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,620
He went to participate in such dangerous activities as rock climbing

385
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,060
What to do if you get hurt

386
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,460
It will affect the progress of the entire crew.

387
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,840
Xiao Zhan

388
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,540
Not allowed to go

389
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,440
I have checked and Xiaozhen does not have work tomorrow.

390
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,380
So he can arrange his thinking time

391
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,720
By the way, nurse

392
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,740
Although you are the boss of the town

393
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,340
But his salary is not our Gaia

394
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,800
Gaia has never

395
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,360
Will not exploit employees' private lives

396
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,620
So the working hours of the town tomorrow will be arranged by him.

397
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,900
We're going rock climbing tomorrow.

398
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,020
I'll wait for you at the climbing gym.

399
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,820
See you there OK

400
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,320
Uh, boss, this is the lamb kebab I told you is really delicious.

401
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,140
I waited in line for a long time before buying it. Come on, let's eat together.

402
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,700
What are you doing?

403
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,840
Didn't you say that you finally waited for a day without any announcements and wanted to have a good rest and eat a big meal?

404
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,820
Then lie down on your cozy little bed and have a good rest

405
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,820
Why are you still in love?

406
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,180
As an actor

407
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,580
You should always keep yourself in shape

408
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,100
This is also part of the actor's training.

409
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,380
Okay, you're already in great shape, stop training. Come on, I bought two bottles of beer.

410
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,580
As a broker

411
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,300
Don't urge me to exercise

412
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,700
Stay in shape

413
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,660
Just keep in good shape

414
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,780
You're tempting me with this kind of junk food.

415
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,840
Hurry

416
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,740
Come and practice with me.

417
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,860
Well, that's it.

418
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,860
Hey, why are you here?

419
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,140
Why can't I come?

420
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,740
Rock climbing is my favorite sport

421
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,780
Whenever I have time off from filming, I will exercise here

422
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,200
how

423
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,100
Are you scared?

424
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,060
If you're scared, don't go up there.

425
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,900
So as not to fall down and be embarrassed

426
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,620
Hum, are you kidding?

427
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,780
After all, I am the champion of our elementary school swimming team.

428
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,980
This kind of thing is totally trivial to me.

429
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,500
If you are afraid, just sit over there.

430
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,900
Can you guys stop arguing and start now?

431
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,620
Hey, Xiaozhen, how are you going to tie this thing?

432
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,640
so

433
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,140
Buckle this up

434
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,380
Then tighten

435
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,820
I won't deduct this from Xiaozhen.

436
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,540
Come and help me.

437
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,560
so

438
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,940
Hey, my area is loose.

439
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,780
What's going on? Wait a minute, let me see.

440
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,580
Oh, you are like this.

441
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,340
Can you please fasten mine first and then fasten his?

442
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,600
Didn't I just button it for you? Why are your buttons loose again? Tie them up yourselves.

443
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,140
Don't come to me again.

444
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,920
Yes, why do you always trouble Xiaojun with everything?

445
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,300
Don't you have a coach? Why don't you just go find him?

446
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,480
Please

447
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,380
I'm a star

448
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,060
Is it possible for anyone to approach me?

449
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,060
What if I run into my fans?

450
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:57,460
Also, people like you who have never been worshipped by others will not understand the troubles of being a male god.

451
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,780
Hey, leader.

452
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,220
Hey Xiaozhen, did I disturb you? No, no

453
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,040
Do you have time now? I want to go shopping.

454
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,660
I don't know if it's convenient for you.

455
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,840
Convenient Very convenient

456
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,940
I'll be there soon

457
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,980
Ah good

458
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,860
Ah, I have to leave now because I have something urgent to do. You two should practice slowly with the coach and be careful.

459
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,580
Xu ZhengXu Zheng

460
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,260
You're back, Xiao Zhang. Where are you going?

461
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,700
Hey, what's the matter?

462
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,500
If your feet really leave, you won't dare to climb anymore, right?

463
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,140
What am I afraid of climbing?

464
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,660
It's you

465
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,460
Aren't you addicted to taking pictures?

466
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,620
Why don't you take a picture for me?

467
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,240
Just shoot it, who's afraid of who?

468
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,540
I'll take a picture for you to see.

469
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,980
Hey, why don't you take a picture?

470
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,340
You are awesome, take the photo first.

471
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,380
Okay, I'll teach you how to shoot.

472
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,020
Come and learn from me

473
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,260
Hello, Ms. Liang. This is

474
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,040
Yes, she is my daughter.

475
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,560
No wonder he looks so much like you

476
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,080
I've never seen it before.

477
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,820
Do you want to try out some clothes for him?

478
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:03,540
Um, do you have any clothes you like? No, mom, I have so many clothes that I can’t wear them all.

479
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,480
That

480
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,280
There's no clothes I like.

481
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,860
Then choose the shoes.

482
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,660
I remember the first pair of leather shoes you bought for me when I was a child also had a bow like this on it.

483
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,220
That was when you were four or five years old.

484
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,580
Do you still remember such small things?

485
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,580
Then please give him this pair of shoes. What size do you want?

486
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,700
I wear size 37 shoes.

487
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,340
OK, please wait a moment, I will check for you.

488
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,460
I don't even know what size shoe you wear.

489
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,820
It's okay, mom. I'm very happy.

490
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,260
Sorry, Ms. Liang, this pair of shoes, size 37, is out of stock.

491
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,800
Beauty, do you want to try other styles?

492
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,080
It's okay if it's out of stock

493
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,580
It's okay if I don't buy it. I'll buy it later if I see something suitable. I may not be used to the shoes here.

494
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:45,900
That color is nice, but it doesn't suit you. What a pity. That person looks so familiar. Is he Jun?

495
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,980
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

496
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,300
Go ahead. I'm afraid you don't dare to go up.

497
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,420
It's amazing. I wouldn't dare to climb that high.

498
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,100
Wow, good

499
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,680
eat

500
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,400
ah

501
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,060
How can I lose face in front of my fans?

502
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,340
It seems that the only way is to climb up.

503
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,140
come on, come on, come on

504
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,700
How can you not be afraid of further studies? Come on!

505
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,140
I can't be worse than him anyway.

506
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,500
Oh my god, this is too high.

507
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,820
terrible

508
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,180
Forget it. If I'm afraid, I'll be digested by bone disease again.

509
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,460
Come on, fight for the town!

510
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,340
come on, come on, come on

511
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,580
There's only a little left. Come on, run to the top and you can get down.

512
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:07,740
Come on, male god, come on, male god, come on, song, come on, come on, it's almost here, cheer me up, it's so high

513
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,940
I'm really going to vomit.

514
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,459
Why don't you go down, swimming champion?

515
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,039
Why don't you go down?

516
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,780
Hey, there are many fans waiting for you below.

517
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:19,698
Just go down

518
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,139
You jump first.

519
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:24,359
You jump first, I won't jump

520
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,179
I don't believe you have the nerve to stay there all the time.

521
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:32,938
Why don't you let go? Coach, wait a minute, slow down, slow down. You are not ready yet.

522
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,739
I said why don't you go down?

523
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,658
Didn't you go down either?

524
00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:40,459
I won't go down unless you do.

525
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:42,539
How long do we have to wait?

526
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,839
It's almost time. Wait a little longer. Won't your hands get sore if you keep staying here?

527
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,839
Not sour at all

528
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,579
You said you were going to get off. You've been standing there for half an hour and you still don't want to get off. Let go and get off.

529
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,899
Come on!

530
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:54,699
Come on!

531
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:57,700
Ahhh

532
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,360
ah

533
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,500
Ah, come in and take a look

534
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,540
I remember that I liked the stuffed animal best after an hour.

535
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,600
Hello, ladies.

536
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,120
Is there anything I can help you with?

537
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,580
Hmm, is there a bigger one?

538
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,100
How old of a child would you like to give it to?

539
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,800
I forgot it was this big.

540
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,860
I guess I won't play with stuffed toys anymore.

541
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,380
Let's try another store.

542
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,440
No, mom, I like it very much.

543
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,100
Please buy me one.

544
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,180
That's it. Okay. Thank you.

545
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,680
I often come to this restaurant

546
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,820
Tastes good

547
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,900
Let's eat here tonight.

548
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,960
Mom, I know a really good place

549
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,900
Can you go with me?

550
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,420
ah

551
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,440
Xiao Chen, you said these are what you want to eat

552
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,180
Of course, the skewers here are delicious.

553
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,840
Mom, please try it.

554
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,360
Oh, do you know how much oil is applied to this chicken wing?

555
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,620
This string?

556
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,480
How many calories do you need?

557
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,980
Even if you run on the treadmill for half an hour, you can't burn it off.

558
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,820
Besides, eating this kind of oily and salty food will cause edema.

559
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,120
I think we should go somewhere else instead of eating here.

560
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,840
Mom, haven't you heard a saying?

561
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,180
Grilled wings with beer is super cool, right?

562
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,940
My father and I would come here to sit every time we came back from an inspection trip.

563
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,520
Dad said these dishes look like home.

564
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,360
really tasty

565
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,620
Try it, mom.

566
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,220
hey-hey

567
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,580
How about it

568
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,940
It's really good

569
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,700
Hahahaha, I didn't know that before, right?

570
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,040
Dad always says that the most homely taste is the most precious taste

571
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,800
Eat in a fancy restaurant

572
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,000
Although the dish is exquisite

573
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,280
But I can't taste any of the fireworks in life

574
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,800
And what family members want when they eat is a lively and noisy environment.

575
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,660
It will be especially delicious if you eat it this way.

576
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,940
Mom, let's go to the City of Time together

577
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,740
Here's to Dad and myself

578
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,580
Yeah

579
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,380
Hahaha, another drink hahaha

580
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,180
Continued Cup

581
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,100
The boss pays, mom.

582
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,140
Today is the happiest day I have had in a while.

583
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,620
How about this meal? Can I pay for it? Thank you, Mom.

584
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,940
Hahaha

585
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,860
ha

586
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,020
Ah, high five, high five, bear with it.

587
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,260
Uh, I mean the boss.

588
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,240
Aren't you slightly afraid of heights?

589
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,660
Why are you still rock climbing with Mr. Kobayashi?

590
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,020
This is called the courage to challenge and break through myself

591
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,220
Hey boss

592
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,980
Actually, I also like rock climbing. Why don't you take me with you next time?

593
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,380
Really don't take me

594
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,620
Ah, don't stop.

595
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,860
Ah, here it comes

596
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,820
Don't bring me, okay?

597
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,020
Ah

598
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,420
All All All

599
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,900
Hey, boss, I still can't let you challenge yourself anymore. You seem to be worse today than yesterday.

600
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,940
Forget it. Let's cancel the rock climbing activity next weekend. It will affect my work.

601
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,700
Mr. Li, slow down.

602
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,980
be careful

603
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,360
Why

604
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,700
I did so much exercise yesterday.

605
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,500
I didn't rest at home today.

606
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,740
Of course, I don't need it for a physique like mine.

607
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,860
You pulled a muscle.

608
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,680
snort

609
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,980
If I can't compare to a pampered young master

610
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,380
What kind of star am I?

611
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,380
That's fine

612
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,600
he

613
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,420
Very good, let's shoot the next one.

614
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,180
boss

615
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,140
What’s wrong with you

616
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,620
Did you strain your muscles because you did too much exercise yesterday? Let me see.

617
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,160
Don't you ignore me?

618
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,660
I was the only one left and ran away

619
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,460
Just be like you were yesterday. Don't worry about it.

620
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,700
Hey Xiao Chen

621
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,900
Xu Zhan, it's time to get off work, why haven't you left yet?

622
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,100
I'm preparing some things

623
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,380
You are here

624
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,000
Look, this is a hot egg that has just been cooked.

625
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,300
Can be used for hot compress

626
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,060
Here are some ice cubes for cold compress

627
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,140
There are also some blood-activating and blood-stasis-removing plasters.

628
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,360
I saw that the boss had a muscle strain while rock climbing yesterday. He could use some medicine to heal faster.

629
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,380
Why don't you give it to him yourself?
