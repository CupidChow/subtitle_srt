1
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,740
oops

2
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,700
Lin

3
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,380
He is indeed the most charming young leader of the enterprise.

4
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,940
You said that if the reporter

5
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,700
Knowing the true identity of the eldest son of the Lin family

6
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,820
Will you write more exciting articles?

7
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,700
Guo Zhijun, what do you want to do?

8
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,660
I come

9
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,740
Just want to tell you

10
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,060
Enjoy your spacious and bright office.

11
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,460
And the smell of free air

12
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,060
Otherwise, it will suddenly disappear one day.

13
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,700
It's too late to regret

14
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,260
Who wins and who loses now?

15
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,460
It's hard to draw a conclusion.

16
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,660
Maybe it's just right, not too early or too late

17
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,980
Leaving the company before the end of the working day

18
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,580
This is so rare for you.

19
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,460
Qian'er

20
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,140
I'll help you lift

21
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,740
Director Liu, why are you in the hospital?

22
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,620
You'd better leave now.

23
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,980
I hope you won't disturb my family.

24
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,780
Qian'er, wait a moment.

25
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm here to apologize to you today.

26
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,180
Things before

27
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,340
I can definitely lend you a hand

28
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,100
But I am afraid of Lin Jinyang's revenge.

29
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,580
Choose to cowardly hide in a dark corner and be a bystander

30
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,180
Let things develop

31
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,460
Make you a victim

32
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,460
I'm really sorry

33
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,140
Look at me now

34
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,060
Don't you think it's a little too late for you to say these things?

35
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,840
Besides, why should I take the risk to trust you now?

36
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,940
Qian'er, this is not an adventure.

37
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,620
This is me to you

38
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,900
It is also my own salvation.

39
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,140
I can't watch you sink into this matter.

40
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,780
We cannot let you go from being a victim to being a perpetrator with your hands stained with sin.

41
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,540
I'm sure your parents wouldn't agree.

42
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,460
All you have to do now is make all the truth known to the public

43
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,800
And get out as soon as possible

44
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,260
Cheer yourself up

45
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,460
All the troubles left

46
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,540
I will bear and face it all.

47
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,700
Can you please believe me?

48
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,220
Brother Weicheng, I believe you won't let me down again

49
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,980
Thank you

50
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,480
Jinyang

51
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,240
Jinyang

52
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,060
Hey, what's wrong with you?

53
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,280
Why

54
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,180
Hey

55
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,780
Why is it you? Didn't you escape from your neighbor's house with great difficulty?

56
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,580
Why is the troublemaker Huang here again?

57
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,380
What do you mean by looking at me like that?

58
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,820
Have pity on me

59
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,780
Pity me?

60
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,500
Lin Qingyang

61
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,100
What right do I have to pity you?

62
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,180
I've been used and trampled on by you time and time again

63
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,700
My heart has become so numb that I don't even feel the pain anymore

64
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,620
But sadly in the end

65
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,120
I still love you like crazy

66
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,820
There's no way I can let you go

67
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,780
Qin Ziqing, you really understand

68
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,900
In the end, you are still so wishful thinking

69
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,420
Lin Xinyang

70
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,180
You're right

71
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,900
My feelings for you

72
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,340
in the end

73
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,660
Only in the end can it be nothing

74
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,500
Nothing but pain and suffering

75
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,100
Because I know how terrible obsession is

76
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,420
That's why I think it's not too late.

77
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,020
Go and turn yourself in.

78
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,980
I really don't want to see you getting deeper and deeper into trouble like me.

79
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,340
I tell you in front of the mirror

80
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,660
Our oily-haired commander is not limited to passers-by.

81
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,260
So don't try to boss me around.

82
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,020
You are with me now

83
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,780
There's no benefit for you anymore.

84
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,500
so

85
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,100
You'd better stay away from me

86
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,980
Hey, what can I eat with this little wine?

87
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,540
You don't have to help me

88
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,900
I'm fine now

89
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,500
I didn't drink much at all

90
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,040
Why

91
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,500
Can you tell me about your childhood?

92
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,580
Although there is no evidence to prove that it was Mr. Kobayashi who reported the answer,

93
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,220
But he still insisted that he was the culprit.

94
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,620
Even if the charges of the explosion are not proven in the end

95
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,540
He will also be punished for obstruction of justice.

96
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,900
When I went to see him, he clearly refused any assistance you offered.

97
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,620
And he asked me to stay with you for a while

98
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,980
I hope you can turn yourself in.

99
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,080
Surrender

100
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,420
Hahahaha

101
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,140
Do you all want me to turn myself in?

102
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,980
I tell you

103
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,660
I won't lose

104
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,060
I will never admit defeat

105
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,620
I won't

106
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,140
I absolutely won't

107
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,460
Ha ha ha ha

108
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,540
I won't admit defeat

109
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,220
Hahahaha I won't admit defeat

110
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,540
Let's start. Okay.

111
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,220
All departments in place

112
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,800
Power on

113
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,100
Five stars in order

114
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,520
action

115
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,280
professor

116
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,700
I lost my job

117
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,540
I can't go with you anymore.

118
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,460
The legendary lie

119
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,900
I am so silly

120
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,580
Why look for luck and liveliness?

121
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,420
In fact, luck has always been by my side

122
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,420
Don't talk

123
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,980
Just let me hold you quietly like this

124
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,540
Every day I can look you in the eye

125
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,300
It's always a gift from God to me

126
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,860
Can you give me some more time?

127
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,540
Don't die

128
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,820
do not leave me

129
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,620
With your company

130
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,120
What else do I want?

131
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,580
Thank you Chiqun

132
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,100
He is very good

133
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,140
Get ready for the next one.

134
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,640
What's wrong? Who is this person? This sheep?

135
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,440
What's coming?

136
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,840
so many people

137
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,120
ah

138
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,160
Lin Xinyan

139
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,980
What are you doing here?

140
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,300
Now I declare

141
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,580
Celsius Group

142
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,580
Disband immediately

143
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,500
These props

144
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,380
I destroyed it immediately.

145
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,220
Take it down for me. Li Jing, what are you doing? Li Jingyao

146
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,500
stop it

147
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,300
Mr. Zhang, are you okay?

148
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,340
It's okay, I'm fine, Mr. Zhang, tell them to stop.

149
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,860
Lin Jiyang, everyone present has signed a contract with you

150
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,220
Before you have enough reputation

151
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,300
You have no right to disband the crew.

152
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,300
Yeah

153
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,820
You are just actors I hired.

154
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,100
director

155
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,700
As a manager, I

156
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,340
Be responsible for the interests of the entire high pressure

157
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,700
After the company's evaluation

158
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,540
The publicity and promotion costs of Time Fold are too high

159
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,700
So the company decided

160
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,460
I would rather stop the early stage shooting

161
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,820
Stop pushing the machine outwards.

162
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,660
So I'm really sorry.

163
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,740
You are fired

164
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,980
Okay, I'll continue disassembling.

165
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,080
All materials are destroyed

166
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,980
Destroy them all

167
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,980
This is the hard work of all of us.

168
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,340
Not qualified to touch

169
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,820
This is Gaia's property. It has nothing to do with you. Hand it over.

170
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,680
Come up quickly

171
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,300
Stop, stop.

172
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,700
Stop it! Stop it!

173
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,680
Hello

174
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,500
okay

175
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,780
I see

176
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,740
Liu Jia, come here

177
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,400
Follow me later

178
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,180
The rest of the people stayed

179
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,820
No orders from me

180
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,220
I see who dares to be happy

181
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,880
Walk

182
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,260
Don't move, don't move, be steady

183
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Lin Jinyang was behind everything from the beginning to the end.

184
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,000
He wanted to stop me from exposing Gaia's harshness towards Yiren.

185
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,380
She even fabricated a scandal about me and Director Wang cheating on her

186
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,380
When I learned that I was not financially capable of paying for my parents' medical expenses,

187
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,900
So the threat

188
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,020
Let me use the scandal to bury Mr. Story

189
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,019
Lin Jinyang Lin Jinyang is the real mastermind behind the scenes

190
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,420
What about others?

191
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,739
Waiting outside for a while

192
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,180
Please wake him up for me.

193
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,340
I heard you recently

194
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,180
It's amazing.

195
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,260
They do earth-shattering things.

196
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,220
Am I waking up now and blocking your way?

197
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,040
ah

198
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,060
I can get to where I am today

199
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,260
Isn't it because of you?

200
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,660
Do you still feel surprised?

201
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,380
From small to large

202
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,060
No matter how much I pay

203
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,740
You take it for granted

204
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,700
To get a compliment from you

205
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,300
I paid so much

206
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,460
But Xiaoxiu can easily get your attention

207
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,460
It's your son too.

208
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,220
Why are you doing this to me?

209
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Just because my mother is an ordinary employee

210
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,560
Xiaoxiu's mother is the daughter of a chairman.

211
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,900
Can it help you rise to prominence?

212
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,540
But have you ever thought about

213
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,620
After this woman was abandoned by you

214
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,020
What a miserable life

215
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,100
Until he leaves you

216
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,780
Went to another world

217
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,300
You never looked at him.

218
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,500
And I regret it too

219
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,100
You don't want me to live in this world

220
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,500
So many years

221
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,300
Have you ever given a little of your father's love?

222
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,740
available

223
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,040
The End of the World

224
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,340
sorry

225
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,420
I really paid too little attention to you these years.

226
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,740
Because of me and your mother.

227
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,580
I left you alone in the orphanage for a long time.

228
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,500
After coming back

229
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,620
I found that you have changed

230
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,540
But I never talked to you

231
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,400
I haven't really understood your pain or your loneliness

232
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,740
Your sadness

233
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
There is no day that I can stand by your side

234
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,700
On the standpoint

235
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,300
Consider Your Feelings

236
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,060
sorry

237
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,260
I am too cowardly.

238
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,460
But

239
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,100
in my heart

240
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,500
You have always been my son

241
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,380
The location has never changed

242
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,900
you

243
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,060
You have always been my pride

244
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,220
Sorry Jinying

245
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,520
Dad apologizes to you

246
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,980
What's the point of you saying this now?

247
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,980
Too late

248
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,520
It's late, you know?

249
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,020
There's no use apologizing.

250
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,060
As long as you are willing to

251
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,940
There's still time

252
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,140
Before

253
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,980
I think a lot of companies

254
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,620
and business development issues

255
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,060
But one day I found

256
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,220
In my heart

257
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,380
But what I really care about is that you can be together as a family.

258
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,020
so

259
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:48,740
Even if you look back now and see a cliff

260
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,260
Xiao Xiu and I will also be with you

261
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,580
Come

262
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,380
Come, let me show you something.

263
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,500
You should have known this a long time ago.

264
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,700
But my illness came too suddenly

265
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,540
So I delayed him.

266
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:14,960
Why

267
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,940
Declaration of non-inheritance

268
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,920
ah

269
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,520
ah

270
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,700
What's the matter with Xiaoxian?

271
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,020
The last time I discussed this with you,

272
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,260
He firmly stated

273
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,020
No matter what happens, he will not compete with you for the position of Gaia Chairman

274
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,180
In his heart

275
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,460
only you

276
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,300
Gaia

277
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,300
do better

278
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,180
How could I not know him?

279
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,740
He's letting me take all the blame now

280
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,080
so

281
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,740
Go turn yourself in.

282
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,860
Surrender

283
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,380
ah

284
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,020
Now you tell me it's too late to turn yourself in.

285
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,260
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

286
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,740
Why didn't you let me feel the father-son relationship earlier?

287
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,340
You think it's too selfish

288
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,660
You only think about yourself

289
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,980
You have ruined my mother's life.

290
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,540
Now you want to ruin the rest of my life?

291
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,540
Stop drinking

292
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,560
Liu Jia

293
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,100
Do you see this building?

294
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,380
I used to dream

295
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,980
After he succeeds

296
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,180
I'll move Gaia here.

297
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,300
To build a

298
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,580
The largest British empire

299
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,140
I used to fantasize

300
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,420
We want to build this into the largest 3D scanning system

301
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,060
To shoot some cross-century CD movies

302
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,460
Create a film and television myth that truly belongs to Gaia

303
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,940
But now

304
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,100
it's all over

305
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,540
Cheer up a bit

306
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,460
Liu Jiaan

307
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,980
This ticket

308
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,500
Already prepared

309
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,260
And this bank card

310
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,860
Enough for you to live abroad for a long time

311
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,620
You don't have to stay. Take it.

312
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,020
You can leave me now

313
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,940
How can I leave at this time?

314
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,220
You go

315
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,500
You used to live for me.

316
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,340
Now

317
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,980
You have to live for yourself

318
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,700
You still have a long life ahead of you

319
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,060
Go do something you really want to do.

320
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,220
you left

321
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,700
I'll wake up a little

322
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,980
I just hope

323
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,100
in this world

324
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,460
care about me

325
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,740
People I care about

326
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,780
All are doing well

327
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,580
Let's go, bro. I won't leave.

328
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,780
Not leaving yet

329
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,460
I do not go

330
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,340
I told you to go, did you hear me?

331
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,560
I let you go

332
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,100
Come on, walk for me.

333
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,300
Go now!

334
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,860
Hello, the number you called

335
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,600
Qingyang

336
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,580
Where are you now?

337
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,800
Everyone

338
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,220
After several months of hard work

339
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,020
Our City of Time has finally finished filming

340
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,340
Thank you all for your hard work.

341
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,580
I think

342
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,540
I got much more than I expected in this time city.

343
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,940
This city of time

344
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,340
This is to commemorate a very important friend in my life.

345
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,900
My ex-husband Professor Xu Zhengyao

346
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,660
Also because of the filming of the City of Time

347
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,180
I saved the person I almost lost in my life

348
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,900
My daughter Xu Zhen

349
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,180
Thank you very much for filming the City of Time

350
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,660
Thank you to all the creators

351
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,940
All the friends who participated in this drama

352
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,360
Thank you so much

353
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,500
thank you all

354
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,020
Thanks

355
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,220
What I'm going to say is much simpler.

356
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,580
Thank you for the drama City of Time

357
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,580
It gave me a deeper understanding of acting.

358
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,660
Of course the most important thing is

359
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,740
In the City of Time

360
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,700
I found it

361
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,660
The most important person in life

362
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,140
thank you all

363
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,900
Hey, can you please stop talking nonsense in the future?

364
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,860
Hey, Sister Qing

365
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,220
It's okay. I want to be alone.

366
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,380
Lin Jingyang I don't believe I can't find you at your own movie's closing party

367
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,720
Let me go, let me go

368
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,040
Li Jinyang, come out here

369
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,620
Li Jinyang let go

370
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,980
Li Jinyang, hurry up

371
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,500
Let go of the guests who are harassing us and call the police immediately

372
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,140
What to feed

373
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,900
Do you know Lin Jinyang's face?

374
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,900
The new base to raise

375
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,260
I'll see where you hide this time.

376
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,720
Good job, Lin Jingyang

377
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,220
You're hiding here.

378
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,639
Get up for me

379
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,979
Get up!

380
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,040
Who are you? You promised to pay off my gambling debt.

381
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,100
Why only half?

382
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,780
I worked like a slave for you, but you still lied to me

383
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,739
It's you who is useless.

384
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,140
You can't do things on your own

385
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,260
You still have the nerve to ask for money

386
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,460
I tell you

387
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,400
You asked me to frame the stubborn army

388
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,679
I have evidence

389
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,059
Would you mind giving me money?

390
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,600
I'll expose the matter

391
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,100
You expose it

392
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,020
You are exposed

393
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,900
Do you think I'm still scared?

394
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,059
I have nothing now

395
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,459
Even a despicable person like you dares to threaten me

396
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,199
Do you think you can be better than me?

397
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,099
Ah, aren't you also on the list of failures?

398
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,100
You, you, what are you doing?

399
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,300
You, you, my money

400
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,340
You let me win or lose the hero but you don't give me money

401
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,340
You don't give me money

402
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,020
I beat you to death

403
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,620
Mr. Lin, spare my life. Mr. Lin, spare my life.

404
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,340
Trash like you

405
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,900
I feel sick even if I hit you

406
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,580
I'll beat you to death

407
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,480
President

408
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,300
born
