1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,660
The pain of time is invisible to the eye

2
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,820
Stupid, this proves that we are destined to be together

3
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,220
It is said that women are a man's rib for life.

4
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,980
Only looking for the whole world

5
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,160
Get back to that rib

6
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,780
His body can complete

7
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,460
His heart won't ache.

8
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,820
My cute little ribs

9
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,540
How could I bear to let you get hurt?

10
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,080
Um

11
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
Ms. Tsz Hing

12
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,780
Is what the factory worker Lao Wu said online true?

13
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,600
Did Xu Zhen deliberately plan this explosion for you?

14
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,540
In addition, the stubborn army takes all the responsibility on themselves.

15
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,440
Do you have anything to say?

16
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,100
Is he trying to confuse the public or is there something else going on?

17
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,300
Regarding this matter

18
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,380
In fact, Xu Zhen and Gu Zhijun were not affected by the explosion.

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,380
Miss Ziqing was hit on the head

20
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,900
So I can't stand excessive noise.

21
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,600
Please help him create a good rest environment.

22
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,840
Let him have a good rest

23
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,340
Get back to the stage as soon as possible

24
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,220
Thank you for your understanding

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,460
Zijin, you need to have a good rest

26
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,580
Don't let people worry about you

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Okay, media friends.

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,400
Sister Ziqing's attitude towards this matter will be conveyed to everyone through me soon.

29
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,940
Please wait outside the ward for a few minutes.

30
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,660
thank you all

31
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,500
Goodbye, whatever you wanted to say.

32
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,060
I advise you to forget it completely now

33
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,780
Because standing by my side is your wisest choice

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,380
Do as I say

35
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,760
Tell Everyone

36
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,660
The controller was telling the truth.

37
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,740
If I admit it now

38
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,620
That's your helper.

39
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,480
A shield when necessary

40
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,900
Until it's useless and you throw it away like garbage, right?

41
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,820
Lin Qingyang

42
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,260
How long will you continue to use me?

43
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,140
What a smart woman.

44
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,140
But you don't have to feel wronged

45
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,000
Because we've always been each other.

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,020
Almost suitable for mutual use

47
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,020
Haven't you always wanted to use me to become the boss lady of this family?

48
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,940
Did I said wrong thing

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,800
Qingyang

50
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,060
I would like to know

51
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,780
When you sent someone to plant the bomb on the set

52
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,860
Is there a minute or even a second?

53
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,660
I thought I was there at the time.

54
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,700
I will also be implicated in the explosion

55
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,580
It seems that I am being too sentimental again.

56
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,220
How can I be worthy of you, Mr. Lin?

57
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,220
I've been thinking hard for you

58
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,620
But don't forget that I still have your recorded evidence

59
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,160
Now we have come to this point

60
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,820
There is no need for me to cover up for you anymore.

61
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,060
Recording evidence

62
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,620
Is this what you are talking about?

63
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,460
Didn't you take it too?

64
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,920
You give it back to me

65
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,380
This is my only leverage

66
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,420
Sorry, Sister Ziqin

67
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,420
Purple

68
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,940
You should think clearly

69
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,540
You can't beat me

70
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,820
I can pull down a Li Qianer

71
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,100
Of course it can also destroy you

72
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
But you do as I say.

73
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,460
After marriage

74
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,460
I'll give you everything you want

75
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,740
Wealth, reputation, status

76
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,820
Even love

77
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,060
I will definitely love you well

78
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
Come

79
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,360
come over

80
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,500
impossible

81
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,540
Lin Jingya

82
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,820
Do you still expect me to listen to you and let you control me now?

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,460
Don't even think about it

84
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,660
In this case

85
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,220
Watch him from now on.

86
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,620
Without my permission

87
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,740
He must not leave here.

88
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,100
Oh, right

89
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,600
Zixin, I forgot to tell you

90
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,940
This ward

91
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,740
It's specially prepared for you

92
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,260
There is a 24-hour guard outside the door

93
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,660
If you want to say something

94
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,020
Or it is absolutely impossible to meet someone.

95
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,040
So I suggest you save your energy.

96
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,260
Just watch him for yourself

97
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,140
I have been friends with you for so many years.

98
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,900
Just let me out.

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,020
As long as I leave here

100
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,500
I won't hold you responsible for your betrayal.

101
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,820
From now on, we don't owe each other anything, okay?

102
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,820
Sister Ziqing, from the moment I chose to sell myself out

103
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,580
I never thought about getting your forgiveness again

104
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,340
sorry

105
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,620
Open the door and let me out

106
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,979
Open the door

107
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,280
Let me out. Why are you keeping me here?

108
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,580
Open the door?

109
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,900
Open the door?

110
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,000
Ms. Jin Ziqing was injured in this accident

111
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,460
He specifically asked me to come here on his behalf to express his attitude towards the explosion.

112
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,060
Xu Zhen had indeed been targeting me in the crew before.

113
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,360
Because I didn’t want my privacy to be exposed before

114
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,740
So he did not make a positive response to Gu Chijun's confession in the hotel

115
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,700
Xu Zhen has always been upset about this

116
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,980
At the same time, I can't let go of our emotional entanglement back then

117
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,220
So love turns to hate

118
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,020
I feel very terrified

119
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,260
As for causing harm to innocent people due to my involvement

120
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,220
I'm so sorry

121
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,540
Thank you for your hard work.

122
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,300
from now on

123
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,980
Our Meike department must clarify its functions

124
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,700
Fight this crucial public relations battle seriously

125
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,780
Publicity department

126
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,020
Prepare a press release immediately to inform all media

127
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,340
We, the Asia Group, must insist on defending the rights and interests of all the weak.

128
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,500
Hello Mr. Lin

129
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,420
Our department will formulate a plan to guide public opinion tonight.

130
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,120
And issued the first draft

131
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,920
besides

132
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,520
Ministry of Justice: Gu Chi-jun deliberately insinuated in front of the media today that Gaia had framed Xu Zhenli

133
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,340
Write a piece of news to tell everyone

134
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,260
The army of Guzhi accused the leader of Gaia of being a traitor.

135
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,180
But Mr. Lin

136
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,860
Suing the Story Army before finding out the truth of the accident

137
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,340
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

138
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,140
More importantly, this is likely to affect the progress of the company's key project this year, the City of Time.

139
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,420
so

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,240
Should we reconsider this?

141
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,260
No need

142
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,840
A movie is as important as a company's reputation.

143
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,900
Everyone has their own judgment

144
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,300
Besides, I am now the acting director.

145
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,100
I think this should be done at all costs.

146
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,020
Goodbye

147
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,860
Notice of prosecution

148
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,460
Oh, this Lin Jinyang is really trying to get rid of me.

149
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,620
Such a far-fetched reason to sue me

150
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,840
I believe

151
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,700
He will probably write about the City of Time next.

152
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,820
We have to be careful

153
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,580
But this is the project that Chairman Lin personally protected before he fell ill.

154
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,180
No matter what, he shouldn't go too far.

155
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,060
Lin Qingyang is now racing against Director Lin's awakening time.

156
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,720
He is desperate now.

157
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,300
Anything is possible

158
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,620
But don't worry

159
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,940
City of Time

160
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,700
It's your blood

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,340
It is also the blood of Liang Dao

162
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,420
I will definitely protect him.

163
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,020
But before that

164
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,180
You have to promise me one thing

165
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,980
What's up?

166
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,060
Lin Jinyang should be able to do anything now

167
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,660
I'm not afraid of him hurting me

168
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,340
I'm afraid he'll hurt you.

169
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,180
So before this matter is completely resolved

170
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,060
I hope you can leave and do it

171
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,860
Get out of here for now

172
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,540
Come back when this is over, okay?

173
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,340
I guessed you would say that.

174
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,820
But I refuse

175
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,020
I'll serve you wherever you are.

176
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,580
Do you see it

177
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,900
This is my answer

178
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,800
I'll be wherever you are.

179
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
I can't drive you away even if I want to

180
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,640
Remember?

181
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,620
Overbearing CEO

182
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Just rest assured

183
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,820
I won't hold you back.

184
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,080
Please give me more advice in the future.

185
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,460
Got it haha

186
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
Zhijun

187
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,960
Zhijun

188
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,700
Now Gaia Entertainment has sent a press release to media nationwide.

189
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,420
The media has been misled to our disadvantage.

190
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,640
I have now found the best lawyer in the industry

191
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,440
But no matter how high the price I offer

192
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,740
No one dares to take this case.

193
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,380
Even the lawyer we used to work with said he had some unspeakable secrets.

194
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,180
This is Lin Qingyang's first step to completely ban us.

195
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,580
I guess it will get more severe in the future.

196
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,380
But he became more anxious

197
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,740
The more likely it is to have flaws

198
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,360
so

199
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,140
On the one hand, you should actively contact a lawyer.

200
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,460
On the other hand, we start from the media

201
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,460
I don't believe that Lin Jinyang can cover up everything.

202
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,300
Shut up everyone

203
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,820
Okay, I'll go to the town now.

204
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,580
But why didn't the town come?

205
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,340
I used him and he probably won't come back again. Why?

206
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,340
Um

207
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,180
What's happening here

208
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,220
How did I get tied up like this?

209
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,120
ah

210
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,900
Gucci County, you are so sweet to prevent me from going to the crew

211
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,940
But don't forget that I'm a great god in the world of wilderness survival.

212
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,340
The first step is to find my tool box under the bed.

213
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,560
Let the Teng Teng come more violently

214
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,900
Roll over girl

215
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,160
ah

216
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,420
How come it doesn't hurt at all?

217
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,460
Ah, Gucci, you are very thoughtful.

218
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,320
etc.

219
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,620
This is how you can imagine it, right?

220
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,720
ah

221
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,420
Ah Gucci

222
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,940
I've taken the toolbox with me.

223
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,400
And all the sharp objects around you, such as scissors

224
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,980
Small light key

225
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,580
Took all of them away

226
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,140
The water and food are on the table. Don't worry. I'll be back after dark to get you out of town.

227
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,860
Have a good rest

228
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,220
OK OK

229
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,180
You really inspired my universe.

230
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,820
Hey Xu Zhen, you must calm down and think about it now.

231
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,380
affim

232
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,700
There are some places that are ignored by the stubborn army.

233
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,840
yeah

234
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,780
Only girls can buy this.

235
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,139
Um

236
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:20,378
See you later if you don't eat chicken

237
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:23,738
October

238
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,099
How do I feel

239
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,940
My back feels chilly

240
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,060
Hey, you don't have a fever, do you?

241
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,020
How can it be

242
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,780
No, come on, come on.

243
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,620
This should be a

244
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,540
Sorry to bother you. It's time to rest.

245
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,000
This is hey hey hey stay away from me

246
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,620
Hahaha OK OK

247
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,380
What's wrong with you? You look listless.

248
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,100
Xiaofei, I'm almost suffocating because of what happened recently

249
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,620
Gu Zhijun also tried to protect me

250
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,380
I am now completely forced to isolate myself

251
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,580
But at a time like this, how could I hide alone and let him take the risk alone?

252
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,660
But I really tried everything.

253
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,800
It's still difficult to even get close

254
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,580
What do you think I should do?

255
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,580
How could Chi Jungao be like this? You are a tomboy.

256
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,760
ah

257
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,700
Love can easily make people lose their minds

258
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,640
Wait a moment

259
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,880
Today is the 93rd scene

260
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,700
So there is still a way

261
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,020
What do you want to do

262
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,600
You should get familiar with this play carefully.

263
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,020
This scene is about Sister Ziqing and Sister Yu turning into a mummy that can't walk

264
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,660
After going through so much hardship, Chi Jun finally found Sister Ziqing.

265
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,260
Fortunately, the person who cleaned the lotus seed was my sister.

266
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,580
so

267
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,660
You found the right person

268
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,580
Ah wait a minute

269
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,140
I don't quite understand what you mean.

270
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,660
you mean

271
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,300
I will play the mummy.

272
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,900
ah

273
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,100
Oh my god.

274
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,820
Hum hum

275
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,900
Teacher Xiaofei, you really know me best.

276
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,460
Gu Zhijun, let's see where you can block this time

277
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,260
Yeah

278
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,180
Hahaha

279
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,840
lead

280
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,100
The substitute girl seems to have some problems today.

281
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,740
It doesn't matter. It doesn't affect the video.

282
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,220
Prepare for the show

283
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,140
Oh my god, what's happening in Hong Kong today?

284
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,460
I can't believe this is tolerated.

285
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,020
This scene is you discover this

286
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,080
Finally found by you

287
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,420
I know you believe

288
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,340
It's OK

289
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,380
All departments in place

290
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,060
Are you ready?

291
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,140
2014 action

292
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,700
I've been looking for so many years

293
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,820
finally found you

294
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,780
Gu Zhijun, you should hug me now

295
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,740
From this moment

296
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,460
From this second on

297
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,180
I will never leave you again

298
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,260
Not even half a step

299
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,460
from now on

300
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
I will never leave you again

301
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,400
You have always stood in front of me to protect me. From now on, I have decided to fight side by side with you.

302
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,220
So don't push me away again.

303
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,820
Why are you filming the scene?

304
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,960
Why are you biting me?

305
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,780
This is my first time kissing someone so I'm still a little unskilled

306
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,520
dad

307
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,620
I remember when I was a kid

308
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,340
I've been haunting you

309
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,060
Don't let you go out

310
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,340
I want you to stay at home with me

311
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,580
But at that time you said to me

312
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,460
In the adult world

313
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,660
There are many things

314
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,020
It's what you have to do

315
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,300
What's in this USB drive?

316
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,140
Enough for me to destroy my brother myself

317
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,900
but

318
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,220
If I don't hand him over

319
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,940
More people will be hurt

320
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,880
dad

321
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,260
You said how should I choose?

322
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,060
Wake up!

323
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,140
actually

324
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,780
By now

325
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,500
I already have some ideas in mind

326
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,220
But I don't know if I'm doing the right thing.

327
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,060
But it's already like this

328
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,740
I now

329
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,300
Just give it a try.

330
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Balls

331
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,980
How about it? Your brother didn't make things difficult for you, did he?

332
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,860
Don't worry, my brother can't do anything to me without you.

333
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,640
You are rare.

334
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,420
I've never seen you care about me so much.

335
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,560
Reporting the case

336
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,500
Thanks to you

337
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,780
Otherwise, we would all be in the hospital.

338
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,860
Tell me what you want.

339
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,220
I will satisfy you

340
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,440
Minor repair

341
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,020
We haven't heard from you in the past two days. We are so worried. Are you okay?

342
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,540
Wu Shijun, does what you just said still count?

343
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,480
What

344
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,000
Didn't you say that as long as I make a request?

345
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,740
I will agree to any request.

346
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,080
No matter what you ask

347
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,500
I will satisfy you

348
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,060
Then lend me Xiaozhen for 10 minutes.

349
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,200
Why

350
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,860
Xiaozhen, I have something to tell you.

351
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,300
Is there anything that can't be said here?

352
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,940
I want to say goodbye to Xiao Chen

353
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,540
The final farewell

354
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,080
Only 10 minutes

355
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,300
Pay attention to the time

356
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,420
Why did you suddenly bring me here?

357
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,840
Small town

358
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,060
Do you remember this?

359
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,420
Remember

360
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,100
This lamp is so cute

361
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,140
It would be a perfect match if it could be placed next to my small specimen door

362
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,340
Sister will definitely win you back.

363
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,700
How could I not remember

364
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,540
If it weren't for some people, this little Deng would be mine.

365
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,680
Small blog

366
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,100
Then you know why I tried so hard to get him.

367
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,980
Because I know you like

368
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,980
So I want to face

369
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,100
Give it to you personally

370
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,380
But at that time

371
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,460
The storyteller suddenly appeared

372
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,580
I hesitated for less than a second.

373
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,300
Alas, it is this second of hesitation

374
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,100
Let me miss you

375
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,460
Xiaoxiu

376
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,180
Why are you talking about this all of a sudden?

377
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,860
Xiaozhen, do you know?

378
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,380
I used to see these things in the prop room

379
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,700
I think it's really weird.

380
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,860
but now

381
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,100
Because of you I now feel those skulls

382
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,140
Everything becomes very romantic

383
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,940
But

384
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,100
Missed romance

385
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,020
Can only become a memory

386
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,180
A little regret

387
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,780
But it doesn't matter.

388
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,460
I've been here for 10 years

389
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,860
I can still see you

390
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,940
It's my luck already.

391
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:52,140
But are you lucky to have a troublesome carrier like me?

392
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,980
How about it? Do you think my confession today is so cool?

393
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,060
Do you want to consider changing your heart?

394
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,120
Hey what?

395
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,300
You've been being narcissistic all this time.

396
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,160
Really handsome for only three seconds

397
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:11,300
I almost got tricked by you. So what on earth did Mr. Lin come to see me about today?

398
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,680
What can I do?

399
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,880
Of course, I'm here to bring you memories.

400
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,140
Take it well.

401
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,220
ah

402
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,220
Hey

403
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,060
What's stored in this USB drive?

404
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,740
This is the recording evidence of you and Gu Shijun that is enough to move against my brother.

405
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,420
There's no point in me keeping it.

406
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,060
I thought about it for a long time

407
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,980
I can only leave it to you.

408
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,800
Xiaoxiu, you are a person who values ​​family ties so much

409
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,000
If I take this evidence from you today to deal with Mr. Lin

410
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,520
Then you will be torn to pieces by your own guilt and pain in the future

411
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,780
Then I won against Mr. Lin.

412
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,900
I care more about whether you will be sad

413
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,500
So I can't take this USB drive back.

414
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,420
but

415
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,660
I received such a great gift from you today.

416
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,820
I'm going to give you a gift too.

417
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,760
Dangdang

418
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,500
This piece of amber is really amazing

419
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,320
With the protection of this amber

420
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,780
I not only got through the hardest days

421
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,300
I also found my favorite person and some of your best friends.

422
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,980
but

423
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,060
Now I feel

424
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,380
You need this hot pot more than I do.

425
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,500
Believe me

426
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,280
good

427
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,380
I accepted it

428
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,120
That

429
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,660
I'm leaving

430
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,520
Xiaoxiu

431
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,380
Just left like that

432
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,540
I'm really unwilling

433
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,020
Now my wish has come true.

434
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,980
It's time to really go.

435
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,500
Thank you, Soo Jin

436
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,860
Mr. Lin now has one more uncertainty factor for us.

437
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,580
That's your brother, Mr. Kobayashi.

438
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,780
Should I not be able to do this next?

439
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,580
You remember

440
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,740
My bottom line is

441
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,940
No matter what happens

442
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,820
I must not let my brother get hurt.

443
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,640
yes

444
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,860
Lin Xiyang

445
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,860
Are you asking about the airtight window in this world?

446
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,240
You locked me up here

447
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,500
No one knows about the bad things you did?

448
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,580
Ahhhhh

449
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,500
There are people here

450
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,239
There are people here

451
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,799
Help! Open the door!

452
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,380
Help! Help!

453
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,539
Who are you

454
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,459
What do you want to do

455
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:38,079
you

456
00:34:38,518 --> 00:34:39,158
what are you doing

457
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,299
who are you

458
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,819
I advise you to be quiet.

459
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,339
Otherwise, I can't guarantee that I won't hurt your pretty face.

460
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,620
Are you hungry during Lantern Festival?

461
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,840
Come

462
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,380
Come and eat bread

463
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,320
Lantern Festival

464
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,540
At this time, you should be with the children in kindergarten.

465
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,100
But dad left you alone in the room

466
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,740
Dad, this is wrong.

467
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,180
sorry

468
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,660
Dad, it's okay.

469
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,740
Why does Dad still look so unhappy?

470
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,160
No idea

471
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,900
You said your father took you away like this

472
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,300
Put aside all the right and wrong

473
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,740
Let things get worse

474
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,940
Is this right, Dad?

475
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,300
Dad, what do you mean?

476
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,580
Mr. Lin, I have brought Miss Qin back. It is great that I have placed her next door.

477
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,220
Ziqing knows too much

478
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,900
It's safer to stay here

479
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,820
You must find a way to keep an eye on him.

480
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,740
We must not let what happened to Liu Weicheng happen again

481
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,980
In order to avoid disastrous consequences

482
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,240
Yes, I just issued a statement yesterday saying that I will stand by your side.

483
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,380
And paid you medical expenses and mental damages

484
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,100
Excuse me, are you here for show today?

485
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,860
Hey

486
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,060
Husband, husband, please say a few words.

487
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,280
Am I doing

488
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,020
Show everyone to judge for themselves

489
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,500
No one will risk their own personal safety

490
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,340
As hype

491
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,620
I thought this was Xu Zhen's revenge.

492
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,500
But originally he held the army

493
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,300
The mastermind

494
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,380
In order to prevent the perpetrators from going unpunished

495
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,700
In order to avoid more people

496
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,500
No more innocent people being harmed

497
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,220
I must stand up

498
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,500
Clear everyone's name

499
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,540
Restore Gaia's innocence

500
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,280
Why

501
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,720
Hey, Old Wu

502
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,020
Let's say a few words, Lao Wu

503
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,940
Is there anything that money can't solve?

504
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,420
Fame or wealth?

505
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,220
In the end, I still played you around with applause

506
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,060
Hu Zhijun

507
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,740
Before you fight me

508
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,540
Should we take a closer look at the chips in our hands?

509
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,220
It's okay. It's over.

510
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,580
Since you love being a hero so much

511
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,260
Then open your eyes

512
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:22,460
Take a good look at how this hero of yours was destroyed.
