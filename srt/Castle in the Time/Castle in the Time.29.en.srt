1
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
Wang Dao

2
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,460
You really have perseverance.

3
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,340
I really want to know what I should do.

4
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,340
Only then can you stop harassing me completely

5
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,780
Hey Zixia

6
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,540
How can you say such a strange thing?

7
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,700
Here

8
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,820
How can I harass you?

9
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,300
I really mean it.

10
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,500
You said you are the number one lady in Gaia

11
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,520
Until now, I still don't have a place to belong.

12
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,300
Can I not be anxious?

13
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,940
Not as good as

14
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,820
If you follow me and spread the word, we'll be considered a talented man and a beautiful woman.

15
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,840
Director Wang, I dare not follow you

16
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,860
Li Qianer was so devoted to you at the beginning

17
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,980
In the end, you kicked me out.

18
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,520
Now I have nothing but scandals

19
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,420
I can't even play a supporting role.

20
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,460
I wouldn't dare take that risk.

21
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,860
Your family and I are fake.

22
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,540
Who told him not to die?

23
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,060
You have to go against Gaia

24
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,300
That's why he ended up like this.

25
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,260
To put it bluntly, I am approaching

26
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,420
The next step

27
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,460
This boss gives you money to talk

28
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,300
You have to say it

29
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,580
This is different from you and me.

30
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,600
What did you say

31
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,700
Can you say that again

32
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,500
I said I took Mr. Lin's money to run errands for him.

33
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,700
not enough

34
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,580
I'm sincere to you

35
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,700
Please don't let me go

36
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,640
Qingyang

37
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,620
This email

38
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,940
You must like it.

39
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
cheers

40
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,260
Ji Yang, look, this is the theme I chose for TF Milan. What do you think?

41
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,680
Do you want to change it?

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
Change it to

43
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,820
Why do I think it's good?

44
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,220
Then look at that wedding dress

45
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,660
Like it

46
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,260
Um

47
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,580
Excuse me

48
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,940
Lie Qian and I, that's fake

49
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,060
Who told him not to die?

50
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,300
I have to fight against the dumbness

51
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,500
To put it bluntly, I am Lin Qingyang

52
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,860
A move of chess before leaving

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,820
I'm giving you money for free so you can say whatever you want.

54
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,300
You have to say something

55
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Xiaoyan

56
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,900
I'm really sorry

57
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,540
I've been really busy with work during this period.

58
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,220
Fortunately, you are by my side

59
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,180
Everything about the wedding dress is up to you.

60
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,340
You decide.

61
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,860
Well, I have something else to do.

62
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,100
I'll go first, you go slowly

63
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,380
I am leaving

64
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,980
What happened to the recording?

65
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,860
I really thought you were a smart woman.

66
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,660
I was just doubting

67
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,540
But I didn't expect that you, Lin Jinyang, would be so anxious.

68
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,100
It seems

69
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,300
This is true

70
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,780
What do you want? Tell me.

71
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,800
All your ambitions and desires are now with me

72
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,700
What qualifications do you have to negotiate with me?

73
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,340
What do you want?

74
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,460
Don't you know what I want?

75
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,740
From the beginning till now, I have always wanted you

76
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,220
I've paid so much for you

77
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,640
But you turned around and married a woman who is inferior to me in every way.

78
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,559
I disagree

79
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,939
I don't allow

80
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,520
The person who marries you must be my neighbor

81
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,180
Love is the one I love personally

82
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,260
ha

83
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,660
Ha ha

84
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,140
Ha ha

85
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,660
Hahaha

86
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,960
ha

87
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,140
Hahaha

88
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,580
Don't come here by yourself

89
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,080
Lin

90
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,680
suggestion

91
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
Thank you for your hard work.

92
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,760
Let you come to the company with me

93
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,860
It doesn't matter. Accompanying you to work is also a kind of date. You are so nice.

94
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,220
Gu Zhijun

95
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Hello, Mr. Gu

96
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,060
Can you sign an autograph for me?

97
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,460
Of course you can

98
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,600
Oh, I actually saw Guo Zhijun.

99
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,180
Guo Zhijun also promised to sign

100
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:26,960
Where's your pen?

101
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,760
Lend me a moment

102
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,240
Jiayu, Gu Chijun is our company's artist

103
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,640
If you want an autograph

104
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,680
I'll ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs to prepare it for you later.

105
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,220
How can it be the same?

106
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,100
I saw Gu Chijun with my own eyes and got his autograph in person

107
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,460
This is what many people dream of.

108
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,760
Last time I saw Sister Ziqing

109
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,500
This time I met Gu Chijun again

110
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,560
All the male and female gods of your City of Time are gathered here

111
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,340
How can you miss this kind of party?

112
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,900
To get support from fans

113
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,380
I'm glad too

114
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,700
It's better like this

115
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,700
Let's take a photo together

116
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,360
I printed out the photos

117
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,940
Sign your name and send it to you

118
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,620
Is it really possible

119
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,060
Can you write a blessing for me on it?

120
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,900
Well, I wrote it to Chen Jiayi

121
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,700
To be happy with the one you love

122
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,180
no problem

123
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,220
Jiayi, Mr. Gu is very busy, please don't disturb him.

124
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,860
Hey, hey, hey, remember to give it to me

125
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,500
Hey, hey, hey, definitely

126
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,140
Master

127
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,020
Please help me find out about Lin Qingyang and Cheng Jiayi's promotion status

128
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,340
You need to investigate Lin

129
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,220
Why is there a family ceremony?

130
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,340
Didn't we report a scandal about Lin Jinyang and Bai Fumei before?

131
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,420
I always feel that this matter

132
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,060
It's not just a suspected love affair

133
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,060
You mean they have a special relationship?

134
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,700
But who in this circle doesn't know that Qin Ziqing has a close relationship with Gaia's boss?

135
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,340
It can be said that Gaia's boss has collapsed, right?

136
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,740
precisely because of this

137
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,540
I wanted to investigate this matter.

138
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,460
ah

139
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,680
I just said it

140
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,720
This man

141
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,420
It's all the same

142
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,220
New love in hand, old love is unforgettable

143
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,940
To be honest, do you still have feelings for your child?

144
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,520
you

145
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,140
I love Xu Zhen with all my heart now

146
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,140
If it's because of what you said

147
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,260
Let Xu Zhen have any misunderstanding about me

148
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,020
I tell you

149
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,260
Even if your

150
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,880
Failure to do one's job

151
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,240
Don't worry, boss. You must take good care of your health.

152
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,040
Take care

153
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,100
I'll go to the tutorial first

154
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,180
Hello, this is it

155
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,540
The news is correct

156
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,420
Lin Xinyang plans to propose today

157
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,380
I'm leaving now

158
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,620
Fusheng put the wine on the table. That's right.

159
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,500
It would be better if the gauze is longer

160
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,940
A little longer, yes, yes, yes

161
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,820
Lengthen it a bit

162
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,880
Good evening,

163
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,820
Lengthen it a bit

164
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,220
Arrange the gauze later.

165
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,420
Hey, take these over.

166
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,980
Put it over there with them.

167
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,500
Mr. Lin's driver has already delivered Miss Cheng's dress.

168
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,940
Miss Cheng will be there soon. The proposal scene has been decorated according to Miss Cheng's usual preferences.

169
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,500
Do you still need to prepare anything?

170
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,380
No need for anything

171
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,140
Everything is ready for the proposal.

172
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,220
Just clear out these irrelevant people.

173
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,300
Hello Mr. Lin

174
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,920
No

175
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,320
Stop, stop, stop, stop

176
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,860
We want to send troops to Gucci

177
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,640
I heard he drinks coffee here at night.

178
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,200
Miss Gucci Army must be in Gucci Army

179
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,360
We want to send troops to Gucci

180
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,300
Gucci Army

181
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,560
We want to call Gu Chijun

182
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,700
Gu Chengjun doesn't want it

183
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,740
what happened

184
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,860
Sorry everyone

185
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,920
Gu Chijun is not here

186
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,680
Please leave

187
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,820
The city guards must be there

188
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,500
I just sent a tweet

189
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,800
You all found this.

190
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,460
We love you so much, we can find you wherever you are

191
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,200
Thanks

192
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,980
Please pay more attention to the City of Time

193
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,020
I'm so sorry, everyone.

194
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,520
Since today is Mr. Gu's private time,

195
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,500
So please try not to disturb

196
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,360
I'm so sorry, please make way.

197
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,960
Thank you for letting me go

198
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,760
so

199
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,460
Considering parents

200
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,300
Please make way for a moment.

201
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,700
Make way for a moment. Make way for a moment.

202
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
What a coincidence!

203
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,580
Mr. Lin is also here

204
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,300
It seems that this place has been carefully decorated.

205
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,320
oh

206
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,700
WED me WED me

207
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,720
Mr. Lin is proposing marriage.

208
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,800
Mr. Lin, are you going to propose tonight?

209
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,020
Could you please tell me who you are proposing to?

210
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,840
Yes, yes, yes.

211
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,960
Reveal it

212
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,760
Excuse me

213
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,200
This is Mr. Lin's private matter.

214
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,180
Not convenient to disclose

215
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,820
Look, it's Qin Ziqing

216
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,260
Qin Ziqing is here Miss Qin

217
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,160
Miss Qin Miss Qin

218
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,740
Why are you here?

219
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:09,378
Miss, look here.

220
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:11,058
Miss, look here.

221
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:12,079
Excuse me

222
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,819
Please let me go first, thank you

223
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,739
Come on, let's move.

224
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,739
Hey hey hey

225
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,260
If this surprise

226
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,780
Or maybe the reporter knew it before me?

227
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,380
A little bit regretful

228
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,420
Mr. Lin, are you going to propose to Miss Qin Ziqing today? Yes, yes, yes

229
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,340
Say a few words

230
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,620
Mr. Lin, your ring

231
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,540
Who told you to take out this ring now?

232
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,260
Isn't this what I've always wanted?

233
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,320
Jingyang

234
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,820
Thank you for being so attentive.

235
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,660
Remember all my preferences

236
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,860
I am really touched

237
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,060
Great Etiquette Great Etiquette Great Etiquette

238
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:26,080
Great Etiquette Great Etiquette Great Etiquette Great Etiquette Great Etiquette Great Etiquette

239
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,540
Thank you very much

240
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,940
In this most touching moment, you are here to witness it together.

241
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,260
Zixuan

242
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,980
I hope you don't regret it

243
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,900
marry me

244
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,940
I do not regret

245
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,920
That's good. Congratulations to Mr. Lin for proposing successfully.

246
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,660
But the media reported that you and Miss Cheng were in love. Do you have any explanation?

247
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,200
Yeah, do you have any explanation?

248
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,660
I also want to hear your explanation

249
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,820
Ms. Chen

250
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,700
Miss Chen is here

251
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,320
Miss Chen, please say a few words. Please say a few words.

252
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
Do you have anything to say?

253
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,140
Miss Chen, I also want to hear your explanation

254
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,620
The previous news was all news

255
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,540
Of course not.

256
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,720
Like us in the entertainment industry

257
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,300
It's normal to have some gossips

258
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,580
You're used to public figures like us.

259
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,340
I know that everything Jinyang did was to protect our relationship.

260
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,620
so

261
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,660
I am also very grateful that he has always been with me and kept a low profile.

262
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,580
Please, please, please

263
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,920
Over

264
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,000
Jiayi

265
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,180
do not Cry

266
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,420
Otherwise, it would be a waste of such exquisite makeup and such a beautiful dress.

267
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,340
He gave me this dress.

268
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,340
But he doesn't belong to me anymore

269
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,260
Before entrusting your life

270
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,380
Isn't it nice to see a man's true face?

271
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,580
You believe me

272
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,860
Your happiness is definitely not with that man

273
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,900
For you

274
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
Cheng Jiayi

275
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,340
You will definitely be happy if you are so beautiful

276
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,380
Miss Gu, why are you so nice to me?

277
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,580
Because you are my fan

278
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,340
As a good idol

279
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,100
Shouldn't be like a light

280
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,580
When fans are down and out

281
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,620
Into their hearts?

282
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,900
Thank you

283
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,940
Can I ask you for another hug?

284
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,180
Wow, that's really the entrance.

285
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,260
Hahaha look, look

286
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,520
Wow, big show, come in, come in, come in, oh yo

287
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,460
Hey hey hey

288
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,080
Mr. Gu Zhijun, have you separated from the civilian girl and are together with Miss Cheng? Yes, yes.

289
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,140
Don't misunderstand.

290
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,620
He is my fan

291
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,420
I am still true to my girlfriend

292
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,540
I just gave him an encouraging hug.

293
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,400
That's not necessarily true.

294
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,160
Story is not only a big star

295
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,440
Still a good man

296
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,220
Who doesn't want to have a good man?

297
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,180
Qu Zhan, you must hold on to the story tightly

298
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,780
Otherwise, I can't tell in the future.

299
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,780
Don't worry

300
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,340
My feelings for Xu Zhen will never change

301
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,060
Xu Zhen, you have to believe me

302
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,820
Zixuan

303
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,540
I hope you don't regret it

304
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,660
I do not regret

305
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,580
Do this in person

306
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,260
I don't know if I will regret it later.

307
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,380
In fact, Qin Ziqing is a person who knows what he wants.

308
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,300
All we can do is bless him.

309
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,020
In fact, Lin Jinyang has always been very cautious in doing things.

310
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,160
This news today was also told to me by my parents.

311
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,540
For this forced marriage

312
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,660
Parent-child relationship also took a long time to prepare

313
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,900
ah

314
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,420
This is indeed his style.

315
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,460
How did you come

316
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
Are you reluctant to separate from me?

317
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,900
Not even for a second.

318
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,360
Look at the entire Weibo, your message has been flooded

319
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,680
All the news about you being besieged by fans at the club

320
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,780
And

321
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,600
Weibo said that Mr. Lin proposed to Qin Ziqing

322
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,580
is that true

323
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,300
Does it matter whether someone proposes to you?

324
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,260
As Gu Chijun's girlfriend

325
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,360
Shouldn't you focus all your attention on me?

326
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,800
Well, what about me?

327
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,700
I was worried about you. After all, Gu Da Ming Xing is the boyfriend of a beautiful and kind-hearted rich girl.

328
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,140
What rich girl?

329
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,860
Yes, Cheng Jiayi

330
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,460
ah

331
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,220
That was just a misunderstanding

332
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,260
I have explained this to the reporters.

333
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,560
Gu Chijun and Cheng Jiayi are very close

334
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,700
Gu Chijun and Cheng Jiayi look good together

335
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,980
There is also a close photo of you two.

336
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,520
Why

337
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,300
It was just an encouraging hug.

338
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,260
Do not think too much

339
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,420
So, can't you just not hug me?

340
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,980
Now you believe it?

341
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,900
That was the distance between idols and fans.

342
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,340
Now is the distance between boyfriend and girlfriend

343
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,940
You are jealous

344
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,820
Oh, Gu Chijun, who is jealous?

345
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,980
Now I learn to be jealous

346
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,980
I am very happy

347
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,960
Shi Yu, hey hey

348
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,580
Bring me my gift.

349
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,500
You are sure

350
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,240
certainly

351
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,300
OK

352
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,300
Since you don't want to leave me for a second

353
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,660
Then let me accompany you

354
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,660
Give you Gu Chijun

355
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,440
One vs one person

356
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,620
Don't be too touched

357
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,380
How narcissistic do you have to be to come up with this idea?

358
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,440
Swear to me I had no involvement

359
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,300
what's the situation

360
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,500
Give you two minutes

361
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,500
Keep in touch with the soldier-shaped version of Gu Chi.

362
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,700
Congratulations Mr. Lin

363
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,480
I can tell

364
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,100
Mr. Lin exudes a happy aura from head to toe.

365
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,940
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

366
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,820
You used your identity to attract the media

367
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,980
Gu Chijun, you should think clearly

368
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,940
There is absolutely no benefit for you in going against me, Lin Jinyang.

369
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,900
As a serious corporate artist

370
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,100
How could I joke with my boss?

371
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,660
As Xu Zhen's boyfriend

372
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,140
I won't let Xu Zhen get hurt at all.

373
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,020
As a man

374
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,460
The most important thing is to keep your promise

375
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,620
What qualifications do you have to say this to me?

376
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,380
You thought today would go according to your plan.

377
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,980
To notify all media

378
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,640
Suppress the news of today's proposal.

379
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,460
The news of the boss, Miss Qin Ziqing's proposal, has spread on the online media platform.

380
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,840
The fans of the Stubborn Army also shot various videos

381
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm afraid we can't hold it.

382
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,900
I just didn't expect

383
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,780
You even took the fans' reactions into account.

384
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,540
The only thing to blame is Mr. Lin's great charm.

385
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,540
I guess this time

386
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,140
Video of you proposing to Qin Ziqing

387
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,860
It should be ranked first on all the hot search lists.

388
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,740
Guo Zhijun

389
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,700
You better pray for the consequences of this

390
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,780
Compared to myself

391
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,420
I would rather pray

392
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,060
Happy wedding, Mr. Lin

393
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,700
Li Jinyang

394
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,660
etc.

395
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,940
Check Jinyang

396
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,340
Jinyang

397
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,840
Jin Yao

398
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,420
Lin Jinyang driving

399
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,820
Ziqing, stop chasing me

400
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,620
No pursuit

401
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,940
My fiancé left me, can I not chase him?

402
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,500
You don't really have to do this.

403
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,980
Are you going to let me watch Lin Jinyang propose to another woman with this?

404
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,560
No

405
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,660
impossible

406
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,780
I can buy the ring myself

407
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,940
But when the time comes, you still have to be with me, Qin Ziqing.

408
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,860
Farewell to a woman

409
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,780
I do not need

410
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,400
Purple

411
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,260
Love can't be forced

412
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,580
No matter what

413
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,980
I hope you can be happy

414
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,900
Of course I will be happy

415
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,700
Keep it well

416
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,300
Oops, the car is too small. This brand can't fit in. See?

417
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,460
Brother, can you help me break it in the middle?

418
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,060
Um, no

419
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,600
Didn't this break my waist?

420
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,740
If he wanted to break you, he wouldn't do it this way.

421
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,700
Yo ah oops

422
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,980
Oh, sorry.

423
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,400
ah

424
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,440
There are real people here

425
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,540
Don't worry about the brand.

426
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,620
This is what you said, Gu Zhijun

427
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,540
When did I say that?

428
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,460
sorry

429
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,700
You will definitely be happy

430
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,220
Let's have breakfast

431
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,180
Xu Zhe, come here

432
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,380
What are you doing?

433
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,660
Brother Shiyu asked me to bring you breakfast. Now I have to go back to the production team.

434
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,300
You ran a school in Shanghai

435
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,460
Why go to the crew?

436
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,100
I still have work to do and the crew's progress cannot be affected by me.

437
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,900
Hey, sit down.

438
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,180
I have an important play today.

439
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,020
I need someone to help me act.

440
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,420
Shi Yu is not here

441
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,020
As my girlfriend

442
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,860
This task is best for you.

443
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,800
The professor is packing his luggage in his room

444
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,440
The assistant pushed the door open and immediately realized that the professor was leaving.

445
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,520
The assistant is reluctant

446
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,700
While talking to the professor

447
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,660
Hug the professor

448
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,700
Kissed

449
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,540
Do you really want to kiss?

450
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,140
of course

451
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,220
As a professional actor

452
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,740
What is a kiss scene?

453
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,940
The bed scene also has to be performed

454
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,060
In order to ensure the performance effect

455
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,340
It's all real performances

456
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,640
This is the basis of being an actor.

457
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,580
This quality

458
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,180
Come on, let's get started.

459
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,940
Professor, are you really leaving?

460
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,220
right

461
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,460
I'm going to be away for a while

462
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,300
Because my girlfriend needs me

463
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,460
Professor Me

464
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,380
Why did it stop?

465
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,140
Oh, this is too embarrassing.

466
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,180
The script says you should pounce and steady me, okay?

467
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,300
Professor Me

468
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,480
The script says you swoop in and steady me

469
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,300
Not swooping in and dazed

470
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,100
The director and screenwriter will go crazy if you change the script like this

471
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,980
Can you show some professionalism?

472
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,720
But I'm not a professional actor.

473
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,980
But you are the girlfriend of a professional actor

474
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,540
Stay with me day and night

475
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,900
Didn't you learn a bit of professionalism from me?

476
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,940
Have you ever had to act to this extent with others before?

477
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,300
In the past, it was always Shi Yu and I who acted together.

478
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,180
This kind of play is for him

479
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,540
Small Note

480
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,340
This isn't a big deal, eh?

481
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,660
What's all the fuss about?

482
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,500
Give you one more chance

483
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,500
Oh, Shi Yu will be here soon. Let him help you. I have to go back to the crew first.

484
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,060
You changed this scene.

485
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,580
You're not professional enough.

486
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,420
Xiaohui can't do this anymore

487
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,540
Ancient Poetry

488
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,060
Just want to take a few days off

489
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,700
Just make me such a big stove

490
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,620
I don't know what you think

491
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,860
Dating with someone in the company and using it as a cover for starting a family

492
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
You put your mind on this.

493
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,000
Lin Zhiyang, who told you to do this?

494
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,460
Without me, my relationship with Qin Ziqing would have ended long ago.

495
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,620
I really want to marry Chen Jiayi

496
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,520
I was going to propose to him that day.

497
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,140
I still want to propose to Jiayi

498
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,820
Mr. Cheng called me.

499
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,700
To break up your engagement with him.

500
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,100
Ah, that's okay.

501
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,720
I can explain it to Jiayi.

502
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,300
We can definitely get this game back.

503
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,540
As for Qin Zixing

504
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,700
I will fix it

505
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,880
The worst thing in the world to do with a woman is to never use the word "solve"

506
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,380
You've been together for so many years

507
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,120
You know what he needs

508
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,340
Do I know

509
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,340
But he's not the right person

510
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,820
Dad, don't worry.

511
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,560
I will not let Gaia miss this opportunity

512
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,500
Don't underestimate this woman.

513
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,180
The more you give to him

514
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,740
The more intense his reaction

515
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,540
It will have a greater negative impact on our Gaia Entertainment

516
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,740
To cover teeth

517
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,580
You guys should get married.

518
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,500
Dad, I don't agree.

519
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,660
If you don't agree, why do you give me this kind of news?

520
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,360
I'm so disappointed in you.

521
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,500
About inheritance

522
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,060
Let's stop for now and get married obediently

523
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,900
Get things done

524
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,300
After the calm

525
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,900
Let's think about it.

526
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,940
Ah, listen to me, no need to say more

527
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,220
What are you going to do?

528
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,160
Get up, get up, do you want to come?

529
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,860
You are not allowed to open

530
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,160
I can go wherever I want.

531
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,620
It has nothing to do with you

532
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,340
Get up!

533
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,760
Mommy, mommy, are you okay? Mommy, mommy, how are you?

534
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,740
Mom, are you okay?

535
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,140
That's what you did to my mom many years ago.

536
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,780
Now you treat me like this again

537
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,700
It seems that I am too soft-hearted.

538
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,500
You should understand why I called you.

539
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,580
I understand. I don't understand.

540
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,780
It depends on what Mr. Lin said.

541
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,740
We've been fighting for so long.

542
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,540
There are some things you should know

543
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,380
I just want the company

544
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,020
As for you and Xu Zhen

545
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,220
I'm not interested

546
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,300
From the beginning

547
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,500
You don't have to be interested in both of us.

548
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,180
I admit

549
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,580
You are the toughest opponent I have ever faced.

550
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,620
I am now willing to declare a truce

551
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,300
But you have to promise me one thing.

552
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,500
You must take Xu Zhen away within 24 hours

553
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,220
From now on, I will no longer ask about the things I should love

554
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,920
As for the penalty for breach of contract in the City of Time

555
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,020
you do not need to worry

556
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,540
I'll handle you.

557
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,140
You should think clearly

558
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,780
After all, I believe

559
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,660
I am also the toughest opponent you have ever met.

560
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,380
If you want to squeeze out all the things that need to be suppressed

561
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,700
For this reason

562
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,060
For the company

563
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,260
What will I do?

564
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,220
I think you can't bear it

565
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,820
Xu Zhen couldn't bear it even more.

566
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,900
Judging from your expression

567
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,980
You promised

568
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,940
That's good

569
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,300
Ah hum

570
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,660
Liang Daoha

571
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,700
Director Liang, you came just in time.

572
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,020
Director Liang knows me very well.

573
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,000
So you don't have to doubt the weight of what I just said.

574
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:21,800
Ask Director Liang

575
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,820
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

576
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,180
Red Army, you better leave quickly.

577
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,140
I will help you find a way for your later parts in City of Time

578
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,920
If you don't leave

579
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,140
Xu Zhen might really be in danger of his life

580
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,580
Even if you are not afraid of Lin Jing

581
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,860
But everything is impossible to prevent.

582
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,020
Li Jingyang is like a poisonous snake

583
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,980
Will bite at any time

584
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,140
Don't worry, Liang Tao

585
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,940
For Xu Zhen's safety

586
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,540
I'll take him away.

587
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,540
Hey, that

588
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,480
This is the crew

589
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,320
I am safe

590
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,820
You don't have to follow me.

591
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,860
Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way.

592
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:33,960
Get out of the way

593
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,300
Stop feeding

594
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,320
What are you doing?

595
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,140
Didn't you see we were filming?

596
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,760
Where is the factory? Where is the factory?

597
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,580
Where are the people?

598
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Why don't you deal with it quickly?

599
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,440
sorry

600
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,640
These people behind me are not extras

601
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,740
He's my bodyguard.

602
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,920
Bodyguard No

603
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,440
Who hired this bodyguard?

604
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,160
It delayed our filming progress.

605
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,820
Please ask them to leave first.

606
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,380
I sent these bodyguards to protect Xu Zhen.
