1
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,020
You are my sweetness

2
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,660
What are you going to do? Just cut it.

3
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,860
Did you cut it?

4
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,460
Come on, continue

5
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
come on

6
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,300
your world

7
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,440
ah

8
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,580
Oh

9
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,980
Oh, I'm on a blind date

10
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,420
Hey, what do you mean?

11
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,380
Didn't I tell you?

12
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,140
Keep you away from Xu Zhiyuan

13
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,680
Didn't I tell you that too?

14
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,200
Don't interfere with his private life.

15
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,880
How can I have a private life with him?

16
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,340
I'm doing this for his own good.

17
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,020
Because you two can't be together

18
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,220
Why can't we be together? Because I

19
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,480
I

20
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,900
Why drink?

21
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Dry

22
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,380
What to hand over

23
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,660
You've given me all the data. What else is there?

24
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,060
Ah, Xiao Zhang, you can't kill them all.

25
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,940
Junjun, please go over and take a look. Mr. Xiaolin and Brother Zhijun are in trouble.

26
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,820
After the setbacks, he will also fill me with love

27
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,140
You can live. Hey, this is not me. Hey, look.

28
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,180
you love me

29
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,040
?

30
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,900
What did you say

31
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,500
Are they both sick?

32
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,300
What? Are they both sick?

33
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,240
I'm sick haha

34
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,040
I told

35
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,320
How long do you

36
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,100
my love

37
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,220
Like a fire

38
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,820
Brother believes in you

39
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,020
As long as you work hard

40
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,980
It will definitely succeed hahahaha bro

41
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,960
Thank you for being so nice to me

42
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,460
I like you really

43
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,520
Daddy

44
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,000
elder brother

45
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,280
Give you a gift

46
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,900
What? A special gift?

47
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,740
Let me tell you, this is no ordinary sieve.

48
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,180
I see that every time I sieve it, it's different.

49
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,580
real

50
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,820
Such a precious gift

51
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,180
Sorry to receive

52
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,500
It's okay, brother loves you.

53
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,060
Bro, look at this

54
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,300
Oh, there's music at any time.

55
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,340
like or not

56
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,920
Give you this

57
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,900
Hahahahahaha

58
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,500
Oh, you are so nice.

59
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,760
Why

60
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,760
Yo

61
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,340
You are so nice to me

62
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,180
Oh, what should they do?

63
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,260
Brother Shi Yu, why don't you take the boss back and I'll take Xiao Xiu back?

64
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,780
Oh, Xu Zhen

65
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,660
It's too late. It's not safe to go back alone.

66
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,700
Hey, how about this?

67
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,840
Weishan and I are here to send Mr. Xiaolin back.

68
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,360
You and Qingyan, send Chijun back.

69
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,080
This way everyone can take care of each other

70
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,100
What do you think

71
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,260
ah

72
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,000
health

73
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,820
Well, do you believe in love at first sight?

74
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,380
I believe in paying a life for a death and paying a debt.

75
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Well

76
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,020
What you said makes sense.

77
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,060
Oh, by the way, how is your work now?

78
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,140
Is it hard?

79
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,940
You guys don't gossip at all.

80
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,420
Of course we worked hard.

81
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,660
What do you want to write every day?

82
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,780
Haha

83
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,300
In fact, it is fate that we can meet today

84
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,780
Um, I wonder if you have time this weekend. Can I treat you to a meal or a movie?

85
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,500
I don't have time. I haven't been able to find a topic for a month.

86
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
I have to continue working this weekend

87
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,540
Think carefully about what gossip you can report to me.

88
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,320
I've already taken some photos.

89
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,460
It was taken away by Xu Zhen again

90
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,060
This damn woman

91
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:52,820
Oh, by the way, is your name Zhang Zhang Shiyu or Shiyu?

92
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,080
Do you have any gossip you can tell me?

93
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:02,980
Hey, think about it carefully, for example, the past events between Gu Chijun and Qin Ziqing.

94
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,500
Also, for example, does Gu Chijun have someone he likes right now?

95
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,740
For example, does he have any shameful hobbies?

96
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,500
Do you drool or snore when you sleep?

97
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,700
What do you like to do in your spare time?

98
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,460
Just give me a little bit of quantity and it will be enough for me to complete the work.

99
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,960
Then I won't have to work overtime this weekend and can go home normally and we can go out for dinner.

100
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,500
After dinner, we can also go to the park and watch a movie. What do you think?

101
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,260
Ah, actually, he came down with a military rank.

102
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,320
He likes fitness, swimming, and building Lego models. When he sleeps, he never snores or drools.

103
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,260
And he is very nice to his fans

104
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,240
Work hard and memorize your lines

105
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,240
In my heart, he is really a perfect artist.

106
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,080
Insincere too untrue

107
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,900
Honestly, I'll let you tell me some gossip about him.

108
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,560
I didn't ask you to give the award speech for him.

109
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,700
Do you think that if our website is full of gossip, would anyone still be willing to read it?

110
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,700
Bad luck already

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,580
Well, I think I should just work overtime.

112
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,820
Hey, let's skip the weekend meal.

113
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,260
No, please think about it again.

114
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,780
Well, actually

115
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,900
Gu Chujun is your boss

116
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,460
I let you tell me his gossip in secret.

117
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,740
It doesn't seem to be very suitable, right?

118
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,980
Well, that's it.

119
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,500
Just send me some photos of his daily life.

120
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,260
It's the kind of private photos that other gossip websites don't usually capture.

121
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,700
Then I can hand him over to my boss.

122
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,900
My work is done.

123
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,580
I don't have to work overtime.

124
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,340
Okay, okay, I'll take pictures, I'll take pictures

125
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,580
I will definitely take a picture hahaha

126
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,560
Um

127
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,780
Go over there, sister. Look at what he looks like. How can your boss be so shameless?

128
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,540
daughter

129
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,560
oops

130
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,980
Well, think about what happened in the KTV just now.

131
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,540
It's really terrible, sister.

132
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,780
Quit your job.

133
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,480
If you can't find a job, no one will marry you.

134
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,060
I will support you forever

135
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,000
Resign

136
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,500
I will quit tomorrow

137
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,000
The boss is actually a nice person, he just got drunk today

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,700
Do you know that the truth comes out after drinking?

139
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,560
Yang

140
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,020
Look at Yang

141
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,380
And that Mr. Kobayashi?

142
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,940
Carry him to the bedroom.

143
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,180
Oh, it's so heavy when I wake up

144
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,100
You are so deep

145
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,980
Ahhhh

146
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,260
Out of Print Tai Chi 010189 Xiao Yan

147
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,420
Come over here and help me

148
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,480
Xiao Yan

149
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,860
Wow

150
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,740
Star Wars 10019

151
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,820
Isn't this out of print?

152
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,340
oh

153
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,020
Ninjago

154
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,340
genius

155
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,980
Chi Jun is definitely a genius

156
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,020
Xiaoyan is gone

157
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,220
I won't leave. I want to stay and take care of Brother Chijun.

158
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,020
Take care of these toys

159
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,880
It's too late. We should go home. He's already asleep and doesn't need anyone's care.

160
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,220
You have classes tomorrow. Let's go home quickly.

161
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,300
How do you become an assistant?

162
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,700
How could you let Chi Jun stay at home alone?

163
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,640
Chi Jun worked hard all day.

164
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,140
I just drank so much alcohol

165
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,260
In case of any accident

166
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,500
What do you propose

167
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,060
No, we can't go.

168
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,180
If you just walk away like this, it will only make me think that your assistant work is very unqualified.

169
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,780
Brother Chijun is a big star loved by everyone

170
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,740
What if something unexpected happened to him at night?

171
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,300
Oh, even if he gets up at night and can't drink water

172
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,420
How sad it would be for his fans.

173
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,620
I will never leave them.

174
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,100
You can't leave either

175
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,140
Um, why are you here?

176
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,580
Oh, I'll treat you to some chicken.

177
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,960
Come, come, have a drink of water to sober up

178
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,660
No, I have a headache now. I don't want to drink water. I have a headache.

179
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,400
I'll rub your headache for you.

180
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,220
Wait a minute

181
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't wear these pants on my bed.

182
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,340
I have a mysophobia

183
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,380
Mysophobia

184
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,380
The pants are clean.

185
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,340
I'll take a shower first.

186
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,140
I won't follow you when Chijun takes a shower

187
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,460
Do you need a bath?

188
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,820
The person I admire most is that A-Zan swear

189
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,820
He is the world's top Lego master

190
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,860
There are only 13 people in the world

191
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,420
He is also a Lego master.

192
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,580
Those who have both titles

193
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,300
He is the only one

194
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,380
He once said

195
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,180
Brick art is actually very easy to accept

196
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,780
He uses common objects from our childhood to illustrate and embody complex concepts.

197
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,940
I agree with this very much.

198
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,060
Look at this

199
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,820
This is a photo I took at his exhibition.

200
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,099
me

201
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,740
Red Army Brother

202
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,819
Is this also his work?

203
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
Not this one

204
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,780
This is what I used to play by myself

205
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,020
At my home in New York

206
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,860
real or fake

207
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,860
Wow, so difficult

208
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,380
time to eat

209
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,140
eat

210
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,280
Qu Zhan, go get me a spoon.

211
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,500
Go get it yourself. I don't have any space.

212
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,260
Sister, do you know that Chi Jun is an artist?

213
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,980
How tiring is it to work hard?

214
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,340
As an assistant, can't you empathize with me?

215
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,820
Hey, hurry up and give me a spoon

216
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,520
Lantern Festival

217
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,740
Daddy will take you to a faraway place, okay?

218
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,020
Why go far away?

219
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,860
because

220
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,900
Because we are in danger here.

221
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,840
Why is there danger?

222
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,220
Dad, don't be afraid. If you encounter danger, I will help Wukong to protect you.

223
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,360
Lantern Festival

224
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,620
Don't you always say that daddy can't accompany you?

225
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,640
Dad will take you out to play for a while.

226
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,960
This way I can be with you every day, okay?

227
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,020
Okay, okay.

228
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,980
Will we be gone for long?

229
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,180
Why do you ask?

230
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,200
I recently decided to ask Brother Time to treat them to a meal.

231
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,100
But I never got there.

232
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,700
Dad, you must keep your word to me.

233
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,620
If we are leaving, can we have a meal with them first?

234
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,320
good

235
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,560
Ah, Dad called him.

236
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,300
You tell him okay

237
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,940
Okay, let's talk.

238
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,480
Is she someone's sister?

239
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,620
I am Yan Xiao

240
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,340
Can you come to our house for dinner with Brother Chicken Eater tonight?

241
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,080
Please take it to the kitchen quickly.

242
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,620
Remember to listen to your teacher.

243
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,880
What happened to Yuanxiao? Dad, you haven't kissed me yet.

244
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
Oh, sorry.

245
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,140
Dad forgot.

246
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,980
Come, let's kiss.

247
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,020
mua, go quickly

248
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,100
Goodbye, Dad

249
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,920
Xiaoxuan

250
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,580
Ah, wait for me.

251
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,780
Why

252
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,700
Hey, Xiao Yan

253
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,140
Mr. Xiaolin, please stay away from my sister

254
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,900
I don't want you to appear next to my sister again

255
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,040
Xiao Yan, what's wrong with you?

256
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,780
Wasn't everything fine yesterday?

257
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,540
A lot can happen in one night.

258
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,560
Anyway

259
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,580
Don't have any illusions about my sister anymore OK

260
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,600
Xiaoxuan

261
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,660
I'll go over there

262
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,160
sister

263
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,100
What are you doing here?

264
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,060
I'm here to protect you

265
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,240
What to protect me

266
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,320
Why don't you go to class quickly?

267
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,200
Otherwise, next time you skip class and get disqualified from the exam, don't drag me along to beg the teacher.

268
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,740
I'm doing this for your own good.

269
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,940
Go to Kobayashi soon

270
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,140
Mr. Kobayashi, I already have a candidate for my brother-in-law. Who is he?

271
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,860
it's me

272
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,740
you

273
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,820
I'm sorry, he just said nonsense. He has been led astray by hypocrisy recently and talks nonsense every day.

274
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,780
No, I got two tickets for the Paleontology Museum. Let's go see it later.

275
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,960
Ah Xiuxiu, I'm sorry.

276
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,800
I have made an appointment with Director Liu's son Xiao Yuanxiao to have dinner with him after school.

277
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,060
I may not be able to go.

278
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,380
Oh, I was invited too.

279
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,180
what are you doing

280
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,300
I was wrong

281
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,940
It's ok, you go ahead.

282
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,820
We'll contact you later when you're done.

283
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,620
Ah, I'll go now. Bye.

284
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

285
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,900
Haha, you didn't see Lin Junxiong's look when he was rejected

286
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,180
Hahaha

287
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,660
hahahahahahahaha

288
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,420
I also want to take Xu Zhen to see some paleontology exhibition hahahaha

289
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,700
Ha ha

290
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,460
Just give me a little information and it will be enough for me to complete the work.

291
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,040
Then I won't have to work overtime this weekend and can go home normally and we can go out for dinner.

292
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:21,660
After dinner, we can also go to the park and watch a movie. What do you think?

293
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,780
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha I lost, haha

294
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,740
Hahahaha you want to fight me

295
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,500
What is Shishiyu doing?

296
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,020
Ah, boss

297
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,980
Xiao Lin can never catch up with Xu Zhen. Why are you so happy?

298
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,320
this

299
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,820
This is the boss's responsibility.

300
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,160
Stop hiding it

301
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,180
Face your own heart.

302
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,180
Is there still no news from Qingyang recently?

303
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,580
Actually, it’s better if Mr. Lin doesn’t contact you.

304
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,100
Recently, our new play started filming

305
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,680
The media, reporters and paparazzi are chasing us closely.

306
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,940
I see several cars coming and going in front of our company every day.

307
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,780
Staring at us

308
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,980
There are really a lot of people watching us. Are you sure? I am sure.

309
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,920
Didn't you say that the two islands would come?

310
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,140
Why didn't I see anyone?

311
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,100
The two islands may be a temporary change of itinerary.

312
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,260
Hey hey hey what's wrong with you

313
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,140
Are you okay?

314
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,280
fine

315
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,500
Ah, since the two islands are not coming, I have seen this exhibition many times. I have something to do, so I will leave first.

316
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,020
Hey Chi Jun

317
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,840
Who is it?

318
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,620
Is there a problem

319
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,340
There are some problems with the property mobile water supply

320
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,780
Let's check the pipes.

321
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,440
Is there a water outage at your home?

322
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,340
Oh, the water supply to my house has been cut off. Please check it out.

323
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,560
Didn't we agree to pick you up after school?

324
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,640
Why do we need to ask the teacher for leave to let us come here early?

325
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,560
Because I can't help wanting to see you right away

326
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,280
And we can go home early and spend time with dad

327
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,700
This way he won't feel tired cooking alone.

328
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,800
Is this a lie?

329
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:42,380
Did you come out early because you didn't want to go to class? But how did you know, brother Jing?

330
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,540
I must have skipped classes since I was a kid.

331
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,220
Let's go

332
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,640
gentlemen

333
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,040
There is no problem with your pipeline.

334
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,580
Is there water now?

335
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,540
You can reply me soon

336
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,820
Thank you and bye

337
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,100
Take your time

338
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,940
How is it? Yuan Xiao, are you happy? Yes, I am happy.

339
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,140
Would your father carry you like this? Yes.

340
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,680
What are you thinking about now?

341
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,220
Captain America?

342
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,060
What's wrong Xu Zhen?

343
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,740
Ah, that person just now looked familiar. I think I've seen him somewhere before.

344
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,120
Why do you keep saying you met someone familiar?

345
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,820
Last time I also said I met someone familiar

346
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,660
I chased after him and fell down

347
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,740
Forget it

348
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,080
Yeah, laugh too.

349
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,020
Are you hungry? Are you hungry?

350
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,180
Come on, grab your sister and let's go eat together.

Don't laugh. Is your dad home?

355
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,880
Yes, he told me that he would go home early to prepare.

356
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,540
Dad, open the door, Dad. Dad, open the door, Dad.

357
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,140
Yuanxiao, did you bring your house keys? Yes.

358
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,180
Come, let me help you.

359
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,940
We open the door ourselves.

360
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:00,940

Director Liu, Hero Dad, Dad, are you okay?

365
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,220
Dad, rush to the hospital

366
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,520
ah

367
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,740
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad

368
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:40,020
Daddy, wake up. Daddy, wake up. Daddy, wake up. Daddy, wake up. Daddy, wake up. Daddy, wake up.

369
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,640
Dad, come and smile

370
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,100
Let dad be quiet for a while

371
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,380
Let Qiqi hold me

372
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,400
Doctor, how is the patient now?

373
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,020
The patient probably had aspirin-induced sudden asthma.

374
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,420
Prolonged hypoxia leads to brain damage

375
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,600
What does this mean?

376
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,740
When will Director Liu wake up?

377
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,820
When can you wake up?

378
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,020
That depends on the extent of his brain damage.

379
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,980
Maybe one to two days

380
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,060
Also a possibility

381
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,080
Daddy, wake up, daddy, wake up, daddy

382
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:41,800
Daddy, daddy, wake up, daddy, daddy, wake up, daddy, daddy, wake up, daddy, please go home first

383
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,600
Okay?

384
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,080
I won't leave unless Dad comes home with me

385
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,720
Dad, wake up.

386
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,260
Dad, let's go home together.

387
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,640
Lantern Festival

388
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,240
Can you go home with your sister first?

389
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,840
I don't want to be separated from my father.

390
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,720
Let's go together. Dad, dad, wake up.

391
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,580
We'll be home soon.

392
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,900
Dad, wake up, Dad.

393
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,120
Yu Xiao

394
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,339
Listen to what the Red Army brother said

395
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,540
Dad is sick now

396
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,339
Need to stay in this place

397
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,700
So that the doctor can take good care of him

398
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,779
Dad's illness will get better soon.

399
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Yuanxiao is a big kid now

400
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,580
You should know what's best for your dad, right?

401
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:32,098
Go back with Brother Chijun

402
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:33,618
eat on time

403
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:35,059
Go to school on time

404
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:37,859
Is it okay to do this for Lantern Festival?

405
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,618
What happens after dad gets better?

406
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,059
Only then will I feel that Yuanxiao has grown up

407
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,419
You've grown up now. Can you come and see daddy together when we have time?

408
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,519
roll

409
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,580
Say goodbye to dad

410
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,700
Why

411
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,740
Hello, the number you dialed is powered off. Sorry

412
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,720
Hello Mr. Xiaolin

413
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,220
Wei Shan, I kept calling Xiao Zhen today.

414
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,480
I can't get in touch with you.

415
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,520
Can you let him pick up the phone?

416
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,780
But Xu Sheng hasn't come back yet.

417
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,980
What? He's not home?

418
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,620
Do you know where he went?

419
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,480
Um, I don't know.

420
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,180
Do you know where you are going now? I don't know

421
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,360
Hey, my sister is brave now

422
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,780
How dare you stay out all night

423
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,300
Seeing him come back, I don't teach him a lesson.

424
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,360
Um, Mr. Xiaolin and Xiaoyan don't know either.

425
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,720
Well, look at this, okay?

426
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,460
Wait until Xiao Zhou comes back. Can I tell him to call you back?

427
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,020
Okay, tell me as soon as you have news.

428
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,020
boss

429
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,080
My Phone's battery is dead

430
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,840
Can I use your phone?

431
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,460
I'll tell Xiaoyan and the others.

432
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Um

433
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,480
Hello

434
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,240
Hello, Xiao Yan

435
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,200
I'm your elder sister. I have something to do tonight and I have to stay out all night.

436
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,420
Don't wait for me.

437
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,780
what's the situation

438
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,800
Sister, although you are an adult woman

439
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,580
But it's not a good idea to just spend the night outside

440
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,920
No, you need to send me your location right now.

441
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,940
I'll pick you up right away. Send it quickly.

442
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,920
Oh yeah, and whose phone is this?

443
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,420
Who are you with?

444
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,220
Oh, the phone is

445
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,620
Hello Xiao Yan

446
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,660
It's me

447
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,700
Yuanxiao's father is sick and hospitalized

448
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,180
So we are worried about him being alone at home

449
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,340
Your sister and I will stay with him.

450
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,320
Brother Tenth Army

451
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,220
I feel relieved when you and my sister are here. I will take good care of myself.

452
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,540
Please spend a good night with my sister.

453
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,020
Oh, yes, and Brother Zhijun, this phone number is mine.

454
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,360
Remember to add me on WeChat

455
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,500
You must add it.

456
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,700
knew

457
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,140
What did he say to you?

458
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,860
Let me add him on WeChat

459
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,940
What's wrong

460
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,300
Charm is great, isn't it?

461
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,240
It’s getting late for Lantern Festival

462
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,500
Let's sleep

463
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:21,700
Well, every night before bed, my dad would give me a glass of milk.

464
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,500
Wait a minute, sister will bring you some milk.

465
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,600
Have you ever seen Yuanxiao?

466
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,040
Yes, this is my father's medicine.

467
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,420
He sprays this every time he coughs

468
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,920
Why are you asking this suddenly?

469
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,220
Nothing to do. Yuanxiao. Drink the milk and go to sleep.

470
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,140
Come to Lantern Festival and wipe your face

471
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,420
Severe winter season

472
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,300
Goose feather-like snowflakes are flying everywhere in the sky

473
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,140
There was a queen sitting in the palace

474
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,120
Are there really snowflakes as big as goose feathers?

475
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,100
Oh, of course.

476
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,280
In the past, when my father and I went to Russia for an inspection

477
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,060
The snow there is so big that it can cover the whole person.

478
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,420
There was a queen sitting by the prince's window

479
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,140
Sewing for his daughter

480
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,100
The needle accidentally pierced his finger.

481
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,060
Red blood flowed out from the needle.

482
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,620
Three drops of blood fell on the snowflakes that drifted in through the window

483
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:36,980
Who is the most beautiful woman in the country?
