1
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,060
Tyrannosaurus Rex

2
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,900
A carnivorous

3
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,620
Fierce temperament

4
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,500
Strong attack power

5
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,940
OK Xu Zhen

6
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,140
Very patient.

7
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,980
Give me a nickname

8
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,340
Tyrannosaurus Rex

9
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,020
A violent temper

10
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,260
A highly aggressive carnivore

11
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,140
Also known as Tyrannosaurus Rex

12
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,620
Xu Ran, how do you explain this matter?

13
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,900
ah

14
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,100
Shi Yu told me before

15
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
Your fans are crazy.

16
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,260
There are also many

17
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,340
Be sure to protect your privacy

18
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,600
So I changed your name.

19
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,220
Even if someone finds my phone, they won't know it's you.

20
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,620
Haha, yes, yes.

21
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,740
Hey, didn’t you also hire a weird assistant last time?

22
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,260
What's even worse is that they even take away your used tissues. How terrible it would be if this news got out.

23
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,020
As a public figure

24
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,780
Personal image is everything

25
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,540
Your behavior has damaged my reputation.

26
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,900
so

27
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,340
Must accept punishment

28
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,780
So what do you want to do?

29
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,140
What's wrong?

30
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,980
Ugh, I peed haha

31
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,980
Chenchen, now is the time to show your value, haha

32
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,460
I've packed it up.

33
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,860
Why is he still spinning around?

34
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,100
Ah, it's time for Xiaojun to poop.

35
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,420
You mean he's gonna poop on my carpet?

36
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,940
Yeah, I'll fix it right away.

37
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,620
Come on, little Junjun, let's go

38
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,460
No principles

39
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,220
Too unprincipled.

40
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,740
Animal behavioral information

41
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,820
The chances of being preserved in fossils are very small.

42
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,780
Only some special burial methods

43
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,380
To read some

44
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,580
it's your turn

45
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,420
Professor, what's that over there?

46
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,120
Xu Zhen

47
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Your father is in trouble.

48
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,780
I'm looking at the painting hospital. Go and have a look.

49
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,300
what happened

50
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,000
Mr. Xu didn't bring his phone number.

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,900
They finally got in touch with me

52
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,660
You still keep him till now?

53
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,300
Why tell me why

54
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,340
I don't want you to worry.

55
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,860
Don't want us to worry

56
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,400
Ever since my parents passed away

57
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,460
Uncle Xu raised me.

58
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,260
Uncle Xu is my father

59
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,880
Have you never really considered me as a member of your family?

60
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,660
You didn't tell me such a big thing.

61
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,420
It's Love Town

62
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
Uncle Xu is so seriously ill

63
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,500
We didn't even know

64
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,000
it turns out

65
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,340
I still let him take care of me.

66
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,540
Sorry, it's okay.

67
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,620
With my own eyes

68
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,320
Don't blame Xu

69
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,140
real

70
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,620
I didn't let him tell you.

71
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,060
uncle

72
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,020
From small to large

73
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,180
You have always treated me like your own son.

74
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,940
I also regard you as my real father

75
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,420
But I owe you my life.

76
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,300
dad

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,780
from now on

78
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,980
I'll call you daddy

79
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,260
Silly boy

80
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,220
They are all big guys.

81
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,540
Why are you still crying?

82
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,340
I didn't let your sister tell you.

83
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,020
Don't blame her.

84
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,540
Uncle Xu

85
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,920
Since I'm sick

86
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,620
You need to be hospitalized for treatment

87
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,300
We are a family

88
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,860
How could you not tell us?

89
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,780
I study paleontology.

90
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,420
You have followed me for so many years, you should know

91
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,820
No one knows better than me

92
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,820
The impermanence and fragility of life

93
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,039
Dad, you just woke up.

94
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,960
Please stop talking.

95
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,220
Please take a rest.

96
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,100
A movement of the earth's crust

97
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,340
Will make five species extinct

98
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,980
Besides, I am just an ordinary person who is small and lonely.

99
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,780
My disease

100
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,940
I was late a long time ago

101
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,420
I have consulted many doctors

102
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,980
Just made this decision

103
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,460
Uncle Xu, please stop talking.

104
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,700
Weishan

105
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,860
With your own eyes

106
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,860
You are not my children.

107
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,820
but

108
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,300
You guys have been following me

109
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,980
You always say you are very happy with me.

110
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,420
Since fate cannot be changed

111
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,100
I just want to share this happiness

112
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,260
Continue some more

113
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,580
Even until the last moment of my life

114
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,980
I leave you with happy memories

115
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,820
you

116
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,820
Can you understand me?

117
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,220
Okay, don't get sick and die like this.

118
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,220
This is a rotation of life

119
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,940
There's no need to be so sad.

120
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,120
We are a family.

121
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,500
Stay together

122
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,500
Happy to accompany uncle

123
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,660
Spend the last moments of life

124
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,380
Okay?

125
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,600
You don't

126
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,060
It's so sad anymore

127
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,780
Since you listen to me

128
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,900
Weishan Qiye

129
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,900
I know you're sad right now.

130
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,280
But please don't despair

131
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,780
Cheer up a bit

132
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,820
We can check some information.

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,220
Go see if there are any precedents of cure in foreign hospitals.

134
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,820
I have asked someone to contact the most authoritative experts in the relevant field.

135
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,840
No matter how low the chances are

136
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,740
I will convince my dad to give it a try.

137
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,020
My father's words just now made me understand that in the face of difficulties

138
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,140
We can't collapse first.

139
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,260
No matter what the final result is

140
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,360
In the rest of his time

141
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,220
I want every second of his life to be a happy memory.

142
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,900
what do you mean

143
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,500
Dad, he never forgot Mom.

144
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,020
He really wants us to be reunited.

145
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,860
I must fulfill his wish.

146
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,780
Xiaochun, you mean you can get close to Ryoshima for Uncle Xu?

147
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,020
I have now become the assistant of the big star Gu Chijun

148
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,860
I have already seen my mother at the company.

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,440
I believe I can let my mother come to see my father soon.

150
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
With the power of family

151
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,100
Dad will get better.

152
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,020
Now the three of us will split up

153
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,260
Wei Shan, your task now is to take good care of your father.

154
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,300
Qinyan, please contact a foreign hospital to see if there is any help.

155
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,780
No matter what happens in the future

156
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,820
We all must

157
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,180
Don't give up easily

158
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,060
Sister, what style are you wearing today?

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,560
I didn't sleep last night

160
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,900
I searched all of Xiao Xiu's social media profiles.

161
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,660
Finally found his dream lover who must know

162
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,940
So I recreated a set according to his style.

163
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,080
How about it

164
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,500
Look like

165
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Hey

166
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,620
They look so alike. Their temperament and appearance are exactly the same. Hehe, that's right.

167
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,780
Did you remember the plan I told you?

168
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,520
I have a cup of coffee in my hand.

169
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,100
Whenever you meet the little bear, you bump into me.

170
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,860
I can spill coffee on the bear.

171
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,740
Hey little bear, are you okay?

172
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,280
It's ok. Are you okay?

173
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm fine. Take off your dirty clothes and I'll wash them for you.

174
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,420
Hahaha

175
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,900
When there is a time to wash clothes, there is a time to change clothes

176
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,740
Just because you came once

177
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,740
The relationship with Xiao Xiu has gradually built up.

178
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,700
Sister Xiaofei, your skills in teasing men are too high

179
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,460
In my Xiao Fei's dictionary of flirting

180
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,300
This is just a little trick. Coffee

181
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,880
Further studies

182
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,260
Xiaojuan, look what this is

183
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,660
My phone is with you. No wonder I couldn't find him.

184
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,860
Yes, your family called a lot yesterday to say your dad was in the hospital. Is he okay now?

185
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,700
It's okay, don't worry, Xiaoxiu

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,940
That's good. Don't handle everything by yourself.

187
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,180
Please tell me, yeah

188
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,840
Hey, what is this?

189
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,220
This is a simulation model made by the art director specifically for our film.

190
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,600
Now let me keep it.

191
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,720
Very important

192
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,080
I'll use it for shooting later.

193
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,160
I have to get him to the studio now.

194
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,140
I go first

195
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,820
Xu Chen's phone was left with him

196
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,980
They were together last night

197
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,220
Holding

198
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,499
Is Xuzhou here?

199
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,579
How is he? Is he okay?

200
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,979
He's in good spirits.

201
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:25,979
Oh, I'm worried about him.

202
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,259
Why don't you go in and ask yourself?

203
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,020
I'm just asking

204
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,020
It's rare for Boss Gu to drive himself

205
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Ah

206
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,140
Such an important thing

207
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,400
Of course I have to come in person.

208
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,660
I also brought the elementary school student with me.

209
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,100
Don't women like animals?

210
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,700
Maybe Xiaojunjun can ease the atmosphere.

211
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,700
Maybe Ziqing fell in love with her at first sight.

212
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,480
yes

213
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,720
How is the matter I asked you to investigate?

214
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,140
After investigation, it was found out that Qin Yang had been in Jiexi for several years.

215
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,460
There is no relationship, no scandals

216
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,400
I knew he would never forget me.

217
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,820
Hahaha

218
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,680
Where are the car keys?

219
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,140
Ah, the car key issue has also been investigated.

220
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,400
After work, Miss Qin always drives home by herself.

221
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,200
His assistant did not drive an additional vehicle.

222
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,320
So we just take his car keys.

223
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,340
Someone has to take him home.

224
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,140
It seems that everything is ready, only the east wind is missing.

225
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,760
correct

226
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,620
Go back and prepare the seafood dinner.

227
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,580
I'm going to take him out for a romantic seafood dinner. Wait.

228
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,860
Why am I the one who does the work every time?

229
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,340
But you are the one eating.

230
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,100
Hehe, because you are a star? Huh?

231
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,960
Didn't Xu Zhen say he's here?

232
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,780
Uh, let's go get some clothes first.

233
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,580
I have already picked up the clothes for today's shoot from the costume team.

234
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,460
The model will be used for taking photos later.

235
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,300
I have taken it back and put it in the studio. It will be ready for use when I shoot.

236
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,020
How did this devil's heart become like this?

237
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,180
No one is talking, right?

238
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,900
Who can explain what's going on?

239
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,820
Oh

240
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,540
I, I, I just put it here and it was fine.

241
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,580
This model is very important. You know it.

242
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,980
Hand it over to your staff

243
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,740
He should have told you.

244
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,860
From now on, you leave this studio.

245
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,680
Hey, boss, I'm going here.

246
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,520
In this case, don't rush to the tool department to ask if they can help you make a new one.

247
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,340
Chi Jun and I will help you think of a solution, okay?

248
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,100
Hey, brother, you're here.

249
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,300
What's wrong, pony?

250
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,260
It's okay, it's okay. I just want to ask if you are tired. No, you are not tired. Okay, come and have some water.

251
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Thank you, Miss Mei

252
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,380
Teacher Chen hasn't come yet. Teacher Chen went to buy you breakfast.

253
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,060
Xiaoxiu, this is yours

254
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,460
What is this? This is the plan you prepared for the City of Time press conference.

255
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,980
This is not what I did.

256
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,280
This is made specially for you by Xiao Chen from our company.

257
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,840
It has been sent to the chairman.

258
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,260
The chairman is very satisfied

259
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,320
Take a look first

260
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,820
Don't ask me later because you don't know

261
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,620
Then please help me thank Teacher Chen.

262
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,820
Then I'm busy now.

263
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,660
Recently someone has been slandering

264
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,860
Our company treats artists

265
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,300
Very demanding

266
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,740
Even abused them

267
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,020
Wei Chang

268
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,340
Is this true?

269
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,080
Well

270
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,860
I've also heard some

271
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,580
Uh, but just some common things to pay attention to.

272
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,580
may be

273
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,720
Maybe our competitors are jealous of our company's performance.

274
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,140
Deliberately spreading rumors

275
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,620
But I heard that there is a rhinitis.

276
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,980
It is said that Li Qianer personally revealed it

277
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,780
My Gaia has flourished for so many years

278
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,060
It depends on solid efforts and industry reputation.

279
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,020
You’ve been CEO for less than a year.

280
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,620
This kind of thing just happened

281
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,620
But how can I rest assured later?

282
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,900
The one who taught you a lesson

283
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,480
We will be more rigorous in the future.

284
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,500
When Li Qie came to the company

285
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,860
I signed the contract with him myself.

286
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,820
Considering his young age

287
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,440
I ask you to take good care of him.

288
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,580
I didn't expect him to do something like this.

289
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,100
Is there any engine?

290
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,940
Take some time to call him back.

291
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,840
I want to talk to him in person.

292
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,060
I'll do it right away

293
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,500
Your uncle Ji just came back from abroad

294
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,540
I have a lot to talk to him about.

295
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,160
It's ok, you guys go down

296
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,960
Good dad

297
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,940
Uncle Ji, we'll leave first.

298
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,200
Lin Zong Lin Zong

299
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,840
The chairman asked me to bring Li Qianer here

300
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,020
Do you think I need to go find him? No,

301
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,480
This Li Qianer is really an eyesore

302
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,040
Yes, Li Qian'er is really too young and too ignorant.

303
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,440
Because he has brought so many achievements to the company.

304
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,620
You are Director Liu

305
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,940
Your concern for Li Qian'er seems a bit excessive.

306
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,900
I think you might as well take care of yourself.

307
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,620
Ha ha

308
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,720
Jingyang

309
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,940
A very capable child.

310
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,780
Are you too harsh on him?

311
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,780
Is it because of his mother?

312
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,400
Why

313
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,780
Although Jinyang and Jinxiu were not born from the same mother

314
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
But they are my sons after all.

315
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,820
I can't judge him because I'm divorced from his mother.

316
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,220
We are in the same boat

317
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,540
But in my heart

318
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,620
I have always had something on my mind

319
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,740
For Jinyang

320
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,820
I'm always worried

321
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,400
I always feel that this child has something hidden in his bones.

322
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,200
You only mentioned the explosion on the set 8 years ago

323
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,020
yes

324
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,620
8 years ago, he was going to the company to carry out a project

325
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,320
Director Wang of the company brought a group of people to object

326
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,780
Originally this project

327
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,980
She should have had an abortion.

328
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,380
But what a coincidence

329
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,100
Two days later, an accidental explosion occurred on the set that Director Wang was in charge of.

330
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,540
And check it out

331
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,900
Can't find the real reason

332
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,140
yes

333
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,660
It was because of this explosion.

334
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,580
Director Wang of the company also resigned as a result.

335
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,140
you know too

336
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,500
He came here with Gaia

337
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,880
Criminals are very careful

338
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,780
Never made a mistake

339
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,580
Why oppose Jinyang?

340
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,380
The crew he was in charge of was released.

341
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,740
And all the opposition was implicated

342
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,560
them

343
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,660
You suspect that the explosion is related to Jinyang

344
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,460
Not just bombings

345
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,740
A lot of things happened later

346
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,780
Some people who opposed Jinyang inexplicably dismissed these things

347
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,940
Have you investigated?

348
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,020
Jinyang is my son after all.

349
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,020
Once the investigation comes out, it's not the result I want.

350
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,120
What

351
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,620
It's coming up again, right?

352
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,820
Old problem

353
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,380
Fortunately, I carried you on my back.

354
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,520
Alas, the pity of parents in the world

355
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,820
It's for the children

356
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,500
You are heartbroken

357
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,520
Hahaha yeah

358
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,600
What about further studies? I heard that you brought back your further studies from abroad.

359
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,780
How is it? Hahaha, is he okay?

360
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,280
Xiao Qiu is a little playful, eh?

361
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,500
People are very smart

362
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,160
Good heart too.

363
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,180
Although some people in the company say that he is not as capable as his brother

364
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,380
He is younger than the one I hired.

365
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,680
So I want him to exercise more.

366
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,420
I will feel relieved if I hand Gaia over to him in the future.

367
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,460
Tongzhou, look at it

368
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,940
This is the last time

369
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,780
I took him to the Propaganda Department

370
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,740
No one knows his true identity

371
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,540
It's definitely like he's not special.

372
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,820
That is to test him.

373
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,940
This guy is really capable.

374
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,220
Made this plan

375
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,100
It looks similar, hahaha, don't tell me yet

376
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,620
This guy really has some ideas

377
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,860
Hahahaha

378
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,900
Hahaha

379
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,520
ha

380
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,420
Hari

381
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,080
director

382
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,680
ah

383
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,380
Hey Uncle Ji

384
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,740
I heard from my dad that you were coming back, but I didn't expect you to come back.

385
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,940
Dad, oh, that's not right, um, chairman, why are you here?

386
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,540
What do you do during working hours?

387
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,140
Oh, I'll go watch a funny video to broaden my horizons.

388
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,900
Did you make this plan?

389
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,980
that's good哎

390
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,580
Yes, Xiao Xiu did it himself, and none of us helped.

391
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,780
Well, tell me how you came up with this plan.

392
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,580
How to communicate with the public relations department

393
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,820
Coordinate and execute

394
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,580
Little Bear, have you seen the plan I made for you?

395
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
The chairman didn't notice it.

396
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,540
Look at the breakfast I bought for you.

397
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,620
That with fried dough sticks

398
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,420
Why

399
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,260
Tell me

400
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,020
What exactly is going on

401
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,620
Watch videos during work hours

402
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,540
Ask your colleagues to run errands for you

403
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,080
If you don't learn well at a young age

404
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,080
The Optical Society can now control the air.

405
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,620
Even let your colleagues do your work for you

406
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,580
You let me in front of your technical book

407
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,660
What a loss of face

408
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,140
How can I see him again in the future?

409
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,520
Dad, this project was not what I wanted to do.

410
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,260
They forced it on me.

411
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,740
How do I know this?

412
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,660
How dare you talk back to me?

413
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,700
You think you're right for not working hard?

414
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,380
Dad, please don't be angry. You are not in good health.

415
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,360
Xiao Qiu just returned to China

416
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,800
There are many things I am not used to yet.

417
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,200
Take your time, he will work well.

418
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,340
Don't get angry

419
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,200
Yes, I was living well abroad, but you forced me to return home.

420
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,180
After returning to China, I was forced to come to Gaia

421
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,140
Now you can't do it well and you blame me

422
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,740
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

423
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,480
Besides, the Propaganda Department was not my first choice.

424
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,620
It's not normal to do badly. You, you, your brother

425
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,420
exit

426
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,060
Isn't it true that the Propaganda Department can't learn anything?

427
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,360
When I was your age, I was already a producer on the set.

428
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,540
Then you can just join the crew as a producer like me.

429
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,740
From now on, the City of Time will be in your hands.

430
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,280
I wonder if you dare to give up on me, Dad.

431
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,520
The City of Time is our biggest project this year.

432
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,640
It was brought up by farming alone.

433
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,540
How can you say leave it to me? Leave it to me.

434
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,200
Because he is Gaia's biggest project this year

435
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,800
That's why I handed it over to you.

436
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,460
If I didn't do this

437
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,000
You can learn what responsibility is.

438
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,600
What is responsibility?

439
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,960
But Dad, what you did is really wrong.

440
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,780
It's really unfair to me.

441
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,480
I have decided

442
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,940
It's no use what you say

443
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,540
Just do your best for me.

444
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,600
dad

445
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,220
It's not that we don't help you.

446
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,780
You have seen our work, right?

447
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
The crew is about to start filming

448
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,200
There are many places where props are used

449
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,120
We are working overtime every day and still can't finish the work

450
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,320
How can I have the time to redo it for you?

451
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,940
Don't underestimate that dinosaur prop.

452
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,020
That's very troublesome to do.

453
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,180
We also need to ask the art director to come out personally.

454
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,120
Please

455
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,280
If this item can't be fixed now

456
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,600
I might get fired.

457
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,000
I beg you to help me

458
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,460
According to your words

459
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,420
I do have a solution.

460
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,580
Unless you ask the leader to stop everything we are doing

461
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,640
Invite the art director as well.

462
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,740
We'll make one for you.

463
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,440
Otherwise

464
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,580
We can't spare the time.

465
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,420
I also beg you to understand and forgive us.

466
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,300
Okay, I'm sorry to bother you.

467
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,040
good

468
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,260
very good

469
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,280
another one

470
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,500
Get closer

471
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,740
Ok, that's it.

472
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,680
hi

473
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,340
Look how well they work together.

474
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,360
Is it a running feeling?

475
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,140
Very good

476
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,260
I wonder if you have time tonight. Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

477
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,440
All right

478
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,140
Very good

479
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,240
Come on, everyone, it's time to call it a day. It's time to call it a day. It's time to call it a day.

480
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,500
it is finally over

481
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,340
I have something else to do later, so you go first.

482
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,260
Then I'll go first

483
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,580
Wait a minute, where are my car keys?

484
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,500
It should be inside.

485
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,340
No, um

486
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,580
How can it be

487
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,080
Why

488
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,860
How could there not be?

489
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,960
Jiajie

490
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,400
What happened? Can I help?

491
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:53,060
The car keys are missing. The keys are missing. Uh, have you looked for them carefully?

492
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,100
I have searched carefully. How about this?

493
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,300
Miss Qin, where are you going?

494
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,860
Time can take you there

495
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,080
Hum, I advise you not to look for it. You won't find it in a while. How about this?

496
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,180
Let the Tenth Army take you there directly.

497
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,020
What's up?

498
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,040
Sister Qing'er's key is lost.

499
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,500
It's okay, I'll take you there.

500
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,220
My car keys were clearly in my bag just now, how come they disappeared?

501
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,200
so

502
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,100
Go to the security office.

503
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,380
Bring me all the surveillance cameras in this studio.

504
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,099
I need to check carefully what happened.

505
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,340
Uh, don't bother.

506
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,760
Ziqing, I'll take you there.

507
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,000
Just let Shiyu help you find the key.

508
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,780
It's okay. I'll help you now.

509
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,900
The key is lost, someone must have taken it, so of course I have to find out what the situation is.

510
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,260
Go quickly, eh

511
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,660
Xu Zhi will be here soon

512
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:30,220
Don't worry, just think of a way to solve this problem

513
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,180
Xu Zhen, you are already 15 minutes late today. Oh, don't forget to bring Mr. Guo's magazine.

514
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,140
Sorry, I just got lost.

515
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,020
Put it away

516
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,580
Sister Ziqing, the security department has already notified them and they will be here soon. Okay.

517
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,780
Everyone, please wait a moment. The security department will be here soon.

518
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,580
Sister Zixin, don't be in a hurry to drink water

519
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,620
Oh, by the way, I just suddenly remembered

520
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Look for a cosmetic bag or other handbag you carry with you.

521
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,260
Oh yeah, or clothes or something like that.

522
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,680
Wait a moment

523
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,460
Sister Ziqing found the key

524
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,320
Look, I'm telling you.

525
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,600
Now that I have found it,

526
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,280
Sister Ziqing's false alarm

527
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,060
Haha, I'm sorry for wasting everyone's time. It's okay now.

528
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,660
Thank you, everyone. I can call it a day now.

529
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,540
Walk home

530
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,060
Ziqingjie

531
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,860
Sister Ziqing, take care

532
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,580
Today's meeting ends here.

533
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,260
Hey Xu Zhen

534
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,300
Did Mr. Gu bring little Junjun here today?

535
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,880
Yeah, just now

536
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,200
I saw a dog at the fountain downstairs that looked very similar to Junjun.

537
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,040
But no one cares about him running around

538
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,280
Now I'm sure it's him.

539
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,720
You should go and have a look right away, okay?

540
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,940
I'll go check it out.

541
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,160
Where are you going? My colleague just said he saw Xiaojunjun at the fountain downstairs.

542
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,740
I was afraid he might get lost, so I went to check.

543
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,060
Xiaojunjun Xiaojunjun Xiaojunjun

544
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,840
Over there

545
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,620
Xiaojunjun

546
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,900
Do you want to find someone to help?

547
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,420
Hey Xu Zhen
