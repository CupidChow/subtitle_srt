1
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,860
Hey

2
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,100
Hey, wait for me

3
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,580
What's wrong with your neck?

4
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,800
There may be parasites on your body.

5
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,900
I have allergies so I have some rashes

6
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,380
By the way, were you pressing the door closing button just now?

7
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,580
I don't need to explain this to you.

8
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,900
What a stingy boy.

9
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,960
This afternoon is the discussion meeting of the City of Time.

10
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,180
Brother Shi Yu is willing to give up this opportunity, so let me participate as your assistant.

11
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,300
Of course not

12
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,060
You are not good enough

13
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,020
Going there will affect my professional image

14
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,800
This is very important to me.

15
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,980
I must attend

16
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,260
No one can negotiate with me.

17
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,820
Aren't you afraid that I will post the news that Qin Ziqing rejected you online?

18
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,620
There are so many revelations on the Internet now

19
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,420
Who will believe you?

20
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,440
hi

21
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,100
Ah, I heard that Gaia's number one sister Qin Ziqing just rejected a

22
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,340
Who did Qin Ziqing reject?

23
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,220
A male fan

24
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,400
Hey, what's so strange about that?

25
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,300
A goddess like him must reject hundreds of them every day.

26
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,860
Now you should promise me

27
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
The news that Ji Jun's fan aunt gave you a puppy has made headlines

28
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,900
You have now won the title of the nation's first warm man

29
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,140
This news is more in line with my image

30
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,960
But now the problem comes. A very influential media wants to interview you.

31
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,640
And the name of the store requires you to take a photo with Xiaojunjun

32
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,260
I'm afraid this news will be more in line with the real you after it is exposed.

33
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,180
Xu Zhen

34
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,460
You have always been taking care of me.

35
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,620
It's time to remind you that your driver's license is up

36
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,700
Oh, the big star Gu Chijin is negotiating with me.

37
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,420
Understood

38
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,200
Let's talk about Mr. Gu's work here first.

39
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,480
Can you tell us a little bit about your life?

40
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
sure

41
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,160
Is such that

42
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,140
Didn't a fan girl give you a puppy before Sadako?

43
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,400
This is all over the news

44
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,680
The website's headlines

45
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,080
Everyone says you are a warm man.

46
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
Do you feel warm?

47
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,300
Or do you think you will keep your promise and continue to take care of this puppy?

48
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,180
Whether it is a cold appearance or a kind heart

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,460
This is all me

50
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,100
I hope you guys see a different side of me.

51
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,820
The little soldier that the fan aunt gave me

52
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,720
I'll take care of it.

53
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,760
Mr. Gu

54
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,200
Can you say hello to our camera with that puppy?

55
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,980
I believe all fans are looking forward to this moment.

56
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,860
sure

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,420
Come on, Xiaojun, let's take a photo together, okay?

58
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,660
Be good, okay?

59
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,220
Uh-huh

60
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,140
Don't move. Press this side.

61
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,640
Mr. Gu, is he not very happy?

62
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,260
It seems like he doesn't know you well.

63
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
ah

64
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,480
Sorry, I forgot to take Junjun to the toilet.

65
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,700
It's okay for me to take him to the toilet. How can I blame you?

66
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,520
Ah, Mr. Gu, you are such a warm man.

67
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,540
He is so gentle to his assistant.

68
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,840
Xiao Juanjuan, let's eat.

69
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,340
eat more

70
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,440
Can you please look at the camera for a moment?

71
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,180
Oh, good.

72
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,840
get

73
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
Come

74
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,260
Let's look at the camera.

75
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,500
so amazing

76
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,020
Xiao Jin is completely different after he goes to the toilet.

77
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
Look, he's so clingy to you now.

78
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,660
You must have taken good care of him.

79
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,480
Come on, Mr. Gu, let's take a look at the camera here and say hello to our audience friends.

80
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,100
Xiaojun looks at the camera

81
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,700
You guys have worked hard today.

82
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,719
I hope we can have long-term cooperation in the future

83
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,060
Okay, okay, thank you. No need to see me off. Take care.

84
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,340
Mr. Gu, you must keep your word.

85
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,200
I want to attend the discussion with you this afternoon

86
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,180
of course

87
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,380
My superb acting skills and professionalism will not be affected by a little assistant like you.

88
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,620
I don't have any hope for you.

89
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,740
Just don't make any mistakes during the meeting.

90
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,980
The others disappear under my light

91
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,220
Liang Dao is here

92
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,300
Mother

93
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,900
Haven't seen you for 8 years

94
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,740
I can still call you mom

95
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,820
Will you come home with me?

96
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,040
Hello, Mr. Gu

97
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,080
Hisaoka Daimyo

98
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,180
Hello Mr. Liang

99
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,100
From now on, you can just call me Chijun

100
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,460
This is my assistant Xu Zhen

101
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,020
Hello, Director Liang

102
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,860
My name is Xu Zhen

103
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,680
ah

104
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,340
This is my assistant Ji Xiaorui

105
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,580
If you have any questions in the future, you can contact him directly.

106
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,860
Come and sit down, um

107
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,660
Mr. Gu's comprehensive understanding is the basis for good cooperation

108
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,140
So our company wants to meet with you before we start filming.

109
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,840
On the one hand, I want you to have a deeper understanding of our project.

110
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,060
Let you have a comprehensive understanding of this city of time

111
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,100
At the same time, I also hope to communicate with you in depth.

112
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,060
By the way, let me know your thoughts on this play.

113
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,020
Uh, can we get started?

114
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,260
Well, let's get started.

115
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,220
Now I will explain to you the general situation of the City of Time project.

116
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,300
The above is the general situation of our City of Time project. Director

117
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,820
Mr. Gu, you are a famous Hollywood movie star.

118
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,340
You probably have your own unique perspective on movies.

119
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,660
I just want to know why you finally chose our City of Time.

120
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,180
Best Director

121
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,140
The best team

122
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,620
And a strong production company

123
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,060
Is that the only reason to reject him?

124
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,820
Um, but I saw you did an interview a few days ago.

125
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,580
You seem to be dissatisfied with our project.

126
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,740
I think

127
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,460
The most basic thing for an actor is his professional ethics.

128
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,140
and professionalism

129
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,980
Since I chose to make this film

130
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,020
Select this role

131
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,700
I will try my best to interpret this role well.

132
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,140
Besides

133
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,580
You are a top director in China.

134
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,380
I am an excellent actor in China

135
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,740
You shouldn't reject me

136
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,180
On this movie

137
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,660
Let's add some brilliance to him with performance

138
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,180
Mr. Gu, I admire your professional ethics very much.

139
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,260
Well, then it depends on your wonderful performance.

140
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,980
I think this is the end of the meeting today.

141
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,700
Uh, time to take the final makeup photos

142
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,860
Xiao Rui, just follow

143
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,440
Mr. Gu's assistant will coordinate the time.

144
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,240
Good leadership

145
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,220
Then I'll go first

146
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,600
lead

147
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,780
I have something I want to say to you in private.

148
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,140
The professionalism that Mr. Gu just mentioned

149
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,180
I totally agree

150
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,220
I also hope that everyone here will have a professional spirit.

151
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,460
During my working period

152
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,060
I don't want to hear anything other than work.

153
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,940
Do you understand now?

154
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,060
Xiaorui, I'll leave this to you.

155
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,360
Is such that

156
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,040
I have previously agreed with Mr. Zhang to take the final makeup photos later.

157
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,100
Now it's very cruel, sir, please confirm it

158
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,940
Miss Ji

159
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,220
Mom, mom, wait a minute.

160
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,660
Something happened at home.

161
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,420
Dad, your dad and I are divorced.

162
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,420
You should know this

163
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,860
Both emotionally and legally

164
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,940
We have already divided

165
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,500
I won't interfere in his affairs anymore.

166
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,380
I also hope

167
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,660
All his things

168
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,140
Don't show up in my life anymore

169
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,220
And later on Gaia

170
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,300
It's better to call me Director Liang

171
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,180
Oh my god, it turns out that the poor swordsman's mother

172
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,220
No wonder he said he always wanted Jiandang Island that day

173
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,900
But we have decided to take makeup photos next.

174
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,560
Time was tight.

175
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,820
What to do now?

176
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,320
My agent should be back soon.

177
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,740
If you have any questions, just contact my agent.

178
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,740
Leave him alone.

179
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,460
I'll connect with him.

180
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,680
The leader is right

181
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,540
You should do your job well.

182
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,460
Sister Rui, let's hand over our work.

183
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,619
Hey, be careful

184
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,340
Study early!

185
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,480
Hey, what's wrong with you?

186
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,400
Nothing, really nothing, just a little allergic

187
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,480
Just take some medicine

188
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,840
No, your condition looks serious. I'll take you to the hospital. Oh, you really don't have to worry. I'm really fine.

189
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,500
A makeup setting mask is made in a short time

190
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,180
I have to deliver these clothes quickly.

191
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,260
Wait a moment

192
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,060
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

193
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,360
Waiting for the next bus?

194
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,780
Sister Xiao Fei, it's too late now. You fought so hard to get this role.

195
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,880
Hey, you're going down alone.

196
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,760
Yes, can you be a little more qualified?

197
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,000
Are you going to leave today?

198
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,540
Yeah yeah

199
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,660
You ah ah

200
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,340
These two ladies

201
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,960
Everyone just saw it.

202
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,560
You two were the last to come in.

203
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,180
If anyone needs to go out, it should be you two.

204
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,740
I'm sorry

205
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,660
Hey sister

206
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,280
Turn around

207
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,300
Doesn't he know me as Xiao Fei?

208
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,540
Ah, here it is.

209
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,000
ah

210
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,660
Oh

211
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,780
Isn't the leader here?

212
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,840
Ahaha, today we're just taking some makeup photos to check the look. The director won't be here.

213
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,060
Um, Xu Zhen, are you okay?

214
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,320
The two islands have been in a meeting all morning today.

215
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,820
There shouldn't be time to eat.

216
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,940
You take this lunch box to Liangdao

217
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,060
Just consider it as our little token of appreciation

218
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,960
ah

219
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,460
oops

220
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,920
It was you who said you wanted to eat Spanish seafood paella.

221
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,000
Also specifically requested large prawns caught at sea

222
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,480
The half-palm-sized neighbor was waiting for me at the seafood market at 5 o'clock this morning.

223
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,440
Cutting and bleeding for three hours

224
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,260
You said you would send someone away now.

225
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,820
Play with me

226
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,580
Mr. Zhang Shiyu

227
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,860
You are my agent

228
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,380
Build a good relationship with my co-director

229
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,020
It's also one of your jobs.

230
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,060
Now I'll help you with this.

231
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,660
What do you have to complain about?

232
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,520
Hey sister, this is not our escape

233
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,100
This is Gu Chijun's

234
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,200
I know Gu Chijun is the most popular male star now

235
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,020
I finally got the chance to act with him, so of course I had to go over and say hello to him.

236
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,100
Crazy Brother

237
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,260
Hey, who are you?

238
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,980
I'm Xiao Fei, my crazy brother.

239
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,860
Ah who

240
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,320
I also have a role in the City of Time this time.

241
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,900
When do you have time for us to play together?

242
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,600
Hey Mr. Chen, I'm so sorry for this beautiful lady.

243
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,920
This is our photo studio.

244
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,000
This is not the place for you to chase stars.

245
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
We are working now, please don't disturb us.

246
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,980
The door is there

247
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,880
Sister Xiaofei, are you okay? You're just a lousy actress.

248
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,740
Why are you playing big with me?

249
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,020
I'm here to find the future heir of Gaia's second son.

250
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,880
Did you find the information I asked you to find?

251
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,540
Oh, I checked.

252
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,520
There are 53 people with the surname Lin in the entire Gaia Group.

253
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,320
Excluding those with the wrong age and gender

254
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,860
Compared with the Ning who was taken away by Lin Jinyang

255
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,380
There are now 3 suspects.

256
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,780
Lin Jinxiu from the Propaganda Department

257
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,820
And Lin Jinbo from the Planning Department

258
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,700
And Lin Ruiyang from the Security Department

259
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,260
Look where we start.

260
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,500
It stands to reason that if we want to train at the most basic level,

261
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,060
Then the Security Department

262
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,160
Since it is sent to the grassroots for training

263
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,300
Then you must train thoroughly.

264
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,060
The security department is unpredictable.

265
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,780
Smart, go.

266
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,120
Uh, who are you looking for?

267
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,800
Is director Leung Wan-ting here?

268
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,400
You are Mr. Gu, Gu Zhijun's assistant.

269
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,340
He asked me to hand over some things.

270
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,920
The director is busy now

271
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,580
I ask you to pass it on to him.

272
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,140
Xiaolin, let him in.

273
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,460
Thanks

274
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,840
Let's say we must meet.

275
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,460
Even willing to be Gu Chijun's assistant

276
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,500
What do you want to say?

277
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,300
Director Liang

278
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,300
Can you go see dad?

279
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,620
Although I don't know

280
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,300
Why did you separate in the first place?

281
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,540
But I know that dad has never forgotten you.

282
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,060
You go and see if he's okay.

283
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,940
Dad has stomach cancer.

284
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,180
There aren't many days left.

285
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,580
You go and see him.

286
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,900
Mother

287
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,260
I thought I made it clear.

288
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,260
Between me and your father

289
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,580
There is no longer any legal or moral restraint.

290
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,780
This is a call from my friend.

291
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,740
He is an expert in cancer.

292
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,300
If you have any financial needs

293
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,380
You can contact my assistant Ji Xiaolu

294
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,940
Mother

295
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,100
I just want you to go see daddy.

296
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,580
Dad, he really misses you.

297
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,280
Dad really wants our family to be reunited.

298
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,060
You know what, mom?

299
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,260
What I can provide you

300
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,100
That's all.

301
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,500
That's all for today.

302
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,860
It's been hard work.

303
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,900
Director Liang, are you particularly satisfied with my paella?

304
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,340
Is there any praise?

305
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,200
Love Stonehenge

306
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,020
Hey Xueshan, I'm talking to you, what's wrong with you?

307
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,220
Why are you such a gossipy person?

308
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,200
Mr. Gu, the director told you that you have to use this prop in the next two days.

309
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,660
Do you think you should keep it in the group or keep it yourself?

310
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,460
We just keep it ourselves.

311
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,440
Xu Zhen

312
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,500
You take this to my lounge.

313
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,660
You must be careful not to break it.

314
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,060
Hey Chi Juan, I feel like Xu Zhen seems to be acting weird lately

315
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,440
He said before that he wanted to work at Gaia Entertainment because of the two shows.

316
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,180
I feel like he has a special relationship with both of them.

317
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,100
Could you please care about something serious?

318
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,720
Didn't you tell me to get along well with the director?

319
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,460
This isn't a serious matter.

320
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,060
Okay, I'll arrange something serious for you.

321
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,740
Please take Junjun to the veterinary hospital to give him a bath.

322
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,780
Get rid of all the bugs that need to be gotten rid of.

323
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,820
Why? Because I'm still clean.

324
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,300
Don't go soon

325
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,800
no

326
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,540
It's Boss Guo

327
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,140
Excuse me, what can I do for you two?

328
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,940
You are Lin Ruiyang, yes

329
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,140
Do you know Lin Jiyang, Mr. Lin?

330
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,940
Hey, why are you asking? It's obvious that it's not

331
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,700
Let's go, sister.

332
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,060
Is it possible that he was afraid of being recognized so he disguised himself so thoroughly?

333
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,200
He looks like this

334
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,020
No matter how much he pretends, he's not...

335
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,860
Your name is Lin Jingbo, right?

336
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,740
I asked you, a foreigner, why do you choose a Chinese name?

337
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,260
I love China

338
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,860
Is it a problem that my girlfriend named me this?

339
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,780
no problem

340
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,760
withdraw

341
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,060
It must be him.

342
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,640
Walk

343
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,620
Yes, Mr. Zhang's express delivery and parcels

344
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,820
Hey, sister Fu, this is the mop you asked me to get. I got it back for you. Thank you. It's okay.

345
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,500
Hmm, this is the folder you want.

346
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,580
Mr. Chen, I also picked up your express delivery for you.

347
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,100
And I got you the WeChat of Xiao Zhang from the Planning Department that you asked for. Really?

348
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,980
When did I ask you to help me? I just asked you to help me understand the work arrangements.

349
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,660
If you don't want it, I'll just tear it up. Stop, stop, stop.

350
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:40,040
I also want to discuss this with you all among the staff. Oh, by the way.

351
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,860
It's afternoon tea time. Buy something to drink for Da Huang. You know what to buy, right?

352
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,280
Of course I know

353
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,940
Yours is caramel mocha, please use soy milk instead of milk

354
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,820
The compound solution is ginger and red date tea, which requires red dates but not ginger.

355
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,020
By the way, Jiaoma's American coffee needs ice cubes

356
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:05,680
And Manager Zhang's is the Hong Kong style Yuanyang, but don't put sugar in it, right?

357
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,300
Yes, don't add sugar

358
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,180
Got it. Let's go buy it now.

359
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,720
Have you found Lin Junxiu's office?

360
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,100
Well, how do I look today? I feel so suffocated.

361
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,580
Why is it this annoying guy again?

362
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,860
Oh, aren't you coming in?

363
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,060
I'm a star. Can I take the same elevator with you?

364
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,720
ah

365
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,580
Hey Xiaozhen

366
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,160
Further studies

367
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,340
Upward run

368
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,460
He called him Lin Jinxiu

369
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,660
Um, I didn't watch it

370
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,960
Why

371
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,000
Hey, why are you carrying so many things again? Let me help you.

372
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,100
No need, I can carry it. It's okay, I just feel uncomfortable. I'll help you. No need.

373
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,220
What's going on?

374
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,420
The elevator seems to be broken.

375
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,660
We have to quickly call someone to rescue us oh oh oh

376
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,660
Hey, is there anyone?

377
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,060
Is there anyone outside?

378
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,260
Oh, help!

379
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,140
Help!

380
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,300
Is anyone here

381
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,900
I think I heard them shouting for help

382
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,280
Is there anyone?

383
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,780
Sister Fei can't

384
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,160
If Lin Jinxiu knew that he was trapped in the elevator because of you

385
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,020
He will definitely be unhappy.

386
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,800
This is your first meeting

387
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,580
Gotta leave a good impression.

388
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,960
I can't just watch him trapped in there.

389
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Do not worry

390
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,880
I just called the maintenance man.

391
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,920
They'll be here in a minute

392
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,220
Let's go to his office and wait.

393
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,540
So that as soon as he escapes from danger, he will see you waiting for him to come back

394
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,020
How touching my heart must be.

395
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,820
Smart and fast walking

396
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,780
Is there anyone outside? Is there anyone outside?

397
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,300
Help! Is there anyone outside?

398
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,300
Help!

399
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,720
Director Liu

400
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,540
Have you read this news?

401
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,700
Well-known domestic entertainment company accused of stealing box office

402
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,140
Female artist reports scandal of the group

403
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,060
Complaints about unfair treatment

404
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,060
Take a look

405
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,780
Although there is no name mentioned above

406
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,660
But the only thing missing is writing the two words "this case"

407
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,900
Director Lin, what do you think?

408
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,980
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin

409
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,260
I will contact the public relations department immediately to handle this matter

410
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,300
Minimize the impact

411
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,660
The function of the public relations department is to nip all unfavorable news in the bud.

412
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,100
Instead of waiting for something to happen before remedying it.

413
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,620
But Director Liu, you don't have to worry.

414
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,020
this matter

415
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,420
The news that should have appeared in the entertainment headlines has been suppressed by me

416
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,660
But I may be able to suppress it this time, but I may not be able to suppress it next time

417
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,260
Oh, that female artist Li Qian.

418
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,660
Seems like he's very close to Director Liu.

419
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,260
The last time I drank

420
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,780
And the last time I had dinner with Mr. Fang

421
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,900
It seems like Director Liu takes good care of him.

422
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,220
Ah, I remember.

423
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,500
It seems like he was promoted by Director Liu, right?

424
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,719
Sorry, Mr. Lin

425
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,239
I will definitely educate him well.

426
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,539
Take care of this matter

427
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,800
Director Liu

428
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,059
If a person has a heart

429
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,539
It's useless to say anything more

430
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,580
You don't have to worry about this matter.

431
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,900
I'll fix it.

432
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,140
Mr. Lin, Li Qian'er is just young and ignorant.

433
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,020
He doesn't understand the company's efforts for him.

434
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,600
I will educate him.

435
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,180
Please give him another chance.

436
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,300
Things like this kind of uncooperative

437
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,100
Li Qianer has done this more than once or twice.

438
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,680
And you have been following me all these years

439
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,820
You should know what kind of personality I have.

440
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,700
When have I ever given others room to change their decision?

441
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,180
Okay, you go down.

442
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,180
OK

443
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,260
bacteria

444
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,680
Dog roundworm dog

445
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,760
Dog toxoplasma gondii

446
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,220
Removal completed

447
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,060
Vaccine

448
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,940
Bathing and disinfection is OK

449
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,840
Oh, you guys are really

450
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,140
There was a warning sign in front saying that the elevator had a problem and could not be used.

451
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,080
Aren't you guys doing this knowingly?

452
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,160
Master, when we ran over here just now, there was no warning sign at all.

453
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,240
You check it quickly

454
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,260
Stop hurting other people.

455
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,860
I have to go to the props team to return the clothes. I'm busy now.

456
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,920
Xiaojun

457
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,460
Decided to return it to him later.

458
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,700
It's over. It's over.

459
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,100
Should I ask him to pick up the express for me?

460
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,720
You also asked him to help you get the WeChat ID of Miss Zhang from the Planning Department. What else did you say?

461
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,320
Last time you asked him to go downstairs to get you some fast food

462
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,940
I forgot to bring soup and asked someone to run a special trip.

463
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,060
Now that's enough.

464
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,980
You didn't have the nerve to say that you asked him to help you get a file.

465
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,140
Also, when you asked your father to go to the logistics department to help you get the head, right?

466
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,580
Manager, manager, you

467
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,000
Please help me, I can't be fired.

468
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,980
My whole family is supporting me. I have given birth to an 8-year-old. Our next

469
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,980
Oops, that's it.

470
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,600
My daughter was admitted to university

471
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,800
My wife is in menopause.

472
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,980
My mother-in-law asked me to pay 5,000 yuan for living expenses every month.

473
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,180
I don't know what I should do

474
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,960
You blind people.

475
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,740
Dare to bully our little villain

476
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,940
But considering your good attitude now

477
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,660
Talk to me right now.

478
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,660
Maybe I can still do it in front of the elementary school

479
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,220
A few words for each of you

480
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,920
Brother, you are back.

481
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,840
Oh, by the way, there was an accident in the elevator just now.

482
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,620
So it took a little time. Oh, it’s okay. Haha.

483
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,760
manager

484
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:24,700
I forgot to tell them not to put sugar in the Yuanyang milk tea you ordered. Well, I'll go buy another cup.

485
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,860
Need not

486
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,740
It's sweet and delicious

487
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,140
Hahahaha, if you need any help in the future, just let me know.

488
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,700
Uh, colleagues should be united and friendly. Hahaha, aren't these colleagues? Xiaoxiu

489
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,420
do you still remember me

490
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,340
We can meet several times in the elevator

491
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,340
I am Xiao Fei

492
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,020
You are the woman who got into the elevator last but insisted on kicking others out.

493
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,100
Hey, manager, can you help me kick her out?

494
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,700
Blast it out

495
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,600
Xiaojun

496
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,960
come over

497
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,960
Xiao Juanjuan

498
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,080
come over

499
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,260
Although I am

500
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,620
The most hated animal

501
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,660
But I have to admit

502
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,820
Sometimes I see you

503
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,380
My mood will really get better.

504
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,900
Otherwise I will send mercy

505
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,260
Can you please call him back to play with you?

506
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,720
Who knows?

507
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,220
He's so happy to see you.

508
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,540
The mood will also get better

509
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,240
But don't be happy too soon.

510
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,340
I do this

511
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,660
That doesn't mean I don't intend to drive him away.

512
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,060
There's no phone number for Xiao Ren's family on it.

513
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,020
Why

514
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,740
How can I give him the phone?

515
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,900
Hello, is this Mr. Lei?

516
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,340
Mr. Lei

517
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,140
My last name is not Lei

518
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,860
Who are you? Why is Xu Zhen's phone here with you?

519
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,940
But it shows Rex.

520
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,260
I'm Xiaozhen's friend. His phone was left with me and I'm wondering how to return it to him.

521
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,460
What is Rex

522
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,020
I am Xu Zhen's boss.

523
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,020
Why are you holding Xu Zhen's phone?

524
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,580
who are you

525
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,320
I am Xu Zhen's childhood sweetheart. We grew up together.

526
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,260
As his boss, you even interfere in the private life of your employees. Aren't you meddling too much?

527
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,220
I don't care whose childhood sweetheart you are

528
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,740
Xu Zhen is now working time

529
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,420
Ask him to come back to me immediately.

530
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,220
Otherwise, leave immediately

531
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,080
Who is it?

532
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,140
Such a bad temper

533
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,500
Tyrannosaurus Rex

534
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,100
OK Xu Zhen

535
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,700
Very patient.

536
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,540
Give me a nickname
