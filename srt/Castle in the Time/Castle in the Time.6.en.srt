1
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,520
You kid

2
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,460
You are so outrageous.

3
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,520
Is this how you treat your family business?

4
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,320
ah

5
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,120
I built the Duck Herding Industry with my own hard work.

6
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,480
Isn't it possible that today it will be destroyed in your hands?

7
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,660
Dad, you don't seem to understand whether it is me who is not serious about the company or you who are not serious about the company.

8
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,740
The City of Time project was originally built by me.

9
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,080
Now you have to give it to me

10
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,260
Isn't it normal that I can't do it well?

11
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,460
OK

12
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,780
You are right if you don't work hard, right?

13
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,080
You know how much I've spent on you?

14
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,160
You, you go to the crew right now and apologize to Director Liang

15
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,100
I dont go

16
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,800
Dad, you always say it's for my own good and for the good of the family.

17
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,180
For the good of the entire company

18
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,540
But when have you ever considered how my brother and I really feel?

19
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
I didn’t want to go abroad before.

20
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,420
You have to force me to go

21
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,180
Now I don't want to come back but you force me to come back

22
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,060
I don't care anyway

23
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,820
I must return the title of producer of City of Time to my brother.

24
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,920
hey

25
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,180
Hey, nephew, look, I have completed the transfer procedures for Uncle Xue.

26
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,440
Isn't it said that it's very difficult to get into Cixin Hospital?

27
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,600
And the attending doctor was changed to the famous Dr. Zhang.

28
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,000
What's so strange about this?

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,740
My dad is just lucky.

30
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,780
Maybe the hospital took into consideration that my father is a scientific research elite.

31
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,900
I gave you special treatment.

32
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,500
How can it be as simple as you say?

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,220
But it's a good thing that Uncle Xue can find Doctor Zhang.

34
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,980
Let's go talk to Dr. Zhang.

35
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,860
The situation is probably like this

36
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,700
We can only do our best

37
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,740
But anyway

38
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,180
Keeping the patient in a good mood will be of great help to the treatment

39
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,260
I hope you can cooperate more in your daily life.

40
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,080
Dr. Zhang, thank you for your concern.

41
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,340
We will pay more attention in the future.

42
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,920
There's nothing else.

43
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,400
Remember to spend more time with him

44
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,460
eat medicine on time

45
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,040
Thank you, Dr. Zhang

46
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,220
We're leaving first.

47
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,660
You're welcome, Dr. Xie

48
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,340
Hey Town

49
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,580
Do you know who is responsible for Uncle Xu's good fortune this time?

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,940
Didn't you just say you didn't know?

51
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,020
How come this is in your hand, Sister Rui?

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,160
I just saw this on Dr. Zhang's desk.

53
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,680
I secretly took a photo of it

54
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Look at Ji Xiaorui

55
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,620
Assistant Director of City of Time

56
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,020
Isn't your mother the director of Time City?

57
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,900
Well, it seems your mother is not as cold as she seems.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,740
If it's really him

59
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,820
I feel better about Liang Wan.

60
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,320
Xiaorui, turn right at the next intersection

61
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,020
I want to go somewhere first

62
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,460
Aren't you going home?

63
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,940
Not going back yet

64
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,620
I want to see someone good.

65
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,440
Dad, if the doctor gives you an injection

66
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,260
If you're scared, just hold my hand.

67
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,500
The disease will be cured after the injection

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,060
Qiao Rui, let's go back.

69
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,820
Director Liang, the person you said you wanted to see is Professor Xu Zhengyao?

70
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,300
Why don't you go down and take a look?

71
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,340
forget it

72
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,660
Some things are over.

73
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,300
It seems like what can happen

74
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,700
Let's go, yeah

75
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,940
What happened to my daughter?

76
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,620
No dad

77
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,540
ah

78
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,280
Your mother arranged this transfer for you.

79
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,460
I think he still thinks about us.

80
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,100
Our family will be reunited soon.

81
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,180
Dad, are you very happy now?

82
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,600
Your mother

83
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,380
He has his own ideas

84
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,680
After all, he has been gone from our lives for so many years.

85
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,820
You can't force anything.

86
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,760
This is how I love you, Mom.

87
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,740
That's the way you love me, haha.

88
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,340
Oh, by the way, Xiao Chen

89
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,540
The mining site we visited last time

90
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,980
It has been proven that it is indeed a group of dinosaur fossils.

91
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,580
My colleagues who work with me have already rushed over.

92
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,260
I want to go see it, too.

93
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,239
Ah, Dad, how can it be such a coincidence?

94
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:42,099
It happens to be a rare fossil group.

95
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:44,320
Those uncles are all paleontologists

96
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,580
The slightest movement makes me excited.

97
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:53,260
Hahahaha, this news report has already confirmed it, take a look

98
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,860
Dad, how can this be possible?

99
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,300
Your current physical condition does not allow you to travel back and forth

100
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
You must be well taken care of in the hospital.

101
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,420
I won't agree

102
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,140
My daughter, although none of you told me

103
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,940
But I know my own physical condition very well.

104
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,100
My father started to learn about paleontology when he was 18 years old and chose his major in college.

105
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,020
It's been almost 30 years

106
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,140
This is my life's work

107
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,380
I look upon him

108
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,100
Much more important than looking at my life

109
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,160
No one should go and see me one last time to say goodbye

110
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,860
I really can't reconcile myself.

111
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,460
I can die at dusk if I hear the truth in the morning.

112
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,380
I hope you can support Dad's last wish.

113
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,100
If you don't agree

114
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,440
Dad will also contact your brothers and sisters in school

115
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,460
Let them take me there.

116
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,140
I think this scene needs some rethinking.

117
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
Do you think there is something wrong with my performance?

118
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,940
Anyway, it's not the same as the archaeologist I imagined.

119
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,540
What's wrong?

120
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Xiaojunjun

121
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,780
Xiaojunjun

122
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,400
Ko Toshun

123
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,960
Ko Toshun

124
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,060
Xiaojunjun, what's wrong with you?

125
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,340
ah

126
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,700
Don't worry, it's okay.

127
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,600
I probably had a stomachache during the day.

128
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,060
I've been giving him injections all night.

129
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,840
Let him drink plenty of water after returning home in the next two days

130
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,160
Don't eat meat. Don't give him any dairy products in the last two days.

131
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,460
There shouldn't be any problem.

132
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,020
Thanks

133
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,300
Xiao Juanjuan is so good

134
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,380
Sister will take you home now

135
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,960
Hey, what happened to him?

136
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,180
are you sick

137
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,300
This kitten's mother just fell ill and passed away

138
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,040
Since his mother passed away

139
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,700
He became unhappy and refused to eat or drink.

140
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,860
Director Liang

141
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,300
You go

142
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,580
Meet Daddy

143
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,760
Although

144
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,020
I don't know why you broke up.

145
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,020
But I know that daddy has never forgotten you

146
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,540
Dad has stomach cancer.

147
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,580
There aren't many days left.

148
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,940
I beg you

149
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,500
Just go meet him.

150
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:02,880
mom

151
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,860
Your father's situation

152
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,060
Isn't that good?

153
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,300
I think

154
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm just like that kitten

155
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,740
Nothing can be done

156
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Xu Zhen

157
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,860
I understand your feelings.

158
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,620
Your father is sick.

159
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,140
The pain he endured

160
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,500
It should hurt more than all of you.

161
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,500
You are an adult

162
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,700
If you can't change him

163
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,140
Then you just have to accept him.

164
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,500
If you act sad

165
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,020
I'm sure your father will be even sadder.

166
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,420
So in the days to come

167
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,300
Spend time with him

168
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,420
Let him spend the rest of his days

169
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,460
Can be better

170
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,780
Your dad is a paleontologist, right?

171
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,600
he

172
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,660
Do you want to go to this place?

173
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,580
yes

174
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,940
but

175
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,300
The road is bumpy

176
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,840
His current physical condition is like this

177
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,540
So I'm worried

178
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,740
You don't have to worry about this

179
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,740
Leave the problems on the road to me.

180
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,460
I play a paleontologist.

181
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,060
It just so happens that your father is also a paleontologist

182
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,420
He wants to go to the painter's site

183
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,340
I also want to go to the painter's site

184
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,100
If you can go to the painter's mining site

185
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,140
It is a learning and improvement for me.

186
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,500
And with an expert like your dad by your side

187
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,640
What a rare opportunity!

188
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,140
How could I not catch it?

189
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,140
Did you fix the model for me that day?

190
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,840
oh

191
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,420
I'm just helping out.

192
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,700
I don't want others to think that my handling is stupid.

193
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,060
Thanks

194
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,180
Hey boss

195
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,280
You called me early in the morning

196
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,760
I am your agent

197
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,880
Not your assistant

198
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,660
I really don't understand why you would sacrifice an agent to help your assistant.

199
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,260
Xu Zhen's father is the country's top paleontologist

200
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,860
Where's your dad?

201
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,980
I need to get in touch with the best experts in the country

202
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,500
Come find the feeling of a banquet

203
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,100
Can you give it to me

204
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,580
Hahahaha

205
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,300
There have been some delays today.

206
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,420
The trailer must be completed within this week

207
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,520
Well, you can discuss it with the coordinator.

208
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,240
Ask him to send another notice.

209
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,260
Good leadership

210
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,320
Why

211
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,900
Mr. Lin, um, Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin

212
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,800
Wanting, I know everything that happened yesterday.

213
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,440
I'm so sorry.

214
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,700
Xiao Xiu is a very careless child.

215
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,460
I didn't expect to cause so much trouble to the crew.

216
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,960
I'll take him to apologize to you and the crew.

217
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,800
Hey, you don't have to do this.

218
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,220
Sit down and talk first. Okay, let's talk slowly.

219
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,720
Why

220
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,760
Wanting, Xiaoqiu, this kid just graduated and has no work experience.

221
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,060
There are many things that I can't handle well.

222
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:22,498
It's also my fault that I didn't set high standards for him.

223
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:29,260
How about this? I'll send another experienced person to the crew as executive producer.

224
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,300
What happened today?

225
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,020
Just for my sake

226
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,140
Don't bother with Xiaoxiu.

227
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,480
Sister

228
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,020
Understand

229
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,260
Good Chairman

230
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,500
I'll arrange it right away

231
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,200
Is it true that I can't ask any questions?

232
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,340
Can't ask

233
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
I won't ask about emotional issues.

234
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,900
I just want to ask him what hobbies or characteristics he has. Is that not okay?

235
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,100
Can not be done

236
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,500
Well, I'll go there with you later.

237
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
No, no, absolutely not.

238
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,360
You are a gossip reporter. Who knows what gossip you can dig out when your professional traits kick in?

239
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,680
This time, Mr. Gu is willing to take the initiative to take my father to investigate the scene.

240
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,080
We must not let him down.

241
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,420
You are not allowed to ask any personal questions when he comes, okay?

242
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,160
Yeah, ok, ok, ok

243
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,820
Revolutionary sentiment is above all else.

244
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,880
Do not worry

245
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,160
Just based on our friendship

246
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,260
I will never betray your boss Gu

247
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,440
Even though I secretly took photos

248
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,220
Before posting, I must give him a pair of 2.8-meter-long legs.

249
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,300
Even if you wear it as a 2.8 meter long leg, it won't work

250
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,380
Oh well, they are here.

251
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,800
Hey hey hey

252
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
I just take pictures

253
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,340
No taking photos!

254
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,740
hurry up

255
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,020
Can't shoot this, can't shoot this

256
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,260
Go back

257
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,460
Bye bye

258
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,180
Dad, they are here.

259
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,020
This is my father. This is Uncle Gu Chijun. Hello.

260
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,900
Let's get in the car, okay?

261
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,480
Hey Xu Zhan um hey

262
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,300
Who was that person just now?

263
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,100
It's a friend of mine.

264
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,300
Jinxiu did something wrong.

265
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,300
As a brother, you should help him more.

266
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,460
Dad, I will.

267
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,480
I will find an experienced producer team to do this.

268
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,420
besides

269
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,660
Last time my name was Liu Weicheng

270
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,920
Find that Li Qianer

271
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,980
So far, I haven't seen anyone.

272
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,340
It's my words that don't work

273
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,240
Is there some engine in here?

274
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,380
Li Qianer may feel malicious slander

275
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
I don't have the face to see you

276
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,700
But don't worry

277
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,820
I'll go find someone else to look for him.

278
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,860
A series of things happened

279
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,900
There is nothing that reassures me.

280
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,820
I don't know what you're doing

281
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,540
In addition to wanting to inherit dry raising

282
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,380
How to kick me out of the position of chairman?

283
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,020
In addition to this

284
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,100
You didn't think about anything, Dad.

285
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,940
Over the years

286
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,900
I have always regarded running a business well as the most important thing in life.

287
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,700
There was no slackness for a single second.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,660
There is no selfishness

289
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,260
But I didn't know until today

290
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,740
No matter how hard I try

291
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,060
No matter how hard I work

292
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,420
I can't get any praise from you

293
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,900
In your eyes

294
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,180
Only blame and grievance

295
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,340
But have you ever thought about

296
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,540
You're doing this to my son.

297
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,540
Is it really fair?

298
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,620
right

299
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,940
It's really unfair

300
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,780
You've worked so hard over the years.

301
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,340
I never let you rest.

302
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,040
Well, start from today

303
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,740
Find a place to take a vacation.

304
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,980
I will find someone to take over your job.

305
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,780
As we said,

306
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,740
Execute it

307
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Editor-in-Chief Liu

308
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,740
Didn't you already promise me?

309
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,900
Said he wanted to report about me and Gaia

310
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,940
Why do you suddenly regret it?

311
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,760
Everything I posted on Weibo and forums was deleted inexplicably.

312
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,540
I also looked for a lot of other media

313
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,300
They won't help me

314
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,320
If you reject me again, I will be helpless. Can you please understand me?

315
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,560
This is a big company helping

316
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,460
You really can't afford to offend a small newspaper.

317
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,660
Otherwise

318
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,820
Please contact other media.

319
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,540
I can't help you with my arrogance

320
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,740
Editor-in-Chief Liu

321
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,120
Editor-in-Chief Liu

322
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,220
Hello, Miss Li Qian

323
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,500
I know a newspaper that can see the story you want.

324
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,780
I will send the contact information of the homepage to your mobile phone

325
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,100
If you are interested

326
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,220
You can contact him.

327
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,180
Who are you?

328
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,420
I want to thank you for fulfilling my father's wish today.

329
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,740
Mr. Gu, you are actually a very good person sometimes.

330
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,740
What do you mean by sometimes?

331
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,900
It should be every time

332
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,460
It seems that your understanding of me is still at a very superficial level.

333
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,380
What are you laughing at?

334
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,300
Oh, although you don't work seriously,

335
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,780
But since you have decided to be my assistant

336
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,260
I want to assign you some independent work.

337
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,420
What content

338
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,980
I won't hide it from you.

339
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,740
Please help me think of a solution.

340
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,820
How can I get my love?

341
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,160
Zhang Shiyu is already old and still single

342
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,700
I'm sure there's no good way.

343
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,860
So I think women should understand women better

344
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,420
Please help me think of a solution.

345
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,420
But I don't have any experience.

346
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,820
This work

347
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,380
Only success is allowed, no failure is allowed

348
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,380
If you fail

349
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,900
I think it will be hard for you to see your mother again

350
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,000
ah

351
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,520
Mr. Lin

352
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:34,340
Still can't find it. The people sent out have searched all the restaurants and bars that Xiaoxiu likes to go to.

353
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,860
There's no news from him.

354
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,980
The cards in his hand were not touched.

355
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,020
Yes, Mr. Lee

356
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,100
Xiao Xiu didn't take anything with him when he went out.

357
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,260
This child has never suffered any hardship since childhood.

358
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,660
I've been out for so long now.

359
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,620
I'm really worried

360
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,140
Director Liang

361
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,320
On the day of the promo shoot, my phone rang.

362
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,620
I'm really sorry

363
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,040
Dad's transfer to another hospital has been arranged.

364
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,980
Thank you

365
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,420
He's in much better spirits now.

366
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,600
He read in the newspaper that a group of Beresheetian fossils had been discovered somewhere.

367
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,620
We also went there together.

368
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,380
Don't take it to heart

369
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,580
I should do this.

370
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,400
ah

371
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,540
I picked up a wolf-finned fish fossil at the site yesterday.

372
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,180
For you

373
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,300
I remember you used to like this kind of painter

374
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,140
I mentioned you when I was chatting with my dad the other day

375
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,060
He said you have your own considerations.

376
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,020
Respecting a person's ideas is the best way to love him

377
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,260
So I won't force you to do anything anymore.

378
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,140
only

379
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,220
Me and Dad

380
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,740
I really miss you very much

381
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,380
I go first

382
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,800
Hey, I heard that Mr. Xiaolin has been away from home for two days.

383
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,300
The chairman took many photos and went to look for him but no one knew where he was.

384
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,420
I heard that he had a big fight with the chairman.

385
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,580
What kind of missing game are you going to play now?

386
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,380
When the filming of this drama really starts, we still don’t know how to shoot it.

387
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,660
Oh, I say, you acted really well in that scene just now.

388
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,460
I feel like you have changed completely since you came back from the fossil site.

389
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,660
How did it change? It's like a living fossil all over my body.

390
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,180
I mean

391
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,140
There was really some Professor Xu's position yesterday.

392
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,280
Um

393
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,540
Hey, has the director called the customer list?

394
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,100
I heard that Xiaolin has picked the

395
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,060
It's so difficult to shoot a trailer

396
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,020
What if it is time to start the machine?

397
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,340
can not imagine

398
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,940
Hey Xu Zhen

399
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,900
Hey Xu Zhen, where are you going? Xu Zhen

400
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,860
Xiaojuan, how do you know I'm here?

401
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,380
Have you forgotten that when we were little, you would run here every time you were unhappy and you haven't been sick until now.

402
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,360
Xiaoxiu, why are you hiding here again?

403
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,060
The adults are looking for you.

404
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,640
My dad must send me to study abroad

405
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,060
I do not want to go

406
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,200
He sent me away right after my mom died.

407
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,860
Why are you doing this?

408
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,900
Don't they want me anymore?

409
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,520
I don't have any relatives in this world.

410
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,580
Don't cry, little bear.

411
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,900
Do you still remember the four-leaf clover amber I gave you?

412
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,680
Xiaoxiu four-leaf clover amber symbolizes happiness

413
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,680
Look at him when you are lonely

414
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,660
It won't be sad anymore.

415
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,900
I remember you told me when I was little

416
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,340
Four-leaf clover represents happiness

417
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,740
Amber represents eternity.

418
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,460
Just hold this necklace in your hand

419
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,660
You can hold happiness forever

420
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,100
But now

421
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:26,220
I already know everything about you and Uncle Lin.

422
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,020
I know you are not an irresponsible person.

423
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,420
You did that on the set that day

424
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,380
You must have your own reasons.

425
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,100
The City of Time is all my brother's hard work

426
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,860
It's really unfair for my dad to do that.

427
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,420
So I'm going to give this project back to him.

428
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,860
So that's why you're screwing everything up on purpose?

429
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,940
But if you do this, it will only make the relationship between your father and your brother more strained.

430
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,340
Your father only blames your brother for everything.

431
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,380
If you really want your dad to listen to you

432
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,660
If you want your brother to come back

433
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,400
You should do things like an adult.

434
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,300
Make others respect your ideas

435
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,400
You have to become a great person first.

436
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,800
People will actually listen to what you have to say.

437
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,840
Thus

438
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,140
Wouldn't there be no more conflicts among the family?

439
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,220
Do you really think so, town?

440
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,140
Of course

441
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,040
Oh, go home quickly.

442
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,780
Uncle Lin has been waiting for you.

443
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,160
I think you are right.

444
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,560
I was so naive to do that.

445
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,120
The City of Time is the hard work of all of us

446
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,520
So I should perform better.

447
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,080
Only in this way can my brother and I

448
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,740
Dad saw my efforts

449
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,460
Thank you, Xiaozhen, hahaha

450
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,660
You changed your boss.

451
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,740
No, I'm working.

452
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,520
That

453
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,540
It's the Story Army

454
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,500
There's a new person to blow kisses to. No wonder you wouldn't even let me see him yesterday.

455
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:16,000
Hey, what are you talking about? Don't talk nonsense.

456
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,260
Help your boss expand his network

457
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,900
It is also part of my job to connect every link of the film.

458
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,140
I said, Senior

459
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,100
We are sisters.

460
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,260
If Gu Chijun blows a kiss, you must tell me immediately

461
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,220
We must not let other magazines get ahead of us.

462
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,940
But the small town

463
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,180
You're really lucky to have this job.

464
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,340
There are so many big stars around me

465
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,340
You're not interested in anyone.

466
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,580
I remember when we were little, we all posted and collected posters on the wall.

467
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,700
You are the only one who posted Li Siguang.

468
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,060
Hey, why haven't you eaten yet? If you don't cook, what will we eat?

469
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:13,179
Hey, come here quickly.

470
00:34:13,319 --> 00:34:16,659
I have a question for you guys.

471
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,939
You say

472
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:22,139
How to confess to someone without being rejected?

473
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,199
Yeah, we're in love.

474
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:29,299
No, I'm asking for someone else.

475
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,740
If you continue to be single, I will use WeChat to find a partner for you.

476
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,980
You two are outstanding representatives of early love who have been dating since the second grade of elementary school.

477
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,960
I have failed many times along the way.

478
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,620
The experience value is definitely high

479
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,599
Tell me how to express your feelings to impress others.

480
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,060
Mm-m-m

481
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,819
I think first

482
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,018
The momentum should be big

483
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:55,699
Looks like a thief

484
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:59,500
Secondly, the difficulty level is high

485
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,460
Looks like a rich guy

486
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,460
the most important is

487
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,220
Good looks

488
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,760
For me, this is the most important

489
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,720
Everything else is secondary

490
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,020
Well, go away. Can you please confess?

491
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,980
No, no.

492
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,820
It's others who confessed to me.

493
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,980
Can you say something serious?

494
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,420
Haha, this is very particular.

495
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,580
First of all, it depends on who you are confessing to.

496
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,580
Male Female

497
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,620
female

498
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,100
Old, young, ugly, pretty, what's the star sign, what's the blood type, what's the personality

499
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,260
Different methods for different objects

500
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,700
Only by knowing yourself and your enemy and tailoring your strategy can you win every battle

501
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,180
Wait, isn't it the most important thing to impress people with your sincerity?

502
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,380
You should also find a way to let others see your sincerity, okay?

503
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,780
Who doesn't have a sincere heart even if they put aside their stomach?

504
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,060
The most important thing is to know what this person likes.

505
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,500
If you are a very realistic person

506
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,660
Then throw money at it

507
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,920
Tell him I have money and a future with him

508
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,460
If it's a dream

509
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,480
Then give him the stars, the moon and all kinds of Korean dramas

510
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,000
How to be romantic?

511
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,720
Find a beautiful place to talk to Beibeishi seriously

512
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,740
Suta

513
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,620
If it's a literary card

514
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,700
Then you have to be talented

515
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,720
How to catch fish depends on acquired knowledge

516
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,340
If it's a face control

517
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,520
Then dress yourself up to look more handsome.

518
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,620
Buy some high-end perfume

519
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,980
Make him think you have good taste

520
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,840
ah

521
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,180
ah

522
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,500
Minor repair

523
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,320
Hey, brother is back.

524
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,620
You're back

525
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
I've seen the meal.

526
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,700
Um

527
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,660
Just got trained

528
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,660
Hey, do you know

529
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,720
Dad has been worried to death these past two days.

530
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,880
Don't do this again in the future.

531
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,660
I know I'll never do that again.

532
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,420
I've made you suffer these past two days.

533
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
What are you saying?

534
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,160
Okay, it's getting late, let's go back to our room and get some rest.

535
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,000
I can't rest yet.

536
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,020
I have to think about work later.

537
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,540
Work

538
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,280
Did I hear that correctly?

539
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,960
Yeah, I've figured it out.

540
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,660
All the empires of the company now are built by you bit by bit

541
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,580
That’s why I didn’t work so hard before

542
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,880
Our previous projects received a variety of problems

543
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,600
This is really wrong, so from now on I must turn over a new leaf and work hard.

544
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,940
This is the greatest comfort to my brother.

545
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,540
What are you doing?

546
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,840
Look, everyone else is working so hard.

547
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,980
Shouldn't I try harder?

548
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,540
Do good deeds

549
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,860
Dad will be very happy to know this news

550
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,040
Um

551
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,160
That's right, bro.

552
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,060
I have something to ask of you because I will have to trouble you with many things I don't understand in the future.

553
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,700
You have troubled me so little.

554
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,700
When did you become so polite to me?

555
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh, it's troublesome.

556
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,780
It's still necessary to be polite.

557
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,360
I feel like you've become a different person.

558
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,860
When did you focus on work?

559
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,840
Is there? No?

560
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,360
Am I still the same?

561
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,820
20 years of dedicated work has never changed

562
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,780
wrong

563
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,020
I guess you are probably in love.

564
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,220
Um, where is it?

565
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,480
Um

566
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,280
normal friend

567
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,300
Ordinary friend aunt

568
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,500
You can't hide it from me

569
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,780
Go back to bed early, eh?

570
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,160
Xiaoxiu

571
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,920
Fang Yi

572
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,780
Where did this person go?

573
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,200
Be careful, I went out early in the morning.

574
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,420
Did you go to work?

575
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,160
His car is still parked at the door.

576
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,320
I do not know

577
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,460
I saw him rushing out in the morning

578
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I can't even call you

579
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,540
This is really strange.

580
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,620
Now I go to work early in the morning

581
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,120
Hello, I have a lot of things to repair.

582
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,060
Stanislav Konway also has some jibs and stuff

583
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,100
What weekends off?

584
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,020
It's okay, you guys can attack me, I'll pay you whatever money you have.

585
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,100
Is this the takeaway you ordered? Just put it on that table.

586
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,720
Good morning. Have you had breakfast yet?

587
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,600
I have already eaten

588
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,940
You must not be full. Come on, have breakfast.

589
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,500
Thank you Mr. Xiaolin for breakfast. Thank you, thank you.

590
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,000
Get breakfast early

591
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
Thank you

592
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,140
Those who haven't had breakfast yet can take it here.

593
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,660
That's enough, Mr. Kobayashi.

594
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,340
My name is Wang. I am the on-site producer sent by General Manager Lin.

595
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,420
Then he asked me to go to the scene to help you. If you need anything, he will call you Hello Wang Zhipian

596
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,080
Hello, hello, have you had breakfast?

597
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,860
Ah, take one of this.

598
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,780
I'm telling you, our group's breakfast is really bad. From now on, I'll take care of breakfast whenever I'm here.

599
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,160
Mr. Xiaolin, this will cause our crew to overspend. It's okay.

600
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,360
As long as everyone is happy eating

601
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,060
I'm responsible for the overspending.

602
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,980
One more thing

603
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,180
Why hasn't Xu Zhen come yet?

604
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,700
There is no story-telling show today. What?

605
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,340
No, wasn't there a play about Story-kun yesterday?

606
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,260
Oh, don't you know?

607
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,620
Gu Shijun said he was not feeling well today and had to temporarily change his schedule with Qingziqin.

608
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,900
Physical discomfort

609
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,320
Hey, can the time of this announcement be changed at will?

610
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,580
You really don't take me, the producer, seriously.

611
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,620
No, this happened last night.

612
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,540
Then we couldn't contact you at all.

613
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,500
I see

614
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,540
Then I'll go first
