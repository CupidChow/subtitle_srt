47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,480
this

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,300


49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
four-leaf clover amber

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
!

51
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,480
yes!

52
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,480
You gave it to me when I was a kid,

53
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
Xiaozhen. I

54
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
really want to thank you!

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,120


56
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:50,960

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,880


59
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,520


60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,716
Someone is coming to arrest you.

61
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:01,000
Xiaozhen,

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,077
even if you owe me this bottle of vegetable juice after so many years,

63
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,901
I will withdraw it first!  Bye-Bye!

64
00:03:05,901 --> 00:03:10,600


65
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,680


66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680


67
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680


68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,600


69
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,560


70
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,600


71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Chijun

72
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Kevin is here,

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,360
Mr. Gu,

74
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,240
hello,

75
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,040
Mr. Gu, take a look.

76
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,400
These designs

77
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
are all designed by our team for you

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,920
based on the latest trends in the world. Is

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360


80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,480
this one right?

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,480


82
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,680


83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,680
Then I know what

84
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,440
your requirements are.  It's always been very high,

85
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,040
so

86
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,880
we definitely don't dare to neglect it.

87
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,360
You see,

88
00:03:57,907 --> 00:03:59,507
all the so-called meticulousness of your team

89
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:01,067
is spent time

90
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,701
searching for pictures on the Internet, right?

91
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:05,154
Mr. Gu, I

92
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:06,673
'm sorry,

93
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,431
because this time

94
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:09,916
is really too rushed,

95
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,818
so what?  I took out

96
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,658
an entire quarter of external design at once,

97
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,240
so I’m actually very embarrassed.

98
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,560
You’ve been following me for so long

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,760
and you know what kind of people I hate the most,

100
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,320
so I won’t come tomorrow.

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,079
Mr. Gu, please listen to me.

102
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,720
Otherwise,

103
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
I will redesign a more fashionable set for you tomorrow.

104
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600


105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I will say it again.

106
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,960
I hate unprincipled people the most.

107
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,200
Mr. Gu,

108
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,640
Kevin,

109
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,680
please listen to me and explain

110
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,880
Mr. Gu’s temper.

111
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,040
I believe you know best.

112
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,640
Thank you.

113
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,720
You go back first and let

114
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
me tell you.

115
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,200


116
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:52,120
Xiaoyan, I’m back.

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,240
Sister is back.

118
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,720
My father is here.

119
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,440
Uncle Xu is not in good spirits today. He went to

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,640
bed early.

121
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,760
I don’t know if he is feeling unwell.

122
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,440
Sister, let’s take

123
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800


124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,080
Uncle Xu with us sometime.

125
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,600
Go to the hospital for a full body check-up.

126
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,040
You don’t have to worry.

127
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,000
My dad may be tired from working too much recently. Let’s

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,520


129
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,920
eat first. Let’s eat the

130
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,560
food soon. Let’s have a taste. My

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,240


132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,440


133
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
dear

134
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:39,040
sister, are

135
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,540


136
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,320
you hiding something from me? I’m

137
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
hiding nothing from you.

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,120
Today's rice was cooked well. The

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,080
vegetables were all fried and

140
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,120
not too much salt was added.

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,560
Even the steamed rice was just right.

142
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,840
There was progress. Xu Zhen.

143
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,400


144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,960
Strictly speaking, we

145
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
are only half a year apart. I

146
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,640
call you sister,

147
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,520
but I don't want to let my child be adopted.  Uncle Xu

148
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,280
is just worried. Do

149
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,560
you think I will really

150
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,640
give in to your words? Oh,

151
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,900


152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm going to open the door. I'm

153
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,340


154
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,920
really exhausted after working all day.

155
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,440
And you, please, can

156
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,320
those big stars

157
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,960
not send out press releases during off-duty hours?  If

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960


159
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,120
you have human rights, let's

160
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,240
go down to the editor of the entertainment network. Thank you for your

161
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,200
hard work.

162
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,320
Sit down and have a good meal. The

163
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,840
editor

164
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,080
is obviously a gossip reporter.

165
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,040
I was in school and

166
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
I was having dinner at Xu Zhen's house.

167
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
You hadn't shown up yet. Xu

168
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Zhen,

169
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
you.  Did you go to Gaia Entertainment

170
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
to see Director Liang Wanting today?

171
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
No

172
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
sister,

173
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
you went to see Liang Wanting.

174
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040
Haven't you seen that

175
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Uncle Xu

176
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
still has feelings for Director Liang?

177
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
Besides,

178
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,040
you only came to Xu after Uncle Xu divorced Director Liang.

179
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040


180
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Why is my family so hostile to Director Liang

181
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
?

182
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
It's because

183
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
she abandoned Uncle Xu and Sister Xu Zhen

184
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
to fulfill her dream of being a director.

185
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,040
I just want our family to be reunited.

186
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Now it seems that

187
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
this idea is difficult to realize. Don't be

188
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
discouraged.

189
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,040
I just got inside information about the

190
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
new movie

191
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
"City of Time" directed by Liang Wanting. It

192
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
will be formed soon and is

193
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
recruiting a large number of staff. Is this

194
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
your chance?

195
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Really?

196
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,040
But I don't know anything about

197
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,040
film work. It doesn't

198
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,040
matter.

199
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
You don't still have me.  What? I know all about the hobbies of every interviewer

200
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
from the assistant director to the production director. Please be

201
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040


202
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040


203
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,040
gentle.

204
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Dad,

205
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040


206
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,040
must I insist on

207
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
bringing you to the company in this way?

208
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
My Lin Zhaohe’s youngest son

209
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
has the bodyguards chasing him all the way.  The Gaia Entertainment points on the street are too much

210
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,040


211
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
for you to lose.

212
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
Dad,

213
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I don’t want to travel

214
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
all the way back from the UK across the Eurasian continent to be

215
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
lost to Gaia.

216
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I told you a long time ago that

217
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
I have no interest in running the company.  If you don't

218
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
have

219
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
such a hard and tiring job, why don't you leave it to

220
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,040
me, a brother who has

221
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
no personal pursuit of

222
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,040
ideals and doesn't do anything?

223
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,040
This is a matter between you and dad,

224
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,039
so don't drag me into it.

225
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,039
I think you can't stop playing.  I'm sorry,

226
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,039
you can only say these things.

227
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,039
From tomorrow, go

228
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,039
back to work at Gaia Entertainment.

229
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,039
Dad,

230
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,039
don't force me to

231
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,039
say Chinese. I'm

232
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,040
so powerful. I wo

233
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
n't say anything

234
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
else. I won't say more.

235
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
From now on,

236
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
all credit cards will be stopped.

237
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040


238
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Think about things yourself.

239
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Dad,

240
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
you won't be so cruel.

241
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Brother, look at my dad.

242
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040


243
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
You know the character of Little Bear's dad. He won't take it easy when

244
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
he decides to come.

245
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040


246
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
You should be obedient and

247
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,040
go to work tomorrow.

248
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040


249
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Brother, dad will take care of you tomorrow.  I've taken my money and

250
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
I don't know if I'll be able to survive today. Is that

251
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
enough? Just

252
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
a few

253
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,040
pieces of money. It's not enough to make me good.

254
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,320
It's not enough to make me good. It's

255
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,760
enough.

256
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,880
Black card.

257
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,280
I can consider it.

258
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,320
Xiaoxiu,

259
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
when will you grow up?

260
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,760
Brother,

261
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,720
I know you have given a lot to Gaia.

262
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,240
You are the most qualified to inherit the company. And

263
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,160
people like me

264
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,880
should travel around the world to

265
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,040
pursue my life dreams.

266
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,680
Okay.  Go back and play,

267
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,480
bye. I thought you

268
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:26,800
could get it with a broken iron door.

269
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,560
Sit down.

270
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:36,720
Not bad. You

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,080
can go early on your first day at work and not be late.

272
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,320
Since you have the ambition to be a superior,

273
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,080
I will make an exception and send you

274
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
to the car.

275
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,680
You sit down first.

276
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,040
I'll sit down first,

277
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,320
you sit down first,

278
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,640
I'll sit down first,

279
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
you sit down first,

280
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,160
I'll sit down first,

281
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,960
you sit down first, and get in the car.

282
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:08,400
I'm going to arrange for you to be an intern in the Propaganda Department

283
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,840
first. When you first arrive at the department,

284
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,600
don't expose your identity.

285
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,200
Dad, do

286
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,600
n't put it in the car.  I cheated and came back from abroad.

287
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,080
Now you don’t have to worry about what I exposed. The main thing

288
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,040
is that I don’t want other colleagues to

289
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,720
take extra care of you. I

290
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,440
don’t want to go back to

291
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
Gaia Entertainment. Do

292
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
you still want it? Isn’t there

293
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,920
still my brother?

294
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
We can talk about this later.

295
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,080
I heard that Gu Chijun has changed his mind.

296
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
He is still the leading actor in City of Time.

297
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,680
Stop talking.

298
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
I said it.

299
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
I said

300
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,680
it. I said it. I said it. I said it.

301
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680


302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680


303
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680


304
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680


305
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680


306
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680


307
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
I said it. I said it. I said it.

308
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
I said it.

309
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
I said it,

310
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
I said it, I

311
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
said it, I said it, I said it, I said it, I said it, I said it, I said it, I said it, I said it, I

312
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680


313
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680


314
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680


315
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,680


316
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,680


317
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680


318
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680


319
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680


320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680


321
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,680
said it, I thought

322
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680


323
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,760
I was the only one who knew the news

324
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,280
With so many love rivals here,

325
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,360


326
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,440
even if I am just a

327
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,360
little assistant serving tea and water, I will be satisfied

328
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,680
as long as I can be close to Nanshui.

329
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120


330
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,800
Can you tell me

331
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,560
what this is, the

332
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,840


333
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,760
napkin you used to wipe your mouth after eating twenty-two hours ago

334
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,280
?

335
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,840


336
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,880
The hair you left after styling fourteen hours ago,

337
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,680


338
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,800
the lipstick you used three hours ago, and the banana beauty you ate

339
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,840
two hours ago.

340
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,080


341
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:57,880


342
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,120
Thank you very much for being

343
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
so fond of

344
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,240
our Shijun

345
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,160
and supporting our Shijun so much.  Jun,

346
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,720
but

347
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,800
as a fan,

348
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,880
you pretended to be an ordinary person to apply for an assistant.

349
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,440
This has seriously affected

350
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,360
Mr. Gu's normal work and life. But

351
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,000


352
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,960
I am the only one who understands Chijun best.

353
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,680
I really have the

354
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,080
same likes and preferences as him.

355
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,160
When he drinks water, his

356
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,560
hand temperature can exceed

357
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,680
When taking pictures outside at 35 degrees,

358
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,240
be sure to measure the UV index.

359
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,360
When taking pictures, the

360
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,720
left side of his face looks best.

361
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,920
The quality of his clothes

362
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
must not affect

363
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,320
Gu Chijun's perfect skin. He

364
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,160
really understands me.

365
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,440
Strictly speaking,

366
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,560
you are better than this agent.  People are more dedicated,

367
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,920
but

368
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,400
I believe you should leave such a precious feeling to the people around you. A

369
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,520
big star with the same appearance is farther away

370
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,680
than a world apart. The people who

371
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,920
care about you the most

372
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,400
are always the people around you, what

373
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,360
this beauty

374
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,080
does to you.

375
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
I am very, very grateful for what I have done,

376
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,520
and I hope you

377
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,440
can continue to support our Jia Chijun in the future.

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
As a fan,

379
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,480
you can continue to support

380
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,680
our Jia Chijun’s works.

381
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,560
But I’m

382
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,840
really sorry.

383
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,640


384
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,840
Could you please give me the

385
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,880
cup from which he drank water?

386
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,920
Oh,

387
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:22,320
don’t bother me.

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,280
Today, this person is

389
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,320
already the

390
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,280
fifth boss you

391
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,880
fired. Shi Jun, it’s not

392
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,040
even twenty-four hours since joining the company. That’s

393
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,200
because you were negligent in your work and

394
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
didn’t find a

395
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
suitable assistant for me. Maybe if

396
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,720
you had fewer

397
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,120
strange requests,  I

398
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,200
hope

399
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,680
you think, did

400
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,800
n't I tell you before, right? The

401
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800


402
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
most important thing in life is

403
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,640
to be principled.

404
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,920
I understand, right.

405
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,560


406
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,640


407
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,360
Did you see the video of me being rejected by the death penalty on the Internet today? The

408
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,440
title is similar to the rejection of the

409
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,000
international superstar Gu Chijun.

410
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,440


411
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,400
Or maybe the superstar Gu Chijun

412
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,920
was rejected and looked ugly,

413
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,720
or maybe the

414
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,760
superstar Gu Chijun was

415
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,440
dumped. It doesn't

416
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:24,360


417
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,920


418
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000


419
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,160
matter. Just tell me

420
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,200
what happened. I can accept it. It's okay. What did you say?

421
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Boss Gu,

422
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,440
that's too concise,

423
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,280
right?  It’s possible to mention that it’s possible,

424
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,000
but don’t worry, you’re

425
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,040


426
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,680
not careful. Is it

427
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,720
true that

428
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,520
you didn’t search for the right keywords? Why don’t

429
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,320
you try again?

430
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,720
China’s most handsome male star, the

431
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,880
perfect man, Gu Chijun,

432
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,840
Big Boss Gu,

433
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,000


434
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,840
I couldn’t find everything I should have searched for.  I'm

435
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,880
sorry to tell you that there is still

436
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,240
no news.

437
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,120
Shouldn't it be?

438
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,360


439
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,720
Didn't that lady upload the video?

440
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,600
Why do I feel that

441
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,560
things will not go so smoothly?

442
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,280
Why don't you try again?

443
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
Boss Gu, Boss Gu, Boss,

444
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,120
I suddenly remembered it

445
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,000
today.  There are several assistants who need to be interviewed,

446
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,280
yes,

447
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,400
yes, there are assistants who need to be interviewed. So,

448
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,280
boss Gu, please stay here for

449
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,920


450
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
a while.

451
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
I'll go change jobs first,

452
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:46,000
okay? What's so great about it?

453
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,040
If it weren't for Gu Chijun,

454
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
I wouldn't have come to this crappy crew of yours.

455
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,040
Who's next?

456
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,920


457
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:10,760
My name is Xu Zhen. I am a

458
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,280
senior student at a university in this city.

459
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,640
My major is paleontology. I

460
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,240
am honored to come here for an interview today.

461
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,320
Paleontology. Do

462
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,240
you have any experience in paleontology before?

463
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,560
No.

464
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,000
Your future development goal

465
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
is the film and television industry,

466
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,480
not

467
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,200
me.  I still like my profession. I'm a

468
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,680
fan of Gu Chijun.

469
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm sorry. What

470
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,160
we need are experienced professionals.

471
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,680
Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in a movie. I don't want

472
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,880
you to chase stars.

473
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,880
I don't know anyone named Gu Chijun.

474
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
I'm not a star chaser.

475
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I'm actually a fan.  I am a fan of Wanting Liang and

476
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,120
I have watched every one of her works.

477
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,840


478
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,720
Director Liang is a very important person to me,

479
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,600
so

480
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
I want to join the cast of "City of Time".

481
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,720
I hope I can have the opportunity to meet him.

482
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,960


483
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960


484
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,560
Come and

485
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,080


486
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,960
thank you for

487
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,320
your strength.  Not bad. How do you

488
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,040
practice?

489
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,680
When I was doing paleontological research, I

490
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,800
often

491
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
ran up and down mountains and ridges. I got used to it.

492
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,160
It’s a pity.

493
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
We still hope

494
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
to recruit some

495
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
professional personnel.

496
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:06,680
Sister,

497
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,840
we are back,

498
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,840
come, come, come,

499
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,520
come, come.

500
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,800
Come and see me,

501
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,440
come and see me. It

502
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,440
seems to be

503
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,840
Gu Chijun's dressing room. It doesn't

504
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,600
matter if you fail.

505
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,680
As long as I can see Gu Zhijun,

506
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
I will be satisfied. Your name is

507
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,080
Xu Zhen.

508
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,120
Chijun is in that room.

509
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,080
Don't you want to go and have a look?  It

510
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,480


511
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,040


512
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,600
’s Gu Chijun’s name. My

513
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,680
ears have already grown calluses.

514
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,840
Why should I go see him? He has

515
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
great work ability and

516
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,480
can overcome any harsh environment. The

517
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,600
most important thing is that

518
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,760
you really don’t know

519
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,680
who Gu Chijun is. Do

520
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,080
I need to know?

521
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
You have been admitted.

522
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,840
Congratulations!  Gu Chijun's new director,

523
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,440
what are you talking about?

524
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,480
You are a new colleague,

525
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,600


526
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600


527
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,440
right, right. I told everyone to just call me Xiaoxiu from now on. I

528
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
hope you will take care of

529
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,040
Xiaoxiu in the future.

530
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,640
I said, Xiaoxiu,

531
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,240
your tenure is good enough.

532
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,800
This is what you are like when you first join the company.

533
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,280


534
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,560
I don’t even want you to do it.

535
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,680
I said what you do.

536
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I said what you did. I

537
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,840


538
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,920
said what you did. I

539
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,840


540
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,920


541
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,000
said what did you do. I

542
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,080
said what you did. I

543
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,240
said what you did. I said what you did.

544
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,720


545
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,720
It’s the budget table of the movie budget.

546
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,120
Hurry up and deal with it.

547
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,960
Also, you want Gaia Entertainment

548
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,520
to let Director Lin

549
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,880
see through your value.

550
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,200
Come on,

551
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,520
little bear. Please help me organize the

552
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,200


553
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,360
on-site information and materials at this press conference.

554
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,760


555
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,280
No problem.

556
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,160
Young people

557
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,760
should cherish it.  We should be grateful for the opportunity to learn.

558
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,280


559
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,680
Society is

560
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,280
just a big classroom.

561
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,480


562
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,600
Why are you so good?

563
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,880
I said, why are you so

564
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880


565
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,080


566
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,400
good? Why are you so

567
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400


568
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,680
good? Why are you

569
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,760


570
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,880
so good?  Why are you

571
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880


572
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
so good? Why are you

573
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,080


574
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
so good? Why are you

575
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,080


576
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
so good? Why are you so

577
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080


578
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
good? Why are you so

579
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080


580
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
good? How are you

581
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,080


582
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080


583
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080


584
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
so good?  Why is

585
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
this boy

586
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
so good? Why is

587
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
so good?  Why are you

799
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080


800
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
so good? Why are you

801
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080


802
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
so good? Why are you

803
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080


804
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080


805
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080


806
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
so good?

807
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,080
You said that he has fired five assistants in the past five days.

808
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080


809
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,080
This is not an easy matter to handle.

810
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Can you handle it?  Well, it depends

811
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
on whose face it is.

812
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
My brother will be fine once he takes action. There's

813
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
no point in

814
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
flattering

815
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080


816
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,080
me now. You have to help me.

817
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Otherwise,

818
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
I can only travel around with your black card

819
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080


820
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
and make you scared. Where are

821
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,080
you going?  Where

822
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
else can you go? Mr. Lin Jianyang, the

823
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
general manager of Gaia Entertainment,

824
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080


825
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
will personally go out and

826
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
find Gu Chijun's agent

827
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
to help you handle this matter.

828
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Brother,

829
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,080
you are really my best brother.

830
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,080
By the way, look at

831
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
how to run the Chuan Gang in the publicity department.  Braised

832
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080


833
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080


834
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
pork with pickled vegetables instead of green

835
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
onions, preserved eggs instead of preserved eggs, and what do you think

836
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
of the

837
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Shanghai pan-fried

838
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
buns and crispy stewed sticks?

839
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080


840
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
You boy,

841
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
your boy,

842
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:16,080
why did he show up in

843
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,080
my lounge again?

844
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
This was arranged by Mr. Lin, Lin Jianyang,

845
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
personally.

846
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm not.  Have you fired him?

847
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Mr. Lin specifically said that

848
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
I hope you can give Xu Zhen a

849
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
chance

850
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
to cultivate a working mother.

851
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,080
You are really like a candy and you can’t

852
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
get rid of

853
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,080
Mr. Gu.

854
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,880
I just want to

855
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
do a job with peace of mind.

856
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,960
I hope you will do the same in the future.  Put away your

857
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,720
prejudice against me,

858
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,280
not to mention

859
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,280
it was just a misunderstanding.

860
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,960
When Shiyu showed me

861
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,400
Gaia Entertainment’s contract,

862
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,040


863
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,800
I didn’t believe that

864
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,720
I couldn’t even make the decision as an assistant.

865
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,600
This is what this is. What about

866
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,840


867
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,160


868
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,120
Gaia during the City of Time project?  Entertainment

869
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,760
does have the right to arrange

870
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,920
its own staff.

871
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,560
How could I sign such a clause?

872
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,840
It was you who personally bullied and

873
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,520
ignored all the consequences.

874
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,280
Besides,

875
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,080
you can't

876
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,240


877
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,520
drive away the assistants arranged by Mr. Li personally with a tough attitude for no reason.  Well,

878
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,480
then I went with him for a reason.

879
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,600
You two are so close.

880
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,280
Do you need me to avoid

881
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,560
Miss Xu?

882
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,920
Since you want to be my assistant so much,

883
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,960
Chi Jun

884
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,520
arranged for him to go to work tomorrow,

885
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,400


886
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,480
Shi Yu. Are you kidding me?  I

887
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,960


888
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,760
have no experience and have not received any training. Will it be too difficult for him to let

889
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,400
him go to work tomorrow

890
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,640
?

891
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,880
Ms. Xu Zhen is full of confidence and

892
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,320
believes that this challenge will not be difficult for her at all.

893
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,040


894
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,600
I hope that the

895
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,640
new record of my assistant will not be updated.

896
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,080
Mr. Gu,

897
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,160
please  Don't worry,

898
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,800
even if I want to set a new record, I have to

899
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,400
win

900
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,640
the title of Gu Chijun's longest-serving assistant.

901
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,880
Don't let me find any mistakes

902
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,640
or I'll leave immediately.

903
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,640


904
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,080
I won't give you this chance. I won't give you this chance.

905
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,080
You, you,

906
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,080


907
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080


908
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,080
you.

909
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
You,

910
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080


911
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
you,

912
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,080
you, you, you, you,

913
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080


914
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080


915
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080


916
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080


917
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,080


918
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080


919
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080


920
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
your

921
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,360
sister, it’s your

922
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,280
first day at work, come on, come on, come on,

923
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,760


924
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,680
slow down,

925
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,200
bye,

926
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:51,800
bye,

927
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:59,840
master,

928
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,040


929
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,080
why did you stop the car before we arrived?

930
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,120
Mr. Lin said that

931
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,960
the driver at home

932
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,320
will no longer take you to and from work.  After that,

933
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,760


934
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,040
please take a bus to Gaia by yourself.

935
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,840
Xiaoxiu,

936
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,040
why is it you?

937
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,960
Your driver

938
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,200
didn’t drive you to work?

939
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,320
It’s not my dad.

940
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,280
He

941
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,360
won’t let me ride in the car. I won’t let you ride in the car.

942
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,480
I won’t let you ride in the car.  I

943
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
won’t let you ride in the car. I wo

944
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
n’t let you ride in the car. I

945
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480


946
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
won’t let you ride in the car. I

947
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480


948
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480


949
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
won’t let you ride in the car. I won’t let you ride in the car. I won’t let you ride in the car.

950
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
I won’t let you ride in the car.

951
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480


952
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
I won't let you ride in the car, I

953
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
won't let you ride in the car, I

954
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
won't let you ride in the car, I

955
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
won't let you ride in the car, I won't let you ride in the car, I

956
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
won't let you ride in the car,

957
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
I won't let you ride in the car

958
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,080


959
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,880


960
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080


961
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,240
I'm not my dad who drives you to work.

962
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,280
He won't let me take the car and has to

963
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,640
take the bus to work.

964
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
That's really embarrassing for you. Isn't it true that

965
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,640
you, the spoiled rich second generation, have

966
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,680
discovered a new world?

967
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,880
Yes, every time after riding the bus

968
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,520
I feel like I have a new

969
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,040
hair style, I'm sweating profusely,

970
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,600
etc.

971
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,440
Thank you, Xiaozhi.

972
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,200
Look, I'll

973
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,840
give you another one. It

974
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,360
seems really unacceptable.

975
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200


976
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,560


977
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,480


978
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,960
My younger brother, Lin Jinxiu,

979
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:17,040
no matter whether he is the eldest son

980
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,880
or the second son in the exam,

981
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,880
I will find an opportunity to expel him.

982
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,400
Let’s go.

983
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,160
You,

984
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,200
you, you,

985
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,120


986
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,040


987
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,680
you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

988
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,320


989
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320


990
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,400


991
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,960


992
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,880


993
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,720


994
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,520


995
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,240


996
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960


997
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,760


998
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,560


999
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,440


1000
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,200


1001
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,880


1002
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,640


1003
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,320


1004
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,120


1005
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,880


1006
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,720


1007
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,520


1008
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,240


1009
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,920


1010
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,600


1011
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,320


1012
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,040


1013
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,760


1014
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,400


1015
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,080


1016
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,760


1017
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,400


1018
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,080


1019
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,760


1020
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,520


1021
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,200


1022
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:55,840


1023
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,560


1024
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,240


1025
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,920


1026
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,560


1027
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,240


1028
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,160


1029
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,480


1030
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,560


1031
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,720


1032
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,320
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,

1033
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,920


1034
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,320


1035
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,040


1036
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,880


1037
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,680


1038
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,360


1039
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,320


1040
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,240


1041
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240


1042
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,240
thank

1043
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
you, what are you talking about? Five million, Wang Zhiping, I think we should not waste each other's time.

1044
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
You,

1045
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
you, you, you, you, you, you, you, your, your, your, your, your

1046
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240


1047
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240


1048
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240


1049
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240


1050
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240


1051
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240


1052
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240


1053
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240


1054
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240


1055
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240


1056
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240


1057
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240


1058
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240


1059
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240


1060
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240


1061
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240


1062
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240


1063
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,640
clothes this time are a bit low, and

1064
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,360
then, then,

1065
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,320


1066
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,960
I think this scene

1067
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,640
and my mood tell me that

1068
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,080
you will be more suitable, grandma,

1069
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,480
so

1070
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,400


1071
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,280
I believe it.  Assistant Xu Zhen

1072
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,240
should be able to do better things for us,

1073
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240


1074
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,200
so with

1075
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,040
our cooperation,

1076
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,240
I believe Assistant Xu Zhen

1077
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
should be able to complete this task.

1078
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,520
Shi Jun is like this.

1079
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
Grandma, it is

1080
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,000
indeed far away from here,

1081
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
and

1082
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,840
you will be there in another hour.  We're going to shoot a magazine cover.

1083
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,560
If Xu Zhen goes, I'm afraid I won't be

1084
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,440
able to make it in time.

1085
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,720
No, it

1086
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,640
won't take an hour and

1087
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,480
forty minutes. I

1088
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,000


1089
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:34,680
'm sorry, I'm sorry, please walk away.

1090
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,520


1091
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,320


1092
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,120


1093
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Don't run

1094
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
away. Come on.

1095
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120


1096
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120


1097
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Thirty-eight minutes, thirty-

1098
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
eight minutes, thirty

1099
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
-eight minutes,

1100
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
three.  Eighteen minutes, thirty-

1101
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,120
eight minutes,

1102
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,120
thirty-eight minutes,

1103
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
thirty-

1104
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
eight minutes, thirty-

1105
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
eight minutes, thirty-eight minutes, thirty-eight minutes, thirty-eight minutes, thirty-eight minutes, thirty-eight minutes, thirty-eight

1106
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120


1107
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,120


1108
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120


1109
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
minutes, thirty-

1110
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
eight minutes, thirty-eight

1111
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
minutes

1112
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,080
Minutes,

1113
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,800
I only used thirty-eight minutes.

1114
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Thirty-eight minutes.

1115
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,960
How could Gu Shijun

1116
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:38,000


1117
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,880
be like this?

1118
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,800
Chijun said that

1119
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,600
her temperament will change according to her mood.

1120
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,960
She is now

1121
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,280
like the clothes she said are

1122
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,560
relatively low.

1123
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,000
It's bigger,

1124
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,480
ah,

1125
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,640


1126
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,920
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

1127
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,120


1128
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:12,159
good-looking,

1129
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,159


1130
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,759
good-looking,

1131
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
I love you,

1132
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,960


1133
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,960
I love you, I

1134
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love

1135
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960


1136
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960


1137
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
you, I

1138
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
love you, I

1139
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
love you, I

1140
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
love you, I

1141
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
love you,

1142
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
I love you.

1143
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
I love you,

1144
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
I love you, I

1145
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,159
love you, I love you, I love you,

1146
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,079
this is our little Zao,

1147
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,280
my close family member, Xiaojun, who was born not long ago.

1148
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,840
I want to give it to you.

1149
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,159
Thank you, aunt,

1150
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,559
for coming and holding it

1151
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,760
for

1152
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:08,360
everyone who has worked hard.

1153
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,560
Thank you, thank you,

1154
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:34,120
sister. Is

1155
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,440


1156
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,880


1157
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,840
it worth enduring so much for Liang Wanting

1158
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,240
?

1159
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,800
Sister,

1160
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,120
you also know that

1161
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,480
my parents were colleagues of Uncle Xu.

1162
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,480
When I was ten years old, I

1163
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,720
died unexpectedly while surveying fossils.

1164
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,040
Uncle Xu has taken me home for more than

1165
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,920
ten years.

1166
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,960
Our family of three is living well.

1167
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,440
Why do we have to let Uncle Xu and Liang Wanting meet?

1168
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,560
Even if Uncle Xu still has an old crush on Liang Wantian, does

1169
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,800
Liang Wanting still have feelings for Uncle Xu? Then

1170
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,880


1171
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:17,480
I have to let them

1172
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,400
see you again,

1173
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,960


1174
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,760


1175
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,640
how will you respond?  What's

1176
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,520
going on with you? What's going on with you? What's going on with you? What's going on with you? What's going on

1177
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,320


1178
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,080


1179
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,880


1180
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,760


1181
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,560
with you?

1182
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,760
Come to the company now. It's

1183
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,680


1184
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,160
so late now.

1185
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,360
The master has already got off work.

1186
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,680
You have to know that there are

1187
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,120
no celebrity assistants at all.  Eight hours of work,

1188
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,000
I think you'd better come back right away before you continue to get angry. Why are you

1189
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000


1190
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,720


1191
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:55,120
back? Why are you

1192
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
back? Why are you back? Why are you back? Why are you

1193
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,120


1194
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,120


1195
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120


1196
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
back? Why are you back? Why are you

1197
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120


1198
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
back?

1199
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Why are you back?

1200
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,640
Gu Chijun, I hate you.

1201
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:19,600
Mr. Gu

1202
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,720
called me to the company in the middle of the night. What

1203
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,600
arrangements are there for

1204
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,160
him to be taken care of by you in the future

1205
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,800
? Yes, there is no way. Chijun has an inexplicable fear

1206
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,160
of children and pets. The

1207
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,920


1208
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,320
behavior of children and pets is

1209
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,480
unpredictable.  If you can't

1210
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,160
predict, you have no principles.

1211
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,480
I don't like things without principles.

1212
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,080
I don't like you and you still accept the kindness of my aunt.

1213
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,400
As a star,

1214
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,040
accepting the love of fans is always the first priority.

1215
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,640
Maintaining my image in front of fans is

1216
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,320
also an expression of my professionalism,

1217
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,720
so

1218
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,080
how can I refuse the fan aunt?  Your love for me?

1219
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,840
Maintaining my perfection

1220
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,320
is also part of your assistant's job. You

1221
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
are really two faces inside and outside the camera.

1222
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,920


1223
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,320
Sister Xiao Junjun is here to take care of you.

1224
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,080
By the way,

1225
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,920
remember to draw a name for her.

1226
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,600
What do you call her?

1227
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,040
Xiao Gu

1228
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,320
Gu Xiao Chi Chi

1229
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,920
Xiao Gu  Gu Xiaochichi Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Xiaogu Gu Forget it, just

1230
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,080


1231
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,280


1232
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,400


1233
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,280


1234
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280


1235
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,120


1236
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,000


1237
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,720


1238
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,600


1239
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,400


1240
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,120


1241
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920


1242
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,800


1243
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,400


1244
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,360
call it Xiao Junjun, Xu

1245
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,240
Zhen  Ah, I will send you

1246
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:38,760
here, and

1247
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:42,440
my sister will take care of you. If you want to poop, you should still ask

1248
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,640


1249
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,720
Xu Zhen to wait for me.

1250
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,120
Xu Zhen

1251
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:55,080
doesn't let anyone rest in the middle of the night. It's a bit too much, right

1252
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,600


1253
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,120
? She said she could be promoted to an assistant's job and

1254
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,200
she chose it herself.  I'm

1255
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,680
crying and have to finish the journey. You

1256
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,280
said it so grandly.

1257
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,000
Isn't it because you were rejected by the parent-child minister

1258
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,840
and he saw it and

1259
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,320
feared personal revenge?

1260
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,160
Am I such a stingy person?

1261
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,680
Besides, I haven't

1262
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,560
been rejected at all.

1263
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,120
Women are duplicitous and

1264
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,360
refuse to accept

1265
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,640
her.  Saying no

1266
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,480
means that the more opportunities I have, I feel so inexplicably

1267
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,280
confident. How can I

1268
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,680
eat?

1269
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,960
Little Junjun,

1270
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,960
come and eat. Open your

1271
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,960
mouth.

1272
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,280


1273
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,160
You’re so good, little Junjun. It

1274
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,240
’s already very late.

1275
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,560
After taking care of Xiaojunjun,

1276
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,640
you can get off work. I

1277
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,680
finally finished

1278
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,560
my work today.  The first day was more

1279
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,520
tiring than the Hengchuan Amazon Jungle. Xu Zhen

1280
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,720


1281
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,960


1282
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,360
is actually not a bad person.

1283
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,680
He is actually

1284
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,200
very, very kind at heart. It’s just that

1285
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,600
he has been

1286
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,720
too successful since childhood,

1287
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,720
so he is a bit

1288
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,000
willful.

1289
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,840
I don’t know if

1290
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,960
I

1291
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,520
can still be like this.  No matter how long

1292
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,600
I persist, I will know that

1293
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,480
I am

1294
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
now a very,

1295
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,760
very kind person.

1296
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,600
I know that

1297
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
I am now a very,

1298
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,960
very kind person.

1299
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,400
Xu Zhen,

1300
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,440
I heard you said during the interview that

1301
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,720
you were a fan of Director Liang. In the

1302
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,720
next few days,

1303
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,480
Shi Jun and Liang  The director

1304
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,680
has a script discussion meeting,

1305
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,960
but Director Liang

1306
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
is very strict and

1307
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,360
only allows Chi Jun

1308
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,560
and one assistant to participate.

1309
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,960
I personally am very

1310
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,440
willing to transfer this opportunity

1311
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
to you.

1312
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,640
If you can persist until that day,

1313
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,560
I believe

1314
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,560
you will definitely meet your idol.

1315
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,600
You said  Is it true?

1316
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,360
Of course, Sister

1317
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,120
Xiao Junjun is

1318
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,320
finally coming to an end. Sister is

1319
00:40:50,320 --> 00:41:03,160
serving dinner. What is that

1320
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,920


1321
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,800
red thing on your neck? That

1322
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,680


1323
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,280
red thing on your

1324
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:18,720
neck. My, my, my, my, my neck is red.

1325
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,840
I don’t think you know

1326
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,880
you.  I know you. I do

1327
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,840
n’t know you. I don’t know you. I don’t know you. I don’t know you. I don’t know you. I don’t know you.  I

1328
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,880


1329
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,920


1330
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,120


1331
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,360


1332
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360


1333
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360


1334
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360


1335
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360


1336
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360


1337
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360


1338
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,760


1339
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,640


1340
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,120
haven't had time to get the vaccine.

1341
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,200
Sister,

1342
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,160
from now on, don't take care of little Junjun.

1343
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,040
If

1344
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,960
you want to see my mother, you

1345
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,120
have to pass the Gu Chijun test.

1346
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:58,480
Wait, I'll

1347
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,120
hurry up.
