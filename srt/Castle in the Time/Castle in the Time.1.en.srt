1
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,130
(Castle in the time)

2
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,500
(Part 1)

3
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,310
This is Shijun.

4
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,080
Won't you try thinking again?

5
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,460
City of Time is a big project.

6
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,200
Director Liang Wan Ting came to direct it himself.

7
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,900
Plus a script written especially for you.

8
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,300
Vice President of Gaia Lin Jinyang personally called.

9
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,010
This

10
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,800
He's this sincere.

11
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,000
First point

12
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,510
I've never acted in a small film before.

13
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,910
Number two

14
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,210
I only work with world-class directors.

15
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,390
Third point

16
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,700
Movies that claim to have been written especially for me

17
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,400
There's never been a movie like that.

18
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:34,700
I'm enough.

19
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,300
Shijun

20
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,200
If you don't accept this play

21
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,410
You may regret it later.

22
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,210
They are the ones who will regret it.

23
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,400
But definitely not this time.

24
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,300
How much did Gaia hire you for?

25
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,300
You yourself know

26
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,300
I'm never late.

27
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,230
Gu Shijun Gu Shijun

28
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,900
Brother, this way.

29
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,300
Gu Shijun

30
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,700
This way.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,310
- This way, sir. - Gu Shijun

32
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,240
Gu Shijun, bro.

33
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,090
Mr. Gu Shijun.

34
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,880
In Hollywood (Gu Shijun press conference)

35
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,000
 <b>You are doing very well.</b>  <b>(Returning to perform in China)</b>

36
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,270
<b>many movies</b>  <b>Those who participated also received awards.</b>

37
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,000
is a rising star of the Chinese entertainment industry

38
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,000
But suddenly

39
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,500
Decided to return to my hometown

40
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,800
What is the reason?

41
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,800
Chinese film market

42
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,000
It is a market with high potential.

43
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,700
As a Chinese person

44
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,600
I will gladly return to my native land.

45
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,600
and want to play a part in development

46
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,600
Let this industry progress

47
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,700
 <b>I heard that Liang Wan Ting</b>  <b>From Gaia Film An Television</b>

48
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,100
<b>Prepare a masterpiece</b>  <b>Like a city that has been around for a long time</b>

49
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,610
 <b>And it is said that he condescends to you.</b>  <b>He is also the lead actor.</b>

50
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,800
I don't know what your opinion is.

51
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you for your attention.

52
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,400
Director Liang Wan Ting

53
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,500
He is someone I have always respected.

54
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,000
 <b>But the city of time</b>  <b>(Shiguangzicheng)</b>

55
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,700
Not yet

56
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,600
It doesn't match my needs.

57
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm still looking forward to it.

58
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,000
This is a more difficult chapter.

59
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,700
To challenge your abilities

60
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,900
What do you say?

61
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,000
So he refuses to act in movies?

62
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,900
Is it good to do this?

63
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,900
Did he really say that?

64
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,740
Really don't accept this?

65
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,900
What are you talking about? This is a press conference.

66
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,610
Big news now

67
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,600
 <b>means that you</b>  <b>Don't you want to accept this show?</b>

68
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,000
How is Gaia contacting you now?

69
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,200
Brothers and sisters, journalists.

70
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm afraid that you guys will misunderstand Mr. Loan.

71
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,700
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,700
 <b>For today's press conference</b>  <b>I'd like to end this first.</b>

73
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,900
Because Mr. Gu just returned to China.

74
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,000
All work matters are not yet finalized.

75
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,500
 <b>If there is more news</b>  <b>I will inform you immediately.</b>  <b>Reporter quickly.</b>

76
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

77
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,210
Thank you all. Thank you.

78
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,200
Have you read the script yet?

79
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,060
Do you have to read something like this?

80
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,400
This type of chapter

81
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,700
How many times have you played it?

82
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,610
Saying this, aren't you afraid that Gaia will find out?

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,500
I want it to reach their ears.

84
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,380
From now on, you won't have to bother me again.

85
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,200
So I can assure you.

86
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,600
that you will surely regret it

87
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,710
Dad

88
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,110
how

89
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,600
Xiao Zhen

90
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,400
How about it?

91
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,300
father's daughter

92
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,210
general women

93
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,600
Probably going to sit and drink tea in the city.

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
Otherwise, let's go shopping.

95
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,000
But the child returned

96
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,200
Follow your father to the mountains and the deserted cliffs.

97
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,450
You can dig up fossils.

98
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,660
Who is this?

99
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,300
 <b>I am the Tai Shan Bei Dou of the ancient world.</b>  <b>Professor Xu Zhengyao's son.</b>

100
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,320
I wonder if I was a dinosaur in my previous life.

101
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,450
When I saw these fossils, I really liked them.

102
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,690
If you find dinosaur fossils here

103
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,450
 <b>I will make you a person.</b>  <b>Name it.</b>

104
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,100
That's good.

105
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,900
The world will have a dinosaur that I named myself.

106
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,200
I'll keep trying.

107
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,240
Dad

108
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,460
So, can I go over there please?

109
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,400
That's good.

110
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,920
Be careful.

111
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,590
Take it slow.

112
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,000
Xiao Zhen

113
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,520
Dad

114
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,010
Dad, Dad.

115
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,510
- Father - Professor

116
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,700
- Professor - Father.

117
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:58,370
- Professor, Professor. - Father.

118
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,520
- Call a car quickly - Dad, please wake up.

119
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,700
Dad

120
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,200
Dad

121
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,290
Doctor, how is my father?

122
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,710
After a thorough physical examination

123
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,170
(Disease examination room)

124
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,100
Your father's condition

125
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,500
There was only a slight wound.

126
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,710
no need to worry

127
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,090
Today's accident

128
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,400
It didn't affect anything.

129
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,600
remit

130
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,300
And then my father

131
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,210
Why hasn't it recovered yet?

132
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,700
that your father is seriously ill

133
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,320
It's because of other reasons as well.

134
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,300
We have received the CT scan results.

135
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,300
Found something in his abdomen.

136
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,900
In this case

137
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,300
We have done additional inspections.

138
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,690
and suspect that it may be

139
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,110
stomach cancer

140
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,200
Stomach cancer?

141
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,000
It's impossible.

142
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,310
A few months ago my father

143
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,000
We always went on mining trips together.

144
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,010
Doctor

145
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,010
Did the doctor check incorrectly?

146
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,100
Of course

147
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,500
It is still an assumption.

148
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,900
If you want to know the exact results

149
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,200
Will need additional diagnostic testing.

150
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,800
family member

151
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,300
You should prepare yourself mentally.

152
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,210
Are there any other people in the family?

153
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,200
You should inform them immediately.

154
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,210
We will be able to prepare for treatment.

155
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,630
All the grandparents have passed away.

156
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,210
My mother and father are divorced.

157
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,700
Sow Thing

158
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,400
Wan Ting, don't go.

159
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't leave me and Xiao Zhen.

160
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,500
We are waiting for you.

161
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,500
Sow Thing

162
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,800
Father's son

163
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,290
Is something wrong?

164
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,600
The face doesn't look good at all.

165
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,670
And how is your father?

166
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,600
Dad, it's okay.

167
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,610
Don't move yet.

168
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,300
The doctor told me to get plenty of rest.

169
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,610
I already know.

170
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,670
Keep it if you go home.

171
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,680
I'll give you plenty of rest.

172
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,490
How can I go back?

173
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,900
The doctor told me to stay in the hospital for another 2-3 days.

174
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,200
Do you know what day it is today?

175
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,300
It's my child's birthday.

176
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,000
How can you celebrate your birthday at the hospital?

177
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,400
And another thing

178
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,800
Wei Shan and Qin Yan

179
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,700
Probably waiting for us at home.

180
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,400
Dad

181
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,090
I told you I couldn't go back.

182
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,040
 <b>The doctor said that Dad still had a few health problems.</b>  <b>Will have to wait for additional inspection.</b>

183
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,400
Oh, what will happen to Dad?

184
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,900
Most doctors are like this.

185
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,000
like to make things difficult

186
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:13,900
no

187
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,800
How can you say you can't leave?

188
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,900
Do you want it like this?

189
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,600
So today we go home.

190
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,000
If something happens

191
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,110
Come back soon.

192
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey, what if the child doesn't let his father come home?

193
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,700
What happens next?

194
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,100
Dad won't help anymore.

195
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,610
You can return it, but Father must keep his word.

196
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,200
Don't forget what you said to me today.

197
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,010
can

198
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,380
You can rest assured.

199
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,750
 <b>At first it was planned to start.</b>  <b>Interview at 2:30 p.m.</b>

200
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,200
But it's already been 15 minutes.

201
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,200
Still no one has come.

202
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,010
Normally there were other people waiting for us.

203
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,310
How can you let us wait?

204
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,600
Mr. Zhiqing

205
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,760
You said

206
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,400
Did something happen to them?

207
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,690
You've been with me for a long time.

208
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,200
Why are you worried?

209
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,500
The car might get stuck.

210
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,790
Please wait.

211
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,970
 <b>Please wait here first.</b>  <b>Mr. Qin asked for some time to prepare.</b>

212
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,600
Who are you?

213
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,510
So what do you want?

214
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,180
We are journalists.

215
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,990
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,410
Mr. Qin must be delayed like this because

217
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,310
I'm busy with important business.

218
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,800
so

219
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,210
Please wait a moment.

220
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,710
Let me introduce myself

221
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,610
I am Zhang Ziyu.

222
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,010
Here's my business card.

223
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,800
Zhang Ziyu

224
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:48,810
Mr. Gu just returned from abroad.

225
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,300
Haven't given an interview to any media yet.

226
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,410
If you had an exclusive interview with him

227
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,600
I think that no matter where the media is, they know.

228
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,200
That this is a rare opportunity

229
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:01,880
You

230
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,400
So I'll go out and have a look first.

231
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,710
whether they have arrived or not

232
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,400
Hello, you are…

233
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,970
Mr. Qin Zhiqing's assistant, right?

234
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,590
oh

235
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,410
Oh, is that so?

236
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,600
<b>I'm really sorry.</b>  <b>We have force majeure.</b>

237
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,070
Therefore, the interview location had to be changed temporarily.

238
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,840
Would you mind coming with us?

239
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:39,780
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,720
Because today we have a special interview.

241
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,120
So he allowed Mr. Ziqing to enter alone.

242
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,600
Could you please wait outside?

243
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,300
In what kind of interview do assistants not be present?

244
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,710
What are you thinking of doing?

245
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,100
Mr. Zhiqing

246
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,100
Otherwise

247
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,810
Wouldn't it be better not to go in?

248
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,870
Wait here, I'll come out.

249
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,910
He who has a beautiful face

250
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,400
He who has the perfect figure

251
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,810
His every look told a story.

252
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,300
The body communicates language in every movement.

253
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,300
He was Gu Shijun.

254
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,280
His performance was perfect.

255
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,600
It's hard to find someone to compare with.

256
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,910
 <b>until sweeping film festival awards</b>  <b>many important</b>

The story ends

264
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,200
You can start again.

265
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,930
Can you give me another chance?

266
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,940
Let us start again.

267
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,400
Zhiqing

268
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,600
This is my role from the latest movie.

269
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,800
But I want to say it to you

270
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,650
Like you said

271
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,500
I just don't know.

272
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,700
What should I do?

273
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,900
But now it's not the same.

274
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,970
Look.

275
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,900
This is the trophy I got.

276
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,400
Now, no one can act better than me.

277
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,690
and that you

278
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,190
Said I can't give you the life you want

279
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:29,700
now

280
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,510
Everything you want

281
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,980
I can give it to you

282
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,900
Three years ago you disappointed me.

283
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,190
Three years later

284
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,500
Even more disappointed than before.

285
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,970
It's like you don't understand.

286
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,980
Why did I break up with you in the first place?

287
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,300
Size 3 years old

288
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,400
You still don't know what I want

289
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,400
Don't think that other people are incompetent.

290
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,800
Everything you just said

291
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,290
All the money

292
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,400

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,200
reputation

294
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,690
I don't care at all.

295
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,400
because

296
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:08,910
I can create it myself

297
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,100
Gu Shijun, don't you still understand?

298
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,210
 <b>You guys only think about yourself.</b>  <b>Never thinking about other people's feelings</b>

299
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,510
I don't care how many awards you win.

300
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't care how famous you are.

301
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,900
I only ask that you don't show me your face again.

302
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,020
Then don't come near me.

303
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,030
Everyone, let's walk.

304
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,000
I told you that award shows are not a good idea.

305
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,300
Plus turn on your own VCR.

306
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,700
Finally, the girl said

307
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,050
I don't want to meet again.

308
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,200
Really embarrassing.

309
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,560
She said she doesn't want to meet again?

310
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,170
Actually, she said don't show your face again.

311
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,700
All right.

312
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,130
Don't think about suffering.

313
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,070
Next, please meet Mr. Qin Zhiqing.

314
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:14,080
Hello everyone, I'm actor Qin Zhiqing.

315
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,800
<b>This time it was a great honor to work with</b>  <b>Director Leung in City of Time</b>

Please contact Gaia.

320
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,200
I heard the city of time

321
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,080
Wait, wait, wait.

322
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,400
Why don't you accept playing?

323
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,600
Tomorrow at six o'clock

324
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,360
Pick me up at my apartment.

325
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,010
What time is it?

326
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Six o'clock in the morning

327
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,700
Waiting all night like this

328
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,600
What if they chose someone else?

329
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:45,900
this time

330
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,930
I must be close to Qin Zhiqing.

331
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,210
By playing this story

332
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,330
surprise

333
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,700
surprise

334
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,000
What the hell are you doing?

335
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,000
- I'm shocked. Do you know that I'm shocked? - Calm down. It hurts.

336
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,000
Is it the work of the two of you?

337
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,660
Aswi

338
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,700
Why did you first say you were going home yesterday?

339
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,000
Why have you just returned?

340
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,150
That's it, ah.

341
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,170
The two of us have been waiting all day.

342
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,160
- I'm so hungry that I fell asleep. - Let's go.

343
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,440
I know you eat all day.

344
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,400
Asvi just got back and you're already complaining.

345
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,800
Aren't you hungry?

346
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,700
Who is this who sleepwalks?

347
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,600
What is this braised pork ribs?

348
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,300
Who said that?

349
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,610
You

350
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:00,810
All right.

351
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,000
Stop arguing already.

352
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,250
What do you want to eat?

353
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,420
Tell me the menu.

354
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,300
Ah, we've prepared everything.

355
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,800
All that's left is to put it in the pan.

356
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:09,420
good

357
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,840
So I'll go take care of it for you.

358
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:13,900
Come on.

359
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,900
- Happy birthday. - Xu Zhen, happy birthday.

360
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,200
Woohoo!

361
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,460
Sit quickly, sit

362
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,100
Sit, Dad.

363
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,700
This movie was meticulously prepared for 3 years.

364
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,290

Brother Wei Chan

370
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,680
I think Aswi is strange.

371
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,240
When I heard the name Liang Wan Ting,

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,610
Have you ever noticed?

374
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,220
Looks like Asvi

375
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,800
I will never forget your mother.

376
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
At this time, Director Liang is still single.

377
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,050
She doesn't think.

378
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,600
Do you want them to reconcile?

379
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,600
It's better to live as a family.

380
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,500
(Results of endoscopy report)

381
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,270
(Stomach cancer test results)

382
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,600
Now the test results

383
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,430
It's come out.

384
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,500
your father

385
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,780
have stomach cancer

386
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,100
no way

387
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,900
It's impossible.

388
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,100
Doctor

389
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,290
Doctor, is there a way to help my father?

390
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,100
Surgery or something

391
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,760
Now science is very advanced.

392
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,300
Why isn't there a cure?

393
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:05,600
Doctor, please help my father.

394
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:08,010
There must be a way to cure Dad, right?

395
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,890
His symptoms are very severe.

396
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,000
Cancer cells have begun to spread.

397
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,310
Even though we decided to have surgery

398
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,400
It can't help anything.

399
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
Now for the patient

400
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,310
We can only support the symptoms.

401
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,410
You should make him happy.

402
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,000
If he still has any needs?

403
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,500
And if you can still do it, it's better to do it quickly.

Mom

408
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,960
Now father is seriously ill.

409
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,310
I want mom to come home.

(Jongxin Road 5)

413
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,200
Hey, little brother.

414
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,100
What are you doing? Run away.

415
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,710
Oh, I'm dead.

416
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,440
Oh, I got hit.

417
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,450
As you can see, we've found a very square person.

418
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,490
I made an appointment to sign a contract with Mr. Lin from Gaia.

419
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,450
This place is not far from there.

420
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll walk myself.

421
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,450
you know

422
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,100
That I'm never late

423
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:40,900
understand

424
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,810
Miss Xu

425
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,100
You can't go in.

426
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,150
Could you please contact me again?

427
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,030
I am the daughter of Director Liang Wanting.

428
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,410
 <b>I have something very important.</b>  <b>I must request to see you now. Please help me.</b>

429
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,560
Miss Xu

430
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,810
Director Liang didn't answer the phone.

431
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,200
No one will let you in.

432
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,790
Please go back first.

433
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,900
Please help.

434
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:20,400
You can get off work.

435
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,300
You, sir.

436
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,300
Who did you come to meet?

437
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,000
Who are you here to meet?

438
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,800
Don't you know me?

439
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,300
I don't know. I'm sorry.

440
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I Gu Shijun

441
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,900
my agent

442
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,800
I already made an appointment with Ms. Lin Jinyang.

443
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,800
Yes, just a moment.

444
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,210
You borrowed it.

445
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,610
Mr. Lin had a meeting with Director Liang on the 33rd floor.

446
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,400
Please go wait in the conference room for a moment.

447
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,690
Please come.

448
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,300
Team Jun's fan club?

449
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,210
Now we are only 10 centimeters apart.

450
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,040
But there was no reaction.

451
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,300
You probably aren't my fan.

452
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,900
Tell me.

453
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,610
Which entertainment media office are you at?

454
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,010
No matter what media agency it is.

455
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,400
Consider your news source good.

456
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
that I will work with Gaia

457
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,820
Don't tell me you've been stalking me all day.

458
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,800
Yes, I know I'm famous.

459
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,300
I am a superstar actor

460
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,220
But that's just my career.

461
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,500
I myself am an ordinary person.

462
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,210
that is not wanted

463
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,800
Let someone follow you.

464
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,800
Or was it secretly taken?

465
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,600
It doesn't feel right.

466
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,250
I said...

467
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,610
You're still young.

468
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,100
Why did you choose to make gossip news?

469
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm not going to find another job.

470
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,800
This line of work has no future.

471
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,900
And now I have something important to do.

472
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,250
Please stop following me.

473
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:10,260
If something happens

474
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,800
You can contact Zhang Ziyu, my assistant.

475
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,870
Are you foreign?

476
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
Oh no…

477
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,900
Ouch!

478
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,200
hello you

479
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,400
Do you know where Director Liang Wanting's room goes?

480
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,010
 <b>Director Liang is quite busy.</b>  <b>Probably don't have time to meet anyone.</b>

481
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,790
I don't know if you made an appointment or not.

482
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,410
I didn't make an appointment.

483
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,720
So what's your business?

484
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,400
It's a personal matter.

485
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,900
I have to talk to you face to face.

486
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,010
Didn't make an appointment.

487
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
So how can you come in?

488
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,300
I came with friends

489
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,300
I mean, I came with a friend.

490
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,000
 <b>So please go find him first.</b>  <b>I'm sorry to disturb you.</b>

491
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:25,400
hello

492
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,590
Security department

493
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,600
A stranger came up on the 33rd floor.

494
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,000
Please take care of it.

495
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,600
Arrived so quickly

496
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,210
As soon as I get the money, I'll take it.

497
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,910
I'm walking around.

498
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,750
Isn't he wrong?

499
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,900
Why did you give the money away?

500
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,210
Come on, unfollow now.

501
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,770
If I don't do this, will I be able to come quickly?

502
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:27,820
You borrowed it.

503
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,100
Vice President of Gaia

504
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,100
Miss Lin Jinyang

505
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:32,300
Hello Khun Ku

506
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:33,520
hello

507
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,110
You borrowed it.

508
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,820
I had no idea you'd come to Gaia yourself.

509
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,400
I just watched the news.

510
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,320
It looks like a timeless city story.

511
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,700
It won't be the job you hoped for.

512
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,610
Why did you suddenly change your intentions?

513
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:47,700
No.

514
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,710
I haven't changed my intentions.

515
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,700
I just

516
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,210
Just change your mind.

517
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,320
There are still many challenging roles.

518
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,010
that came in for me to choose

519
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,410
but

520
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,100
If I make the characters normal

521
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,700
Shine brighter

522
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,210
through my interpretation

523
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,010
I think this

524
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,600
It's very challenging for me.

525
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,310
Khun Kun's rhetoric is really outstanding.

526
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,710
No wonder I thought it wasn't challenging.

527
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,380
Now I have hope and confidence.

528
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,790
In the city of time, a lot has grown.

529
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:34,990
You borrowed it.

530
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,700
Director Liang is in a meeting.

531
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,600
She looks forward to seeing you.

532
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,400
One more thing

533
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,710
If you need anything

534
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,890
Let us know.

535
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,890
We are pleased.

536
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:45,810
nevermind

537
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,400
Ms. Lin is really thoughtful.

538
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,900
<b>In fact, we just returned to China.</b>  <b>Soon there were not enough people.</b>

539
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,100
Would you mind if I asked you to find someone to help you?

540
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,200
If you can, I will thank you very much.

541
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,900
Oh, that's easy.

542
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,900
I'll let the HR department take care of it for you.

543
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,710
Miss Lin

544
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,490
The contract is now complete.

545
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,200
I have another job.

546
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,000
If you need anything

547
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,410
You can tell Zhang Shiyu.

548
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,210
Oh, Miss Lin.

549
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,010
If it happens

550
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,470
What do you want next?

551
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,410
Please inform me.

552
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,110
yes

553
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,350
Oh, Mr. Swee.

554
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,700
Haven't gone back yet?

555
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,700
How can you come in again?

556
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,400
fast

557
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,400
Let me go.

558
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:50,950
Zhiqing

559
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,040
Listen to me first.

560
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,300
I have nothing to say to you.

561
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,550
Why?

562
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,380
Come here.

563
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,390
Here you…

564
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,060
What do you think you're doing? Just let me go.

565
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,960
People like Gu Shijun.

566
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,400
If you want it, you must get it.

567
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,400
Do you see what this is?

568
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,970
Introduction to the city of time

569
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,390
Watch it.

570
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,500
Whether you like it or not.

571
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,980
At least for the next 3 months.

572
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,810
We have to be together all day and all night.

573
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
Gu Shijun, you don't know anything.

574
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,110
Do you think you can change anything?

575
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,990
If you do this, I will turn against you even more.

576
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,610
We broke up and there is no way to reconcile.

577
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,400
Stop harassing me.

578
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:35,800
Zhiqing

579
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:45,700
Who?

580
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,100
Who's there?

581
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,310
What's up?

582
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,100
this is you

583
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,880
Are you mad at the elevator?

584
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,500
Oh, we're done.

585
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,100
Is it over?

586
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:25,800
what

587
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,300
Just now, Zi Qing and I were secretly photographed.

588
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,210
It's sure to be in the headlines tomorrow.

589
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:30,800
Here you…

590
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,900
With Zhiqing?

591
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,050
You are the lead actor and here...

592
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,570
This is the application…

593
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,980
Wait...put it here.

594
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,800
I have time to check.

595
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:49,810
Dad

596
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:50,910
Miss Lin

597
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,490
How is Gu Shijun?

598
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,700
Is the contract smooth?

599
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,610
It's ready.

600
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,300
Wow!

601
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,510
The contract has been signed.

602
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,500
That's it.

603
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,100
Oh, Mr. President.

604
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,800
 <b>This Gu Shijun was an actor.</b>  <b>Chinese A-list popularity</b>

605
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,710
That he agreed to sign the contract

606
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,500
 <b>Box office help</b>  <b>A lot of the city of time.</b>

607
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,650
But this is not easy either.

608
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,100
Gu Shijun, this person.

609
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,510
The hardest to deal with

610
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,000
There are many companies

611
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,000
who tried to work with him

612
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,310
But he doesn't care at all.

613
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,120
<b>It was unbelievable that Mr. Lin had signed the contract.</b>  <b>It's easy with him like this.</b>

614
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,500
Very excellent.

615
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,210
President

616
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,600
In a few years, you will probably…

617
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,710
You can retire and rest assured.

618
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,400
How can I trust it?

619
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,510
This Jin Siu again.

620
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,400
Just ran away and traveled abroad.

621
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:52,610
Ban Chong refused to return.

622
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,300
Is the company still in your sight?

623
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,010
How could I leave Gaia with him?

624
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,110
Talking about Jin Xiu

625
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,160
Where is he now?

626
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:25,900
What are you doing?

627
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,900
What are you worried about?

628
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,410
I'm not running away.

629
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,900
Run away.

630
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,610
Dad, I know I'm about to get on the elevator.

631
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,030
I'm definitely thinking about it.

632
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,400
I thought about it until I was completely thin.

633
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,780
That's right.

634
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:46,940
oh

635
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,350
I understand.

636
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,460
We'll talk later.

637
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,410
Oh, wait a minute.

638
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,820
Hey, Dad, I'll talk to you.

639
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,760
Yes, Mr. Lin.

640
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,280
This is yours.

641
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,830
Xu Zhen?

642
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,010
go

643
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,500
Hey, stop it.

644
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,670
Hurry, follow me.

645
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,400
This is you.

646
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,700
Just up to here is enough.

647
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,800
 <b>The problems you have with those people</b>  <b>I don't want to interfere.</b>

648
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,600
It's better to notify the police.

649
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,000
in the eyes of men

650
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,800
Women's problems must always come first.

651
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,700
Because of that

652
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,800
No matter what

653
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,710
Let's help each other solve the problem first.

654
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,000
I study paleontology.

655
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,330
Study of the male human species

656
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,600
Which you

657
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,700
It's not my type.

658
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,500
You're so mean.

659
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,340
 <b>The human heart is an uncertain thing.</b>  <b>Just as I thought.</b>

660
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,400
But so be it.

661
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,710
From today on

662
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,800
I'll pay it back compounded.

663
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,100
Not in time now

664
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:24,700
go

665
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,150
Wait, wait, wait.

666
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,000
Here, wait a minute.

667
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,270
you two

668
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,500
Where do you live?

669
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,200
Do you remember yet?

670
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,000
Is that right?

671
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,420
Lin Jinxiu

672
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,000
Do you remember now?

673
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:49,110
That's right.

674
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,110
Why did it suddenly disappear?

675
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,000
I never thought I would be Mr.

676
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,700
We haven't seen each other in 10 years, right?

677
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,000
The way you smile is just like when we were kids.

678
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,300
It's been 13 years already.

679
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:19,200
Hey, it's the same as before, she doesn't even remember.

680
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,640
I just

681
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,000
A little more handsome

682
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,470
But you completely forgot about me.

683
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,620
Really

684
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,290
It's good to have this guy.

685
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,010
So I recognized her immediately.

686
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,900
Oh my…

687
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,410
This is it.

688
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,480
four leaf clover

689
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,910
With amber

690
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,840
That's right.

691
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,300
that she gave me when I was a child

692
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,710
enough after that

693
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:47,010
I moved abroad

694
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,630
Always carry it with you.

695
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,260
Over the years it has helped me.

696
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,210
Plus it gave me luck.

697
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,000
Xiao Zhen

698
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:55,720
I really have to thank you.

699
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:12,490
He's come after you.
