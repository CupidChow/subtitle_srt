1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,380
The pain of time keeps prolonging

2
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,460
The Red Army thing is actually not as difficult as you think

3
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,580
How wonderful it is that we can fulfill the wishes of two people in just one day.

4
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,660
This matter is not as simple as you think

5
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,060
I'm not a philanthropist who is embraced by everyone

6
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,100
There is no obligation to help a stranger trample on your inner bottom line

7
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,020
I don't even have time to play family games with that uncle.

8
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,580
Tell them to give up on this idea.

9
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,220
It's just like playing house to meet his daughter

10
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,020
Uncle, he really needs your help.

11
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,420
He wanted to make up for the guilt he had felt towards his daughter over the years.

12
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,780
This is a conflict within their family.

13
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,980
We outsiders cannot solve the fundamental problem

14
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,000
He has time to ask me for help.

15
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,580
Why not spend more time with your family?

16
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,840
Chat with them more

17
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,420
Maybe it can solve the problem

18
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,820
Shi Yuge

19
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,160
I've been begging you for so long.

20
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,540
Can you help me talk to Chi Jun and ask him to agree to this?

21
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,440
Xiaozhen

22
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
No, I won't help you.

23
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,500
But I am also very embarrassed about this matter

24
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,160
Because when time just debuted

25
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,300
There was something extremely scary that he revealed to his fans alone.

26
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,900
Hello, is this Brother Shijun?

27
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
Oh, I really like you so much.

28
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,240
You played really well just now.

29
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,700
This is the water I just bought.

30
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
Haven't drunk it yet.

31
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,060
If you don't mind, why don't you drink first?

32
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,700
Oh, thank you.

33
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,900
I don't know why it's missing.

34
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,280
what

35
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,460
Hey Kiki

36
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,120
Hey, Qiqi, don't scare me, what's wrong?

37
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,060
Hey Kiki Kiki

38
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,460
Kiki

39
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,780
Later I took the time to go to the hospital for gastric lavage.

40
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,640
The doctor said Xin Fei was sent to the hospital in time.

41
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,620
Otherwise, it's life-threatening.

42
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,460
And super glue and toxic drugs were found in the drinks he drank.

43
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,080
So I don't care who this uncle who suddenly appeared is.

44
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,260
What does he want to do?

45
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,340
I can't guarantee what he will do after the Red Army meets him alone.

46
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,660
As a military agent

47
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,280
I don't even dare to take the risk of letting Chijun meet fans alone

48
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,380
So Xiaozhen

49
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,140
terribly sorry

50
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,640
Xiao Yan Weishan

51
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,860
After school or get off work, go home and gather together

52
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
What did you send in the morning?

53
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,440
Ten reasons why Xu Zhen deserves Gu Chengjun

54
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,600
Take it down immediately.

55
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,820
It's because you smell it here.

56
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,400
Our server was almost hacked

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,540
Rewrite the ten crimes that Xu Zhen is not worthy of Gu Chengjun

58
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,580
Immediately now soft

59
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,820
Humph, I'm the gatekeeper.

60
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,380
My best friend

61
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,100
No way

62
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
oops

63
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,760
You two are my last hope.

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,500
Is there any way to make Chi Jun agree to do something he doesn't want to do?

65
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,040
Xiaozhen, you are someone's girlfriend.

66
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,900
Don't you understand this matter?

67
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,620
Stop keeping me in suspense and tell me now

68
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,620
Acting like a spoiled child is a universal rule for a woman to conquer a man

69
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,400
Oh, Weishan

70
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,960
Acting like a spoiled child is my Achilles' heel.

71
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,140
I can not do it

72
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,580
That's all right

73
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,900
We can ask for help from outsiders.

74
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,260
I definitely don't believe it

75
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,480
Xiaoyan, do you know any girl?

76
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm the type who can act like a spoiled child.

77
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,540
Xiao Fei is one of them.

78
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,100
I'll go back to my room first

79
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,180
I'll go and continue reading.

80
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,460
Xiao Yan, have you forgotten this?

81
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,260
Oh, Xiao Yan

82
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,820
The injuries a girl suffers are not so easy to heal.

83
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,120
Whether it's for your sister or for yourself

84
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm going to invite you to come to my house tonight.

85
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,980
This will help repair the relationship between you

86
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,660
Sister, this is not good.

87
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,980
Then take my car.

88
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,460
Sister, I am doing this for you

89
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,100
All right

90
00:08:36,239 --> 00:08:39,259
That's my sister. Look.

91
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,100
You actually sent me a message asking me to go to his house

92
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,100
Then he asked me to send him the address to pick me up.

93
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,140
Give him the address.

94
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,120
Hey, you should at least give him some time off.

95
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,380
Come back, didn't you say before that once we broke up, you wouldn't come back even if I gave you 1 million?

96
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,180
Doesn't this also depend on the people involved?

97
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,120
Besides, I know Shen Qingyan too well.

98
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,820
If I don't go now, we're both doomed.

99
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,020
And for a poor girl who is desperate to solve the problem of Tianshaoluoxing, this is nothing.

100
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,320
How about I won't talk to you anymore

101
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
I have to go there quickly

102
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,980
After a long time, he should stop waiting for me and leave.

103
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,900
Looks like this time they're serious

104
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,540
Come on, Xiaofei, come on quickly

105
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,620
Come, come, come, come, come, please sit down.

106
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,860
I heard Xiao Yang tell me

107
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,600
For me, being coquettish is as easy as eating.

108
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,500
But according to my experience

109
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,740
If you want to be a spoiled brat

110
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,280
Someone must cooperate with me

111
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,540
The effect will be better

112
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,100
Uh, can I refuse?

113
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,580
Okay, I'm convinced.

114
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,380
If you don't agree to it

115
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,380
People just keep telling you

116
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,020
Until you promise me

117
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,100
No, help me!

118
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,220
Don't hahaha

119
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,140
Ha ha ha ha

120
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,060
Sister, I sacrificed my body for you.

121
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,740
Teacher Xiao Fei's coquettish class ends here

122
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,740
I've created such a good opportunity for you, but you still don't take the initiative. You should seize it. I'm really worried about you.

123
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,300
Hehe, forget it. I think the magic eye is destined to be lonely for life.

124
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,540
I don't know what you two are talking about. I have nothing to do with him.

125
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,660
Why is my heart beating so fast?

126
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,000
Must be a heart attack.

127
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,180
I'm going to see a doctor

128
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,060
Is Xiaofei's action correct?

129
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,260
Not like this

130
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,020
Hahaha oh eh hahaha

131
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,820
Xiaofei, thank you for coming today. I learned a lesson about Christmas.

132
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,500
Ah Xu Zhen

133
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,580
I

134
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,300
I have something to tell you.

135
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,180
I

136
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,700
The car is coming, get ready to go

137
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,620
gone

138
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,480
bye bye

139
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,020
I'm sorry, Xu Zhen

140
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,420
I was wrong about the photo.

141
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,580
Come in

142
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,160
Good morning.

143
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,020
Hey

144
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,200
Xu Xuzhe, what are you doing? Haha

145
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,220
It's so urgent

146
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,740
Hey, what's wrong with you?

147
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,220
what happened

148
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,460
Oh hey

149
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,920
Hey

150
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,820
Do you have a fever?

151
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,940
Still feeling uncomfortable?

152
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,820
My brain is burnt out

153
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,880
Oh, I finally managed to challenge myself to enter the second life of the Code of Acting Cute

154
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,540
Now I feel like everything is gone.

155
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,360
You're so handsome

156
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,660
So cool!

157
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,120
Xu Chen, stop being a spoiled brat

158
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,180
I get goosebumps when you act like a spoiled child

159
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,220
Do you have something to trouble me?

160
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,700
Could it be because of that uncle again?

161
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,560
Ah, have you finally figured it out?

162
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,020
I want to help uncle.

163
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,040
Xu Zhen

164
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,820
I still have the same attitude towards this matter as before

165
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,420
Rather than asking me to comfort his daughter to bridge the gap between them,

166
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,900
Let the father reflect on himself.

167
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,820
What kind of problems did he encounter in playing the role of a father?

168
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,620
do you know

169
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,840
Because he is a father

170
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,860
So no matter how ridiculous this thing is, the uncle will do it

171
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,040
Because he is willing to gamble regardless of the consequences.

172
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,100
in my opinion

173
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,780
It is a father expressing his simplest and most direct love for his daughter.

174
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,100
Gu Zhijun

175
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,100
Sometimes people feel lonely and helpless

176
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,220
Like when my dad died

177
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,380
Uncle, he just needs a hug from you now.

178
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,300
Xu Zhen, you are the only one who can make me, Gu Shijun, make exceptions again and again.

179
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,140
But in return

180
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,340
Should I give you a loving hug?

181
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,900
But thank you so much today. I am really touched.

182
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,300
Call uncle right away and tell him the news.

183
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,978
Xu Zhen was due to the adjustment of the start time of school abroad

184
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,939
So my daughter has to go abroad early

185
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,719
I've already taken her to the airport.

186
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:19,598
No matter what

187
00:17:19,598 --> 00:17:24,858
Thank you for reaching out to me and offering to help me. The uncle said he had passed customs 30 minutes ago.

188
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,038
It's peak traffic now.

189
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,859
It's definitely too late.

190
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:31,060
Don't give up easily on something you've worked so hard on for so long.

191
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,260
That's enough.

192
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,420
I, Gu Chijun, will definitely do what I promised you.

193
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,160
Hey, Dad, it's almost time.

194
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,180
I'm going through customs.

195
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,260
Why don't you eat something to fill your stomach before you go?

196
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,080
Didn't I just eat?

197
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,820
Dad, do you have anything to say to me?

198
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,820
Dad just feels that there are so many things I haven't done for you yet.

199
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,920
You just left

200
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,160
A bit reluctant

201
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,520
Oh, dad, don't worry.

202
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,680
Even if I go there

203
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,160
We can also chat on WeChat

204
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,520
Okay, just go back now.

205
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,640
Then I'll leave first.

206
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,300
Be careful on the road.

207
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,480
Be careful on the road

208
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,060
Let me know when you arrive. Bye.

209
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,620
Hey Xu Zhen

210
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,560
Mr. Gu, why are you here?

211
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Uncle, where is your daughter now?

212
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,220
I just sent her in.

213
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,900
We should be getting ready to board the plane now.

214
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,240
How to do it

215
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,700
We're still a step late

216
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,080
What's your daughter's name?

217
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,940
Pei Xiaotian, I have a way. That's enough.

218
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,740
How can I help you?

219
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,080
We are looking for a very important friend

220
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,440
Could you please send us a student broadcast as soon as possible?

221
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,580
The sooner the better

222
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,080
good

223
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,960
Please note that passengers traveling to New Zealand should

224
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,360
Please go to the airport customer service center now

225
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,280
Your friends are waiting for you here

226
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,240
Please note that passengers traveling to New Zealand should

227
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,440
Please go to the airport customer service center now

228
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,700
Your friends are waiting for you here

229
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,300
Report it again

230
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,720
Please note that passengers flying to New Zealand

231
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,960
Please go to the airport customer service center now

232
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,140
Your friends are waiting for you here

233
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,420
Hello Pei Xiaotian

234
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,900
I am Gu Shijun

235
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,860
You have left something very important in the terminal hall.

236
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,740
I hope you can come here immediately after hearing this broadcast.

237
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,620
We will always be here waiting for you

238
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,620
Pei Xiaotian, please show up.

239
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,380
Show up soon

240
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Why

241
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,460
sorry

242
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,020
You are Pei Xiaotian

243
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,400
It's me. How do you know me?

244
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,540
The whole airport knows that you are waiting for you at the customer service

245
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,540
I don't know if you are looking for me.

246
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
I really don't eat chicken.

247
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,780
I can't believe myself

248
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,660
Who else could it be but me?

249
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,700
I just didn't expect you to know my name

250
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,460
He will come to the airport to find me

251
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,580
Oh, by the way, you just said that I left something at the airport terminal.

252
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,560
ah

253
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,340
Your father wanted to fulfill your wish before you went abroad.

254
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,940
Dad, they are

255
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,700
It's all because of this man

256
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,500
We will be at the airport.

257
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,340
Your father fulfilled your wish.

258
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,860
This is so persistent that it's horrible

259
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,940
Missing a flight is not a big deal.

260
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,980
Miss your father's love for you

261
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,860
You will regret it forever.

262
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,440
Dad, I haven't thought about it.

263
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,540
Something I never thought would happen

264
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,420
You actually always remember

265
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,180
Xiao Tian

266
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,060
Dad is stupid

267
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,140
No money for you to go to a better school

268
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,540
I don't have the ability to travel around the world with you.

269
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,440
I can't even talk to you properly.

270
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,020
So I can only do it for you

271
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,180
Complete this task

272
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,920
Dad, actually many of my friends envy me.

273
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,940
When they chase stars, they fight alone

274
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,300
And every time I go to see my idol

275
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,840
You accompany me regardless of weather conditions

276
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,000
Bring me water.

277
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
Hold an umbrella for me.

278
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,780
I really don't think you are worse than other fathers.

279
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,340
This time I chose to study abroad

280
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,700
It's not because mom is richer than you.

281
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,260
But I think

282
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,660
I should get out of your protective raincoat

283
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,940
I want to see the outside world

284
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,700
I want to be a better me

285
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,060
You really have grown up.

286
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,460
Dad understands

287
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,420
No matter where you go in the future

288
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,820
I support you

289
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,680
But Xiaotian

290
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,420
Your plane has left.

291
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Do you want to see if there are any tickets available for today?

292
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,840
Oh, dad, don't worry.

293
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,700
If the ticket is sold out, you can buy another one.

294
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,420
Today, I just want to accompany my dad.

295
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,900
Wow Town

296
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,140
You did this.

297
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,620
She is indeed my best friend.

298
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,060
marvelous

299
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,920
Hey, has the article that Wei Xia asked you to post yesterday that slandered Xu Zhen been posted?

300
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,380
If you don't, stop immediately.

301
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,560
Have you watched today's video?

302
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,720
It's so touching.

303
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,560
Xu Zhen has now made a big comeback on the Internet

304
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,080
Even Gu Shizhen's fans have turned from haters to fans of him

305
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,180
Hurry up and curse again

306
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,040
Support this couple's kiss

307
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,840
yes

308
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,820
In fact, I have already written an article about 100 reasons why Xu Zhen and Gu Chijun must be together.

309
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,620
I'll upload it right away.

310
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,140
Why is your news everywhere?

311
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,960
Feed Zhao Ju to worship the ancestors

312
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,280
All leaders meeting

313
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,740
I need to deal with the shooting tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

314
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,860
Isn't it said that serious men are the most handsome?

315
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,740
Then I should be the most handsome man in the world now

316
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,220
The theme of our meeting this time is to discuss the shooting time tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

317
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,740
You guys speak up

318
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,960
Falling on the ground

319
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,380
Those are the years we missed

320
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,160
We picked up the pages one by one

321
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,580
It's every minute and every second now

322
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,220
I'm sorry

323
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,740
It's okay to give it to me

324
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,660
Now let's talk about the design of the script.

325
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,240
Subjugated

326
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,060
Such a heavy burden

327
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,060
How can I bear to let you take it?

328
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,660
As long as I'm by your side

329
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,620
Gravity is a fallacy to you

330
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,700
You guys have a meeting first.

331
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,020
I think wolfberry

332
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,960
Why

333
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,220
Finally I can be alone and quiet

334
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,860
nothing anybody can be just

335
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,120
fair

336
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,900
no reason

337
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,740
does he start asking why

338
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,380
go crazy

339
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,020
Give me some

340
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,620
Opening your mouth must be an illusion

341
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,740
Not seen yet

342
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,380
Can't affect my good mood

343
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,460
Open your mouth

344
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,460
Ahaha

345
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,220
Ha ha

346
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,440
Even though it's just an illusion, you two are being too affectionate.

347
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,500
It seriously affected my mood for watching movies.

348
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,860
Xiao Xiu, why are you here too?

349
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,880
Why

350
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,620
You are the real Xu Xuan

351
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,540
Really a story, nonsense

352
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,020
I can meet you guys even when watching such an unpopular movie

353
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,640
Ah, there is something going on with that company.

354
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,780
I'm going back

355
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,100
Hey Xiaoqiu

356
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,780
Xiao Xiu doesn't look very well. I'm worried that something might happen to him.

357
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
it does not matter

358
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,020
It'll be fine.

359
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,620
It's you

360
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,100
Now is the time to deliver on your promise

361
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,340
Um

362
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,200
If you don't agree to it

363
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,180
People keep kissing you like this

364
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,700
Kiss until you agree

365
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,540
do not do that

366
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,900
Oh, I can't come out

367
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,480
Come up quickly, bro.

368
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,980
You've been swimming all night.

369
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,900
Ah, you are finally here

370
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,420
What's wrong

371
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,320
ah

372
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,940
My clothes got dirty.

373
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,140
What's wrong? I want to die.

374
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,380
Bro, I'm heartbroken.

375
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,300
And I've been having a lot of hallucinations lately.

376
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,000
You say I'm going crazy?

377
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,160
Oh, how big of a deal was that for me?

378
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,580
Isn't it just a broken heart?

379
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,220
Can't you just find a good girl later?

380
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,000
I'm telling you something serious.

381
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,100
Dad today

382
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,140
I have been made the heir of the company.

383
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,400
real

384
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,820
Oh, brother, that's great.

385
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,120
But you deserve this.

386
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,220
You work so hard

387
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,960
Brother, if you become a president in the future

388
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,240
Then I can play more recklessly.

389
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,080
Don't be happy too soon.

390
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,200
I have promised my dad that I will manage the company with you.

391
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,180
What?

392
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Please forgive me

393
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,460
I'm still going swimming.

394
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,100
I continued to vote.

395
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,200
Why

396
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,060
Gu Zhijun, can you do me a favor?

397
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,420
What's wrong

398
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,240
I forgot to take my change of clothes so I left them at the end of the bed.

399
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,060
Could you help me get it, please?

400
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,120
ah

401
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,100
I put it at the door for you.

402
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,620
Gu Ai

403
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,380
Gu Chijun, you got the wrong clothes

404
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,660
That's right.

405
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,660
What's this

406
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,820
Gu Shijun, where are the clothes I put at the end of the bed?

407
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,220
Oh, are you satisfied?

408
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,420
When we were shopping, I saw you staring at couples wearing matching outfits.

409
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,580
I know you have this idea.

410
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,180
I didn't, I didn't look at it, I looked at the clothes

411
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,540
Rather than passively accepting, it is better to actively enjoy

412
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,520
So what?

413
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,840
Since I can't wear couple outfits with you outside

414
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,300
Then I will wear it with you at home reluctantly for once, but don't think about it.

415
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,960
Just that once

416
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,700
There won't be a next time.

417
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,020
Since the big star has given me such a favor, I will reluctantly prepare a cup of Xue's milk tea for you.

418
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,500
Remember to put less sugar

419
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,380
Body shape is still important

420
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,020
I see

421
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,660
Ah ha ha

422
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,860
ha

423
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,320
Why

424
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,940
I should also record a song for Xu Chen like Xiao Yuanxiao did.

425
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,540
When he misses me, he can listen to the songs I sing to him.

426
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,860
Leidy, what do you think?

427
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,540
The king asked me to patrol the mountains

428
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,260
Hahahaha, cook beef for dinner

429
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,180
Small around

430
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,239
Director Liu, please save me.

431
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,639
I brought it up by hand

432
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,939
You know me best

433
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,120
The media reported that what happened to me was not true.

434
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,220
Everything was planned by the neighbor.

435
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,400
Mom and Dad are worried about my situation

436
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,800
Drive over to see me

437
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,500
But there was a car accident on the road

438
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:30,518
Please let Lin Zong and Li Qian off the hook

439
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:32,178
He is still young after all.

440
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,779
Now his mother has been in a car accident

441
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,218
Lying in the hospital

442
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,939
He can't even afford the medical bills.

443
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,620
He has received enough education.

444
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,100
If this continues

445
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,319
His whole family will be ruined.

446
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,199
It turns out that Director Liu is such a compassionate person

447
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:49,139
This is the first time I discovered

448
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,180
But I remember the tragic explosion 8 years ago

449
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,779
Mr. Wang was also affected

450
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,640
I heard that he is living a hard life now.

451
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,840
Very miserable

452
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,700
Why didn't I listen to Director Liu asking me to help him?

453
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,380
But I almost forgot about the bombing.

454
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,380
Director Liu also participated

455
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,580
That's why you have gone from being a small clerk to where you are today.

456
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,140
Became the Artist Director of Gaia Entertainment

457
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,520
You are used to having a good life

458
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,680
Now you suddenly have a sense of justice, right?

459
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,080
Come and try my Xu's milk tea

460
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,880
Bar

461
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,820
Yeah, here I come, haha

462
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Um

463
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,660
It's delicious.

464
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,480
It is reported that

465
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:45,780
The scandal of Gu Chijun's female assistant and the sudden collapse of the dressing room in the movie "City of Time" caused a backlash from fans

466
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,040
After the interview, the leading actors Gu Chijun and Qin Ziqing

467
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,140
Director Leung Wan Ting also expressed her feelings to the public through the media

468
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,060
The movie "City of Time" is very important to me.

469
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,660
I certainly don't want the City of Time to stop because of the recent accidents and these farces.

470
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,840
Even if it's difficult

471
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,460
I will never give up

472
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,100
So I sincerely hope that everyone will support my City of Time

473
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,500
Sorry, Mom.

474
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,060
Xu Zhen

475
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,980
If the City of Time encounters particularly great difficulties or even dangers

476
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,660
Will you still persist?

477
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,060
What about the City of Time?

478
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,300
It's my mother's memorial to my father.

479
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,100
It is also my commemoration of my father.

480
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,220
I will never give up

481
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,460
I believe my mother will never give up.

482
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,740
If I were like Yuanxiao's father

483
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,260
Encountering that level of danger

484
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,060
Do you still want to persist?

485
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,300
Yuanxiao's father will definitely wake up

486
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,940
The City of Time is a memorial to my father

487
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,840
So no matter what difficulties you encounter

488
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,140
I don't care about opposition, boycott, accidents, etc.

489
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,920
good

490
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,460
Then I support you too

491
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,980
Ah, sit, sit, sit

492
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,260
Recently?

493
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,860
I'm so sorry

494
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,900
Because my health has caused everyone to worry

495
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,500
But it also gave me a reminder

496
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,580
Age is a thing.

497
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,660
There are so many things that are more terrifying than KPI.

498
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,580
Hahahaha, it's time to quit

499
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,940
Come today?

500
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,140
I just want to discuss this with you all.

501
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,380
Studying abroad or furthering your studies

502
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,620
Who is the most suitable person for the position of Chairman of Gaiya?

503
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,920
yes

504
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,460
Hahaha

505
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,260
Okay, let's raise our hands and vote.

506
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,780
Sit down

507
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,040
Sister, yeah

508
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,900
You told me last time

509
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,540
If you were to choose between the two of you brothers, who would be best suited to run the company?

510
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,820
It must be you

511
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,480
Where is your confidence?

512
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,660
I really appreciate

513
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,780
So many years

514
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,940
Your performance

515
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,940
Everyone can see

516
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,360
The board of directors just voted

517
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,300
We unanimously approve you as the next chairman.

518
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,680
Leave the company to you

519
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,940
I feel relieved, thank you

520
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,580
Thank you Chairman and Chairman of the Board for your trust and condolences

521
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,300
But I hope before I retire

522
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,140
You must start a family.

523
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,580
The girl you mentioned to me last time

524
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,980
That's good. Don't worry.

525
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:34,260
Regarding work, Xiao Xiu and I will lead Gaia to become the strongest entertainment company in the country.

526
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,860
There was something

527
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,100
I think I'll tell you when the time is right.

528
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,420
Me and Jiayi

529
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,580
We are now at the stage of discussing marriage.

530
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,760
What a trustworthy child.

531
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,560
correct

532
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,020
This is Neferta, a blood pressure medication.

533
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,760
The doctor asked me to bring it to you.

534
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,500
Don't forget to take it on time. You are such a good kid.

535
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,100
I still think about my dad.

536
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,700
But what about Xiaoqiu?

537
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,820
I seem to have encountered something recently.

538
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,700
Please take some time to enlighten him.

539
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,720
OK, if there is nothing else, I won't delay your work.

540
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,080
You can go back first.

541
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,600
Yeah, okay

542
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,720
Then I'll go first.

543
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,780
Okay, I'm going to put this here for you.

544
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,020
Something I've been waiting for for so long

545
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,340
Until today

546
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,980
Finally got it

547
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,280
look

548
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,780
Good show

549
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,580
Everyone take a half hour break

550
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,500
Brother Zhijun, your show is over today.

551
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,100
Mr. Yang

552
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,940
I have a scene later that I want to talk to you about privately

553
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,660
Okay, let's go.

554
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,340
What happened to Chu Jun?

555
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,420
I don't know which one is next.

556
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,860
Actually, it's not the later part.

557
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,140
It was the scene half a day ago.

558
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,500
I don't quite understand what you are saying

559
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,380
The crew 8 years ago

560
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,100
You Lin Jinyang

561
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,020
What happened to Liu Weicheng before?

562
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,660
This matter has nothing to do with you

563
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,180
You don't really need to know

564
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,540
You keep chasing Xu Zhen away

565
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,060
Is it because of this incident?

566
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,660
During this time

567
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,460
I actively cooperate and participate in public relations work

568
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,940
Your incident with Xu Zhen did affect the crew.

569
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,540
That's why I hope Xu Zhen leaves

570
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,620
Please let Mr. Li go for what he did in the past.
