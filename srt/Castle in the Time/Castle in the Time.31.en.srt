1
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,900
A person who helps evil people for selfish reasons

2
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,960
A person who causes evil people to become evil people

3
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,220
All of you including you

4
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,020
Which one is innocent?

5
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,140
So many years

6
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,380
What happened?

7
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,140
Why is this happening?

8
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,040
ah

9
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,680
do you

10
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,300
Ahhhh

11
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,640
ah

12
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,060
ah

13
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,820
You've been CEO for less than a year and this has happened to me.

14
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,380
How can I feel assured in the future?

15
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,419
The one who taught you a lesson

16
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,660
We will be more rigorous in the future.

17
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,120
From now on, the City of Time will be in your hands.

18
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,980
I wonder if you dare to give up on me.

19
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,560
Dad, it's really wrong for you to do this.

20
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,220
It's really unfair to me.

21
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,500
I don't know what you're doing

22
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,060
In addition to wanting to cover the car

23
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,260
How to kick me out of the chairman's position?

24
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,760
In addition to this

25
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,300
You haven't thought about anything

26
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,460
You've worked so hard over the years.

27
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,260
I never let you rest.

28
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,780
Well, let's find a place to take a vacation starting today.

29
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,560
dad

30
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,100
You forced me to do this.

31
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
It's you

32
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,740
Must have mine

33
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,760
yeah

34
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,780
Dad, you have to be fierce

35
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,860
Dad, I didn't mean it.

36
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,460
Didn't I marry you on purpose?

37
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,900
Uncle Liu

38
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,280
dad

39
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,620
Ah ha ha ha ha ha

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Zhao He

41
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,860
Ah, don't think about it, Old Ye

42
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,660
Zhao He Zhao He Lao Ye

43
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,220
Zhao He, Lao Ye Zhao He, you are Lao Ye

44
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,220
What happened to Aunt Yang?

45
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,280
How could it be you

46
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,420
I think he might have a heart virus.

47
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,660
Uncle Liu, call me quickly

48
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,100
You guys be careful

49
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,580
You guys be careful

50
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,660
Doctor, what's going on?

51
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,440
My dad was talking to me just now.

52
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,420
Why did you faint suddenly?

53
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,980
You must find a way to cure him.

54
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,840
Don't worry, Mr. Lin

55
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,060
We will try our best

56
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,880
Miss Qin, when can your husband come to our place?

57
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,360
The photographer is ready

58
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,740
You can start shooting at any time

59
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,860
He must have been stuck in traffic.

60
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,060
Wait a minute. Okay.

61
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,820
Xiaolu, bring me the phone.

62
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,920
Jinyang, didn't we agree to take wedding photos today?

63
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,020
Where are you

64
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,820
You have to decide on your own marriage

65
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,240
Of course, you take the wedding photos yourself.

66
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,380
Do I need to go there? Lin Jingyang

67
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,820
Sister Ziqing, are we still shooting today?

68
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,500
Of course I have to shoot

69
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,140
I want to take more beautiful pictures

70
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,260
I'm coming

71
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,800
Who is it?

72
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,360
Hello, is your name Liu Jia?

73
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
Oh, that's enough. I said he has moved away and doesn't live here anymore.

74
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,740
One or two is enough. I come here every day to ask

75
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,420
Hey hey hey beautiful lady

76
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,480
You look so kind, you must know where he is now.

77
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,340
Please tell me

78
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,220
He said my last tenant moved out a few years ago. How would I know this?

79
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,740
I'll tell you since you're so pitiful.

80
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,180
I want to go to the old lady selling drinks at the door, right?

81
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,280
He has lived here the longest, you can go ask him

82
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,660
They have a relatively familiar relationship

83
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Okay, thank you.

84
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,060
You're welcome. Let's go.

85
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,240
Hello, grandma. Hello, grandma.

86
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,200
You've been selling drinks here for many years, right?

87
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
I've been selling it for many years.

88
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,980
Do you know a person named Liu Jia?

89
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,660
Liu Jia

90
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,200
Oh, you mean Xiaojia, right?

91
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,800
I know him. Xiaojia is a good kid.

92
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,080
He often helps me with housework. He is very considerate and enthusiastic.

93
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,860
Do you know where he is now?

94
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,160
Moved again

95
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,180
Move as soon as you say

96
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,840
I don't know where it moved to.

97
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,880
Hey, let me tell you

98
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,920
Xiaojia, this child has a hard life.

99
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,840
He grew up in that orphanage.

100
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,120
No one cares

101
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,680
But you see, without parents' supervision, the child has not learned bad things and is doing well.

102
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,220
Welfare Home

103
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,420
Which welfare home did he work in before?

104
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,720
The welfare home is the one in the suburbs of our city. What is it called?

105
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,100
That's Gongming Welfare Home

106
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,420
Gongming Welfare Home

107
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,780
Why does it sound so familiar?

108
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,440
Hello

109
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,380
What

110
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,020
My dad fainted.

111
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,380
I'll be right there.

112
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,900
Thank you, grandma.

113
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,760
Zhao He

114
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,220
You've always been in good health.

115
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,300
Why is it suddenly like this?

116
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,980
Wake up quickly

117
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,780
Tell me what's going on

118
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,240
Liang Party

119
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,780
During the time when my father was ill

120
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,900
I hope that those who are with him are our own family members.

121
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,500
Not an unrelated outsider

122
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,540
So please leave for a while

123
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,380
Don't touch me, I can walk on my own

124
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,700
I will definitely check this matter

125
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,740
before this

126
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,980
I hope you still have some conscience

127
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,140
Take good care of your dad

128
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,020
Will do

129
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,600
dad

130
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,380
Now even if you blame me

131
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,420
There is no way

132
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,540
Because I have no way out

133
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,560
Lian Zong

134
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,740
Doctor, how is my father?

135
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,180
After our rescue

136
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,300
Chairman Lin's condition has basically stabilized.

137
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,700
I should be able to invite you over in a while.

138
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,980
Mr. Lin, please don't be too anxious.

139
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,620
Lin

140
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,860
Do you have any questions about Mr. Lin's condition?

141
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,980
I do have a question

142
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,740
Doctor, your medical skills are so great

143
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,220
I think you can find a way to let my father go

144
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,340
Wake up two days later, right?

145
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,980
Lin

146
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,300
I do not quite understand what you mean

147
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,980
I made it clear

148
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,740
You heard it clearly too.

149
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,860
You have been socializing with our Lin family for so many years.

150
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,580
The current situation should be seen clearly.

151
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,740
How do you choose

152
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,060
I think

153
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,620
I don't need to teach you.

154
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,680
dad

155
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,740
Doctor, how is my dad?

156
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,100
Mr. Xiaolin, Mr. Lin's condition is basically stable now.

157
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
Well

158
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,060
When will I wake up?

159
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,860
We can’t predict now.

160
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,660
Still need further observation

161
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,840
Uh, sorry, both of you.

162
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,860
I have to go to other wards for rounds.

163
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,140
Then I'll take my leave first.

164
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,700
Thank you for your hard work, doctor.

165
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,060
Don't worry, little one

166
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,860
We have the best doctors and medicines.

167
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,380
Besides, Dad often has heart attacks.

168
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,300
Which time didn't it turn into stomach cancer?

169
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,860
Don't worry, Dad will wake up soon.

170
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,019
I'm lucky to have you this time.

171
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,820
Oh, yeah, brother

172
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,500
Did you live in Gongming Welfare House for a while when you were a child?

173
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,539
Why did you suddenly think of asking this?

174
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,398
Do you remember the mysterious man I told you about before?

175
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:24,398
While investigating him, I found out that he had lived in that citizen welfare home.

176
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:26,858
So I want to ask you if you know him.

177
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,500
Gongming

178
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,860
I remember that this was not my previous name. You must have remembered it wrong.

179
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,540
Oh, okay

180
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,960
Hello

181
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,700
What

182
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,880
The town was kidnapped.

183
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,700
Wait for me, I'll be there soon.

184
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
Hey, Xiaoqing, what happened? My brother was kidnapped. I have to go and take a look.

185
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,540
Please take care of Dad here.

186
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,680
If there is anything, please let me know immediately.

187
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,060
Well, I'll go first.

188
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,640
What happened to Sister Ziqing?

189
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,940
Yeah, you're fine.

190
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,220
If you have anything to say, just say it.

191
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,760
Hmm, Sister Ziqing

192
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,040
Here's what's going on

193
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,300
The media has learned about your marriage to Mr. Lin.

194
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,860
They want your wedding photos with Mr. Lin for publicity

195
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,420
I don't know if we can provide them with

196
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,140
But at present we only have photos of you and Mr. Lin alone

197
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,500
No group photo

198
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,580
Why no group photo?

199
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,340
We not only have photos

200
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,780
We must work well with them.

201
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,580
The wound is so deep

202
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,300
Just don't fall.

203
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,940
I don't want my girlfriend

204
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,740
Keep some on you.

205
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
I must have encountered Mercury retrograde during this period.

206
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Always hurt

207
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,560
Thank you for your hard work.

208
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,020
Mr. Gu Chujun

209
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,300
How did you come

210
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,860
Do me a favor

211
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,720
ah

212
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,160
Ziqing

213
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,900
The photo you want is in there.

214
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,860
Thank you Chijun

215
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,080
I don't trust others

216
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,540
I can only come to you for help

217
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,820
If the reporters knew that Lin Xiyang and I's wedding photos were all computer-generated

218
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,740
I won't be able to see anyone in public anymore.

219
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Thanks

220
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,040
Child

221
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,500
He did this to you

222
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,220
Do you still want to marry him?

223
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,580
There are such enviable lovers like you and Xu Zhen in the world

224
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,380
There are also two people like him and I who hurt each other.

225
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,840
But even though he did this to me

226
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,740
I will still marry him

227
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,900
Do not worry

228
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,340
I'll make everything alright

229
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,900
Sister Ziqing is really strong

230
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,540
Even if I get hurt, I won't hesitate

231
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,900
I really hope that the person she falls in love with is not Mr. Lin Jinyang

232
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,940
I hope so too

233
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,120
Xiao Chen

234
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,700
Are you OK

235
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,860
How come you always show up at the most critical moment?

236
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,500
How did you get hurt like this?

237
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,580
Is it that black man who did it?

238
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,820
It's him

239
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,240
Xiaozhen

240
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,660
Have you tried to find this black cinema before?

241
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,140
But I tried every possible way but couldn't find the man in black.

242
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,160
Not even one person related to him was found.

243
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,260
He is just like the loner in the novel.

244
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,220
Because he is an orphan

245
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,340
I found out that he lived in the same mansion as my brother when he was a child.

246
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,380
Xiao Juan

247
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,500
if

248
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,820
I mean if

249
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,900
My brother

250
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,820
Not the brother I knew before.

251
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,260
what do I do

252
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,320
Even if

253
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,420
He is another person

254
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,100
He is also your dearest brother.

255
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,660
Whatever the truth is

256
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,500
This will never change

257
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,340
I believe

258
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,460
Everyone already knows

259
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,860
Your chairman is unwell

260
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,340
So now I will take over the entertainment.

261
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,060
First of all, I have one thing to tell you

262
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,580
The company has decided to terminate the contract with Gu Zhijun

263
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,820
I disagree

264
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,800
as far as I know

265
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,940
When we signed the contract with Gu Chijun, our company paid a huge price.

266
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,300
Now it's easy to terminate the contract

267
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,140
I'm worried that the company will be harmed

268
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,620
Besides, his mission to kill people in the City of Time has not been completed yet.

269
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,860
Why save now?

270
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,860
Since Gu Chijun entered

271
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,380
Brought too much negative information to the City of Time

272
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,940
Firing him now will minimize the losses.

273
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,620
I would rather go to Southern Medical University again

274
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,460
Martial Arts Scenes

275
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,340
Nor can we allow the film to be released after

276
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,820
It caused a devastating disaster for the entertainment industry.

277
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,280
so

278
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,580
Termination of the contract between now and the past

279
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,780
Is the wisest choice

280
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,660
Anyway

281
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,500
Your decision

282
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,660
Some are too hasty

283
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,540
I hope we can discuss this further.

284
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,420
Uncle Ji

285
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,340
Now I accept the high-pressure entertainment

286
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:31,020
I believe the executive director has sufficient decision-making power on this matter.

287
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,420
This matter ends here

288
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,140
I don't want to say anymore

289
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,760
Xiaojun

290
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,340
Xiaojun came out and something happened.

291
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,680
What's up?

292
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,620
Aren't we going to the set in 10 minutes?

293
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,700
Look, this company wants to terminate your contract

294
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,240
no doubt

295
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,660
Lin Jinyang was wrong

296
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,300
After Chairman Lin was hospitalized

297
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,300
Lin Jinyang has already mastered Gaia Entertainment's life and death university

298
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,040
He has now gathered all the strength of the company to deal with

299
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,020
Therefore, this savings contract cannot be agreed to in any case.

300
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,460
It's time to talk to him.

301
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,500
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

302
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,940
Lin is in a meeting

303
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,660
Lin Jianyang City of Time will be destroyed by you

304
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,720
Mr. Wu

305
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,700
I remember you have nothing to do with the entertainment case.

306
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,180
As a guest coming to my office, should I greet you in advance to appear polite?

307
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,800
polite

308
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,060
Don't forget

309
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,860
I haven't signed the contract yet.

310
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,780
You didn't do what you promised me.

311
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,100
I do this

312
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,060
I was just forced to take measures.

313
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,220
Mr. Gu, don't you understand?

314
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,340
If you want to unilaterally breach

315
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,020
Then we go to court.

316
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,820
I'm really scared

317
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,420
Gu Zhijun is the leading actor in our play.

318
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,160
If you terminate the contract now

319
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,600
It will do great harm to the film.

320
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,660
do you know

321
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,920
Director Yuan

322
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,600
How was the filming?

323
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,020
That's your job as a director.

324
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,300
I'm not interested

325
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,940
But since a great director

326
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,300
A big star came to me

327
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,300
Questioning my decision

328
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,540
Then I will tell you again reluctantly.

329
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,820
The City of Time is for me

330
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,620
I have no interest at all

331
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,060
Gaia also has no shortage of movies to make money for him

332
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,020
You are not welcome at Gaia Entertainment, which I run.

333
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,420
Please leave

334
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,360
Mr. Hu

335
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,740
Uda, from the moment you went against me

336
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,060
You should think

337
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,420
There will be such an ending

338
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,100
It seems that Lin Jinyang will not give in.

339
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,600
When I promised Xu Chen to stay

340
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,380
I've already prepared myself mentally

341
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,620
All this is expected

342
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,020
No matter what

343
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,900
I will insist on filming the City of Time

344
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,220
So what are you going to do?

345
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,540
Since I have promised Xu Chen

346
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,420
I will definitely take a good picture of the time rope

347
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,380
I also hope Liang Dao doesn't give up

348
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,380
I certainly won't give up

349
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,500
I still can't give up

350
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,340
Zhao He fell ill

351
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,320
Lin Qingyang can do whatever he wants

352
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,660
Unscrupulous

353
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,580
He just wanted to force Xu Zhen away

354
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,260
Otherwise he won't be content.

355
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,700
rest assured

356
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,100
I will protect Xu Zhen

357
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,840
Xuezhen

358
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,300
I want to talk to you.

359
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,940
Dad died and didn't have many wishes.

360
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,220
But it feels like I've been gone for a long time.

361
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,220
Have you ever blamed your mother?

362
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,820
No

363
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,220
Dad keeps telling me you have more important things to do.

364
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,440
There is a mother who bravely pursues her dreams

365
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,420
I am actually very proud.

366
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,180
8 years ago

367
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,420
I'm just an assistant director.

368
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,940
Lin Jianyang had just entered Gaiya at that time.

369
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,620
He wanted to seize power

370
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,300
Renhe and Liu Weicheng committed a bombing case

371
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,060
Unfortunately

372
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,060
I saw this incident accidentally

373
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,180
Then he came to me

374
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,020
He said I just had to keep silent.

375
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,020
After he takes office

376
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,580
He will do his best to support me as a director

377
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,740
Are you saying that Yuanxiao's father is also involved?

378
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,140
The conditions Lin Jianyang offered me were too tempting for me.

379
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,740
I promise

380
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,820
I justify myself

381
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,840
Anyway, this is not what I did.

382
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,100
none of my business

383
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,500
But I was wrong

384
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,900
These 8 years

385
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,220
I just think of this

386
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,540
I feel very guilty.

387
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,020
I'm not a good mother

388
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,460
I am between pursuing my dream and family

389
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,580
I chose to pursue my dream

390
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,020
I'm not a good person either.

391
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,580
Just because I pursued my dream

392
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,140
I chose silence

393
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,460
I did something I shouldn't have done

394
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,440
These things are over.

395
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,520
You don't have to blame yourself too much.

396
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,320
Mother

397
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,820
I'm afraid of getting you into trouble.

398
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,180
especially

399
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,740
I'm so cold to you

400
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,980
I just don't want you to be drawn into such a dirty world.

401
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,300
Lin Jianyang has recently started to take revenge

402
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,960
You and Gu Zhijun

403
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,860
I know too many of his secrets.

404
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,420
He won't let you go.

405
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,080
We won't be afraid of him.

406
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,460
Even if Lin Jinyang really wants to do something to me

407
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,620
We won't give in easily.

408
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,780
Listen to your mother's advice

409
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,660
Leave with Gu Zhijun

410
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,460
City of Time

411
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,540
I'm here to commemorate your father.

412
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,780
But if it's for your safety

413
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,260
I believe he will support me in giving up this movie

414
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,640
I disagree

415
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,260
Mom, I actually accepted your choice many years ago.

416
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,540
I think it's great that you work hard for your dreams.

417
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,460
Now the dream has been hindered a little bit

418
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,480
All we can do is overcome obstacles

419
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,780
How could you give up so easily?

420
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,540
I've lost your dad.

421
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,140
I can't lose you again

422
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,060
I can't let you take these risks again.

423
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,220
Justice can defeat all evil people with bad intentions.

424
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
We must fight him to the end

425
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,420
Let him receive the punishment he deserves

426
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,940
We are a family

427
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,820
Family together

428
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,700
There is nothing that cannot be overcome

429
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,380
we are Family

430
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,640
I promise you

431
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,500
I don't escape

432
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,580
We realize our dreams.

433
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,740
Do you know why I came to you?

434
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,720
Mr. Lin, I really don't know

435
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,060
Is there something you want me to do?

436
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,860
Your hidden rules about Qian'er

437
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,620
It was designed by Gu Chijun.

438
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,500
The reason why Li Qianer is so miserable

439
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,340
All thanks to Gu Zhijun

440
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,060
Right? No

441
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,000
no

442
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,540
Mr. Lin, I didn't understand.

443
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Wasn't this arranged by you?

444
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,040
What does it have to do with that Gu Gu Zhijun?

445
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,180
What if I say it matters?

446
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,080
Lin

447
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,580
What do you mean?

448
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,140
I want you and Li Qian'er to tell all the media

449
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,060
You were used by Gu Zhijun

450
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,940
Li Qianer was framed by Gu Jianjian

451
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:28,099
All of this is because of Gu Zhijun, a hypocritical hypocrite, who instigated

452
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,379
That's why Li Qian'er has such a tragic fate today.

453
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,779
This is unfounded.

454
00:34:33,998 --> 00:34:35,698
Will the media believe me?

455
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,899
Besides, Li Qianer hates me now.

456
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,779
He won't see me.

457
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:42,818
No review, no evidence

458
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:45,938
Look what this is

459
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,860
Transfer Application

460
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,420
That's right

461
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,840
After Li Qianer experienced this scandal

462
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,820
Popularity plummets

463
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,980
Now I can't get a single notification.

464
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,400
I heard his parents were in a car accident and are in the intensive care unit.

465
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,340
I'm about to lose money.

466
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,960
I will find him the best doctor.

467
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,380
The best equipped hospital

468
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,540
you say

469
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,700
Will he agree?

470
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,340
As for you

471
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Owe those gambling words in Macau casino

472
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,940
I'll put the money directly on your card.

473
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,620
How to make the media continue to believe in you as a director

474
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,820
I'm afraid I don't need to teach you.

475
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,020
Hahaha I know I know

476
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,260
Mr. Lin, don't worry. Don't worry.

477
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,140
Think about it carefully

478
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,780
Mr. Lin, take care

479
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,980
Mr. Lin, take care

480
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,100
With this

481
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,300
Hahaha

482
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,120
ha

483
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,600
In fact, the manipulator behind the whole thing is Gu Shijun.

484
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,820
It turned out to be Gu Shijun

485
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,540
how could it be possible

486
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,800
Why is Wang Dao Gu Shijun?

487
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,380
Please give a reasonable explanation

488
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,700
At that time, Gu Shijun had just returned to China

489
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,540
I fell in love with Li Qianer

490
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,580
Gu Zhijun wants to take advantage of him

491
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,820
But was rejected by Li Qianer

492
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,540
So Gu Chijun became angry and ashamed.

493
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,620
Said he wanted to teach Li Qianer a lesson

494
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,660
and I

495
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,820
In order to let Gu Chijun take pictures of my relatives

496
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,260
Also promised

497
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,540
Help him fix it.

498
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,500
So the so-called scandal

499
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,140
It's all the stubborn army behind the scenes.

500
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,120
Miss Li, what Director Wang said just now is true

501
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,900
Does Story King really have any immoral demands on you?

502
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,060
this matter

503
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,800
The damage to Li Qianer was too great.

504
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,100
His career is not developing now.

505
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,940
I don't have money to take care of my parents.

506
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,700
What about the Stubborn Army?

507
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,580
After using me, he kicked me away

508
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,020
I have to take all the blame.

509
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,420
Li Qianer and I have a tragic day

510
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,920
This is all caused by the stubborn army.

511
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,240
Director Wang, are you saying that all this was done by Mr. Gu Zhijun?

512
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,500
Do you have evidence?

513
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,320
This is right.

514
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,000
Is there any evidence?

515
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,700
It is the hotel check-in form

516
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,540
It clearly shows that Bush's army was manipulating everything in the hotel that day.

517
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,700
What does a hotel check-in certificate represent?

518
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,260
Bush's army obviously has its own apartment

519
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,740
But he happened to open the same hotel as us on that day.

520
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,040
Don't you think this is too much of a coincidence?

521
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,720
Seems like a coincidence?

522
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,900
How is this possible?

523
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,700
If you still don't believe it

524
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,940
I can ask one more person to come up.

525
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,780
Who is it? Mr. Liu, there is a witness.

526
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,460
Who took this photo?

527
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,660
Hello, thanks

528
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,940
This is Mr. Liu Zhongsen, the former stylist of the Stubborn Army.

529
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,780
He has been with the Stubborn Army for a long time.

530
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,340
Followed from Hollywood to China

531
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,700
He can prove that the stubborn army has always had bad intentions towards Li Qianer

532
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,100
And hold a grudge

533
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,720
I can prove it

534
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,800
What about Gu Zhijun?

535
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,740
He showed interest in Li Qianer more than once

536
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,800
Moreover, he repeatedly asked me to ask Li Qianer out in the name of styling.

537
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,860
But I never agreed once.

538
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,680
In fact, apart from these things

539
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,120
There are many things that you media don't know.

540
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,920
Where is the storyteller?

541
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,080
He thinks he understands fashion.

542
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,020
I'm very picky about clothes.

543
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,360
And the story man

544
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,160
When I have nothing to do, I like to secretly read magazines like Playboy.

545
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,980
oops

546
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,100
Mantou, you say

547
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,640
Actually, Mr. Liu said this

548
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,940
I also know a thing or two

549
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,180
It's just that we are all public figures

550
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,980
It's not convenient to say

551
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,740
some things

552
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,260
Today's press conference

553
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,500
Just here first

554
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,620
thank you all

555
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,840
ah

556
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,740
Speak slowly, what are you saying?

557
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,700
The Weibo posts are all about Gu Chijun's behavior of taking advantage of Li Qian

558
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,700
And let Wang Dao take the blame

559
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,580
Are you kidding me?

560
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,540
This is totally fake news

561
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,060
Let me take a look first

562
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,140
Gucci is just the king's hidden rule Li Qianer

563
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,580
The former model is personally testified

564
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,540
Hey, you psychos.

565
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,140
This is clearly Lin Jianyang's doing.

566
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,220
How could the three of them get together?

567
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,380
OK, I know.

568
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,720
Zhijunzhi

569
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,000
military

570
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,380
Hey Zhijun

571
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,860
I heard

572
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,540
Li Qier doesn't have that much ability

573
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,780
It can shock so many media

574
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,880
It must be that person

575
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,820
You said Lin Xinya

576
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,900
except him

577
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,680
I can't imagine anyone else wanting to fuck me

578
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,380
Chi Jing, should we avoid her?

579
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,080
The set must be full of fakes now.

580
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,100
The basics are no longer needed

581
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,620
A piece of fake news can't do anything to me

582
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,580
The most important thing now is to shoot the City of Time well.

583
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,180
Don't worry, I will take good care of this matter.

584
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,060
Hello Zhao Xiaoxuan Chenbu

585
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,100
You didn't work today.

586
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,780
Why didn't you help fabricate the stubborn army scandal?

587
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,380
What does it mean that the company prohibits you from expressing any opinions on the Tenth Army incident?

588
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,280
The 10th Army has not been reviewed yet.

589
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,580
The company certainly has an obligation to maintain his image

590
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,180
What

591
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,800
What does the above mean?

592
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,180
You can't make the decision
