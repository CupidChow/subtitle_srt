1
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,540
The pain of time continues

2
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,620
Long look

3
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,300
Skin is still as white as blood

4
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,720
This is the last medicine Director Liu used before he fell into a coma yesterday.

5
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,960
I always feel like there's something wrong

6
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,780
Could you please check it?

7
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,660
OK, I'll ask the garden department to check it for you.

8
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,100
Thank you

9
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,180
Didn't we already talk about Yuanxiao?

10
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,940
Director Liu has been using this medicine.

11
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,700
It's been several years

12
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,460
Why are you still worried?

13
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,940
I have to come to the hospital specially.

14
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,540
That's why I'm worried.

15
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,300
Since I have been using this medicine for several years

16
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,020
It proves that the effect is still good

17
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,820
Why did it suddenly get worse last night?

18
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,680
And the doctor said Director Liu has had this disease for more than ten years.

19
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,560
He couldn't be unaware of the effect aspirin had on his condition.

20
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,320
How can we take in so much?

21
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,400
Also, when I saw this bottle of medicine yesterday, it was on the ground.

22
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,840
It can be seen that this bottle of medicine was still in Director Liu's hand at the last moment before he fell into a coma.

23
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,280
Aspirin asthma is another condition that can be triggered quickly.

24
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,580
So I think there is a problem

25
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,260
Unexpectedly, the assistant also has the ability to be Sherlock Holmes

26
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,780
I hope I'm overthinking.

27
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,580
It's just that Director Liu is so sick

28
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,580
How to deal with the small Yuanxiao

29
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,940
We are so busy filming.

30
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,860
There will inevitably be negligence in care

31
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,780
I have contacted his mother's sister.

32
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,360
You can let Xiao Yuanxiao stay there for the next few days.

33
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,480
We should just spend more time with her.

34
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,420
What do you think

35
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,940
That's all we can do for now.

36
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,060
Thank you so much for yesterday.

37
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,620
You let me sleep in the bed but you slept on the sofa all night

38
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,900
what is this

39
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,340
This is just a gentleman's self-cultivation

40
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,640
Xiaofei, um

41
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,840
I came up with an idea

42
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,800
What idea

43
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,420
Since it is certain that the person Shi Jun truly loves is you,

44
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,320
I think we need to take action next.

45
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,860
Take it down in a flash

46
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,660
what does it mean

47
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,580
Don't you happen to have a scene together today?

48
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,000
After the filming, you will hand him over to a meeting room.

49
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,100
I sneaked out to find a lock

50
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,020
Lock you guys outside like this

51
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,340
Sister Xiaofei, when the time comes, you can fully display your feminine charm

52
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,800
A man and a woman alone in a room

53
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,460
Dry wood and raging fire hahahaha oops

54
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,500
What kind of privateness is this?

55
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,380
How much it affects my image in the minds of mushroom eaters.

56
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
Hey, don't you know?

57
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,840
Men are born with a desire to conquer

58
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,060
The woman is too active and the man loses the desire to conquer her

59
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,340
Besides, how could I do such a shameful thing as actively seducing someone?

60
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,380
Um, I'm telling you

61
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,760
Have you ever talked about love?

62
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,300
Do you have emotional intelligence?

63
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,860
So what should we do?

64
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,060
How to do it

65
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,300
Of course it's playing hard to get

66
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,820
Rejection

67
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,180
I want to say it but I don't know what to say

68
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,540
Passive, you know?

69
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
Women are responsible for seduction

70
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,620
Men are responsible for confession

71
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:50,940
I just want to show my fresh, refined, shy and hazy aura

72
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,820
Just wait for the surprise to come to me.

73
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,420
Hey, Miss Xiaofei

74
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,260
Eat Jin Ge

75
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Why

76
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,780
Why

77
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,620
Sister, are you okay?

78
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,679
Sister, are you okay?

79
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:38,779
Nothing, I just came into the company and had an encounter

80
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,220
It's such a coincidence.

81
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:45,180
But I just saw that Shi Jun didn't react to you.

82
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,220
What do you know?

83
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,280
Although he pretended to be calm on the surface

84
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,180
In fact, I don't know how excited I am.

85
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,900
I have to think about what to do next.

86
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,620
Let's go to the scene.

87
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,360
such

88
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Where has Xiaoshun been these days? I can't reach you even if I call you.

89
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,580
I'm so worried about you.

90
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm really sorry.

91
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,320
Yesterday, during the Lantern Festival, my father had an asthma attack and was sent to the hospital

92
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,920
He was the only one left, so I stayed with him all night because I was afraid he would be scared.

93
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,100
My phone just ran out of battery so I made you worry.

94
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,100
As long as you're okay,

95
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,320
Xu Zhen, the special effects manager, said there is a problem with a scene and wants you to go take a look.

96
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,780
Xiao Xiu, I'll go over there first.

97
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,620
Xiaozhen, don't forget to charge your phone. Got it.

98
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,940
Kobayashi

99
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,940
Why are you looking for Xu Zhen again?

100
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,340
I don't care what your feelings are towards Xu Zhen

101
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,220
It's work time

102
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Please restrain your behavior

103
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,220
Gu Shijun, you repeatedly stopped me from seeing Xu Zhen

104
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,020
Don't you think you're funny?

105
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,780
I didn't want to tell you before

106
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,520
But I have to remind you now

107
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,740
You and Xu Zhen are just working people.

108
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,740
But I've known him since I was 6 years old

109
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,700
When we were little, we would go home together after school.

110
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,860
On weekends we go to the playground together

111
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,880
One time his schoolbag was lost.

112
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,100
These are the two people I accompanied him home to meet.

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,420
So I am the only one who knows his past happiness and unhappiness

114
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,540
And I will bear all his future happiness and unhappiness.

115
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,900
More than just business

116
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,860
Please don't tell me these boring reasons anymore.

117
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,560
goodbye

118
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,640
Xiao Fei, um

119
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,460
Why does Brother Chi Jun care so much about Xu Zhen's assistant?

120
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,060
I saw him and Xiaolin quarreling over him several times.

121
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,100
Oh my god

122
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,780
Do you think Brother Chi Jun also likes him?

123
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,100
Of course not.

124
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,060
It's possible that Lin Qiqiu likes him

125
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,880
How could a star with such a big story like such a frivolous assistant?

126
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,340
Not always

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Didn't you notice?

128
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,020
When they came into the company this morning, they were wearing exactly the same clothes as yesterday.

129
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,740
Did the two of them shut up last night?

130
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,180
Don't do it

131
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,300
Ouch

132
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,580
Oh, I'm jealous.

133
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,600
envy

134
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,180
How could I, Master Gu, be jealous?

135
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,740
I can't do such a childish thing.

136
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,640
Gu Shijun

137
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,420
Did you spend last night at Director Liu's house?

138
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,900
What's going on between you and the town?

139
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,220
That's right

140
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,020
oh

141
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,540
Someone who has been good friends with Xu Zhen since he was 6 years old

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,860
But that didn't tell you that we had

143
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,460
oops

144
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,700
After all, my relationship with him

145
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,340
You can't just tell others casually.

146
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,900
Didn't you just say

147
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,740
Do you want to be responsible for Xu Zhen and the future?

148
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,060
Didn't you ask him if he was willing?

149
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,020
It's not your own wishful thinking.

150
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,980
childish

151
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,460
What's wrong with me being childish?

152
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,620
I like it, I am happy, I am happy

153
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,980
Okay, I will modify it according to the data Xiao Xu gave me.

154
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,000
Then leader, I will go first

155
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,460
Okay, go get busy.

156
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,660
Leader, I'll go back first.

157
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,140
Xu Zhen, wait a minute.

158
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,680
Um

159
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,140
This is for you.

160
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,860
what is this

161
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,500
Well

162
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:05,420
The store called me and told me that there is a size 37.

163
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,780
I got a pair for you.

164
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,780
thanks Mom

165
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,340
What are you holding?

166
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,060
Try this shoe, it's not OK

167
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,220
Just right

168
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,640
Thank you, mom

169
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,180
I guess I need to treat you to 10 more skewers before I can thank you.

170
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,820
I don't want to carry another drunk home.

171
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,900
too heavy

172
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,020
These media are really good at making up stories now.

173
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,700
I just went to the solo exhibition with Gu Chijun

174
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,460
In other words, we should do our homework according to the wishes of the two parties.

175
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,180
What did they write as a result?

176
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,420
Talking about love through drama

177
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,660
This is ridiculous. These are just trivial matters.

178
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,700
No need to work so hard

179
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,460
I thought that this matter would be cleared up by the innocent.

180
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,260
But I didn't expect them to report this again and again.

181
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,900
Some time ago, I was reported to have agreed to a job with the president of a multinational corporation.

182
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,620
She said she was going to get married at the end of the year.

183
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,600
I told that person clearly that there is no possibility between us

184
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,780
In the end, they still exaggerated and wrote a lot of nonsense.

185
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,900
Reports bring attention

186
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,020
The thing that artists fear most is not scandals

187
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,820
No one cares about you at all

188
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,420
The media is paying so much attention to you now, which shows that you really deserve the title of the dark queen.

189
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,060
Isn't this good?

190
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,540
But Jinyang I don't want to be the number one sister of Gaia

191
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,260
I just want to have a life like an ordinary person

192
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,180
Marry and have children

193
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,300
Live a down-to-earth life

194
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,500
This life in the spotlight

195
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,620
Many people are envious but can't catch up

196
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,380
You still want to be an ordinary person

197
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,920
But I understand

198
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,060
But we all have our own responsibilities now.

199
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,980
Not yet

200
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,280
goodbye

201
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,820
Don't be so childish.

202
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,520
you

203
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,780
Oh, such a small thing

204
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,560
I have to go and get busy.

205
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,100
Let me take you back to your apartment first.

206
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,380
We'll have dinner here another day.

207
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,460
What's wrong? Is there something wrong with the company?

208
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,420
It's not a private matter

209
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,999
Xiaolin, I think confession is

210
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:24,419
Don't let your heart rate

211
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:26,358
You must be able to plan ahead

212
00:17:26,358 --> 00:17:27,538
Great accumulation leads to great success

213
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:31,020
But now the follower next to Xiaozhen is pestering him every day

214
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,860
Yesterday, the two of them spent the whole night with a child.

215
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,580
I'm really worried if this continues.

216
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,440
No, no, no, Mr. Kobayashi

217
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,360
I think

218
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,200
At this time, you have to be more resolute.

219
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,980
You mustn't confess to him.

220
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,600
You have to make sure your opponent can't guess what you are thinking.

221
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,480
Let him force himself to confess

222
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,580
Wasn't he rejected for taking a step too far?

223
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,020
If you marry the lady like this, won't you be the only one left by her side?

224
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,840
By that time

225
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,140
You confess your true feelings to him again.

226
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,340
Did you two just naturally get together?

227
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,760
What if he confessed first?

228
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,060
I really accepted it

229
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,180
What to do then

230
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,760
It's better not to do so

231
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,000
I also think that you should never confess easily.

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,620
Mr. Xiaolin, haven't you heard a saying?

233
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,520
Confession is the clarion call of final victory

234
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,580
Rather than launching an attack

235
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,120
A casual confession only gives you one more chance to be rejected.

236
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,300
Xiaolin, you must be careful.

237
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,180
Why

238
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,840
I have different thoughts about confession.

239
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,220
Confession can promote the relationship between two people

240
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
If two people are in an ambiguous relationship and one of them takes the initiative first,

241
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
This shows that this relationship can turn the tide

242
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,900
The effect of resurrection

243
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,260
The reason why you usually fail in confession is definitely because of one of the following reasons

244
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,060
First, the hardware itself is not up to standard

245
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,920
Like our Mr. Kobayashi

246
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,440
This height, this appearance

247
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,720
This is the background

248
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,220
Can you not pass?

249
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,420
Yes, yes, that's right.

250
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,660
Second, the software itself is not up to standard

251
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,700
What's the meaning

252
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,460
In other words, the emotional foundation for the girl is not solid.

253
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,760
Like our Mr. Kobayashi

254
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,300
With our Miss Xu

255
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,640
A mutual understanding

256
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,440
Childhood sweethearts spend every day together

257
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,400
Can this feeling be unreliable?

258
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,800
Absolutely reliable

259
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,380
Absolutely qualified

260
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,780
So you want me to confess now?

261
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,720
Of course, the third one is a bad way to confess.

262
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,780
It is the direct cause of the failure of the confession.

263
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,420
So I have already thought of a perfect way to express my love for you.

264
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,280
I'm so mad. I'm so mad.

265
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,220
Our rival company has robbed us of our cash again.

266
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,020
When did this news come out?

267
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,300
It's over. It's over.

268
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,780
I'm going to be scolded by my boss again at work

269
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,660
Zhang Shiyu also said that she would send me private photos from Story Circle

270
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,040
It's okay if I don't post one

271
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,460
I lost this opportunity in vain.

272
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,580
Zhang Shiyu

273
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,800
Hello Miss Wei, I am Zhang Shiyu

274
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,240
I'm downstairs in your house now

275
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,800
I want to ask if you have time?

276
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Don't mention it. I'm not free today.

277
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm not free later

278
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,480
I'm not free tomorrow.

279
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm not free the day after tomorrow.

280
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,240
No time next week

281
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,340
I'm not free next month.

282
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,140
Don't look for me again.

283
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,780
wait wait wait wait

284
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,800
what does it mean

285
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,640
busy today

286
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,440
No time tomorrow

287
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,220
I don't have time in my life

288
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,980
Why is Xiaolin here?

289
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,320
Flowers and balloons

290
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,100
There are also fireworks confession

291
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,220
To whom?

292
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,500
Surrounding Mountains

293
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,260
No

294
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,020
Shen Qingyan

295
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,260
Xiaolin doesn't look like him.

296
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,420
Xu Zhen

297
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,180
OK, Mr. Xiaolin is so romantic.

298
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,100
oops

299
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,260
But don't worry

300
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,880
I am Zhang Shiyu here

301
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,460
I will definitely not let you confess successfully

302
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,100
Wow, boss Gu, why don't you answer the phone at this time?

303
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,980
Answer the phone. Answer the phone. Answer the phone.

304
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,840
My mother

305
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,100
The balloons on both sides are now laid out OK

306
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,440
The most important thing is that the word "O" is a little small.

307
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,880
I want to make it a little bit bigger. You see, that line looks a bit like 0 or something.

308
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,980
Not a good look

309
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,820
And the petals are a little short. Can you ask him to add a little more to each place?

310
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,020
Ah, boss, please answer the phone. If you don't answer it, Mr. Xu will run away with someone.

311
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,660
Make this a little bigger.

312
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,900
Don't pile the balls too high and try to roll them evenly.

313
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,420
Oh, and let the brothers set off one more firework on each pier on the shore.

314
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,920
You must seize the opportunity

315
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,560
The moment I saw the town meet, I lit it up again

316
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,540
Don't leave. Don't worry about it.

317
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,860
Hey, you must create a very romantic atmosphere for me, please

318
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,540
Basically there is nothing else to do. It should be easy. Just wait until dark.

319
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,220
Boss, please answer the phone.

320
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,180
It's almost dark.

321
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,360
Xiao Yuanxiao, are you staying at your sister's house these days?

322
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,380
There are two other brothers and sisters in my sister's family. They will definitely be very happy to see you.

323
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
Sister Kiki

324
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,600
Your shoes are so nice

325
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,300
When did you buy it?

326
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,820
Someone gave it to me.

327
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,100
Was it sent by the chicken brother?

328
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,760
My mother didn't buy it for me.

329
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,140
I thought who likes it? My sister gave it to me.

330
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,020
Come here

331
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,140
be careful

332
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,040
Hello

333
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,140
Thank you, Boss, for answering the call

334
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,820
Hello, my phone was on silent just now, so I didn't hear you. What's wrong, boss?

335
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:35,060
Well, I have seen students but the situation may not be very good now.

336
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,720
Never mind. I can't help it. Just look at mine.

337
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,620
Arrange it

338
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,440
Xiao Juan

339
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,080
Xiao Juan

340
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,480
Wei Shan

341
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,920
Wei Shan

342
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,580
I like you very much

343
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,340
Please promise to be my girlfriend.

344
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,740
Sister Qishan, are you watching the fireworks?

345
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,840
Wei Shan, did you see it?

346
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,080
These balloons

347
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,620
Flowers and fireworks are prepared for you

348
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,660
Although they are beautiful

349
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,180
But it will never be 1/10,000 of yours

350
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,180
So you must promise me today

351
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,860
Be my girlfriend

352
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,340
otherwise

353
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,780
I can't kneel down anymore.

354
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,540
Oh, Boss Gu, Boss Gu is so tired.

355
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,980
Sister, what do you mean by a vegetable?

356
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,060
Why are you asking this question suddenly?

357
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,060
I went from being told that my father had turned into a vegetable

358
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,760
Dad is a human being, not a plant.

359
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,780
Why do they say that?

360
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,540
Sister, do you think dad will never wake up?

361
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,660
Of course not.

362
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,040
Lantern Festival

363
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,780
The winter here is very warm.

364
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,400
But it's far away

365
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,340
Winter is very cold

366
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,200
Trees, flowers, and grass will shed all their leaves and enter hibernation.

367
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,180
This way they can grow again when the weather gets better next year.

368
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,800
Yuanxiao's father is the same

369
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
He is usually very tired from work.

370
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,320
So you need to take a break for a while

371
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,000
Just like plants hibernate

372
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,940
He will wake up naturally after he has rested.

373
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,700
Sister Qu Zhen

374
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,680
Is what you said true

375
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,360
Wait until daddy has had enough sleep

376
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,260
Then he will wake up and come to me again, right?

377
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,860
Will my father wake up in the spring?

378
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,700
How long is spring now?

379
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,380
Good morning, teacher.

380
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,900
Okay, bye.

381
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,640
Come bridesmaids

382
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,840
Xiao Yuanxiao, go to school quickly

383
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,920
Brother and sister will come to pick you up in the evening

384
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,580
Sister, well, my father used to kiss me every day when he sent me to school.

385
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,860
Come on Lantern Festival

386
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,980
I'll give you a kiss for your dad.

387
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,780
Go to school now

388
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,060
Bye-Bye

389
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,820
Such a young age, but you are already bad.

390
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,420
let's go

391
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,980
According to our inspection results,

392
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,660
This does contain a lot of aspirin mixture.

393
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,060
Beta-thaw is a common drug used to treat asthma.

394
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,460
Now since there is a lot of aspirin mixed in

395
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,820
This situation is indeed a bit rebellious.

396
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,300
It seems that Director Liu's medicine was indeed tampered with.

397
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,580
But who could this person be?

398
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,780
I'm sorry

399
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,860
Have we met somewhere?

400
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,040
Boss, I think of someone.

401
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,220
I want to take half a day off to confirm whether it is that person.

402
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,860
I will go with you

403
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,780
Lan Ting, your dress is so beautiful

404
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,900
Did you buy it with Xiaozhen last time?

405
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,340
Yes, Xiaozhen also said that my dress looks good.

406
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,180
Later, we went to have dinner

407
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,500
Very happy

408
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,420
Like I said.

409
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,380
There is no knot between parents and children that cannot be untied

410
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,480
Xiao is a good kid

411
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,180
He will definitely understand your hard work over the years.

412
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,380
Haha, just like when I was young

413
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,980
Relatives are very tall

414
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,220
Always want to make a career

415
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,060
War and War

416
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,380
To succeed

417
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,100
But as I get older

418
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,380
Feel the life

419
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,160
More and more fragile

420
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,320
No matter how much you have achieved

421
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,900
But in this world

422
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,560
It's so small and meaningless. Once you leave

423
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,020
Eventually it became a bubble

424
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,980
Cherish the friends around you.

425
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,940
At least it leaves precious memories.

426
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,060
Hey Zhao He

427
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,500
Have you encountered anything recently?

428
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,220
Why so many emotions?

429
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,460
No.

430
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,300
Do you know the artist director Liu Weicheng?

431
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,300
Well, he and I are a bit older.

432
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,980
This person is very down-to-earth.

433
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,180
There is a way to do things

434
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,300
This is the one that I think the management is optimistic about.

435
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,620
But suddenly I received the news yesterday

436
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,020
He said he had an asthma attack.

437
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,740
Sent to hospital for emergency treatment

438
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,220
After a day of rescue, he still didn't wake up

439
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,260
do not know either

440
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,780
Can you wake up?

441
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,540
Everyone already knows that Director Liu has asthma.

442
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,220
It has been well controlled for so many years.

443
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,020
Why did it suddenly get worse?

444
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,240
I don't know either

445
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,700
I heard that I smelled it in my own home.

446
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,640
Fortunately, the rescue was timely

447
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,900
Otherwise, you will lose your life.

448
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,020
Hey, Liu Weicheng is the most capable person under Jinyang

449
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,140
His illness

450
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,660
His position

451
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,060
Who will take over temporarily?

452
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,460
Why

453
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,740
Wan Ting, are you okay?

454
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,220
It's ok, waiter.

455
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,420
Quick

456
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,260
Are you okay? It's okay.

457
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,460
That day, the building where Mr. Liu lived did have a car parked.

458
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,420
But it's only a few minutes.

459
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,340
Uh, maybe someone closed the floodgates as a prank.

460
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,900
After we received the response, we dealt with it quickly.

461
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,440
Since the sluice gate is not inside the building

462
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,380
So we didn't send anyone to repair it.

463
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,820
Please take a seat, both of you.

464
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,940
I'll pour you two a glass of water.

465
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,380
Oh, no need

466
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,980
Please think about it carefully.

467
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
Is a young man

468
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,900
Wear your property's uniform

469
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,840
That's probably this high.

470
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,260
Eyebrows are very dark

471
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:14,059
Very thin and clean

472
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,860
The whole person looks a little gloomy

473
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:21,139
Oh, you mean Xiao Wu, right?

474
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,259
Tall and handsome

475
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,499
Not very talkative

476
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:26,598
Oh, yes, yes, it's him.

477
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,939
Manager, do you know his information?

478
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,979
What's your name, where do you live, etc.

479
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,320
He's just a temporary worker.

480
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,020
That was his first day at work.

481
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,779
I thought he looked pretty energetic, so I let him try.

482
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,420
I was thinking

483
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,279
Fill in the information after Lu You

484
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,020
Who knew he would quit after working for just one day? Look at this piece of clothing, it's still his socks.

485
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,780
I remember

486
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,880
He was the chef at the restaurant where Jinyang and Xiaoxiu took me to eat steak that day.

487
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,580
Let's go check out that steak house.

488
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,020
He left before the probation period ended.

489
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,580
I don't know exactly where I live.

490
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,500
But one time I was in Jinhua Community and I saw him. He should live nearby.

491
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,340
Why don't you go look for it over there?

492
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,860
Thank you, Bao, I'm happy

493
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,080
The property can't provide any information

494
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,980
I asked for a long time but didn't get any useful information.

495
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,980
This neighborhood is quite big.

496
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,580
There are quite a lot of residents

497
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,820
And there is no intersection between them

498
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,060
So I think it’s more difficult

499
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,240
If there are no clues today,

500
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,660
Let's look for it another day, okay?

501
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,980
That's Xu Zhen.

502
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,900
ah

503
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,180
Xu Zhen, are you okay?

504
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,500
Boss, this is already the 10th lap. I'm dizzy. Stop shaking.

505
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,580
Hey, doctor, is the patient's injury really not a big deal?

506
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,340
His legs hurt so badly.

507
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,780
I have explained it to you very clearly.

508
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,060
From the C machine

509
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,340
He has ruled out any fractures.

510
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,140
It's probably a soft tissue contusion.

511
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,980
So go home and take a rest

512
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,460
Apply cold compresses for 24 hours and then heat to reduce swelling

513
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,500
Besides, I will prescribe some medicine for him.

514
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,380
Just remember to apply the medicine on time when you get home.

515
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,260
The patient is not right.

516
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,900
Does the doctor really not need to check again?

517
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,640
It is said that it takes 100 days to heal a broken bone

518
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,740
Do you need a plaster cast for him?

519
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,300
Or give him a cane.

520
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,380
Or leave a message and observe for a few days

521
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,440
I have explained it to you very clearly.

522
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,860
The patient's symptoms are not serious.

523
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
After returning

524
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,660
Get out and exercise more

525
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,740
Hey Doctor

526
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,520
Doctor, I'm sorry to trouble you.

527
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,700
Doctor, remember to prescribe him anesthesia

528
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,220
please

529
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,900
Calm down

530
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,640
Don't make things difficult for the doctor.

531
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,620
It's not easy for others, isn't it?

532
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,660
Xu Zhi is sick now and needs to rest

533
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,020
Not convenient to meet outsiders

534
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,620
I'm not an outsider

535
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,580
And I have something important to say to him today.

536
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,140
Gu Da Ming Xing

537
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,780
Aren't you afraid?

538
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,780
If you are a man

539
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,300
Just give me this fair chance

540
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,820
We let Xu Zhen

541
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,620
Let him choose

542
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,380
Afraid

543
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,460
I will be afraid

544
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,280
ah

545
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Xiao Chen

546
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,320
How are you

547
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,460
Is the injury serious?

548
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,180
Oh, it's okay.

549
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,160
I was just hit by an electric car.

550
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,700
It's nothing serious. How did you get here?

551
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,060
I came this time

552
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,940
There are important words

553
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,500
I want to tell you

554
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,620
Xiaozhen

555
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,380
I like you

556
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,220
these days

557
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,940
I did a lot of stupid things

558
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,140
I found a lot of people

559
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,780
I have thought of many ways

560
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,620
Because I do not know

561
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,540
what should I do

562
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,900
To make you accept

563
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,660
boss

564
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,580
Image wake up

565
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,820
actually

566
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,460
The fireworks last night

567
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,100
I arranged it.

568
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,420
Because I don't know how to confess to you

569
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,500
Is the most sincere

570
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,580
The most romantic

571
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,860
But I just heard that you were injured.

572
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,580
I think that moment

573
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,420
My world stopped turning

574
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,740
Xiaozhen, I didn't understand it until now

575
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,660
I love someone

576
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,940
What's on your mind?

577
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,740
It's all unimportant

578
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,300
the most important

579
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,860
Treat each other with sincerity

580
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,220
so

581
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,060
I choose now

582
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,700
Tell you directly

583
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,660
I like you
