1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,700
The pain of time has

2
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,260
The crew 8 years ago

3
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,980
You Lin Jinyang

4
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,620
What happened between Yao Weicheng and

5
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,660
This matter has nothing to do with you

6
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,220
You don't really need to know

7
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,340
You've been following Xu Zhen.

8
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,700
Is it because of this incident?

9
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,620
During this time

10
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,620
I actively cooperate and participate in public relations work

11
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,980
Your incident with Xu Zhen did affect the crew.

12
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,980
That's why I hope Xu Zhen leaves.

13
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,580
Please let Lin Zong and Li Qian off the hook

14
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,660
He is still young after all.

15
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,100
Now his mother has been in a car accident

16
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,560
Lying in the hospital

17
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,260
He can't even afford the medical bills.

18
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,060
He has received enough education.

19
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,460
If this continues

20
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,640
His whole family will be ruined.

21
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,340
It turns out that Director Liu is so sympathetic

22
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,500
This is the first time I discovered

23
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,620
But I remember the tragic explosion 8 years ago

24
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,420
Mr. Wang was also attacked

25
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,320
I heard he's living a rough life now.

26
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,500
Very miserable

27
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,140
Why didn't I listen to Director Liu asking me to help him?

28
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,100
Is everything they say true?

29
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,460
Two years ago

30
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,420
In order to get the company

31
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,940
He asked Liu Weicheng to report the case out of loyalty.

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,660
At that time, I wanted to get the opportunity to be a director.

33
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,820
You knew it but didn't tell it

34
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,220
The choice between thoughts at that time

35
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,340
There's no way back now.

36
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,780
Whenever I think of this

37
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,340
I will feel very guilty

38
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,140
Lin Jingyang is a very scary person

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,780
He will definitely take action

40
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,220
He won't let this come to light.

41
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,060
perhaps

42
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,580
He may know about the existence of this recording.

43
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,700
So I think

44
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,780
Letting Xu Zhen leave the crew is the best protection for him

45
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,620
Xu Zhen doesn't know about the recording yet

46
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,620
Now he just wants to concentrate on making this movie

47
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,420
Take a good photo to complete his father's day

48
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,620
As Xu Zhen's boyfriend

49
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,740
I will protect him

50
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,580
Don't let him get hurt

51
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,580
Liang De, if you still love your daughter

52
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,260
I hope you don't follow him deliberately.

53
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,800
I want to be the first to jump to military power

54
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,160
Then you guys can show respect to me if you jump

55
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,060
Then we can only respect the charm of the blood wolf on your body. He didn't expect that

56
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,600
Am I tempting?

57
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,860
Kill the soldiers

58
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,700
Hey be careful

59
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,340
I'm so tired

60
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,840
Lantern Festival, here I come

61
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,020
Sister Zijin, I miss you so much

62
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,140
Hide

63
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,380
Do you know there is a saying that men and women should not touch each other

64
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,740
But I am very close to Sister Xuezhen.

65
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,120
Sister Yigen, I miss my dad.

66
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,580
Can you come with me to see my dad?

67
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,000
I want to draw the picture I drew in kindergarten today.

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,420
I share all the songs I write with my dad.

69
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,820
Yeah, that's it.

70
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,220
Chi Jun, I want to accompany you for Yuanxiao today

71
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,200
I'll go with you, yeah

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,300
I'm already very happy if you are willing to accompany me to kindergarten

73
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,320
What if you cause a stir in the hospital again?

74
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,940
I don't know whether I should take care of Yuanxiao or you.

75
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,100
Brother, didn't you just say that men and women shouldn't touch each other?

76
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,060
You still hold a grudge, eh?

77
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
Zhao He

78
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Zhao He

79
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,520
Oh

80
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,040
Bai Ting, I'm sorry. Since you said so, we will be late to keep you waiting.

81
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,140
It's okay. I'm willing to wait for you longer. Haha.

82
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,740
Here's this for you.

83
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,620
Why are you still like a young person? Hahaha, come on, come on, walk around.

84
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,820
Hey, the movie has already started, right?

85
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,180
Oh, it's halfway through.

86
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,500
Then let's not go. Just chat with me, okay? Hahaha

87
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,380
Last time

88
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,620
Xiaoxiu and I

89
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,820
Talking about integration companies

90
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,180
This child

91
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,660
Insist that I choose Jinyang

92
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,360
Why

93
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,420
So what do you think?

94
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,300
Why

95
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,100
I think Jinyang Integrated Company is indeed suitable

96
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,100
I'm also worried about handing the company over to him.

97
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,900
If we talk about simply managing the company

98
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,180
He is Xiaoxiu

99
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,420
Better but

100
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,100
When I think of what happened 8 years ago

101
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,460
Li Qianer's story

102
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,380
especially you

103
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,899
Liu Weicheng

104
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,700
Hey, a good person

105
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,980
Why suddenly

106
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,780
Asthma caused brain hypoxia and coma

107
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,820
My intuition tells me

108
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,380
Although on the surface this matter has nothing to do with the sword

109
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,300
But behind

110
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,740
I guess it's not that simple.

111
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,860
Why

112
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,960
Zhao He Actually, I know

113
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,860
I'm overthinking, right?

114
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,340
After all, they are all my sons and my own flesh and blood.

115
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,720
Why

116
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,760
But I found a girlfriend during the Jinyang period.

117
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,180
I feel it's ok

118
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,180
Clever

119
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,140
A generous future

120
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,060
It must be my neighbor's good wife

121
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,040
Hahaha ouch

122
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,740
I'm only now realizing this at my age

123
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,700
A large family

124
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,500
Family and beauty are the most important

125
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,660
Don't you think so, Wanting?

126
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,380
I don't know Miss

127
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,240
May I ask how the patients are doing recently?

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
When will he wake up?

129
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,600
Ah, the patient's condition has basically stabilized. It may take some time for him to wake up.

130
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,760
Moreover, Gaia's Lin Jingyang had instructed that the best medicine be used for treatment.

131
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,080
Gaia will cover all expenses

132
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,860
This is the first time I have met such a good boss in all my years in the hospital.

133
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,720
boss

134
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,140
God Xu is here again

135
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,480
Once upon a time there was a little girl

136
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,820
She is very cute

137
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,320
Lantern Festival

138
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,500
Sister, it would be nice if your little May Day dinosaur was here.

139
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,360
Then I can save what I say to my father every day

140
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,140
Play it for dad when he wakes up.

141
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,460
Okay, Sister Yuanxiao, please remember to bring him to you next time.

142
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,160
Anyone who sees him will like him.

143
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,020
A little girl's birthday

144
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,620
His grandmother gave him a little red hat made of a swan.

145
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,820
He wears

146
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,640
Especially suitable for overhead

147
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,540
From then on, everyone called him Little Red Riding Hood.

148
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,820
One day his mother

149
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,560
Xu Zhen

150
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,940
What are you looking for?

151
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,140
Chi Juan, have you ever seen my recording of Little Dinosaur?

152
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,740
I was clearly by your side, how come I can't find you all of a sudden?

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,180
Didn't I see you carrying it with you a few days ago?

154
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,380
Did you accidentally fall into the crew?

155
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,260
Oh, is there?

156
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,200
The key fell off

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,260
What should I do

158
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,100
It doesn't matter if it falls off, I'll give you a new one.

159
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,100
No, maybe I forgot where it is.

160
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,900
I'll go look for it in the crew right away.

161
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,660
The tragic explosion

162
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,700
Director Liu also participated

163
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,860
That's why you have gone from being a small clerk to where you are today.

164
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,460
Became the Artist Director of Gaia Entertainment

165
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,580
Director Du said based on our inspection results, it does contain a large amount of aspirin mixture.

166
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,820
I always think that Director Liu's matter is very strange

167
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,340
ah

168
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,420
That's the guy

169
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,720
Why

170
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,920
stop

171
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,740
Okay, I know.

172
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,080
pay tribute

173
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,380
The company's internal information makes the chairman's friendship important for you to get promoted and close to your own life

174
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,820
Mr. Gu, do you have an appointment?

175
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,740
Mr. Lin, I already know

176
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,700
This is none of your business.

177
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,500
You go down first.

178
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,900
Mr. Guo must have something important to do when he comes to see me.

179
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,660
Recently, Xu Zhen

180
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,220
A lot of strange things happened

181
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,620
I think

182
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,100
Must it be related to this thing?

183
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,140
How much do you know

184
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,340
It doesn't matter how much I know

185
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,940
I'm not interested in your secrets.

186
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,940
I come here

187
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,620
I hope you promise me something.

188
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,580
Tell me the conditions

189
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,140
Tell me what the conditions are

190
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,020
I'll give this back to you.

191
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,700
I hope you can promise me

192
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,420
Don't hurt Xu Zhen

193
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,300
Mr. Gu is a smart man.

194
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,300
I can't think of a reason why I refused.

195
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,260
That's good

196
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,980
I hope you keep your word

197
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,580
Finally, one more word

198
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,900
Stop doing things that hurt others.

199
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,380
Otherwise I won't stand by and watch

200
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,180
It's never too late to turn back

201
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,760
I was really innocent in the last hotel incident.

202
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,840
Everything is understood and someone needs to be planned.

203
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,040
Please let Lin Zong and Li Qian off the hook

204
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,660
He is still young after all.

205
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,300
Now his mother has been in a car accident

206
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,760
Lying in the hospital

207
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,540
He can't even afford the medical bills.

208
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,260
If this continues

209
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,620
His whole family will be ruined.

210
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It turns out that Director Liu is such a compassionate person

211
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,180
But I remember

212
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,180
The quotation 8 years ago

213
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,260
in this world

214
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,140
Have you heard this recording?

215
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,020
Except for the two of us

216
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,420
There are two more people

217
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,460
Liu Weicheng is still lying in the hospital with no sign of waking up.

218
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,900
As for Gu Chijun

219
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,380
He was really careless.

220
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,820
Careless enough to expose one's weaknesses to others so easily

221
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,820
For Xu Zhen

222
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,060
He can't escape my control.

223
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,440
Defending champion Hengcheng

224
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,240
Amputation

225
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,260
Everything is on hold

226
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,500
Do you understand?

227
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,220
Sorry, there's nothing to say.

228
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,500
sorry Sorry

229
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,320
Mr. Liu

230
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,260
You woke me up

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,400
Where am I?

232
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,620
You are in the hospital

233
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
Although your will is clear

234
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,200
But the body has not fully recovered yet

235
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Don't worry

236
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,960
I will notify the doctor right now to give you a comprehensive examination

237
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,160
take a good rest

238
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,580
Okay?

239
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,900
Sir, whose relative are you?

240
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,020
No, I must escape.

241
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,140
It must not fall into Lin Jiner's hands

242
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,260
Liu Weicheng has woken up

243
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,460
You give him enough money immediately

244
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,060
Let him leave this city forever

245
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,260
Never come back

246
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,840
Lin

247
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,380
Liu Weicheng ran away

248
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,940
I asked you how you could have let someone escape from under your nose.

249
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,180
OK OK

250
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,980
Now is not the time to pursue

251
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,680
Go to the kindergarten where Li Weicheng's son is

252
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,820
Get things done

253
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,300
Ha ha

254
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,020
Haha, it smells really good

255
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,940
Sister, sister, give you a kite

256
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,800
Can we both fly this kite high together?

257
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,740
The culprit is coming to Dad.

258
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,640
Dad, why are you here?

259
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,200
Are you feeling better

260
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,300
I miss you so much during Lantern Festival

261
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,880
Director Liu, when did you wake up?

262
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,580
How come I came to Lantern Festival wearing a hospital gown?

263
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,780
Let's go home

264
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,420
Hey

265
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,060
Come to learn from the Lantern Festival

266
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,760
Don't make trouble if you are afraid of Lantern Festival

267
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,740
We have to get out of here now.

268
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,640
What happened to Director Liu?

269
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,500
Where are you taking Yuanxiao to in such a hurry?

270
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Xu Zhen

271
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,300
Thank you for taking care of Yuanxiao during this period.

272
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,860
But for your own good

273
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,420
I advise you not to come near us again and be responsible

274
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,980
Sister Time Sister Time Mingxiu Goodbye

275
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,200
Don't be afraid to say what your father said

276
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,900
We will definitely meet again

277
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,500
Northeast

278
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,020
License plate number 2620

279
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,660
Get it back to me at any cost.

280
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,860
Xu Zhen, do you know how much he told Liu Weicheng?

281
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,620
Whether it is Xu Zhen or Liu Weicheng

282
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,140
I might report this to my dad.

283
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,400
So I won't allow this to happen.

284
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,500
Never allow

285
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,020
What about Guo Shujun?

286
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,380
Liu Weicheng is awake now

287
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,380
Gu Chijun is like a ignited bomb

288
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,060
It could explode at any time

289
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,420
so

290
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,300
I will never allow anyone to stand in my way of success.

291
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,660
Never allow

292
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,360
Um

293
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,620
Good for me Xu Chen

294
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,740
Thank you for taking care of Iwae during this period.

295
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,220
But for your own good

296
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,940
I advise you not to come near us again and be responsible

297
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,300
Brother Weicheng said

298
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,380
What exactly does that mean

299
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,540
I don't know where Yuanxiao is now.

300
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,480
Are you doing well, sister?

301
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,700
What are you mumbling about?

302
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,060
I finally got some rest today, so don't think too much.

303
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,020
Just relax for a while.

304
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,140
Hahahaha

305
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,940
Ha ha

306
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,980
Ha ha

307
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,060
Hahaha

308
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,780
Hey, put me down.

309
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,640
ah

310
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,860
Hahahahahaha

311
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,740
Ha ha

312
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:19,620
hahahahahahahaha

313
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,820
Ha ha

314
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,700
Hahahaha

315
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,620
Hahahaha

316
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,940
Is it interesting, sis?

317
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,980
Oh, we have almost finished shopping, why don't we go home now?

318
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,380
We didn't do anything wrong, so what are we afraid of?

319
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,840
Um

320
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,840
6-point direction

321
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,840
12-point direction

322
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,740
There are two more directions to go

323
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,020
Hahahahahahahahahahaha

324
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,100
Because I will be involved in the military, and you will also be secretly photographed by reporters.

325
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,080
I am such a failure as a sister. I don't mind.

326
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,700
I'm just an ordinary college student

327
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
Not a celebrity.

328
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,340
What are you afraid of?

329
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,020
As Gu Chijun's girlfriend, you are also a semi-public figure.

330
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,140
You have to pay attention to your image.

331
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,920
What happened to my image?

332
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,420
Wear sportswear every day

333
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,380
Are you going to hunt in the primeval forest anytime?

334
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,320
What are you talking about? You hit me. What are you two talking about?

335
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,120
Say it

336
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,500
Mmm delicious

337
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,060
You two still have the mood to eat noodles?

338
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Did you know that the photo of you two being secretly photographed in the supermarket has become a trending search?

339
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,660
So, you two have become Internet celebrities now.

340
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,780
It's unscientific that such an ugly photo can become popular

341
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,860
哎沈庆元

342
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,980
How could you eat alone while I was talking? If you don't eat it now, it will get cold.

343
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,160
Are you two mica-heads?

344
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,860
Such a rare opportunity

345
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,780
Listen to me, both of you.

346
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,420
From now on I will be your agent.

347
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,820
Um

348
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,480
Let's raise funds first

349
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,860
Not much, maybe 20 million.

350
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,300
Release an album first

351
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,780
Participate in a few more reality shows

352
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,900
Shoot a few more magazine covers

353
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,740
Well, none of the emotions of youth can be missing

354
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,880
In this way, you two siblings will go international

355
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,660
Become a winner in life

356
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,180
And I can lie down at home before going to bed.

357
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,060
Ha ha

358
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,660
No more scolding from the editor-in-chief

359
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,500
Hello, hello, hello

360
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,160
Did you two understand what I just said?

361
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,860
Yeah, I understand.

362
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,820
Hmm, very good

363
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,780
So let's start from now on.

364
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,480
First of all, I will give you two a strict training.

365
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,980
What about facial expressions and body language?

366
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,580
Weishan, you are too fast.

367
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,300
Oh, yeah, yeah

368
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,020
It's such a pity, Sister Wei Shan, it's such a pity

369
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,340
I made an appointment with my classmates to go camping

370
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,860
To write a paper

371
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,160
Well, I won't be back tonight.

372
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,580
Uh, I'm leaving first.

373
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,700
I support you spiritually.

374
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,620
Bye bye

375
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,100
Xiaoyuan is getting better and better

376
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,360
A wonderful agent career is looking forward to me

377
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,540
I'm so excited just thinking about it

378
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,340
I'm so tired. I finally finished shooting.

379
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,180
Take a look at my Prince Charming Shen Qingnian

380
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,200
Sister Xiaofei, you are browsing your friends circle and searching for his keywords on the Internet.

381
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,700
Don't you feel tired?

382
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,940
You don't understand what I see when I see the information of neurons

383
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,300
I will be resurrected with full blood

384
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,660
It's only been a few hours, Shen Qingran

385
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,460
It even became a hot search on Weibo

386
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,780
Return to the National Brother-in-law Shen Jinyan

387
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,660
What the hell? I even call him hubby. I've never called him that before.

388
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,620
Then check these IDs.

389
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,860
Block me all

390
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,380
Wow, it’s number one on the trending search list

391
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,540
Sister Xiaofei, you have a lot of rivals in love now.

392
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,780
Check Shen Qingyan's current location immediately

393
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,500
This is easy.

394
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,460
No matter where he goes now, he is surrounded by a group of fans taking pictures.

395
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,720
Yeah, I found it.

396
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,940
So fast huh

397
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,340
How can I make these girls give up on him?

398
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,580
Then the only way is to fly.

399
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,940
Hahaha

400
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,700
Shen Qingyan

401
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,660
Wait for me to rescue you.

402
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,840
Wow, Shen Qingyan is so handsome.

403
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,160
Shen Qingyan is so handsome haha

404
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,100
Look at these bird clavicles. They are so amazing.

405
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,620
Hahaha

406
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,740
Small-minded

407
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,900
I'm late

408
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,580
Who are you?

409
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,020
It's you

410
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,440
Hey, can we make our tent a little smaller?

411
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,700
In this way, you come close to me and I hug you

412
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,380
What? You hug me and I hug you.

413
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,300
Do you still want these women to stay away from you?

414
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,860
Oh, you look hot.

415
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,220
I really hate it

416
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,960
Forget it, let's just forget it.

417
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,320
What's the point of surrounding here?

418
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,620
Let's go

419
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,360
Let's go

420
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,580
Okay, okay.

421
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,900
Xiaofei, what are you doing here?

422
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,500
I'm here to chase you.

423
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,460
I can't stand my boyfriend being surrounded by these women.

424
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,500
Shen Qingyan, let me tell you

425
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,080
from now on

426
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,280
I will pursue you relentlessly every day

427
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,880
Anyway, I have plenty of time and means to make you go from hating me very much to hating me a little bit.

428
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,080
Finally, he fell in love with me and depended on me

429
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,000
Then fall in love with me

430
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,100
Hey, wait, I'm going to die of boredom

431
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,160
Which TV show is this from?

432
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,100
Hey, I'm telling the truth

433
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,500
Do you think I can remember the lines by now with my IQ?

434
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,740
Uh, are they looking for me to weigh the bill now?

435
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,060
Don't think you can get rid of me like this

436
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,580
oh oh

437
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,920
oh

438
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,140
Ahhhhh

439
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,820
Hahahaha wow wow

440
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,420
Go back to sleep haha

441
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,960
ha

442
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,439
Xiaofei

443
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,039
Xiaofei

444
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,199
Wake up

445
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:50,059
Drink so much

446
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:51,498
Gone Gone

447
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,298
Woke up

448
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,060
Well Jiang Management

449
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,860
Why do you hate me so much?

450
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,580
I know I have many shortcomings. Do you have many shortcomings too?

451
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,020
Why can't you see it?

452
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,220
Do you really want me to associate this with my broken heart in primary school?

453
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,740
What is the Broken Love League?

454
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,500
ah

455
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,380
I like you, but you don't like me.

456
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,880
ha

457
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,900
哈沈天涯

458
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,720
what happened again

459
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,500
You know how sad I am.

460
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,860
The more I want to get closer to you, the more scared I become

461
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,340
I'm afraid you'll know the darkest secret in my heart

462
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,820
What little secret?

463
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,100
I was the one who sent out the photo of Xu Chang and Guo Chunbin

464
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,580
I was Doctor Tang at that time. I really regret it now.

465
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,260
Every time I want to apologize to Xu Xian, I don't know how to start

466
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,220
I dare not say it now

467
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,140
If you knew I was the one who killed your sister, you would hate me even more.

468
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,980
Chasing you is so hard.

469
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,100
Okay, okay, okay.

470
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,620
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

471
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,780
Okay, it's okay.

472
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,540
Oh, I'm drunk again.

473
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,820
Ouch, my head hurts.

474
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,500
What just happened?

475
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,460
I am drunk

476
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,020
Nothing done

477
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,500
ah

478
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,220
I didn't remove my makeup.

479
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,220
Hey, where are you?

480
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,300
Where did the people go?

481
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,540
Xiaofei

482
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,420
Xiaofei

483
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,440
Why

484
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,580
Why are you looking at me secretly?

485
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,460
Am I too ugly without makeup?

486
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,640
Why

487
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,660
No, no, I think you look good after removing your makeup.

488
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,940
Don't wear such heavy makeup anymore.

489
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,260
Okay, if you say you don't want to change, then I won't change.

490
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,060
Hey, this soup can help you get rid of hangovers.

491
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,540
You gave it to me as a newbie

492
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,180
Don't cheat me.

493
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,580
Who brings hangover soup when going out?

494
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,100
You really don't understand the life of college students.

495
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,980
Uh, I just drank too much

496
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,380
Didn't make a fool of myself?

497
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,660
It's an eye-opener.

498
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,340
Um

499
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,660
Actually, I have something I want to confess to you.

500
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,200
explain

501
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,980
I was the one who sent out the photos of Xu Zheng and Gu Shijun

502
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,740
What louder?

503
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,100
I was the one who sent out the photos of Xu Zheng and Gu Shijun. Got it?

504
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,060
You said it yourself when you were drunk just now

505
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,700
Oh, drinking is not a problem.

506
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,420
You scold me

507
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,180
But don't think I'm a bad person because of this.

508
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,020
I won't think of you as a bad person because of this incident.

509
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,780
But I'm not the one you should apologize to.

510
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,300
It's my sister.

511
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,500
Yeah, I will definitely apologize to Xu Zhen.

512
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,820
Thank you for encouraging me.

513
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,020
Sister Xiao Fei

514
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,160
Why is it you?

515
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,540
Xiao Yan, why are you with Xiao Fei?

516
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,700
What's going on

517
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,800
magic

518
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,020
Didn't you say you were going camping?

519
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,060
Isn't it for writing a paper?

520
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,860
Don't tell me you two were just studying hard last night

521
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,980
Sister Wei Shan, stop imagining things.

522
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,420
Xiao Fei has something to tell you
