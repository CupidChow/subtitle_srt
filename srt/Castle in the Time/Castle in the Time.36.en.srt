1
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,620
Hey, Old Wu is here. Old Wu is here.

2
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,800
Yes, I just issued a statement yesterday saying I will stand by your side.

3
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,980
And pay your medical expenses and military loss compensation

4
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,740
Excuse me, are you here for show today?

5
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,620
Am I putting on a show?

6
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,780
Judge for yourself

7
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,100
No one will risk their own personal safety

8
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,900
As hype

9
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,180
I thought this was Xu Zhen's revenge.

10
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,180
But originally he held the army

11
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,100
Is the focus

12
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,140
In order to prevent the perpetrators from going unpunished

13
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,420
In order to avoid more people

14
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,300
No more innocent people being harmed

15
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,860
I must stand up

16
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,100
Clear everyone's name

17
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,140
Return the innocence of Gaiya

18
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,820
Is there anything that money can't solve?

19
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,100
Fame or wealth?

20
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,980
In the end, I still played you around with applause

21
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,180
Gu Zhijun

22
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,860
Before you fight me

23
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,460
Should we take a closer look at the chips in our hands?

24
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,140
It doesn't matter

25
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,260
It's all over

26
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,540
Since you love being a hero so much

27
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,380
Then open your eyes

28
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,620
Take a good look at how this hero of yours was destroyed.

29
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you still have a car? Sir, I am Sir.

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,160
We can't ask if there are any cars left.

31
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,280
Look at this line

32
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,780
Can't you ask me a question?

33
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,400
What kind of man are you now?

34
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,660
Come and have a look

35
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,060
Who is this person?

36
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,100
Why did the car stop here?

37
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,160
At this critical moment

38
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
A mysterious inheritance car stopped in front of us

39
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,240
Who is the person coming and why?

40
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,380
We will wait and see

41
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,940
Isn't this the second son we want?

42
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,820
Yes, Mr. Xiaolin came here to tempt with the bandage.

43
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,180
Ah, look at the position the mirror gives us

44
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,220
Today I want to face you.

45
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,940
To our factory worker Mr. Wu

46
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Apologize

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,500
Because of my own selfishness

48
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,380
Temporarily obsessed

49
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,140
As a producer

50
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,300
The explosion was caused

51
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,420
I feel

52
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,620
I'm very sorry about this.

53
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,940
All consequences and legal responsibilities

54
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,780
I will take full responsibility

55
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,980
Mr. Kobayashi, what are you doing?

56
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,080
Mr. Kobayashi, this explosion has been going on for a long time.

57
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,060
Why did you come forward only now?

58
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,620
Mr. Kobayashi, before you, Yao Chuan, you have always admired Xu Zhen

59
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,400
Did you come forward this time because it really happened or to help Gu Shijun escape?

60
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Mr. Kobayashi, this matter has been full of twists and turns

61
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,960
Frequent occurrences

62
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,220
What's your explanation for this?

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,060
This captain

64
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,620
What I just said is the truth

65
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,240
Gaia has been intervening in this matter

66
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
The so-called truth has been constantly updated

67
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,120
What role did Gaia play in this incident?

68
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,260
this matter

69
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,500
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

70
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,460
I take all the responsibility alone

71
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,460
In fact, this matter is very simple

72
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,060
If I had been in his shoes earlier

73
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,140
Think carefully about his heart.

74
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,340
Nothing will happen today.

75
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,580
So the biggest responsibility for this matter lies with

76
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,200
Tiny

77
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,500
Why do you make things so complicated?

78
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,420
Make way for a moment. Make way for a moment.

79
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,100
Lin Zongxian is also here

80
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,820
How did you come

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,220
Brother, how come you are here? There are so many people here and it's not crowded.

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,620
Xiaomi, stop talking and leave.

83
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,320
Mr. Lin, do you have anything to say to the landlord Dongren team?

84
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,180
Nothing to say

85
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,800
This is between us brothers.

86
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,080
Please ask him to be Mr. Li

87
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,060
Please explain this matter, Mr. Li

88
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,780
Mr. Li, Mr. Li, please explain

89
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,220
Dear media friends,

90
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,560
Please give them some private space.

91
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,660
Thank you. I'll answer any other questions you have.

92
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Please stop making trouble, okay?

93
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,200
Come home with me now

94
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,300
Just pretend nothing happened and I'll take care of it, remember?

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
elder brother

96
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,260
I know

97
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,340
No matter what I say now, you won't listen

98
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,420
But so much happened before

99
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,780
I can't pretend I don't see it.

100
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,860
you know

101
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,900
Why would I risk everything on this?

102
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,620
It's because I still regard you as the brother I once admired and worshipped.

103
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,020
This USB flash drive

104
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,700
I originally wanted to give it to Xiaozhen

105
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,180
But he said

106
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,660
If he uses this against you

107
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,540
It will definitely make me feel ashamed

108
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,600
so

109
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,680
elder brother

110
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,500
take care

111
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,580
Xiao Qiao Xiao Qiao

112
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,419
We need to know the truth

113
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,338
Xiaolin is here

114
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,519
Come come come

115
00:08:42,359 --> 00:08:43,179
Kobayashi

116
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,600
Kobayashi

117
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,120
From Xu Zhen to Gu Chijun

118
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,480
Today, Lin Jinxiu suddenly appeared

119
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,900
The explosion in the city of time finally has a conclusion

120
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,660
But the truth of the matter makes people curious

121
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,460
The brothers left

122
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,620
I'm really unhappy

123
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,260
Now my wish has come true.

124
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,180
In fact, I really left

125
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,700
Thank you, that's it.

126
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,020
Why do you keep looking at the silly bird Lin Jixiu gave you?

127
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,460
From now on you can only look at me

128
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,680
Zhijun

129
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,700
I always felt that Xiaoxiu was acting weird yesterday

130
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,260
What's wrong

131
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,360
Yesterday, Xiaoxiu came to the set to find me

132
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,620
Gave me a USB drive

133
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,400
He said the USB drive contained information that could incriminate Lin Jianyang.

134
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,680
But I rejected it later.

135
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,060
I didn't want that USB drive.

136
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,320
Then Xiaoxiu took out this bird lamp and gave it to me.

137
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,700
Said he wanted to say goodbye to me

138
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,300
I always thought he was a little weird.

139
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,580
I will help you investigate Lin Jinxiu's matter

140
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,780
But you in front of me

141
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,460
Blatantly caring about other men

142
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,220
I'm not happy

143
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,820
So I'll confiscate this stupid bird for you first.

144
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,620
Hello, you're back. Xu Juan. Xu Juan

145
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,620
Something big happened

146
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,820
Kobayashi took full responsibility for the explosion in front of all the media.

147
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,540
What do you say?

148
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,840
Is Xiao Xiu taking the blame for his brother?

149
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,460
How could he do this?

150
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,700
If Xiaolin insists that he did it,

151
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,840
Even if he is found to be innocent

152
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,560
That would also be punishable for obstruction of justice.

153
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,100
Isn't he kidding?

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,800
ah

155
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,380
How could I be so stupid?

156
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,420
If I had understood what happened yesterday earlier, today wouldn't have happened.

157
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,120
Xu Chen

158
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,260
do you know

159
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,780
The more time we waste on self-blame

160
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,100
Mr. Kobayashi's sacrifice was in vain.

161
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,300
So now we have to think of a way

162
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,580
Breakthrough is imminent, and the same is true for our blockade and suppression

163
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,980
To find the key to solve the problem

164
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,880
Envoy, we must help Xiao Xiu celebrate.

165
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,180
Let him come out as soon as possible

166
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,620
Without my permission

167
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,220
Who is not allowed to come in?

168
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,060
I want to be alone

169
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,500
Why would it be so?

170
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,520
Tiny

171
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,900
Do you know what you are doing?

172
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,340
Do you know

173
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,300
Bro, I'm here.

174
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,180
Where are you, little bear?

175
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,940
ah

176
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,340
Where's the little bear? I'm here.

177
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,200
ah

178
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,420
Oops, it's over.

179
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,460
This is my dad's favorite vase.

180
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,980
How could this happen?

181
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,340
What should I do

182
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,300
Who broke the vase?

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,360
Jinyang, it must be you who did it

184
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,260
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation

185
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,280
Zhou Hui

186
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,380
Ahhh

187
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,900
Xiaoxiu, why are you crying?

188
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,000
Dad, I just accidentally broke your favorite vase

189
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,600
You wait a minute Song Xiaoxiu

190
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,900
Could you be a little gentler?

191
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,620
Silly boy

192
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,700
If daddy beats you up, this vase will be restored to its original state.

193
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,820
I'll spank your little butt hard

194
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,260
What a nice vase

195
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,140
Don't move me.

196
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
Brother is fine.

197
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,060
Dad is gone

198
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,800
I won't let dad blame you alone for the vase incident.

199
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,220
If we're going to get spanked, we'll both stick our butts out together.

200
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,020
Liu Jia, come in.

201
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,620
Find a lawyer we know better.

202
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,800
No matter how much money you spend, don't condone

203
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,860
We must keep Xiaoxiu at all costs

204
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,420
do you understand

205
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,980
Mr. Lin, I have already contacted a lawyer.

206
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,960
He told me clearly that we had made a big fuss about this matter.

207
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,580
Now all the media are watching

208
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,140
If we make any move, they will pulverize us.

209
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,520
The situation will get out of control then.

210
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,580
It will be very bad for both you and Gaia.

211
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,340
So Mr. Lin

212
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,260
You better calm down.

213
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,980
Think about it carefully

214
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,660
Deserted

215
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,380
Things have come to this point.

216
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,740
How do you ask me to calm down?

217
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,900
I don't care. I don't care what method you use. You must try it.

218
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,860
Mr. Lin, someone has already found Liu Weicheng's whereabouts

219
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,660
A pier in Qiu Caidong

220
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,500
But it's very secretive

221
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,539
From the film set explosion 8 years ago

222
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,439
To the whole story of Li Qianer's incident

223
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:11,839
He knows it clearly.

224
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,139
If he stood up and talked nonsense at this time

225
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,299
By then the situation

226
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,179
It will be more difficult to control

227
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,660
Against me

228
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,180
You all are against me.

229
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,100
OK

230
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,260
You forced me to do this.

231
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,460
You forced me to do this.

232
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,540
I won't give you a chance to speak.

233
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,260
Go ahead

234
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,740
yes

235
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,500
Liu Weicheng

236
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,780
Liu Weicheng is the key to the whole incident

237
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,020
I must tell Chi Jun and Xu Zhen immediately

238
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,620
But how should I get out?

239
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,080
Miss Qian, how did you fall to the ground?

240
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,220
Get up quickly

241
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,920
Miss Qian, please wake up!

242
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,380
Wake up, Miss Qian. Miss Qian.

243
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,680
ah

244
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,180
Hey, don't run, Jieanjiejie

245
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,420
Anjie, don't run!

246
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,760
Don't run away

247
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,700
The lord told me to keep an eye on you.

248
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,180
Don't run, come back soon

249
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,380
Mr. Lin, I was deceived by him when I was delivering lunch to Miss Qin just now.

250
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,060
He has now locked me in the room and ran away

251
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,180
I see

252
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,880
Hey, look, look, wow

253
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,440
Don't you think this guy looks like a star?

254
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,240
So that's Qingzi, Qingqing, right, right, right, but how is it possible?

255
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,440
He is a top-tier celebrity.

256
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,820
How could it be so miserable?

257
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,580
what happened

258
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,260
You can't even watch over a living person.

259
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,340
Qin Ziqing ran away

260
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,580
Find a solution quickly

261
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,260
Please bring the person back to me.

262
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,340
He'll be caught soon.

263
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,660
Miss, you can't come in here.

264
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,440
Miss, I'm sorry, you can't come in here.

265
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,560
Here we are for the honorable

266
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,420
You really can't enter the VIP room prepared by the customer

267
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,260
Dear VIP

268
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,780
You see, I am not noble.

269
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,940
Miss Qin, take care.

270
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,260
Look, I'm not a star, right?

271
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,940
Is this a beauty salon or a film set? Are there also main and supporting roles?

272
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,040
Recharge Card

273
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,260
VIP

274
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,840
I want super VIP

275
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,260
And I come here every week and ask for this room

276
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,700
Good lady

277
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,860
A-list stars are amazing

278
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,140
I will become a first-line star in the future

279
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,420
Ah, come on.

280
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,940
Did you hear that right?

281
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,740
Qin Ziqing, cheer me up

282
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,900
yes

283
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,700
After meeting Shen Qingyuan, I realized what it means to be a man with a needle in the sea

284
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,740
Both in theory and practice

285
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,900
I have used all the tricks I can.

286
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,020
He remains indifferent

287
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,740
So I found that in order to catch up with neuritis

288
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,660
No emotional intelligence or IQ is needed

289
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,820
The only thing you need is physical strength

290
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,320
Hey sir, who are you looking for?

291
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,260
Hey, you can't come in, sir, you can't come in

292
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,360
Hey, you can't go in the light.

293
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,180
Let's invite sister next time

294
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,580
Sir, you can't come in here. Sir, you can't come in. How are you wearing this? Do you need to explain so much?

295
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,360
Someone is chasing me now

296
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,020
I need you to help me get out of here right now.

297
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,740
Let me see the story is so true

298
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,740
I have something important to tell them, okay?

299
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,840
oh

300
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,120
gentlemen

301
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,140
Oh sir, you are crazy, get out

302
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,420
Who is sick outside?

303
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,540
Sir, please leave here first.

304
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,580
Ah sir, who wants to go?

305
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,940
Hey, sir, this matter cannot be solved, sir.

306
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,100
Sir, you are crazy, go away

307
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,820
Sisters, give me

308
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't

309
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,200
Walk

310
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,860
Don't move. Don't move.

311
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,440
You still resist?

312
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,300
Are you convinced, little guy?

313
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,260
October

314
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,220
What is the current public opinion on the Internet?

315
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,100
Also, how is the network being spread by the self-media?

316
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,280
To be honest, the effect may not be very ideal.

317
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,040
Because of Mr. Kobayashi's sudden confession

318
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,160
Plus the full pressure from Lin

319
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,500
No media outlet is willing to report this.

320
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,280
Fortunately, I asked an acquaintance about it.

321
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,940
They said unless you have solid evidence

322
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,940
Otherwise, no media outlet would be willing to offend Gan Ya because of this matter.

323
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,020
Ah, now the most important two people

324
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,620
One is Lin Dong

325
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,740
But he is still in the hospital and hasn't woken up yet.

326
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,620
There is still one

327
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,660
Liu Weicheng

328
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,900
But since his last hospitalization

329
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,660
No news

330
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,700
It's like the whole person has evaporated from the face of the earth.

331
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,140
ah

332
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,220
So what?

333
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,060
Where should our breakthrough be?

334
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,960
Xu Zhen

335
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,260
Stop blaming yourself

336
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,780
Who is it? Who is it?

337
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,580
Here I come. Is this a knock on the door or whack-a-mole?

338
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,680
Xiao Fei Qin Ziqing

339
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,740
What's wrong with you two? Come in quickly.

340
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,500
show free

341
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,340
Small flying purple

342
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,780
What's wrong?

343
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,840
Don't ask me I don't know anything

344
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,520
Sister Zixin, please explain

345
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,120
Give me a drink of water

346
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,500
Give water

347
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,060
Thanks

348
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,620
I some time ago

349
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,260
Lin has always been admired

350
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,300
Imprisoned in his home

351
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,580
I accidentally heard the news that Liu Weicheng came back today.

352
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,260
He is at a dock in East China

353
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,060
I know this news is very important to you.

354
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,020
so

355
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,260
So I must come

356
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,160
Sister Ziqing is too weak

357
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,780
Have a good sleep.

358
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,640
Xu Zhen

359
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,060
Now that we have a clue

360
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,220
It proves that I have no chance to move to Li Jinyang

361
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,540
from now on

362
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,220
Don't lose to yourself first.

363
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,040
Zhang Shiyu, you are really good and you have brother Chijun

364
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,500
How many things are you hiding from us?

365
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,140
Didn't Sister Ziqing say she would marry Mr. Lin?

366
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,980
Why is he imprisoned now?

367
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,980
And that Liu Weicheng

368
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,980
Why was he involved?

369
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,280
We are confused now.

370
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,660
Explain it to me quickly, okay, okay, okay, okay

371
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,620
calm down

372
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
There are so many people here.

373
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,560
This is not the time to explain this.

374
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,940
And it won't be explained clearly for a while.

375
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,120
Wei Shan

376
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,280
Don't make it difficult

377
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,780
The matter is related to this matter

378
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,100
I will explain it to you clearly.

379
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,700
What happened

380
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,500
It's probably like this

381
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,340
Xu Zhen was injured before

382
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,820
Room Explosion

383
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,700
And Mr. Lin is sick

384
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,580
Haven't woken up yet.

385
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,820
All this was done by Lin Jingyang

386
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,980
Anyone who stands in his way is now a sacrifice to his ambition.

387
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,940
In order to achieve his goal

388
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,620
Already started to resort to all means

389
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,820
Oh my god, my idea of ​​a perfect man is like this

390
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,700
That's horrible.

391
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,860
Now is not the time to discuss this

392
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,860
Ziqing desperately ran out to tell us the news

393
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,300
This means that Lin Jinyang has taken some action now.

394
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,700
We must find Liu Weicheng first

395
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,260
Let him explain things clearly.

396
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,180
Chi Jun is right

397
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,120
We have to leave now.

398
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,700
But one of us has to stay and take care of Sister Ziqing.

399
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,820
Then keep the consumption.

400
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,560
Why me?

401
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,760
I played an important role in discovering this clue.

402
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,460
You can't cross the river and burn the bridge

403
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,340
Just stop messing around.

404
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,000
You're in such poor condition.

405
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,580
You'll get hurt if you go out.

406
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,760
Xiao Yan

407
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,820
You care about me

408
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,620
But you're right.

409
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,920
You can ask me to stay

410
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,140
But I have one condition

411
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,560
You have to stay too

412
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,700
me

413
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,080
If a black person comes here

414
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,500
How can Sister Ciqing and I deal with him?

415
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,800
I've decided that.

416
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,160
You stay with Xiao Fei

417
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,980
let's go

418
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,860
Hey wait wait

419
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,420
I haven't agreed yet.

420
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,340
We have decided

421
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,840
Where are we going next?

422
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,420
This piece is not small.

423
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,140
Check out the more remote trails

424
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,920
If I am not mistaken

425
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,640
Weicheng has always had asthma problems

426
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,180
Then he must be very particular about the environment where he chooses to live.

427
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,400
I guess Lin Jinyang's people are also looking for him

428
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,780
So we have to be careful

429
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,620
The car is parked here

430
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,060
We split up

431
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,280
If you find any clues

432
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,260
Contact by phone

433
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,100
My male god, you must take good care of our Xiao Zhang

434
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,420
See you later. Don't worry.

435
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,820
Shiyu, go look over there, look over here.

436
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,180
Stop laughing and pack your things.

437
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,540
We have to get out of here now.

438
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,400
Dad, where are we going?

439
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,820
Stop asking so many questions. Clean up quickly.

440
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,900
Hey, where are you going in such a hurry? The meal is ready.

441
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,320
Mr. Wang

442
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,060
Whoever comes to see me later, just tell him

443
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,720
You said I had already moved away

444
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,960
You don't know where I went, remember?

445
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,680
Ah, ok

446
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,480
Thanks

447
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,580
Hey, what's going on here?

448
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,220
Take the boat, take the car, take the boat, take the customer boat, uh

449
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,980
Hello, I would like to ask if you have seen this couple.

450
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,620
I didn't see it. Sorry, I didn't see it. Thank you.

451
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,240
Let the two bosses take the boat.

452
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,940
10 yuan per person. I would like to ask if you have seen this couple? No, thank you.

453
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,180
Hey, boss, take a boat

454
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,580
I would like to ask if you have seen this responsible

455
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,620
Oh, I pulled him over. Oh, great. Then take me over there. Okay.

456
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,700
Thank you.

457
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,420
Hey, this is it.

458
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,820
Hey, who are you two looking for?

459
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,380
The landlord, right?

460
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,580
I want to find this father and son.

461
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,100
I don't know if you've seen it.

462
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,600
Oh, they've already moved out.

463
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I asked him if he would come back.

464
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,740
He said he wouldn't come back, and there was no news.

465
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,940
Then we

466
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,239
Can I see his room?

467
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,759
You see, I know this child and his father and we have a very good relationship.

468
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,920
We are looking for them now and hope you can help

469
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,260
We'll go in for a minute.

470
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,580
Go in and take a look and then come out

471
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,579
Ok, okay, okay, go in and take a look, come out quickly, thank you.

472
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,899
They must have left in a hurry.

473
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:48,498
Look, this cola bean is still cold.

474
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,978
They must have heard something.

475
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,539
So I left immediately

476
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,579
Hey, Tenth Army, look

477
00:34:56,958 --> 00:35:00,000
This was something I gave to Yuanxiao when I saw that he liked Xiaojunjun.

478
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,440
He said that no matter where they go, they will stay by your side. According to your judgment, since they just left

479
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,520
Then I think Yuanxiao and the others will definitely come back to marry this doll

480
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,140
They will definitely come back

481
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,960
I'll call Shiyu and the others right away.

482
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,060
Let them come quickly

483
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,620
Let's just wait here for them to come back.

484
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,780
Thank you, landlord. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's go.

485
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,480
Hey, how's the situation now?

486
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,820
I saw the father and son.

487
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,820
Haven't found them yet.

488
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,440
But we have found where they live.

489
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,280
According to my and the Red Army's judgment

490
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,480
Brother Weicheng will definitely come back with Yuanxiao

491
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,100
So please wait patiently.

492
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,980
Every corner cannot be left out

493
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,420
If you can't find anyone, don't go back today. Got it. Got it.

494
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,740
Liu Weicheng

495
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,220
I will never let you go

496
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,420
Will Xiaozhen and his son really come back?

497
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,140
worn out

498
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Um

499
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,160
Well, Zheng Shiyu is out, don't embarrass me here.

500
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,540
Be careful, I'm breaking up with you

501
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,480
Dear, if you are tired

502
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,900
My great chest is open to you, come on, go, go

503
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,980
Zhijun, look!

504
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,580
Is that Director Liu and Yuan Xiao?

505
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,980
Let's go there quickly

506
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,740
Waiting to go

507
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,400
Sister Xu Zhen

508
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,060
Brother Jun, please stop laughing and making trouble.

509
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,180
Sister Qu Tian eats chicken on Lantern Festival. Brother, I miss you guys so much on Lantern Festival.

510
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,000
Sister Yuanxiao misses you too.

511
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,580
I'm here for you. Didn't you eat well? Your face looks thin.

512
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,980
Come to daddy's place for Lantern Festival

513
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,860
Brother Beichen, long time no see. We have been waiting for you for a long time.

514
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,180
How did you find this place?

515
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,400
What is your purpose in looking for me?

516
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,180
You left this city for a long time.

517
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,900
Why did you suddenly come back?

518
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,240
Dad, when you saw Brother Xiaoxiu on TV this morning

519
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,400
I'm asking Yuanxiao if you did something wrong

520
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,640
I don't understand Lantern Festival

521
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,060
But you can know for sure if you make a wish.

522
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,340
I came back just for Gaia's matter.

523
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,220
As the disorder develops

524
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,060
I am increasingly doubting whether it is right or wrong for me to keep to myself

525
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,100
But when I think back to 8 years ago

526
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,020
I was that person's accomplice.

527
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,140
I've seen his brutality.

528
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,220
I admit I'm scared

529
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,820
I'm afraid even if I sacrifice myself

530
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,120
It's meaningless to fly into the flame

531
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,180
It doesn't solve any problems at all

532
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,700
Weicheng

533
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,820
Everything that has happened has its value.

534
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,700
Xiao Xiu is using his own surrender to gamble with Mr. Lin's conscience.

535
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,360
Seemingly meaningless

536
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,600
But it actually gave us time to find you.

537
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,100
Find our last chance

538
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,300
Xu Zhen is right

539
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,780
Lin Jiyang has already jumped over the wall

540
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,620
Now he is creating some scandals to discredit me

541
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,940
In fact, there is no chips at all

542
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,040
Now we just need you to stand on our side

543
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,740
We can take him down together.

544
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,540
Dad, please promise Sister Xu Zhen that I am Brother Jing, right?

545
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,020
Yuanxiao Dad knows how to make it

546
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,700
good

547
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,900
I promise to go back with you.

548
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,140
It also puts an end to the mistake I made 8 years ago.

549
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,380
But I have a request

550
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,100
If something happens to me

551
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,500
I hope you can take good care of Yuanxiao for me

552
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,860
Don't worry, we will take good care of Yuanxiao.

553
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,900
Okay, that's all.

554
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,620
Thank you Mr. Lin for taking the time to accept our interview today.

555
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,960
Seeing is believing

556
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,400
You are indeed the most charming young business leader in the industry.

557
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,000
Then we won't bother you.

558
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,500
Goodbye. Thank you.

559
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,060
Hey Mr. Lin

560
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,460
He is indeed the most charming young leader of the enterprise.

561
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,260
You said that if the reporter

562
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,700
Knowing the true identity of the eldest son of the Lin family

563
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,620
Will you write more exciting articles?

564
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,500
Guo Zhijun, what do you want to do?

565
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,540
I came here just to tell you

566
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,540
Enjoy your spacious and bright office.

567
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,740
besides

568
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,420
The smell of free air

569
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,860
Otherwise, it will suddenly disappear one day.

570
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,540
It's too late to regret

571
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,100
Who wins and who loses now?

572
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,340
It's hard to draw a conclusion.

573
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,420
Maybe it's just right, not too early or too late
