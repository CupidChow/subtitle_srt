1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,980
The pain of time has always been invisible

2
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,600
Hey Shiyu, have you seen Xu Zhen?

3
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,820
Why didn't I see him today? Xiaolin is always like this. Xu Zhen, where was he today?

4
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,780
Ahh ah

5
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,540
Oh thanks

6
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,580
Surprise is celebrating the 27th day of our reunion. Are you interested in having a candlelight dinner with me tonight?

7
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,620
Of course, before that, I have prepared a little surprise for you

8
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,980
Look back

9
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,300
Wow, so beautiful!

10
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,580
I would like to have dinner with you

11
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,940
You even remember the first day we met

12
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,340
So happy. Wait a minute.

13
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,080
How could it be you, Xiao Fei?

14
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
What about Xiaozhen?

15
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,080
It's me, Xiao Fei.

16
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,220
We are destined to be Xiaoxiu

17
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,500
Happy, I feel dizzy, oh you, oh

18
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,140
Gucci, Xiao Su

19
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,260
Our dinner

20
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,980
Uh, keep going.

21
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,219
We are offending Mr. Kobayashi who is a liar.

22
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,580
Is it okay? What's wrong?

23
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,140
You've been with me for so many years

24
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,200
Have you ever seen me afraid of offending people?

25
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,340
Moreover

26
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,420
Even if I offend others, it won't affect my salary.

27
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,820
But is this fair to Xu Zheng?

28
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,780
How come it's unfair?

29
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,080
Who made him hang up on me?

30
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,060
Have you ever seen anyone hang up on a doctor's parents?

31
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,220
Sure, just because I hung up the phone

32
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,620
Ancient Poetry

33
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,220
Is it fun to play tricks on me?

34
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,580
Do you know how much I thought about today?

35
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,540
I don't know how much effort you put into today.

36
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,660
But I think that as a qualified producer, you should focus on acting, which is completely different.

37
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,620
You'd better tell me where Xu Jun is now

38
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,500
Otherwise what

39
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,700
Otherwise how

40
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,700
Fired, fired.

41
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,820
I want to see how you explain to the investors and your father after you fire me.

42
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,180
Hey, try harder, Mr. Kobayashi

43
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Actually, this is the case.

44
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,920
Uh, Xu Zhi didn't come to pick it up today. He asked for leave from me.

45
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,940
I was cleaning the room in my old house.

46
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,860
Xu Chun is in the old house

47
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,140
Hey, Xiaozhen, are you back home now?

48
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,560
Otoko

49
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,700
Then I'll come find you. Wait for me.

50
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,160
Even so

51
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,500
I can still find him

52
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,960
Do you know where Xu Zhen's old home is?

53
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,120
Of course, even though we haven't seen each other for more than ten years.

54
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,820
But at least we are childhood sweethearts

55
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,100
It's different from your simple employment relationship.

56
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,660
Mr. Li, wait a minute.

57
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,600
I have a very important work question to ask you now

58
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,820
What work problem

59
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,860
My work problem is

60
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,460
Where is Xu Zhen's rescue?

61
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,420
What kind of work problem is this?

62
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
Of course it's a work issue.

63
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,160
Xu Zhen is my assistant

64
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,760
I need someone to help me with the words

65
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,460
If no one helps me with the lyrics, it will affect my performance.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,760
Excuse me

67
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,880
I absolutely cannot disclose the privacy of my good friends.

68
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
And you are his boss

69
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,100
You should know best where he lives.

70
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,780
You don't tell me

71
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,220
It doesn't mean I have no way of knowing.

72
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,680
well

73
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,460
Why are you here?

74
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,720
Why can't I be here?

75
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,860
You have to know that I have driven an F1 car in the United States.

76
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,540
You follow me

77
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,180
How can this be called tracking?

78
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,220
I just used my intelligence.

79
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,100
Hurry up, I got to this parking space first

80
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,900
Why should I do it?

81
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,600
Because Xiaozhen came to the old house to clean up the house

82
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,860
I'm going to help him

83
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,980
Being a boss who cares about employees

84
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,100
Of course I have to consider all aspects of my employees.

85
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,420
Hey, two of you

86
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,480
Sorry, I found this parking space first.

87
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,740
Please let me go.

88
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
I'm sorry, handsome guy.

89
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,539
You may not be familiar with it yet.

90
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,880
Everyone in the neighborhood knows this parking space.

91
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,140
This is a 20-year exclusive private customization for our car.

92
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,780
I didn't see any mark.

93
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,820
This is the internal regulation of our community.

94
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,040
I'm really sorry, you two.

95
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,480
I don't have time to talk to you about internal regulations.

96
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,580
Is this okay

97
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,020
Do you think money can solve everything?

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,900
Oh, I see. I'll give it all to you.

99
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,700
Can you look down on others just because you have money?

100
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,120
Hey, you misunderstood me. I really don't mean to look down on you.

101
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,500
I want to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.

102
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
Um

103
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,980
Kobayashi

104
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,220
Do you think you're acting in an idol drama?

105
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,020
Give money if you don't agree

106
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,480
I think you are quite reasonable, beautiful lady.

107
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,580
How about we discuss lending me this parking space for a day?

108
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,180
Are you Gu Chijun?

109
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,420
Oh my god, I'm so excited.

110
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,740
I'm sorry

111
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,900
Forgot to introduce myself

112
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
My name is Weishan

113
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,380
Just call entertainment network editor

114
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,000
Also your fan

115
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,820
I've always wanted to interview you.

116
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,820
I didn't expect it to be such a coincidence today.

117
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,800
I don't know if I can interview you.

118
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,900
I'm sorry

119
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,900
My work tips

120
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,540
Please contact my agent Zhang Shiyu. Thank you.

121
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,340
Find a parking space somewhere else.

122
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,680
go home with me

123
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,540
walk home

124
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,900
Oh my god

125
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,020
Move the car quickly.

126
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,940
Hey, why are you still following me? Aren’t you afraid of being photographed?

127
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,460
Why am I afraid of being photographed when I'm with you?

128
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,980
You were accidentally photographed by a reporter.

129
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,140
Then your dad found out that you were not working properly on the set but hanging around outside all day.

130
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,340
Your black card will be confiscated.

131
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,900
Don't blame me for not reminding you

132
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,480
Hey, you follow me so closely

133
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,100
Do you know which building Xiaozhen lives in?

134
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,340
I don't know which building Xiaozhen lives in, it doesn't matter

135
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,980
Just you know

136
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,020
Why did you two come back so late?

137
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Oh, sister, don't mention it.

138
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,600
I just ran into two people with these problems outside.

139
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,380
Xiao Yan, stop talking nonsense

140
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,980
Xiaojun, guess who I just met

141
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,700
Why is it you?

142
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,700
What are you two doing?

143
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,920
Who is this man Xu Zhen?

144
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,940
Why in your house?

145
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,580
Gu Nanshan, we meet again

146
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,980
Xiaozhen, you didn't ask for leave just for this guy, did you?

147
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,460
Hey, what are you two talking about? This is my brother.

148
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,020
Ah, hello

149
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,020
Hey Xiaozhen

150
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,580
This flower is from me.

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,180
thank you

152
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,620
Oh, by the way, how did you and Xiao Yan meet?

153
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,880
Oh, I was outside just now.

154
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,420
Just now

155
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,640
We had a little misunderstanding just now.

156
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,700
I heard that you came to your uncle's house, so I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help you.

157
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,780
Being a good boss

158
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,180
You should know why the assistant asked for leave without any reason.

159
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,300
Mr. Gu

160
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,120
I am Xiaozhen

161
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,720
Grew up together

162
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,380
Best friends and girlfriends

163
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,580
Since we are all acquaintances

164
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,420
Please let me interview you once.

165
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,900
No problem at all

166
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,020
Respond at any time

167
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,660
Boss, why are you so approachable today?

168
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,740
I'm not always like this

169
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
Hey, Sister Xing

170
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,900
Let's continue fixing the water pipe, otherwise it will be too late.

171
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,100
If you want to fix the water pipe, I'll help too.

172
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,340
I am professional in plumbing repair

173
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,980
Hey Xiaolin Xiaolin Xiaolin Xiaolin

174
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,700
Just leave the West Lake water pipe issue to me.

175
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,660
If I don't agree

176
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,700
Are you going to give me money again?

177
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,340
What money? What a misunderstanding. What a misunderstanding.

178
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,420
Kobayashi

179
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,380
Plumbing repairs

180
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,620
Can a pampered young master like you do this?

181
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,900
Are you kidding me?

182
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,760
When I was abroad, I did all the dirty and hard work.

183
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,340
Tell you about the big star who has always been surrounded by people

184
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,900
Do you know these?

185
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,660
I experience life before I play each role.

186
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,740
Like repairing water pipes

187
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,980
I don't know how many times I've performed it.

188
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,080
The water pipes in my house are seriously aged.

189
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,480
You guys have to be careful when you repair it. Don't worry, leave Xiaozhen to me.

190
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,660
It's a piece of cake. Okay, just wait. Yes, yes, we'll call you when we've fixed it.

191
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,980
Oh, let me research it.

192
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,940
Will you

193
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,860
Hey, don't go there.

194
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,680
I tell you, this is the place that is missing

195
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,300
I'll tighten it up.

196
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,560
No, you have to check if there is water first.

197
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,020
If there is no water, let's make it bigger.

198
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,040
You don't connect it.

199
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,500
How could there be water?

200
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,300
It's all right.

201
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,820
Take a look

202
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,980
Ahhhh

203
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,640
ah

204
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,380
You must have done this on purpose.

205
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,260
Hahaha you

206
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,140
Come on, you

207
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,740
Hahahahahaha

208
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,060
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

209
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,320
Ha ha

210
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,180
What are you two doing?

211
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,700
What are you two doing?

212
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,820
What are you two doing?

213
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,620
I said you two are fixing the water pipes

214
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,380
It's like a water splashing festival.

215
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,300
Don't move, I'm begging you guys, please get out first, please get out

216
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,580
Get out, get out, get out

217
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,260
Why

218
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,319
Thank you for your hard work today.

219
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,159
I appreciate all the good intentions.

220
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,440
I don't need any special help

221
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,480
There are no innocent absentees. You are all so busy. You should go back first. Look, it's getting dark outside.

222
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,100
I have to cook quickly.

223
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,540
Cook

224
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,740
Xiaojuan, I am willing to eat whatever you cook

225
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,740
Remember my habits

226
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,300
No onions, no garlic

227
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,300
Only plants can be used, not animals.

228
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,540
If you must cook fish

229
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,780
Remember to squeeze some lemon on it

230
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,920
Two great gods, please don't misunderstand

231
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,760
The food here is just simple and plain, it's really not suitable for you to eat.

232
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,540
Except for this door, there are delicacies from land and sea suitable for you everywhere.

233
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:05,980
You two still don't understand what my sister means. You two should get out right now.

234
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,860
Xiao Chen Shen Qing

235
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,660
Aren't you two siblings too cruel?

236
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,900
Can't Liu Gu and Mr. Lin have dinner at home?

237
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,720
Why

238
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,680
Big Brother

239
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,340
What do you call them?

240
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,140
Xu Zhen Neuron

241
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,860
Yeah, why don't you two have the same last name?

242
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,260
They weren't siblings.

243
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,760
Why are they living in the same room if they are not siblings?

244
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,980
Yeah, it's not a last name.

245
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,420
We lived together for many years.

246
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,340
No, I have to stay for dinner today.

247
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,660
Although it is just plain food

248
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,140
But I can still accept it

249
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,240
Can all big stars eat it?

250
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,140
I can too

251
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,660
Come serve me food

252
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,500
You two, stop messing around.

253
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,900
You said how did you do it?

254
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,340
Aren't you and Xu Zhen childhood sweethearts?

255
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,680
Why don't you know whether they are biological children?

256
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
How would I know?

257
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,440
This must have happened after I went abroad.

258
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,680
And you're the one who can scream

259
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
He's obviously the boss.

260
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,700
How come you don't even know his brother's last name?

261
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,700
How do I know this happened before I met him?

262
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,540
Why hasn't Dad rested yet?

263
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,020
I'm waiting for you to come back

264
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,180
I heard that you've been skipping work a lot these days.

265
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,340
Where on earth did you run off to?

266
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,140
Are you going to continue to be a producer?

267
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,960
Of course I have to do it

268
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,800
Not only to do

269
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,680
Do your best, Dad.

270
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,640
Didn't you always say that I don't have any goals in life?

271
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,600
I'm telling you now I have it

272
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
So what is your goal?

273
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,020
My life goal is to work hard.

274
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,140
I chased Xu Zhen by mistake

275
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,720
Hey mom, let me tell you

276
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,540
Xiaozhen is really a very good girl

277
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,080
The most important thing is that I am very very happy when I am with him.

278
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,100
So from now on, chasing Xiaozhen is my biggest goal in life.

279
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,860
Stop messing around.

280
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,740
Can you put more thought into this entertainment?

281
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,380
I have trained you to read books for so many years.

282
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,500
You don't even know the point of your life now.

283
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
Hey, Dad, let me see.

284
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,800
You don't understand the focus of life.

285
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,580
Do you think you should think about Aunt Liang?

286
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,820
Should I set a new life goal?

287
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,040
Okay, no more words.

288
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,000
You should take a rest immediately.

289
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,280
I went back to my room to sleep.

290
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,660
Think about it carefully.

291
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,580
The boy has really grown up

292
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
If you have any questions, feel free to call me.

293
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,960
I see

294
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Don't worry.

295
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
My dear, please remember this.

296
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,440
As long as the family is together

297
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,680
Even if happiness is short-lived, it is eternal

298
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,300
Yeah, I know everything. Let's go.

299
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,700
Bye bye sister, call me anytime bye bye call me

300
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,740
Mom and Dad, you are back.

301
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,780
It seems like I haven't been back for a long time.

302
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,580
It should be more than 10 years.

303
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,400
dad

304
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,380
I can't remember how long it has been since I had my mother's cooking.

305
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,260
Xiao Chen

306
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,460
The Lego horse-like dad is finally assembled

307
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,980
Do you remember Manny the Mammoth from Riverside?

308
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,020
Dad thinks you look a lot like Manny.

309
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,200
Love family

310
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,740
Cute and kind

311
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,260
No matter what happens in the future

312
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,380
Dad wants you to be like him.

313
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,600
Not afraid of loneliness

314
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,900
Not afraid of getting hurt

315
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,980
Finally found the warmth that belongs to me

316
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,860
Thank you, Dad.

317
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,500
dinner time

318
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,620
Wow, the food my mom cooked looks delicious haha

319
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,220
You do not know

320
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,040
Dad learned his cooking skills from mom, hahaha

321
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,140
You, the apprentice, have not learned the sincerity of your master.

322
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,340
Really hahahaha

323
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,900
Eat more and wait

324
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,740
look here

325
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,860
321

326
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,140
The town is asleep

327
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,940
Wanting, thank you for your hard work today.

328
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,380
fine

329
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,100
It's nice to go back to my hometown.

330
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,680
Xiaozhen is too stubborn

331
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,380
Like you and me

332
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,700
This period of time is difficult for you

333
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,060
I know

334
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,780
We no longer had feelings for each other a long time ago.

335
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,300
We have our own values

336
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,620
Different ideals and different lifestyles

337
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,060
But despite all the differences

338
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,500
I am still very grateful that you are willing to accompany me through this last journey of life like a family member

339
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,540
actually

340
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,660
It's you who has always been with me

341
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,500
I was out

342
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,060
Work hard and pursue my dreams

343
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,080
You didn't blame me

344
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,740
I left this house without caring about it

345
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,620
Leaving Daughter

346
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,580
actually

347
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,940
I feel really guilty.

348
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,260
But I am grateful

349
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,020
Wen Ting'er

350
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,100
You haven't changed after all these years.

351
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,820
I am willing to keep everything in my heart.

352
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,380
I know you don't want to contact us.

353
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,340
There must be other reasons.

354
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,500
But Xiaozhen is your daughter.

355
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,020
your family

356
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,980
No matter what difficulties you encounter

357
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,860
Family members should stand up and protect each other.

358
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,680
It's so late

359
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,060
I should go back

360
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,360
Don't wake him up

361
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Xiao Chen has been busy all day today.

362
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,100
Let him have a good rest

363
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,340
Okay, then I'll take you there.

364
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,980
Dad, Dad, Dad

365
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,020
Dad, dad, dad, dad, wake up

366
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,300
Dad, wake up.

367
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,860
Dad, Dad

368
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,540
Doctor Zhang, how is my father?

369
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,140
Doctor, I'm sorry.

370
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,140
We have tried our best

371
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,940
Sister, please help me.

372
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,820
Ahhhh

373
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,100
Ahhhhh

374
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,380
Dad thinks you look a lot like Manny.

375
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,740
No matter what happens in the future

376
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,420
Dad wants you to be like him.

377
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,440
Not afraid of loneliness

378
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,820
Not afraid of getting hurt

379
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,700
Finally find your own warmth

380
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,840
Small town

381
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,640
It's been several days

382
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,660
You're still sitting there like this, not eating or drinking.

383
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,660
How can the body bear it?

384
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:12,899
Come and see

385
00:34:12,998 --> 00:34:15,198
I brought you your favorite cakes.

386
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,539
Very delicious

387
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,939
Do you remember?

388
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,659
We used to play Lego together.

389
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,058
If one person works alone, he or she will not be able to do it well.

390
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,939
He seems to want us to work together

391
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:48,019
No matter how difficult it is, it won't be a problem

392
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,699
This door handle looks complicated.

393
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:53,938
How about we work together again?

394
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,819
See if you can put it back together.

395
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
sister

396
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,860
I know this mammoth box was left to you by your father.

397
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,540
It's important to you

398
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,820
But no matter how important something is, if it is broken

399
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,140
What's the point?

400
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,140
If you're not ready to touch these pieces now

401
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,020
Could you give it to me first?

402
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,700
I don't know if one person can complete it.

403
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,060
But because it was left by my father

404
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,580
So I'm going to give it a try anyway

405
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,320
Xiao Chen

406
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,300
Uncle Xue is not only your father

407
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,180
He is also Xiao Yan's father.

408
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,780
For his departure

409
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,940
Xiao Yan feels no worse than you do.

410
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,940
But because he is your brother

411
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,300
It's your family

412
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,900
So he kept telling himself not to give up and to be strong.

413
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,980
He wanted to share this pain with you so much

414
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,140
Why don't you give him a chance?

415
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,860
Where is Xu Zhen?

416
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,300
Haven't you come to work yet?

417
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,520
I've made several calls.

418
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,700
But no one received

419
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,400
He only invited his family to Professor Xu's funeral.

420
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,400
It's been so long.

421
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,340
I don't know how long Xu Zhen will be sad.

422
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,460
Then I'll go to Xu Zhen's house first, boss.

423
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,820
Today, the City of Time arranged a grand finale.

424
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,820
After the filming, you and your son will participate in an interview together.

425
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,580
These schedules can't be without this male protagonist

426
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,180
Why don't you finish the shooting first? Let's go.

427
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,820
Uh, boss.

428
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,860
Do you want to change your eyeshadow?

429
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,400
oh

430
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,800
Hello, small town

431
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,280
How's it going over there now?

432
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,660
When can you come to work?

433
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,060
We

434
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,540
Especially Boss Gu is very worried about you.

435
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,700
It's Yu, thank you.

436
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,700
but

437
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,620
I probably won't go back to work.

438
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,700
Hey Xiao Zhan, don't be impulsive

439
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,460
Tell me something

440
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,820
I have no impulse

441
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,060
only me

442
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,900
Figured out some things

443
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,620
I was racking my brains because of the most important person in my life, my father.

444
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,740
Want to enter Gaia to build two islands

445
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,540
But I've lost him now.

446
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,860
Then what's the point of me staying in Gaia?

447
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,060
I have never been very good at my job as Shi Yuge's assistant

448
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,660
But it's over now

449
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,340
I won't cause you and your boss so much trouble in the future. Hey, Xu Zhen, wait a minute.

450
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,320
You can't just say it's over.

451
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,620
Do you know that you

452
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,180
Hello Xu Zhan

453
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,700
Where are you? Give me blood right now

454
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,540
It's over when it's over

455
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,440
Without permission

456
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,260
Why do you make decisions on your own?

457
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,220
boss

458
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,340
I want to quit

459
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,500
You were the one who fought so hard to be my assistant.

460
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,860
You're quitting your job before the film is even finished.

461
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,580
What if I resign?

462
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,400
Able to return in person

463
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,740
City time travel?

464
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,220
What will resignation change?

465
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,780
Just a small assistant

466
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,140
One grab is a handful

467
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,900
No one said you have to

468
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,180
I'll give you three seconds to think about it.

469
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,080
3

470
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,020
2

471
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,020
1

472
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,840
Xu Zhen

473
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,900
you are fired

474
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,760
oath

475
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,300
Find me a new assistant right away.

476
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,820
What are the requirements

477
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,900
Don't be the kind that smiles stupidly

478
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,780
Don't be the type who likes to wear sportswear

479
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,860
Don't want someone with strong wilderness survival skills.

480
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,620
Don't be the kind who only cares about dinosaurs

481
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,620
Especially don't be the kind of person who is so strong that he can sprint 100 meters without taking a breath just to buy a cup of coffee.

482
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,220
I understand, just don't marry someone like that.

483
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,560
Shi Jun I always thought Xu Zhen was a lively girl

484
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,840
This is the first time I heard his arrogant voice.

485
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,980
I'm a little worried.

486
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,540
Losing a father is a big blow to anyone.

487
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,340
What's more, it's Xu Zhen

488
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,020
From the last time he sent me a WeChat message about Huoshan Yan

489
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,500
Professor Xu in Xu Zhen's heart

490
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,220
It does have a significant impact

491
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,620
dad

492
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,780
if you can

493
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,100
I want to use these precious fossils

494
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,300
In exchange for you to come back to me
