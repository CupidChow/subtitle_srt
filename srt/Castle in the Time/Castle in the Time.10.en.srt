1
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,180
ah

2
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
ah

3
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
ah

4
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,220
Is this okay for today?

5
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,260
Boss, go find someone to plug it in.

6
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,740
Hahaha, come here, here I come.

7
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,700
I'm coming, I'm coming to catch you.

8
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,380
I am coming

9
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,160
ah

10
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,540
Ahhh

11
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,540
Almost

12
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,180
OKNext

13
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,180
Come and have a laugh

14
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,340
Good looking camera

15
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,660
OK

16
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,540
Thank you, Brother Gucci

17
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,700
Thank you, Brother Gu Chijun

18
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,620
Look at the camera and smile

19
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,060
Thank you for your courtesy, brother Gu Chijun.

20
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,060
Brother Gu Chijun, can you kiss me?

21
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,340
You are the naughty kid who asked for a kiss in the video, right?

22
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,720
I think there's no problem, don't you think?

23
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,100
It's Jun brother

24
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,660
Of course no problem

25
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,680
Thanks for the story, Brother Jin is awesome.

26
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,180
Really a big star with the most affinity

27
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,000
Jun brother, what do you like to eat? If you don't want to eat, Jun brother, what do you like to drink?

28
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,700
Brother Bu Chijun, I want to play with Xiaojunjun, why didn't you bring him here?

29
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,500
I'll perform a magic trick for you

30
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,220
Delicious and fun things will come to you.

31
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,900
123 Wooden Man

32
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,200
Do you like this dinosaur?

33
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,100
I like this dinosaur that can talk.

34
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,420
Hahahaha, I am a Tyrannosaurus Rex. You are so bad. Auntie, I want you to give me money.

35
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,960
Well

36
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,580
Is this all the money you have?

37
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,580
yes

38
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,640
But this money is only enough to buy this little dinosaur that can't talk

39
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,480
The talking dinosaur can also record

40
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,060
The price is more expensive

41
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,260
Hey kid

42
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,460
Why did you all run to the small supermarket?

43
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,560
Brother Guo Chijun is very nice

44
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,720
Give us money to buy snacks and toys

45
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,440
You mean the money that Brother Gu Chijun gave you?

46
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,080
Yes, then why are you still not happy? I want this dinosaur

47
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,140
But the money given by Gu Chijun's brother is not enough

48
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,260
Warm man Gu Chijun is not warm

49
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,060
Reception boy show

50
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,380
Gu Chijun uses money to get rid of his little fans

51
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,960
Showing warmth

52
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,260
what's the situation

53
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,180
Boss, why are you turning off the phone at this time?

54
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,880
Hello Xu Zhen, come to the company right away

55
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,300
The army is out

56
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,140
I'm already downstairs. I'll be there soon.

57
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,700
Hello, Miss Li, I am Zhang Shiyu

58
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,700
The news you published was completely a deliberate attempt to smear our family.

59
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,580
You must help more

60
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,420
Okay, then I'll thank you first, Sister Li.

61
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,060
Okay, okay, okay.

62
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,540
Hello, Editor-in-Chief Xiao

63
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,140
I am Zhang Shiyu

64
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,220
How can you publish such a letter?

65
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,340
This is totally irresponsible behavior.

66
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,300
good

67
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,940
No problem, I'll arrange a special one for you next time.

68
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,140
As soon as possible

69
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,380
What should I do now, Shi Yu?

70
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,860
Is it time to contact?

71
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,260
The boss's phone is turned off

72
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,120
so

73
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,580
You should collect information first and see the emotional development.

74
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,960
Why

75
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,740
Um

76
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,020
No response for now

77
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,220
No way. What is no way?

78
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,420
You listen carefully

79
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,620
I don't want to hear the three words "no way"

80
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,220
Now the reporter only took pictures of the children and did not take pictures of 59

81
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,820
Of course, there is still room for further study.

82
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,300
Hello

83
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,820
ah

84
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,140
An advertising department

85
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,780
Not Zhang Shiyu

86
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,620
I see

87
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,620
I'll handle the contract.

88
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,220
Sorry to bother you guys.

89
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,140
Master, where are you?

90
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,280
Hello

91
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
ah

92
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,240
We will solve the problem and it won't affect us.

93
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,380
Which one is it this time?

94
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,460
Fashionable and leisurely, they said the cover should be refreshing

95
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,300
I am Zhang Shiyu

96
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,780
Substitution

97
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,780
Okay, listen carefully.

98
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Change it now, give it to me immediately

99
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,940
I won't shoot even if you ask me to.

100
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,240
What are you doing?

101
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,620
It's so noisy on the weekend

102
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,760
You're so wild, do you know how long I can find you?

103
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,980
You still have the energy to sleep in there?

104
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,220
Why don't you sleep on the weekend?

105
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,700
Boss Guo

106
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,460
You thought you did a perfect job yesterday, but now you may have some imperfect results.

107
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,720
Take a look

108
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,460
It's too cold. It's troublesome now.

109
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,380
The reporter just kept asking about the money you gave him.

110
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,620
and

111
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,820
Love talk is very disadvantageous to teammates

112
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,840
I have already informed the company.

113
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,580
The news cooperation party also agreed to remove some related news

114
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,360
But a few advertisers still called and said they wanted to reconsider some contract issues.

115
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,540
Anyway, the situation is very unfavorable to us now.

116
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,340
The speed of turning black is very fast

117
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,180
Don't be so nervous.

118
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,540
What happened?

119
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,020
Let's find a way to deal with him.

120
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,740
What you need to do

121
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,100
It's behind me.

122
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
good

123
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,700
I have a solution

124
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,460
But it needs two steps

125
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,320
First, since the reporter said that Gu Chijun spent money to buy off young fans

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,020
We can continue to talk about

127
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,580
Let's say Chijun is going to take the kids to visit the Dinosaur Museum

128
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,780
But before that, let the children buy dinosaur toys to learn about them in advance.

129
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,500
This is the first step

130
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,020
The second step

131
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,300
Since we have said that before,

132
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,660
Boss Gu

133
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,700
You should really take your children to visit the dinosaur museum

134
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:58,360
Xu Zhen, what I need you to do is to give our boss Gu a vivid lesson on dinosaur fossils.

135
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,240
To explain to the children

136
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,320
By that time, the negative fine lines will naturally dissolve.

137
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,220
Let Xu Zhen teach me

138
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,980
Let him be my teacher

139
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,220
It's impossible. Even if all the dinosaurs were resurrected, it's impossible.

140
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
Let me teach him about dinosaurs

141
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,580
Brother Shiyu, are you sure?

142
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,860
But Boss Gu doesn't seem to be able to cooperate at all.

143
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,920
snort

144
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,440
Xu Zhen, this requires your efforts, but don't worry.

145
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,980
I will help you

146
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,380
Boss Gu

147
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,600
Because both of your employees work so hard.

148
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,760
I beg you

149
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,700
Why don't you just give us some vivid dinosaur fossil lessons?

150
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,440
Are you going to teach me how to draw?

151
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,940
Still need to teach me about dinosaurs?

152
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,280
Student Gu Zhijun

153
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,920
Now is your time for tutoring.

154
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,460
Please don't judge the teacher's teaching tools.

155
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,540
We are going to take the children to a natural history museum

156
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,920
The focus is on the dinosaur exhibition hall inside

157
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,500
So you just need to know the facts about dinosaurs.

158
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,760
First, dinosaurs appeared about 245 million years ago.

159
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,060
Seven reptiles from the Mesozoic Era that suddenly became extinct 65 million years ago

160
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,420
Sudden extinction

161
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,340
Could it be aliens?

162
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,180
How about you teach me some knowledge about aliens?

163
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,820
I tell the kids

164
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,680
The disappearance of dinosaurs remains a mystery

165
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,940
We won't discuss this with the children in the museum for now.

166
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,220
We just need to introduce dinosaurs to a few children who are interested in them.

167
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,540
For example, Tyrannosaurus Rex

168
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,140
Tyrannosaurus Rex is also called Tyrannosaurus

169
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,220
Alias ​​Rex

170
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,300
Isn't this the nickname someone gave me?

171
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,640
us

172
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,980
We still need to focus on the key points

173
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,920
Well, there is still a lot of other knowledge about Tyrannosaurus Rex that you urgently need to know.

174
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,160
For example, Tyrannosaurus Rex is a dinosaur whose hind limbs are much more developed than its forelimbs.

175
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,060
Why

176
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,940
Uh, because the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus Rex were not often used.

177
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,760
The only time you might use your forelimbs is when

178
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,140
When they reproduce

179
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,860
Please don't think about scenes that are not suitable for children, okay?

180
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,660
So besides Tyrannosaurus?

181
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,380
There is also Mamensilong that children like.

182
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,140
I have no interest in Marvin Xilong.

183
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,680
Oh, I'm so hungry.

184
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,180
My energy is now

185
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,780
The health bar above the head has been cleared.

186
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,040
Assistant Xu

187
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,380
Could you please go downstairs and buy me some food?

188
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,780
ah

189
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,780
OK

190
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,900
no problem

191
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,500
You gave me the chance to go.

192
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,580
Don't blame me

193
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,660
I have studied seriously.

194
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,380
Mr. Wu bought some food.

195
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,020
Mr. Wu

196
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,380
I bought Mr. Guo's food.

197
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,180
Mr. Gu

198
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,219
where

199
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,178
Dear Teacher Xu Zhen

200
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,899
I'm so tired today.

201
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,878
I can’t eat the food bought by the teacher anymore

202
00:17:17,878 --> 00:17:19,778
Please digest it yourself, teacher.

203
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,358
I'm going home first

204
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,138
Teacher, don't be too late.

205
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,579
Watch out for dinosaur resurrection

206
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,779
Run away secretly

207
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,520
Why

208
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,740
Little dinosaurs

209
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,700
I know we haven't played together for a long time.

210
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,020
Wait for me, wait for me to fulfill my father's wish and then I will come back to find you.

211
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,060
How to light up

212
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,580
Could it be that Gu Chijun knew that the guilt had returned?

213
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,540
Gu Zhijun, please come out

214
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,380
Lipstick Pigment

215
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,020
Gu Chijun, are you childish?

216
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,780
Why

217
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,140
Forgiveness again

218
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,620
Fu Zhijun, can you be a little more creative?

219
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,900
Come out to me quickly

220
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,900
This isn't fun at all

221
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,500
Gu Chijun

222
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,420
Stop playing this game, Gu Chijun

223
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,280
Gu Chijun

224
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,620
Gu Chijun, please come out quickly

225
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,860
Gu Chijun

226
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,780
Gu Chijun

227
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,140
Gu Zhijun, are you hiding in there?

228
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,380
You'd better not carry me on your back.

229
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,660
More than just the militaryMore than just the military

230
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,220
Stop it, open the door

231
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,740
Not only the military

232
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,540
Not only the army, you open the door. Not only the army

233
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,540
Open the door quickly Gu Zhijun

234
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,540
Stop it, Gu Zhijun, open the door

235
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,820
Gu Zhijun

236
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,820
Juanjuan

237
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Juanjuan

238
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,860
Stay at home and feel comfortable.

239
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,420
Don't need me

240
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,860
Being tired and exhausted outside

241
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,060
Even an assistant has my orders, don't you think?

242
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,560
Um

243
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,140
You want to know why I came back?

244
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,700
Of course I came back to find you something to eat.

245
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,580
Go find it for you.

246
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,380
Look where your food is.

247
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,980
Xiaojunjun, I'll find some dog food for you.

248
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,760
Um

249
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,580
This Xu Zhen

250
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,780
Where do you put the dog food?

251
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,060
Xiaojunjun

252
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Ko Toshun

253
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,380
otherwise

254
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,260
Let's call Xu Zhen.

255
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,140
Where did he put the dog food?

256
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,380
You said if he knew

257
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,380
If I go back home to rest, will I get angry?

258
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,540
What if he gets angry and doesn't tell me where the dog food is?

259
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,580
You can't blame me

260
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,820
You must be very hungry, right?

261
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,320
You must want to eat something.

262
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,540
Let's go find Xu Zhen

263
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,140
Why don't you ask him where he put the dog food?

264
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,980
By the way, why didn't he answer the boss's call?

265
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,140
Yeah, go.

266
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,500
Gu Chijun, please open the door

267
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,540
Gu Chijun

268
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,820
Open the door quickly, Gu Chijun

269
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,160
Xu Zhen

270
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,420
Junjun, let's go find Xu Zhen together

271
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,880
Xu Zhen

272
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,160
Xu Zhen

273
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,000
Xu Zhen

274
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,440
Xu Zhen

275
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,960
Xu Zhen

276
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,580
Xu Zhen, are you up there?

277
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,880
Xu Zhen

278
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,280
Xu Zhen

279
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,240
Xu Zhen

280
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,480
Xu Zhen

281
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,920
Xu Zhen

282
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,220
In here

283
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,120
It's me

284
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,540
Xiao Junjun, Xiao Junjun, is it you who found me?

285
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,920
I know I didn't love you in vain

286
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,700
You just acted like a superhero

287
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,980
It was me who rescued you.

288
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,980
Guan Xiaojun, what's going on?

289
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,600
The first person I saw was Xiaojunjun

290
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,820
Instead of seeing you, Gu Chijun

291
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,020
You are so stupid

292
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,340
The troubled doctor who was trapped in the room and injured

293
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,900
If you thank me

294
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,060
I wouldn't mind having my personal doctor take a look at you.

295
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,780
How could I get hurt when I'm so agile?

296
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,980
You are so agile yet you are locked in the house

297
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:26,380
I have to wonder if you are my assistant and are deliberately creating trouble to attract my attention.

298
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,660
Maybe the last time you felt it was too good

299
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,460
Makes you want to come again

300
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,340
But I tell you

301
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,940
No chance

302
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,760
Because you are not injured today

303
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,540
So I won't carry you anymore.

304
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,340
The problem is that you are still pretending to be pure and clearing yourself

305
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,160
If you hadn't been playing a prank

306
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,060
Will I be locked up in a dark room?

307
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,700
Do bad things and be good people

308
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,740
He is indeed a famous actor.

309
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,180
I didn't play any pranks

310
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,020
I just went home

311
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,700
No, not you

312
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,100
Who would that be?

313
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,700
That, those, and these are all

314
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,220
It must be man-made.

315
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,740
I think

316
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,260
It must be my loyal fans who saw you getting too close to me.

317
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,500
So I'm just playing a prank to scare you

318
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,960
Why target me?

319
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,700
I'm just your assistant, not your girlfriend.

320
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,700
How do I know this?

321
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,160
so

322
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,480
To prevent the same thing from happening again next time

323
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,780
You better be careful.

324
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,340
Thank you for coming and saving me just now

325
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,860
Thank you

326
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,940
Let's go to the monitoring room.

327
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,420
See if there are any clues

328
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,360
Excuse me

329
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,900
There's really no reason

330
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,440
Sorry, Mr. Gu Shijun

331
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
The camera that can capture the studio is broken

332
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,320
No surveillance video

333
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,140
Excuse me

334
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,340
This is too coincidental.

335
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,380
Do you remember what I always told you before?

336
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,180
Life is like playing cards

337
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,260
The most important thing before placing a bet is to see clearly the chips in other people’s hands.

338
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,820
Xu Zhen just greeted you in the elevator before.

339
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,900
How much does he know about you?

340
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,500
We don't know yet

341
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,420
You've messed up.

342
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,320
Try to scare him smartly

343
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,340
Do you think this will scare him away?

344
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,980
You have done this now

345
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,460
I wish the whole world knew

346
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,920
Are you afraid that Xu Zhen isn't suspicious enough?

347
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,860
alright

348
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,180
From now on

349
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,220
Stop acting on your own.

350
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,780
I'll handle this matter.

351
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,180
Can someone explain to me what happened last night?

352
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Probably someone who is not interested in dinosaurs.

353
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,260
A masterpiece by a die-hard fan of a big star who wants to bring his children to the Natural History Museum.

354
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,740
Being such an excellent artist

355
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,900
Always causing trouble to people around you

356
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,380
I'm really sorry

357
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,040
We're leaving soon.

358
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,760
Today, I met the children directly at the Dinosaur Museum.

359
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,460
I have arranged an interview with a reporter

360
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,400
Qu Zhen, what you need to do is to manage the children well when the reporters are interviewing them.

361
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,540
I don't want anyone to talk about our family training anymore.

362
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,480
But it keeps going.

363
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,700
What if you don't learn about dinosaurs?

364
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,460
I probably know more than before.

365
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,500
Know more about it

366
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,820
I not only know that dinosaurs lived for more than 200 million years

367
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,460
I also know that Tyrannosaurus Rex is also known as Tyrannosaurus Rex.

368
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,620
Know more

369
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,540
Other forelimbs

370
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,860
Difference between the hind limbs

371
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,100
Is there any difference?

372
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,560
A frequently used

373
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,900
A not often used

374
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,020
Boss Gu is a very capable director.

375
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,000
Okay, I'm ready.

376
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,300
We are about to set off

377
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:21,120
Don't worry, as an artist, I also have the responsibility to make my colleagues around me not worry.

378
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,340
I'll go get ready.

379
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,260
Come on, follow me closely.

380
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,660
Follow me, go slower.

381
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,400
Come on, kids, one by one.

382
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,480
Now we can see Fuji Jun leading the children into the dinosaur park one by one.

383
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,280
Pavilion

384
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,060
Children

385
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,380
This is the dinosaur museum I'm going to take you to visit.

386
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,540
These are dinosaur belts.

387
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,060
You can take a look.

388
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,220
His neck is so long

389
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,220
Is the story brother as long as corn?

390
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,980
His tail is longer

391
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,000
Story brother, his tail is long

392
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,980
Or maybe his neck is long?

393
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,040
Did his mother lengthen his tail?

394
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,820
Is it like us, where we don't even get out of bed and are pulled up by our mothers?

395
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,540
The largest dinosaur in front of you

396
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,580
Mamensi dinosaur

397
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,420
What does brother Guo Zhijun eat?

398
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,700
Haha

399
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,380
He eats plants.

400
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,100
How's your teaching?

401
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,260
This truth is being tested

402
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,680
When was the heaviest Mamesi dinosaur alive?

403
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,420
Weight up to 60 tons

404
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,000
So is your move still big?

405
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,060
How many elephants are there in one dinosaur?

406
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,100
Ah, the weight of a Manmenxilong is equal to the weight of 4 elephants.

407
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,380
Do you know why Mamencilong is called this name?

408
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,660
Because he found a magical place in a place called Mamensi

409
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,820
His neck is the longest among all dinosaurs.

410
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,340
Can I tie a bow for a long one? Can I tie two?

411
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,380
After pouring two, you can give me another one with a wet wipe.

412
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,880
Aa ...

413
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,860
Very cool

414
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,740
Children, look at those dinosaurs.

415
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,580
Is it true that money is given to children in kindergarten?

416
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,440
Mr. Guo, why did you give money to the child?

417
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,740
Have you considered the negative impact on this child?

418
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,340
What do you think about people saying you are a fake warm man online?

419
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,740
I believe everyone has seen it.

420
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,779
It is my honor to have so many lovely fans.

421
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,100
Yes, I will not let you down.

422
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,180
Regardless of the age of fans

423
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,820
I won't discriminate.

424
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,980
I hope everyone can recognize Gu Chijun with their own eyes.

425
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,099
Rather than listening to rumors

426
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,480
Okay, today's question.

427
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,340
Here, Mr. Gu mainly brought the children to visit the Dinosaur Museum to learn about history.

428
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,580
I am also very grateful to all media friends for their strong support to Chijun.

429
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,400
Thank you so much

430
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,180
I have thanks

431
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,260
Thanks, I want to touch it.

432
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,239
Really not moving.

433
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,419
So fast

434
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,140
But they don't move.

435
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,420
They yo

436
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,780
The silly teacher was talking about specimens. I didn't expect Xu Zhen to know quite a lot. What did he know?

437
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,820
Don’t you think it’s amazing?

438
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,160
You have a good eye for assistants.

439
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,120
of course

440
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,340
I personally picked Xu Zhen.

441
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,320
The manuscript and video will be posted today.

442
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,240
What about your warm man or not?

443
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,760
It's a smooth solution.

444
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,980
But this time

445
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,340
Thanks to Xiaozhen.

446
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,940
Look at that dinosaur tooth.

447
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,940
Xiaojuan, let me take you out to play

448
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,060
My bag needs me more now

449
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,780
Just leave this stuff to me.

450
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,180
Hey

451
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,540
Hello

452
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,300
Please prepare one for me.

453
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,620
Latest Backpacks

454
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,820
Yeah, thank you.

455
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,220
Hey, this is the store in the town.

456
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,200
Hello sir, please show me your membership card

457
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,160
I'll make an appointment for you.

458
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,480
Do I need to make an appointment to visit your store?

459
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,440
Hey, I really like the design of your store. Can we go in and buy something?

460
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,980
Sorry, I really can't

461
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,060
Don't be so exaggerated.

462
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,180
I like my bag very much. I'll just have to find a way to fix it. Let's go.

463
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,260
Oh, isn't it just a membership card? I'll take care of it.

464
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,760
Hello, hello brother

465
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,480
Do you have a membership card?

466
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,620
Lend it to me.

467
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,020
What are you going there for?

468
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,600
You are the main character, right? You know a lot about it, do you come here often?

469
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,500
Then buy me one.

470
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,420
I bought it because I needed it for work.

471
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,540
If you want to buy it, then stop asking so many questions and just tell me whether you will give it to me or not.

472
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,420
Ask for rogue

473
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,300
Go talk to Eglan.

474
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,380
Okay, okay, I've already said hello, just go get it.

475
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,660
My brother is the only one in the world who is doing well. Thank you, brother.

476
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,180
Xiao Zhen is done now, we can go in. Let's go in.

477
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,520
Hey, this bag is pretty good and practical, right?

478
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,660
what do you think

479
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,380
Just him

480
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,620
Hey, is my brother in there? It's easy to walk in there.

481
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,220
elder brother

482
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,180
Thank you Mr. Lin for the money for the bag

483
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:05,980
Hey, Xiaozhen, what are you talking about? Isn't it normal for a brother to make a reservation for his younger brother?

484
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,860
exactly

485
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,260
Don't take this little gift to heart.

486
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,180
If you want to thank someone, thank Xiao Xiu.

487
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,240
It's his intention.

488
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,500
Yes, you should thank me for all these things in this small town, not my brother.

489
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,740
Hi, have we met somewhere?

490
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,560
ah

491
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:39,060
Xiao Qiu, I forgot to introduce him. He is a chef we often work with.

492
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,940
Dad really likes his water art

493
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:45,140
He also helped a lot this time while lying on the ground

494
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,520
No wonder he looks so familiar. I've seen him lying on the ground before.

495
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,560
I have an impression of you

496
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,900
Your cooking skills are very good

497
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,380
Oh, I remember that I saw you at the party.

498
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,960
I was wondering why it looked so familiar.

499
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,060
Haha, no wonder you're obsessed with him because you're too greedy

500
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,560
Oh, by the way, has the master's revenge been settled? Yes, it has been paid in full to Mr. Lin.

501
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,420
That's good. Mr. Lin, I'm leaving first.

502
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,660
You go, thank you.

503
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,540
Thank you, Mr. Lin. I will leave first.

504
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,660
Hey, Xiao Chen, I'll look for you later.

505
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,620
Thank you so much for not helping me today.

506
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,960
Don't thank me for little things.

507
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,960
I hope that one day you can ask me to help you deliver a package to Xu Jun at work. It's not a small matter.

508
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,220
very important

509
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,900
Brother I

510
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,340
I think I'm in love with Xu Zhen

511
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,280
Hot

512
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,340
Yes, so you must help me more in the future, just like today, so handsome ha

513
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,140
I'm not handsome every day.

514
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,660
Besides, whether I am handsome or not has nothing to do with you.

515
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,320
My brother is handsome, doesn't that mean I am handsome?

516
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,080
My brother is rich, which means I am rich.

517
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,220
Anyway, I will definitely hold on to you, this big tree, and I will not let go.

518
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,680
Oh, okay, okay

519
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,640
Then you go ahead and do your work

520
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,700
I have something else to do, so I'll go find Xu Zhen first. Bye.

521
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,420
You also heard what Xiaoxiu said just now, right?

522
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,700
I think he really likes Xu Zhen

523
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,460
And he didn't recognize you today.

524
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,140
I think you don't need to target Xu Zhen anymore.
