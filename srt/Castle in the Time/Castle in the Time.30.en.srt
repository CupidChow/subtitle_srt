1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,340
The pain of time is always visible in the corner of my eyes

2
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,680
Hey, that

3
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,480
This is the crew

4
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,280
I am safe

5
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,060
You don't have to follow me.

6
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,460
Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way

7
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
Hello

8
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,880
What are you doing?

9
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,660
Didn't you see we were filming?

10
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,320
Where are the crew members? Where are the crew members?

11
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,260
Where are the people?

12
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,340
Don't deal with it quickly.

13
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,640
Oh, sorry.

14
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,740
These people behind me are not extras

15
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,180
He's my bodyguard.

16
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,460
bodyguard

17
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,000
No, who hired this bodyguard?

18
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,760
It delayed our filming progress.

19
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,820
Or should we ask them to leave first?

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,880
I sent these bodyguards to protect Xu Zhen.

21
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,740
So they can't leave

22
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,980
Since Mr. Kobayashi's decision will not change

23
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,540
Then we can only ask Xu Zhen

24
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,940
Please step away for a while.

25
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,160
oh

26
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,500
Why am I avoiding it?

27
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,960
Can Xiao Xiu remove the bodyguards?

28
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,380
I can't do anything if they follow me like this.

29
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,040
How can that be possible?

30
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,440
Hey, that man in black is so weird, who knows when he will appear again

31
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,940
What did I do to hurt you?

32
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,560
Even if there are men in black, I still think these bodyguards should be removed.

33
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,600
We can't give up on good things just because bad things might happen in the world.

34
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,300
They've been following me around like this and it's seriously affecting my work.

35
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:23,300
All these bodyguards should be removed from my place.

36
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,220
The task of protecting Xu Zhen

37
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,540
Just leave it to my boyfriend.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Xu Zhen was your assistant before, that was just a temporary solution

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,780
In order not to cause resentment among fans

40
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,900
Now fans are blessing our love

41
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,620
So he should go back to the one he loves.

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,700
I object

43
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,300
How can you have the heart to abandon such a good boss like me?

44
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,060
invalid objection

45
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,420
What boss?

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,940
Can it be more important than a boyfriend or boss?

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,900
The earliest first-class cabin

48
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,620
Thank you Xu Chen

49
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,380
Now the first thing I want to come back to is

50
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,740
Just elope with me

51
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,680
elopement

52
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,600
Let's hold hands

53
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,860
Let's go see all the beautiful scenery in the world together

54
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,220
How about it

55
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,140
What scenery are you going to see?

56
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,820
Wake up, I have to go to work.

57
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,660
Even if you don't want to see the scenery

58
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,220
How about we go on a fossil tour?

59
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,340
We can go to Mongolia

60
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,120
Tanzania

61
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,300
Sichuan and Yunnan

62
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,180
Go find your favorite fossils

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,560
ah

64
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,980
Hey, are you okay? It's okay. Thank you. I'll issue the ticket right away. Thank you.

65
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,780
Let me help you

66
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,660
Boss Gu, Xiaozhen doesn't seem to be interested in your archaeological trip.

67
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,380
That's it

68
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,180
The flight tickets and accommodation have been arranged. Just leave on time.

69
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,980
Thank you for your hard work.

70
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,880
Are you really going to take him away?

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,240
I thought you were joking.

72
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,220
Where are you going?

73
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,020
I am also worried about the man in black you just mentioned.

74
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,100
I'm afraid Xu Zhen will cause more harm if he stays here.

75
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,020
So I have to take him away

76
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey Chi Jing

77
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,640
Why don't you tell him?

78
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,080
It's all because Lin Jianyang told us to leave within 24 hours

79
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,460
Otherwise, I won't let you go.

80
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,700
In online practice

81
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,340
His brother is his role model.

82
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,380
Think of your role models

83
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,860
The hero in my mind is a bad guy

84
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,820
How big of a blow was this to him?

85
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,700
Before 12 noon tomorrow

86
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,060
Xu Zhen and Gu Chijun

87
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,300
Must leave the city

88
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,460
If you don't leave

89
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,860
Just do it.

90
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,820
Enough to hold the army

91
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,360
You kept pestering me when you came back from the crew. When we got home, you started packing your clothes.

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,440
What on earth are you going to do?

93
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,700
Stop it for me

94
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,900
Didn't I say that I would have a true love?

95
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,860
A lifetime prehistoric love journey?

96
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,140
We have to get started quickly.

97
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
Who wants to love you sincerely for a lifetime? I don't want to kiss your hairy hands.

98
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,420
I don't want to leave the crew either. I think it's good here. I don't want to go anywhere else.

99
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,360
But there are men in black here.

100
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,620
But the last time I was able to lead you to the morgue and scare you

101
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,540
The last time I was able to cause a gas incident and hurt you

102
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,540
Next time, they might kidnap you and send you to an uninhabited island to let you die.

103
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,660
Are not you afraid

104
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,960
I am the forest princess of the paleontology department.

105
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,780
Fauvism

106
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,280
Would I be afraid of a tiny human being?

107
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,860
And your part hasn't been finished yet.

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,580
What will happen to the movie if you leave?

109
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,740
Don't worry, I will handle this matter.

110
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,680
Why

111
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,420
So you wear c

112
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,680
you

113
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,540
Sister, you and brother Chi Jun actually like to play such a large-scale game

114
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,720
Neurosis, shut up!

115
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,020
You all get out of here

116
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,980
It's so embarrassing.

117
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,220
Brother Chen Jun, my sister is too violent

118
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,860
But once my sister sold it

119
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,500
Should not be returned

120
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,300
You don't have a chance to regret.

121
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,700
Xiao Yan

122
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,460
Do you remember my living room?

123
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,500
Ninjago Series

124
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,940
Tai Chi Ling 10189

125
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,680
Xiao Yan

126
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,660
I've been with your sister for a while.

127
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,460
I've never traveled with her.

128
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,260
So I really want to take her out this time

129
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,540
But she just wouldn't cooperate

130
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,540
Well, I'll help you deal with him.

131
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,300
Do you want me to knock him out, tie him up, and send him to the airport for you?

132
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,660
Ah, this is not necessary.

133
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,480
I just need you to help me pack your sister's luggage and send it to the airport.

134
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,300
I'll take care of your sister.

135
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,700
After the event

136
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,780
You can choose the Lego in my living room

137
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,260
No problem with the deal

138
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,620
It's all up to me.

139
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,260
I often have out-of-print Lego, but it's not often I have it.

140
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,920
Sister, please forgive me for betraying my happiness this time.

141
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,100
It's up to you

142
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,920
What are you two secretly plotting?

143
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,980
Nothing at all

144
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Xu Zhen

145
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,980
Don't be angry with me.

146
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,660
Gu Zhijun I won't pack my luggage

147
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,560
The man in black has not been solved yet.

148
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,360
Filming is not over yet

149
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,680
I can't leave

150
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,860
Besides, don’t I have a boyfriend to protect me?

151
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,140
I know you don't have to worry about anything because you have a great boyfriend like me.

152
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,380
But since you have rejected my true love, my life journey

153
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,540
Then can you promise me a one-day trip of true love?

154
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,460
What the hell is this, sister?

155
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,340
What Chijun meant was

156
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,780
Uh, play a passionate little game

157
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,940
For example, upgrade the mini game you just played in the room.

158
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,140
Xu Zhen

159
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,300
This is definitely a pure love and pure food

160
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,820
Can you promise?

161
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,820
Your boyfriend I

162
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,860
Help me fulfill 3 wishes

163
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,020
Hey boss

164
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,620
Please come to me 2

165
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,340
200 lamb skewers

166
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,420
Ah, not the boss.

167
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,020
Ah, 20 lamb skewers, 20 beef skewers, two chicken wings, two bottles of beer. OK, please wait a moment.

168
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,700
This is the correct way to fry.

169
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,980
The boss probably hasn't encountered such a fluctuating ordering style as yours.

170
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,820
I used to come here often to eat kebabs and drink beer. Beer and kebabs are the true meaning of life.

171
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,180
I want to know why you come here to eat skewers

172
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,900
Even though I'm a big star

173
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,260
But I also have to experience the joy of ordinary people

174
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,660
Yeah, experience them.

175
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,220
Ordinary life is boring if I stay in the room all day.

176
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,300
Yeah, that

177
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,780
What is the first wish?

178
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,500
Be careful when lifting your feet

179
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,780
Yes

180
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,620
be careful

181
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,140
Lift your feet again

182
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,900
good

183
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,280
alright

184
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,420
You can open your eyes.

185
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,580
Aa ...

186
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,380
These are all our photos.

187
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,020
I remember when my father first taught me how to make specimens, he said

188
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,580
Specimens are gifts from nature and time

189
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,940
Time stops on the specimen

190
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,780
Let people who see the specimens receive natural signals

191
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,340
Then they were cracked one by one by people

192
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,700
The dead specimen came back to life

193
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,980
You said this late at night

194
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,900
I always feel like I'm panicking

195
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,660
It turns out that having a girlfriend who studies paleontology is such an amazing feeling

196
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,700
Photographs are also a type of specimen.

197
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,460
All these photos

198
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,560
What is retained is the signal of emotion

199
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,620
I received your feelings from the photo

200
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,300
I barely accept this explanation.

201
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,460
But what I want to share with you today is not paleontology

202
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,140
It's astronomy

203
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,240
Gu Zhijuan

204
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,820
Is this your third wish?

205
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,960
Um

206
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,540
Be with your loved ones

207
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,659
Find a Quiet Place

208
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,180
Let's look up at the starry sky together

209
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,379
What a romantic thing

210
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,100
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

211
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,540
I have a boyfriend who likes to surprise people.

212
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,860
It feels very strange too.

213
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,120
Gu Chijun

214
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,560
Gu ChijunGu Chijun

215
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,500
Why did you open the door?

216
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,200
Gu ChijunGu Chijun

217
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,440
You don't have any wishes to fulfill, right?

218
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,260
Open the door

219
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,980
Gu Chijun, open the door.

220
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,860
I want to watch the stars with you

221
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,140
I also want to live an ordinary life with you

222
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,220
But my biggest wish now

223
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,180
Just to ensure my girlfriend's safety

224
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,740
You stay in there.

225
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,760
I'll come back to pick you up.

226
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,200
Gu Zhijun, please don't leave.

227
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,020
Don't go, don't go.

228
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,520
Please open the door for me quickly

229
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,500
come back quickly

230
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,420
Gu Zhijun

231
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,020
Gu Zhijun

232
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,780
Come back Guo Zhijun

233
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,860
Guo Zhijun

234
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
October

235
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,020
Do you really want to go?

236
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,560
As my agent

237
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,660
You should go there early to help me prepare everything

238
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,980
But this time the matter is more urgent

239
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,620
So we go first

240
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,340
Come back in a few days.

241
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,060
We I

242
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,460
I want to go too.

243
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,980
Then aren't Shanshan and I in a transnational relationship?

244
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
I feel guilty enough for not telling him about this.

245
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,260
You still want me to go? Aren't you trying to break us up?

246
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,400
Besides, we had already agreed on this.

247
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,240
Be Honest with One Another

248
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,460
No Secrets

249
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,380
I wouldn't mind putting all your ex-girlfriends' information into a collection

250
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,740
Send all to WeChat

251
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,900
Boss, you threatened me

252
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,060
Hey, what are you talking about? Hurry up and leave

253
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,940
OK, then I will accept WeChat

254
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,940
Brother

255
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,800
You must have taken great pains to hide the students in this place.

256
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,460
But the problem is people.

257
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,740
Gu Zhijun, you actually put me here

258
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,300
But have you forgotten that I am a little athlete?

259
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,180
Still want to trap me?

260
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,740
gone

261
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,180
Hey, let me come and help you. Okay.

262
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,340
Put that over there.

263
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,580
This way, right?

264
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,900
Ah, I see.

265
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,780
Oh, Xiaorui,

266
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,620
Why is Xu Zhen still here?

267
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,460
Didn't he just arrive?

268
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,780
You must take Xu Zhen away within 24 hours

269
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,480
From now on, I will no longer ask about the things I should love

270
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,940
After all, I believe

271
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,860
I am also the toughest opponent you have ever met.

272
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,460
If you want to squeeze out all the things that need to be suppressed

273
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,700
For the pressure

274
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,220
For the company

275
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,420
What will I do?

276
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,300
I think you can't bear it

277
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,700
Xu Zhen couldn't bear it even more.

278
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,460
Oh, just put that over there.

279
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,140
OK

280
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,540
What

281
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,300
Xu Zhen is still on the set

282
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,500
Well

283
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,580
Let's do this plan tonight.

284
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,100
Gucci

285
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,100
You breached the contract first.

286
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,660
Don't blame me for being late.

287
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,980
Since you can't make Xu Zhen disappear

288
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,460
Then I'll help you.

289
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,360
Hey Xu Zhen

290
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,500
Hello, Gu Chijun

291
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
Did you see the note?

292
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,640
I'm already in the crew.

293
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,380
I can get down here without hugging your big biceps.

294
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,780
Xu Zhen, listen to me now

295
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,060
Leave the crew immediately

296
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,480
We're going to the airport now.

297
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,020
Can we meet at the airport?

298
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,020
Okay, then listen to me.

299
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,060
I will never leave the crew

300
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Xu Zhen

301
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,880
Xu Zhen

302
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,060
How about it? Did the Snow God agree?

303
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,020
Now it's not a question of whether he agrees or not.

304
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,040
It's past 12 o'clock

305
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,140
It's very dangerous for him to stay alone in the crew

306
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,220
Can we hurry over there in October?

307
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,460
OK, don't worry.

308
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,420
What is Chi Jun talking about?

309
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,340
Don't let me leave the attic for a while

310
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,780
Then he asked me to go to the airport right away to play with me.

311
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,580
The phone you dialed is powered off

312
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,540
Hello, how's it going?

313
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,140
Snow Mountain still not accepting?

314
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,580
It's not a matter of not accepting

315
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,780
Now the Xueshan phone is turned off.

316
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,620
Something must have happened.

317
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,940
11 Hurry up, let's get it done

318
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,980
I'll try to be quick. Don't worry. Don't worry.

319
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,360
Xu Zhen

320
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,280
Xu Zhen

321
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,560
Xu Zhen

322
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,960
Xu Zhen

323
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,300
Xu Zhen

324
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,920
Xu Zhen

325
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,920
Xu Zhen

326
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,560
Xu Zhen

327
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,580
Xu Zhen Xu Shen Hey

328
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,760
Has Chi Jun Xu Shen been found?

329
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,180
If there is no movie in our strip, please search separately.

330
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,360
Qizhen

331
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,520
Qizhen

332
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,700
Are you okay?

333
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,860
I am really scared

334
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,620
Don't worry, I'm here

335
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,040
no

336
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,620
The moment I woke up from the box

337
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,500
I realized how important you are to me.

338
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,820
I'm afraid I'll never see you again.

339
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,740
You have to believe me

340
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,180
I will never let you get hurt.

341
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,860
You were so anxious to let me leave

342
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,620
Did you know in advance that the man in black was going to harm me?

343
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,860
How could I possibly know

344
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,900
I just want to get you out of here.

345
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,820
No, you were trying to convince me to leave before the three wishes yesterday.

346
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,980
Even trapped me in the attic

347
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,700
you tell me

348
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,780
Is someone threatening you?

349
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,420
Let me disappear here, okay?

350
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,860
Did you already know why the man in black was targeting me?

351
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,300
No

352
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,140
You're still hiding it from me at this point?

353
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,460
The man in black was ordered by Ling Jinyang

354
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,380
It's Jinyang brother

355
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,260
impossible

356
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,020
Do you still remember the recorded dinosaur that Yuanxiao gave you?

357
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,200
I remember, but what does it have to do with this matter?

358
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,860
In that recording dinosaur

359
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Hiding inspiration

360
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,180
Evidence of a crime committed 8 years ago

361
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,100
I discovered it by accident.

362
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,660
Later I found out

363
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,660
All the dangers around you come from your neighbors.

364
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,140
I have returned the recording dinosaur to him.

365
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,020
Tell him you don't know

366
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,860
But he is suspicious by nature.

367
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,340
Don't believe what I say

368
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,980
He told me to get you out of the car before 12 o'clock

369
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,380
But you're still in the car.

370
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,660
So he was cruel to you.

371
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,300
how so

372
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,580
How could Brother Jinyang be such a person?

373
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,900
Does Xiao Xiu know about this?

374
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,860
Lin Jiyang is Lin Jinxiu's most admired brother

375
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,500
How could I let Lin Jinxiu know about this?

376
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,760
So you're taking me away

377
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,020
To protect me

378
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,940
For my safety

379
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,060
If I were alone

380
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,540
I can face this alone

381
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,140
But now I have you

382
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,380
How could I put you in danger?

383
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,260
So let's go.

384
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,220
Director Liu was harmed by them

385
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,180
I stayed in the hospital for such a long time.

386
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,320
The first thing I did when I woke up was to leave the house as soon as possible. I didn't dare to go back.

387
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,780
Now I don't even know where Xiao Yuanxiao is.

388
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,700
And we all know who caused all this.

389
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,180
I can't ignore my friends because of the threats from bad guys.

390
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,800
I don't want Yuanxiao to lose his father like me.

391
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,100
I must stay

392
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,340
Lin Jinyang will not give up.

393
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,020
He can kidnap you today

394
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,780
I don't know what horrible thing he will do next time.

395
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,660
He is in the dark and we are in the light

396
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,180
Hard to guard against

397
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,580
I now

398
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,600
Just facing a bad guy

399
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,940
And I have you

400
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,020
What is there to be afraid of?

401
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,020
good

402
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,340
Then I will accompany you to face all this

403
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,020
I will make Lin Qin pay the price for what happened today.

404
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,860
Gu Chijun is indeed the most handsome man in the world

405
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,780
Okay, go take a rest.

406
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,720
Walk

407
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,700
You are hurt now

408
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,060
Take a good rest

409
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,780
I'm going to do something

410
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,340
How is Liang Zong's blood dust?

411
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,860
Is the injury serious?

412
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,180
Just a little scratch

413
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,380
No big deal

414
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,480
Liang Tao

415
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,580
You can go in and see him.

416
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,740
I didn't protect my daughter.

417
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,500
I don't know how to face him

418
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,560
This Lin Jinyang could even kidnap someone

419
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,380
I won't stand this any longer.

420
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,300
I don't intend to endure it any longer.

421
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,180
It's time to make him suffer.

422
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,380
Why fail again?

423
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,020
Do you know that Gu Shijun has no worries anymore?

424
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,600
He'll stab my dad.

425
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,580
Where to go

426
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,220
sorry

427
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,900
roll

428
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,820
Guo Zhijun, what is this?

429
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,499
This is Gaia Fishing Road

430
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,820
The truth behind squeezing out Li 72's world

431
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,259
All in it

432
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,679
How is this going

433
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,479
Lin

434
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,500
I'll show you this document

435
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,499
It's not friendship that embarrasses Gaia Entertainment

436
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,260
Just want to tell you

437
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,180
Let you recognize the true face of your eldest son Lin Jinyang

438
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,060
The company is rumored

439
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,060
Do you want to retire?

440
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,300
Hand over the company to Lin Jinyang

441
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,500
But I hope that after reading this document,

442
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,860
Can be re-determined

443
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,020
This time I will find you.

444
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,040
Come in

445
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,700
Mr. Xiaolin, what do you want from me?

446
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,780
I want to ask you about someone.

447
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,420
You should know this person.

448
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,860
Where is he now?

449
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,540
Tell me who he is.

450
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,500
It's really interesting

451
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,580
Why is everyone looking for this person recently?

452
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,300
Who else has found a lover?

453
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,220
I had contacted him before when I made a wish, and it was Mr. Lin who helped me find the address.

454
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,220
Dad, you look for me

455
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,200
snort

456
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,220
See for yourself

457
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,060
Who gave this to you?

458
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,300
Does it matter who gave it to me?

459
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,780
I didn't expect you to do such a thing.

460
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,780
How did I teach you since you were little?

461
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,900
Be kind

462
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,220
The thing a person fears most is evil intentions.

463
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,620
What a company fears most is the distortion of its values

464
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,740
A society

465
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,260
The most frightening thing is the lack of humanity

466
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,060
Is this how you repay me?

467
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,140
So I would rather trust an outsider than trust me.

468
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,580
Just based on these things

469
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,300
Just scolding

470
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,800
Is it possible that what I said is wrong?

471
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,200
Isn't this true?

472
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,420
You're still arguing

473
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,900
Inheritance

474
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,860
Just stop thinking about it

475
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,380
Gaia Entertainment

476
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,840
I don't want to be led by a ruthless person.

477
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,080
If I give it to you

478
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,580
That destroyed Gaia.

479
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,300
Cruel

480
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,180
Evil intentions

481
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,340
Distorted values

482
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,420
Is there any biological father in the world who would say this to his son?

483
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,900
I, Lin Jingyang, have come to this position today

484
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,280
Isn't it thanks to you?

485
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,620
My dear father

486
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,860
You know what you're talking about?

487
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,740
After Mom passed away

488
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,140
I'm like an orphan

489
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,140
Abandoned in an orphanage

490
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,060
That kind of pain

491
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,380
That kind of loneliness

492
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,140
Should you feel it?

493
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,540
So I swear

494
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,940
I must succeed so that you can't ignore me

495
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,980
And you just said a few words

496
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,080
I denied everything

497
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,620
To get me out

498
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,380
You've had enough.

499
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,060
I've had enough.

500
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,180
The master, Ms. Liang Wanting, said downstairs that she had an appointment with you.

501
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,940
OK, Got it

502
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,940
I'll go down right away

503
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,280
dad

504
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,560
I know you are not as late as the moon

505
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,900
Director, I know

506
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,220
Why did he come to you?

507
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,820
Want to know?

508
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,460
What do you want to do

509
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,380
You said I was a bad person

510
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,140
I do evil

511
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,300
You must have heard of the term "Weihuzuchang"

512
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,620
Bad people do things

513
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,980
Often a helper is needed

514
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,620
What do you mean

515
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,660
You have liked the two bowls hall for so many years.

516
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,620
He is innocent

517
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,100
If it weren't for his acquiescence 8 years ago

518
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,860
Can you make me the deputy general manager of the company?

519
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,200
If I hadn't supported him for so many years

520
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,500
He is just an unknown assistant director now.

521
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,900
A person who helps evil people for selfish reasons

522
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,920
A person who causes evil people to become evil people

523
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,140
All of you including you

524
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,020
Which one is innocent?

525
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,100
So many years

526
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,420
What happened?

527
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,260
Why is this happening?

528
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,800
ah

529
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,800
Ahhh

530
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,300
Sister

531
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,460
oh i'm with you

532
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,980
gya

533
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,420
My ya

534
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,260
Ah Jiyang

535
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,940
my waist

536
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,580
Jiyang

537
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,500
My waist My waist
