1
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,700
The pain of time cannot be seen with one eye

2
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,640
Oh, Xiao Qiu

3
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,060
I really didn't expect it

4
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,340
You handled this so well.

5
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,220
Brother, you really underestimate me. You're praising me for such a small thing.

6
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,520
Lin

7
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,500
Brother, why is there a living person hiding in your room?

8
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,420
Still a man

9
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,140
Brother, your reputation is getting better and better.

10
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,220
Let me introduce you

11
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,260
This is my very important friend.

12
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,820
Has been following me since the orphanage

13
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,640
Why are you stealing our toys?

14
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,040
Yeah did we let you move?

15
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,060
Who asked you to steal our toys?

16
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,440
Who asked me to move?

17
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,700
Grab ours

18
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,580
I hope you get along well in the future

19
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,380
Yeah, I've seen

20
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,700
We just passed each other by before.

21
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,580
Today I finally saw the front. Nice to meet you.

22
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Oh, sorry.

23
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,740
There are red wine stains on my hands

24
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,940
Ah, you guys probably have something else to do.

25
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,460
Well, I'll go upstairs and rest. You guys continue.

26
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,780
Will not be disturbing

27
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,600
how

28
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,380
If you have any ideas, please tell me.

29
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,260
Mr. Lin, I think you guessed a lot of personal feelings about your brother.

30
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,540
Can he really be relied upon?

31
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,380
It will take time to verify

32
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,940
Xiao Xiu is the only person in this world who is related to me by blood.

33
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
If I don't believe him

34
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,220
Who should I trust then?

35
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,320
If I don't have anyone who believes in me in this world

36
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,680
Then what's the point of everything I do?

37
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,860
dont you agree

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
good

39
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,700
Then I choose to believe

40
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,980
now it's right

41
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,260
How is Xiaozhen doing recently?

42
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,620
He came to see me at the company yesterday

43
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,820
Looks like he's in a bad mood

44
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,900
Don't worry, I'm here

45
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,700
And you

46
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,220
Are you ok

47
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,700
Acting is important to me

48
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,540
It's really tough

49
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,140
Especially when you are the one you trust the most

50
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,420
In front of the closest people

51
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,060
You have to integrate into the role

52
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,540
I can't give up my original appearance

53
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,020
troubled you

54
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,180
correct

55
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,620
Is that photo really okay?

56
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,100
no problem

57
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,120
I found Mr. Liu.

58
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,500
A photo of the prison and Yuanxiao

59
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,580
Plus the expert's refinement

60
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,740
Bankruptcy should not be seen

61
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,520
Just received accurate news

62
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,640
Liu Weicheng is back

63
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,400
In a hotel in Chen Dong

64
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,860
Is that so? Is the news reliable?

65
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,260
Will I rush over and get nothing again?

66
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,280
The news is absolutely reliable

67
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,940
Look, this is the photo they sent me.

68
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,660
Liu Weicheng is in this hotel

69
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,300
But I'm not sure whether it will be in vain.

70
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,760
Not everything will be successful.

71
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,260
You also know that Liu Weicheng is the biggest threat to my brother

72
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,360
I'm also afraid of alerting the enemy

73
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,140
You know I don't have enough experience.

74
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
If you still doubt me

75
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,260
Then I'll go by myself.

76
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,820
I'll get it for you later.

77
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,300
Listen carefully, no matter what happens, you must keep an eye on Director Lin.

78
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
If something happens

79
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,900
You know the consequences.

80
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,679
Uh, I'm following my boss' orders.

81
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,080
I need to take Mr. Lin away from here.

82
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,220
I'm sorry

83
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,020
Hey, what are you doing?

84
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
I told you I came here on the orders of my boss.

85
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,560
Hello

86
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
Hello, hey, hey, me

87
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,540
Let me go

88
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,660
All right.

89
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,980
This is how to do ah

90
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,460
Where to go next

91
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,700
The most dangerous place is the safest place

92
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,500
Hurry up

93
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,120
Hello Mr. Lin

94
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,020
Oh no! The chairman was picked up.

95
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,080
Lin

96
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,020
What's up

97
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,900
I just want to know

98
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,020
The exact time my father woke up

99
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,380
Without drug control

100
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,660
Director Lin will fully wake up in three days.

101
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,980
If Dad wakes up like this

102
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,140
Then everything I did before

103
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,860
It's totally meaningless.

104
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,000
go up

105
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,060
Today's daytime events

106
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,820
I need an explanation

107
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,600
Mr. Lin, I originally planned to stay at the hospital all night.

108
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,080
But he suddenly appeared and said that he had received accurate information about Liu Yucheng.

109
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,300
I followed him away

110
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,140
But just when I left

111
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,180
Chairman Lin was taken away

112
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,340
Isn't this all just a coincidence?

113
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,660
Brother, I also shared resources as soon as I got the news.

114
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,940
I didn't expect to be suspected.

115
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,500
Well, I think I did nothing wrong.

116
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,460
If you continue to doubt me

117
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,740
I don't think we need to continue working together.

118
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,460
Xiaoqiu

119
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,420
Tell the truth

120
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,380
What is the news about Li Weicheng?

121
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,160
elder brother

122
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,220
Look, this is the chat record between me and Liu Weichen.

123
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,040
As soon as I got the news, I wanted to help you stabilize this time bomb.

124
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,460
That's why I'm in the hospital.

125
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,760
elder brother

126
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,340
Could it be

127
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,060
You are doubting me too

128
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,580
I have believed in you from beginning to end

129
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,460
Because you are my only brother in this world

130
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,740
But Xiaoxiu

131
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,220
do not let me down

132
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,620
Okay, it's okay here.

133
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,500
You go back

134
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,740
Okay, I'll go back first.

135
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,980
Close the door when you go out

136
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,140
Mr. Lin, do you really believe what Mr. Xiao Lin said?

137
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,060
Believe how

138
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,180
What if I don't believe it?

139
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,260
Ever since I was taken back from the orphanage

140
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,060
Everyone looks at me

141
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,740
They all doubt my identity

142
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,700
Everyone doubts my excellence

143
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,740
Dad is also good

144
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,380
The company is also good

145
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,020
They looked at me like a thief who came out of nowhere.

146
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,980
Even if I wear the prince's clothes

147
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,140
They will also look at your identity with the same eyes as before

148
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,900
Only Xiaoxiu

149
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,800
he

150
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,300
Gave me all the love and trust

151
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,660
I believe you will also feel the same as I do in the orphan night

152
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,420
That kind of loneliness

153
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,020
That kind of loneliness

154
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,900
That kind of helpless

155
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,420
Everyone is like an island

156
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,220
so

157
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,260
I can't lose my childhood

158
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,860
The only person in this world who has given me warmth

159
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,940
Lin is fine.

160
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,220
Let the past be the past

161
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,060
The current thing is to control the progress of things

162
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,980
You go to the crew right away.

163
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,740
After a person succeeds in doing something

164
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,180
You will be blinded by pride

165
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,660
According to the notice

166
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,100
There should be a star explosion tonight.

167
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,500
So you mean the same as 8 years ago?

168
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,020
I look at them

169
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,940
It needs some lessons.

170
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,660
Director Yang is filming this exploding shoe tonight

171
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,100
Be careful, let's hurry up, it's too late.

172
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,760
Are you ready? Okay.

173
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,860
What about you guys?

174
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,500
Yeah, be sure to pay attention to safety

175
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,180
Hey, have you checked it out? Everything is ready.

176
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,300
The shooting tonight was very difficult.

177
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,320
Now everyone please make sure your cell phone is on silent mode

178
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,380
So as not to interfere with tonight's filming

179
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,940
Adjust it

180
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,420
There will be an explosion scene later.

181
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,740
Everyone knows that filming is dangerous.

182
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,900
So pay attention to your personal safety

183
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,900
Yeah, there's more.

184
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,599
Although the play must take into account

185
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,139
But your own safety is more important.

186
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,340
Everyone must protect themselves

187
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,260
Especially actors must protect their bodies and faces.

188
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,500
Then I tell you that some of the reporting points may have one over there

189
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,060
There's one behind me.

190
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,980
Anyway, pay attention to your own safety

191
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,860
Then we can almost start.

192
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,460
careful

193
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,220
There's no problem, right?

194
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,560
Go down

195
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,460
ah

196
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,920
ah

197
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,060
Ahhh

198
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,220
How are you guys?

199
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,600
quick

200
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,220
How are you guys?

201
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,100
Get up and check it out

202
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,860
Zixia, are you okay?

203
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,360
Xiao Juan

204
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,260
Xiaojun, are you okay?

205
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,960
I'm fine. Come to Liuxiu.

206
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,300
Why are you here?

207
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,000
Come with some money

208
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,840
Chen Jun

209
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,820
I didn't expect that at this critical moment

210
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,460
It's you who saved me

211
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,880
Let’s not talk about this for now.

212
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,040
See where you're injured.

213
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,180
Are you feeling uncomfortable somewhere?

214
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,080
Ahhh

215
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,020
Ah, Xiao Chen

216
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,060
Hello?

217
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,100
Are you OK

218
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
Did you kill the water cream?

219
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,860
Xiao Chen is not injured, right?

220
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,120
Xiao Zhang

221
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,260
You're okay, okay, okay, okay

222
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,940
Old Wu Old Wu

223
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,820
Someone come quickly. Someone is injured here.

224
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
Old Wu

225
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,020
Call an ambulance, call an ambulance

226
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,580
Hurry up, good, good

227
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,220
Be careful, be careful, be careful

228
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,860
Don't worry

229
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,580
Fortunately, no bones were broken.

230
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,400
Zhijun

231
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,160
I just went to check the props with my leader

232
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,140
I found out that the props were indeed tampered with.

233
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,780
And the pyrotechnician said

234
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,180
The people who do the tricks are professionals including personnel

235
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,500
He still attacked us.

236
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,420
I think this is Lin Jiyang's warning to me and Xu Zhen.

237
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,900
I guessed right, right?

238
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,820
Chi Jun, what do you mean?

239
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,020
You misunderstood Jinxiu.

240
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,380
Jinxiu's brother is actually trying to help us.

241
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,980
Otherwise, he wouldn't have shown up on time today.

242
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,700
Avoided a doubt

243
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,240
Repair

244
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,940
I'm sorry for what I did to you before.

245
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,220
It doesn't matter

246
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,780
Now compared to this

247
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,700
I'm more worried about my brother.

248
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,380
I wanted him to turn back on his own.

249
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,900
It seems

250
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,500
Now I think things are too simple

251
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,420
So what are you going to do?

252
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,420
I didn't have any plans.

253
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,140
and

254
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,460
I really don't want to keep acting in front of my brother.

255
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,740
This kind of life is so tiring.

256
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,180
I can only confront him.

257
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,460
Look at him

258
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,460
Are you willing to listen to me?

259
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,820
You know this won't work.

260
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,900
But that's all I could do

261
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,460
Red Army

262
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,320
What should I do if Lin Jinyang takes his anger out on Xiao Xiu?

263
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,740
Will he be in danger?

264
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,660
I have no idea

265
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,860
I only know

266
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,620
Between their brothers

267
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,780
There will be a negotiation

268
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,400
The movie City of Time is being filmed today

269
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,400
An explosion suddenly occurred on the set

270
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,280
Many injured

271
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,580
This is also the first film of Hollywood Chinese movie star Gu Chijun after returning to China.

272
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,580
There have been many accidents since the filming began

273
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,380
How is the matter handled?

274
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,020
Mr. Kobayashi rushed in at the critical moment

275
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,380
Evacuated the crowd

276
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,940
Xu Zhiren and Gu Zhijun were both unharmed.

277
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,860
Only one person succeeded and was hurt

278
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,980
You go out first.

279
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,580
I'll give you one last chance.

280
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,860
Please explain clearly what happened

281
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,020
I don't have anything to say

282
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,700
What you see is the truth

283
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
elder brother

284
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,480
I advise you to stop.

285
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,280
snort

286
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,540
Close hand

287
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,180
Now tell me to stop

288
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,740
Is it a bit too late? It's not too late at all.

289
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,520
Brother, the crew now announced that it was an accident

290
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,700
But the outside world will find out the truth one day.

291
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,860
If you go to the police station to report the case now

292
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,900
Turn yourself in

293
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,460
All this is in time.

294
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,060
Surrender

295
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,060
Are you forcing me to admit defeat?

296
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,820
There is no word "give up" in my dictionary.

297
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,860
Over the years

298
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,540
I have always regarded you as my dearest brother.

299
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,580
How do you treat my brother?

300
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,920
Why do you want to get involved in this matter?

301
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,500
Helping these outsiders again and again

302
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,760
elder brother

303
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,500
You are my dearest relative

304
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,140
They are also my best friends

305
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,340
I really don't want to see any of you get hurt.

306
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,100
elder brother

307
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,420
I'm coming today

308
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,860
Just want to tell you

309
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,580
No matter what you have done before

310
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,940
I can atone for you.

311
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,860
Atonement

312
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,660
You said it well

313
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,280
Don't hold me hostage with your ridiculous moral values

314
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,080
This world is the law of the jungle

315
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,900
It's just the rules of the game

316
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,100
I don't have a choice

317
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,260
And what qualifications do you have?

318
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,460
To atone for my sins?

319
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,580
Because I'm your brother

320
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,020
I don't want to see you degenerate step by step and destroy yourself.

321
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,220
If I, Lin Jiyang, had come this far

322
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,980
If there is anything wrong

323
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,940
It's not because I'm too hard on others.

324
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,900
But because

325
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,620
I'm so good to you

326
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,060
So you betrayed me again and again because of my trust in you

327
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,820
My dear brother

328
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,780
I don't want to see you again

329
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,620
Please go out

330
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,300
Get out of here right now

331
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:18,900
roll

332
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,700
Still no news from Jinyang?

333
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,580
Sister Ziqing, maybe Mr. Lin has already rested.

334
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,980
He may not know this yet.

335
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,260
Don't wait.

336
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,420
Since I met him

337
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,660
I have always relied on these excuses to trick myself into falling asleep.

338
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,300
Hope it works today too

339
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,900
Sister Ziqing

340
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,460
You better take a good rest.

341
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,140
Hey Ten Army

342
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,620
Sorry, I overslept today. Give me another half an hour and I will rush to the scene.

343
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,120
It's okay, don't worry.

344
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,300
Let's take it slow

345
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,900
Yesterday, I saw that you were too tired, so I deliberately set your alarm clock later.

346
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,340
As your boyfriend

347
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,700
Today I specially allowed my lovely girlfriend to sleep soundly until she wakes up naturally.

348
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,320
How to be moved or not

349
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,780
Gu Zhijun, you ruined my perfect attendance record.

350
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,540
When will you change this habit of hanging up on me?

351
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,660
Do you know how many people in this group hope to sleep until they wake up naturally?

352
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,060
Come and serve me after breakfast.

353
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,500
Hello Chi Juan, Mr. Lin has arrived at the crew and is inspecting the work.

354
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,020
Level 1 alert

355
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,140
I didn't expect our boss to be so nice.

356
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,140
Look at this benefit.

357
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,300
Yes, he is still so handsome. This is the most amazing contrast in history.

358
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,900
Swear you won't go down.

359
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,220
I'll go meet him

360
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,980
I didn't expect it.

361
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,900
Mr. Lin also has a talent for acting

362
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,940
But I advise you

363
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,540
You'd better stop acting in front of me.

364
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,980
Too much time wasted

365
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,260
If I put some thought into it

366
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,100
In the most important person around you

367
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,220
Then I advise you not to do that.

368
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,900
Otherwise you will pay the price

369
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,460
Yeah

370
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,380
We will wait and see

371
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:20,880
Shi Pei

372
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,860
Our good show

373
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,580
You can start

374
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,620
Sign it

375
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,940
As long as you do what I say

376
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,380
Your life

377
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,300
No need to bring good sentences

378
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,260
Why is this road so congested?

379
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,140
If this continues, I probably won't be there in two hours.

380
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,300
Hey, sir, I'm getting off here. I'm going to be late.

381
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,380
I am Lao Wu, the factory worker at the explosion site of the movie City of Time.

382
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,420
What I want to say today is that this incident is not an accident at all

383
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,620
It was Gu Zhijun's assistant Xu Zhen

384
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,420
A planned intentional injury incident against another leading actor in the crew

385
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,740
This is my test report

386
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,260
I hope you can help me

387
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,340
Let the facts prevail

388
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,539
We'll be home tomorrow night.

389
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,539
Come and go

390
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,419
There is new progress in the explosion incident of the Time City crew

391
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:47,058
The film's lead actor, Story-kun, was also involved in the explosion and is back

392
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,619
I am Lao Wu, the scene controller of the explosion accident in the movie City of Time.

393
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:56,559
What I want to say today is that this incident is not an accident at all

394
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,380
It was Gu Zhijun's assistant Xu Zhen

395
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,280
A planned intentional injury incident against another leading actor in the crew

396
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,300
Dad, what are you doing?

397
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,260
Ah Li Xia

398
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,140
You go back first

399
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,700
If you are hungry, eat some bread first. Dad will be back soon.

400
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,980
This is my test report

401
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,460
I hope you can help me

402
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,340
Let the facts be known

403
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,940
Hey, I also think this material is too explosive

404
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,880
I don't think this matter is that simple.

405
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,400
Xu Zhen is so awesome

406
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,360
How can an amateur make the headlines so many times a year?

407
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,260
How many artists will be pissed off by this?

408
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,680
Hey, here he comes, Xu Zhen is here, hahahaha

409
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,200
Did you arrange the Xu Zhen accident?

410
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,060
The victim accused you because Qin Ziqing refused to clear Du Shijun's name in the scandal.

411
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,660
So it was a deliberate plan

412
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,760
Is this true?

413
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,940
Have you ever considered that you will be punished by law for this extreme behavior of turning love into hate?

414
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,680
Did you take the initiative to do this or did Gu Shijun benefit from it behind the scenes?

415
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,980
Do you have any explanation?

416
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,340
You said that I was punished by law because Qin Ziqing turned his love into hatred.

417
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,840
What are you talking about?

418
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,420
Hey, Xu Jun is in trouble.

419
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,520
What's wrong

420
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,400
Xu Chen was surrounded by a group of reporters outside

421
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,380
The last time

422
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,220
The injured object

423
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,500
Old Wu said that the mastermind behind the bloodshot explosion was Xiaozhen

424
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,300
Isn't this nonsense?

425
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,060
How can these people lie with their eyes open?

426
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,740
If this matter is exposed so quickly

427
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,980
Someone must be behind this.

428
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,300
Hello, has Gaia decided how to handle this matter?

429
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,720
As soon as we learned of this, we held an emergency meeting.

430
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,100
After discussion, we unanimously decided to fully cooperate with the investigation.

431
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,280
Once we confirm that our employees have indeed engaged in such inappropriate behavior

432
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,980
Then we Gaia will support the law and impose severe sanctions

433
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,980
Never cover up

434
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,940
We will apologize to the victims and the public as soon as possible.

435
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,140
Sorry, please let me go.

436
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,180
Please let go

437
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,580
Xu Chen, don't come over here.

438
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,500
No matter what I say, just keep silent, okay?

439
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,460
What do you think of your assistant's extreme behavior?

440
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,340
Of course

441
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,700
Please remember every word I say below.

442
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,180
The planner of this explosion was not Xu Zhen

443
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,740
It's me

444
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,580
What's going on? What's going on?

445
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,380
If you continue to slander Xue without any evidence

446
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,620
I will immediately sue you for defamation to the relevant authorities.

447
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,380
So, why do you do this?

448
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,740
What's the motive? You guys don't have a girlfriend.

449
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,460
Before the matter is investigated

450
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,060
Dear media friends, please stop talking nonsense.

451
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,560
Mr. Shi will not express any personal opinions in the future.

452
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,860
I will no longer accept any media interviews.

453
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,100
Please give him some private space.

454
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,920
I'm really sorry

455
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,000
sorry

456
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Can you say a few more words? Yes, wouldn't it be better if you can say something a little more?

457
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,280
sorry

458
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,220
Not really fake

459
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,040
Yes, you are right

460
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,280
Back off, Chinese team!

461
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,060
Please answer Gu Zhijun again

462
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,400
How can you take the blame for something you haven't even done?

463
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,520
Why are you doing this?

464
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,460
This has a huge impact on your career.

465
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,780
It's obvious that Lin Jinyang is behind this.

466
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,300
He wants to disrupt my position by attacking you

467
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,220
So I'll take advantage of it.

468
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,340
Drag him in too.

469
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,260
This way he won't be able to find any hard evidence for a while.

470
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,780
His image will plummet.

471
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,720
Just imagine how the board of directors would let him go.

472
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,420
His dream of becoming chairman was shattered.

473
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,780
Ah, that's good.

474
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,220
I was really shocked just now.

475
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,340
I can't help you.

476
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,700
I didn't expect it to become your weak spot for others to attack.

477
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,700
I'm so useless.

478
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,620
Stupid, this proves that we are destined to be together

479
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,940
They say women are the missing ribs of men.

480
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,380
Only by searching all over the world

481
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,920
Get that rib back

482
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,300
His body is complete

483
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,220
His heart won't ache.

484
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,460
My cute little ribs

485
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,140
How could I bear to let you get hurt?
