1
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,540
The pain of time continues

2
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,700
Long look

3
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,860
I remember you once said you wanted to have a princess-like wedding in this place.

4
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,320
Don't look at me. It's too embarrassing to confess to you. Go away.

5
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,980
You decided to propose to you here, don't look at it

6
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,780
You were

7
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,900
Was it particularly painful to be rejected by Qin Ziqing?

8
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,780
In fact, I have thought carefully about what Ziqin said to me

9
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,140
He is right.

10
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,500
I don't like him.

11
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,220
What I can't accept more is being rejected by him.

12
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,580
When he rejected me

13
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,420
Rather than being sad

14
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,580
It's more like a child's obsession of not being able to get his favorite candy.

15
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,340
But you can't blame me for this.

16
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,060
People can never imagine what they have never seen.

17
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,860
Only when true love comes

18
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,060
I understand what love feels like

19
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,740
After being rejected by you

20
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,860
I understand the feeling of heartache

21
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,620
I like it no matter you are an adult or a child.

22
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,720
Now we finally have the evidence to clear their name from your name.

23
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,540
I want them to apologize to you.

24
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,100
Hey, you guys are showing off before I go to bed

25
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,820
After waking up, you guys are still showing off

26
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,700
Hey, two great gods

27
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,140
Do you have to be so disgusting?

28
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,319
I found that video of Shi Yuge, come and have a look.

29
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,120
Yeah

30
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,860
take a look

31
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,500
Hahaha

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,900
Xu Zhen

33
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you for your hard work.

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,600
Uh, so after I make the contact,

35
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,940
It's time for us to fight back.

36
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,260
Hahaha hey hey hey

37
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,940
Annie, I was abused by Master Gu again. I also want a hug and comfort, oh muah

38
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,100
Ha ha

39
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,160
Brother, we found the video and have evidence.

40
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,860
Today we will definitely be able to prove Chi Jun's innocence. Of course.

41
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,700
These journalists published false information without any investigation.

42
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,180
Today I'm going to give them a slap in the face

43
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,980
Hello, friends from the media

44
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,920
The theme of today's press conference is mainly

45
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,060
Regarding some occasional reports about Gu Chijun in recent times

46
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,220
Next, we would like to invite Mr. Gu to come on stage.

47
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,980
We once again prove

48
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,640
The incident between Director Wang and Li Qian'er has nothing to do with Mr. Gu

49
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,220
Dear media friends, please stop spreading rumors based on the amount.

50
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,380
All the truth today will be announced to the media friends. Thank you

51
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,540
So how do you explain the testimony of the stylist and the hotel check-in slip?

52
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,020
First of all, I want to state that

53
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,460
Stylist Liu was fired by me, she didn't resign voluntarily

54
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,420
Was it because of personal grudges that he was involved in making this false testimony?

55
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,620
I have no way of knowing

56
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
besides

57
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,700
I am to Miss Li Qianer

58
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,060
No ill intentions

59
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,940
Although the hotel check-in slip he provided was correct

60
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,020
But it has nothing to do with the incident they claimed.

61
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,620
Dear media friends, please look at the big screen

62
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,140
I remember you once said you wanted to have a princess-like wedding in this place.

63
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,900
So I choose to confess to you here

64
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,060
I also decided to propose to you here

65
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,220
When you like me

66
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,940
I do not like you

67
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,540
When you fell in love with me

68
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,460
I like you

69
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,380
When you left me

70
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm in love with you

71
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,180
Do you really think that I broke up with you because you were not famous?

72
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,620
Didn't it become popular?

73
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,020
of course not

74
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,500
You keep saying you love me

75
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,860
But do you really understand what love is?

76
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,040
This video material belongs to Mr. Gu himself

77
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,400
Based on personal privacy considerations

78
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,300
We didn't intend to make it public.

79
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,940
But now the situation has developed beyond our expectations.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,300
So we don’t want to remain silent anymore.

81
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,860
I can only prove my innocence publicly.

82
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,820
We have previously stated

83
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,380
Mr. Gu has been busy filming the City of Time

84
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,240
There was no time for anything to happen to Li Qianer.

85
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,040
Intersection

86
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,680
As for why they are in the same hotel

87
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,460
It was because Mr. Gu wanted to express his feelings to Miss Qin Ziqing at that time.

88
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,940
Now the truth of the matter has been revealed

89
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,840
Mr. Gu has nothing to do with Li Qian's world

90
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,540
I also hope that all media friends will stop spreading rumors about

91
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,340
Please media friends publish fair

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,280
Innocent and true speech

93
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,520
Thank you for the fact that there is only Gu Chijun's voice in the entire video

94
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,820
But not his face

95
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,540
How can we prove that it was Gu Chijun who confessed to Qin Ziqing?

96
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,260
This is a sound identification report.

97
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,620
The official confirmed that the voice belongs to Mr. Gu Chijun.

98
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,620
The shooting time of the video coincides with the time when Li Xian happened.

99
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,660
I think anyone with normal logical thinking ability will understand

100
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,700
The person who filmed the video cannot be in two places at the same time

101
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,920
But the video sound can be added

102
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,820
This doesn't prove anything at all.

103
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,580
We have given evidence

104
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,700
You still have to confuse black and white

105
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,060
Confusing right and wrong?

106
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,500
If we don't have a fair stance

107
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,940
Just want to know the eye-catching news

108
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,060
Well

109
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,420
I have decided to exercise my legal rights

110
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,140
Suing Director Wang for defamation

111
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,860
And the mastermind behind it

112
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,860
Let's wait and see

113
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,780
This concludes today's press conference.

114
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,540
I hope everyone can trust Mr. Gu Shijun

115
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,700
thank you all

116
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,420
Zhijun, do you really want to sue Director Wang?

117
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,180
Since you are so shameless

118
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,860
Then I must defeat him head on.

119
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,700
I will definitely stand by your side and fight alongside you

120
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,580
Qingyang, do you think I am beautiful today?

121
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,280
beautiful

122
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,180
Mr. Lin, a group of reporters came outside and said they wanted to interview Miss Qin.

123
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,540
You tell them

124
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,860
I don't accept interviews

125
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,180
It doesn't matter

126
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,500
You let them in.

127
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,260
Please respect Ms.

128
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,980
Zhao Yun really couldn't have entered just now

129
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,620
Please tell those who are not allowed to enter that they can enter.

130
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,760
Please show me the video of my confession to you to prove my innocence

131
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,240
Is this true?

132
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,340
Yes, yes, yes, yes

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Yes, answer it.

134
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,060
True words about the video

135
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,900
We are not in a position to answer

136
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,660
Miss Qin is my fiancée

137
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,020
We have always had a good relationship

138
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,820
As far as I know, he has a secret relationship with the Stubborn Army.

139
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,700
No contact

140
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,620
Miss Qin, you mean this video is fake?

141
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,620
This issue is not our main concern.

142
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,700
What we care about most now is to have a grand wedding of the century.

143
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,260
Is it Mrs. Lin?

144
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,840
Ms. Qin refused to comment on the video's rear-end collision

145
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,700
Gu Chijun's press conference did not achieve the expected purpose

146
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,680
Our reporter is reporting on the scene.

147
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,600
Everybody, get out.

148
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,080
Let's go out. We are all out.

149
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,740
I hadn't interviewed her yet.

150
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,880
Please give a reasonable explanation for the video

151
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,580
Miss Qin Miss Qin

152
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,420
I said why are you so gentle to me suddenly?

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,500
It turns out that you are using me to attack Guchi-kun again.

154
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,300
Don't you think you're mean by doing this?

155
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,800
Mrs. Lin

156
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,840
When the reporter asked you a question just now

157
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,420
You don't keep silent.

158
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,380
No response

159
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,820
It seems that you have learned how to be my wife, Lin Jianyang, right?

160
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,060
Zhao He, look at this flower, isn't it beautiful?

161
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,900
The florist said this is suitable for young people.

162
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,580
Didn't you say you always want to learn from young people?

163
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,380
Get up quickly

164
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,060
Look at these beautiful flowers

165
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,700
Doctor Doctor

166
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,220
Someone else invited

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,940
Doctor, is he awake?

168
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,140
Mr. Lin is not awake

169
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,980
Finger movement is a nerve reflex

170
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,060
Let’s talk about medicine today.

171
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,540
I have something to do, so I'll leave first.

172
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,700
Oh

173
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,860
What's wrong with you?

174
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,580
Put the car here

175
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Look, the medicine is all over the floor.

176
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,800
I'm a manager now.

177
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,860
OK OK

178
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,180
No problem with other medicines

179
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,480
But there is a drug that tests

180
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,940
A small amount of Barbie

181
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,060
Barbiturate is a drug that has a sedative and sleeping effect

182
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,180
Often used to treat insomnia

183
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,460
Its biggest feature is that the therapeutic dose and the lethal dose are very close

184
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,260
Even slightly higher doses can be dangerous

185
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,240
You mean this medicine contains sleeping pills?

186
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,380
Yes, if the dosage of Barbie head is not well controlled

187
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,460
The effect will be doubled

188
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,740
It may cause the patient to fall into a coma and never wake up.

189
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,580
What happened?

190
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,460
I want you to invite me, your love rival, out to drink with you.

191
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,380
And got myself drunk first

192
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,560
sorry

193
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,700
What are you sorry for?

194
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,820
You didn't take Xu Zhen away

195
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,380
If you really feel guilty

196
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,700
Then stay away from Xu Zhen

197
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,380
Don't hide it from me anymore.

198
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,820
I already know

199
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,740
Everything that Ren Xiaozhen has encountered recently

200
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,460
My brother arranged all this behind the scenes.

201
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,340
And you have suffered so much

202
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,900
Still thinking about my feelings

203
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,020
Never showed any suspicion in front of me

204
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,620
Thank you, no need to say thank you

205
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,700
We all know

206
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,939
You and your brother are two completely different people.

207
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,519
So don't worry about this.

208
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,819
Why am I not worried?

209
00:17:18,398 --> 00:17:19,858
My brother

210
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:23,019
He has been my favorite since childhood.

211
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:26,818
I have long regarded him as the most important part of my life

212
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:28,940
But that's

213
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,100
You trust most

214
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,300
The person you cherish most

215
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,660
He actually did this

216
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,780
And with my current ability

217
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,060
There's no way I can stop him.

218
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,620
Not to mention

219
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,700
His comrades came to restrain him.

220
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,820
I now how to do

221
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,420
He is your brother

222
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,900
The person closest to you

223
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,780
We don't want to see you and your brother become enemies.

224
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,900
so

225
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,100
Just leave the task of protecting Xu Zhen to me.

226
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,420
Missions against you

227
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,420
Leave it to me too.

228
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,620
is true

229
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,500
Now things become like this

230
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,220
I don't know how to face him.

231
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,260
I don't know if I can continue to be friends with him.

232
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,580
Can I continue to be friends with Xu Zhen?

233
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,860
That's between you two.

234
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,940
I don't think it has anything to do with anyone else.

235
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,520
Gu Shujun

236
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,940
Now I know why the town chose you.

237
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,140
You look

238
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,780
A bit confident

239
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,940
Confident to the point of being a little arrogant

240
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,700
but

241
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,340
You are quite delicate at heart.

242
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,980
And it's good

243
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,100
There's no need to praise me.

244
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,220
I know I'm charming but

245
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,140
I'm not interested in men

246
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,700
You are too confident.

247
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,420
But Zhu Zhijun

248
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,260
I still want to thank you

249
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,660
today

250
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,820
Come out and comfort me

251
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,020
before

252
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,340
I am a bit childish

253
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,100
No matter what happens, I will just hide behind my brother.

254
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,940
And never cared about his feelings.

255
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,060
Now

256
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,460
I encountered such a thing

257
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,740
I reached out too.

258
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,340
Stop him.

259
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,300
you mean

260
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,460
Although there may be no way to stop him directly

261
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,820
That's better

262
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,380
I'll accompany him.

263
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,780
Play a play

264
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,540
acting

265
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,780
Acting is difficult

266
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,380
I know

267
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,380
I think before you learn to act

268
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,220
You need to practice your drinking capacity first.

269
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,020
bring it on

270
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,180
Welcome to the adult world.

271
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,660
Cool down

272
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,840
Xiaoqiu

273
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,500
There is something important I must tell you.

274
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,660
What's up

275
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,380
Your father's coma

276
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,700
Someone secretly changed the medicine.

277
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,240
Lin

278
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,780
We need to be more detailed about self-media

279
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,620
This is now the high ground of public opinion.

280
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,100
Be sure to remember

281
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,940
bottom up

282
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,820
Completely reverse the negative public opinion about Asia due to the Lee Chung-ah scandal

283
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,620
Hello Mr. Lin

284
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,040
Xiaoqiu

285
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,620
I think your father has been in a coma like this

286
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,680
Someone must have tampered with it.

287
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,920
How is this possible?

288
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,980
Aunt Liang, why do you say that?

289
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,860
Today I saw your father's electrocardiogram in the hospital and it showed big fluctuations.

290
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,580
Like a sign of awakening

291
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,220
So I called over quickly.

292
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,300
Guess what?

293
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,620
The doctor said

294
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,160
This is due to a long coma.

295
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,260
The illusion

296
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,100
Then, without any examination, he was given an injection.

297
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,260
I think the doctor is weird.

298
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,920
So I secretly brought the medicine out.

299
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,980
I asked my friend to do a test on him.

300
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,260
This is the result of eye painting.

301
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,220
Barbie

302
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,100
This is a nerve control drug.

303
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,420
It is the most widely used sedative

304
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,940
This is impossible

305
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,940
Aunt Fei, the hospital my father is staying in now is the most authoritative one in the field of new internal medicine.

306
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,640
And all the attending doctors were arranged by my brother himself.

307
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,140
Because he's your brother.

308
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,980
That's the problem

309
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,580
Your brother currently wants to get the inheritance rights of Gaia

310
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,900
So he doesn't want your dad to wake up

311
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,580
Once your dad wakes up and knows everything your brother did

312
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,220
He will definitely completely deprive him of his inheritance rights.

313
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,400
Bear

314
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,500
Don't hesitate any longer.

315
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,740
Help your father get transferred to another hospital

316
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,360
What are you thinking about?

317
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,460
Such an accident

318
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,180
Ah, nothing, bro.

319
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,900
I was originally worried that something Director Wang did would have a huge impact on our company.

320
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,340
Later when I came in, I saw that you guys were talking about almost the same thing.

321
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,700
I feel relieved.

322
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,080
nice

323
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,580
Know the work

324
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,020
It's a good start

325
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,900
I just happen to have some

326
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,840
The Propaganda Department's plan

327
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,100
See if you are interested

328
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,360
elder brother

329
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,860
What's wrong

330
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,020
I think our dad's condition hasn't improved recently.

331
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,260
Is it because the hospital is not suitable for him?

332
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,860
A few days ago, I talked to some friends

333
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,420
They said the new internal medicine department at another hospital in the city was the best in the field.

334
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,740
So I think we should transfer dad to that hospital and give it a try

335
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,100
Xiaoxiu, everything takes time.

336
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,380
Determining whether treatment is effective

337
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,140
We have to wait until the treatment is over before we can make a judgment

338
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,020
The hospital I am currently assigned to

339
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,860
Whether in terms of the quality of doctors or equipment, they are the most advanced in the country. Let's wait and see.

340
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,880
After the treatment is over

341
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,340
If it really doesn't work

342
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,660
It's not too late to blink

343
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,980
dont you agree

344
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,700
What he did for Gaia

345
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,500
All will fail

346
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,940
So he will definitely not agree to your request for half-turning injustice

347
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,500
You have to think about this carefully.

348
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,900
Little Bear, why do I feel that you are

349
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,580
Bro, I'm fine.

350
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,300
Maybe I was too worried about my dad.

351
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,500
So

352
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,460
You are the one who decides the hospital matters.

353
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,340
I'll take this file back and take a good look at it

354
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,860
Then I'll go first

355
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,060
Hello Director Yang

356
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,260
Just like you thought

357
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,860
My brother didn't let my dad go through the transfer procedures.

358
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,100
But don't worry

359
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,580
I will definitely pick up my dad.

360
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,200
to sing

361
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,320
elder brother

362
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,300
Why did you become like this?

363
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,180
Hello Aunt Liang

364
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,160
Where are you now

365
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,140
Is it in the hospital?

366
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,680
Xiao Qiu, let me tell you

367
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,420
I can't leave your dad alone in the hospital anymore.

368
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,160
I don't know what your brother will do.

369
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
I must rescue him.

370
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,260
Aunt Liang, please don't be impulsive.

371
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,900
I'll come find you right away.

372
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,920
Zhao He

373
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,380
I'll let you out now.

374
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,000
lead

375
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,600
Are you filming in the hospital?

376
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,800
Take it away. What are you doing?

377
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,640
I want to take Zhao He away

378
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,260
Let me go, let me go

379
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,620
Hey, let me go, hey, let me go

380
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,000
Xiaoqiu

381
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,860
Aunt Liang

382
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,300
Xiaoqiu, are you okay?

383
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm fine. Your dad and his men have sent many people to watch over me.

384
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,680
I really have no other choice.

385
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,280
Aunt Li, I've figured out a solution for my dad.

386
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,260
Wait for my news.

387
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,340
Well, I have something else to do, so I have to leave first.

388
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,920
Hello

389
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,340
Let's meet some time.

390
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,180
Negative news about the company

391
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,420
It has reached its historical peak

392
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,300
And the company's turnaround measures have not effectively reversed public opinion.

393
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,720
According to this situation

394
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,220
I think I have reason to question your management ability on behalf of all shareholders.

395
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,260
Mr. Ji, I think your conclusion is fashionable.

396
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,400
I don't know how you judge whether a person has leadership ability.

397
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,780
How do you judge whether a company is successful?

398
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,880
If we just talk about word of mouth

399
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,540
Our Gaia is indeed affected now.

400
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,920
But from the actual interests of the company

401
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,540
Now, because of the current public opinion, the popularity of our company has reached an unprecedented level.

402
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,140
The fact that stocks don’t fall is a good proof.

403
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,180
Everyone here is a business elite.

404
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,600
Talking Business

405
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,380
I believe everyone has their own unique views on this matter.

406
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,220
Shame on you remember

407
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,500
The current online public opinion war in society cannot be viewed in a short-term perspective.

408
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,420
Lin Zong has now turned the tide.

409
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,860
Public opinion is developing in a positive direction

410
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,540
Where there is attention, there will be heat

411
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,420
So I also hope that everyone can pay attention to our subsequent development of this matter.

412
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,740
What you said is very good

413
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,500
It also makes a lot of sense

414
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,460
My management skills

415
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,460
And the company's bricklayer

416
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,780
Shareholders, please

417
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,460
Wait until this quarter's financial statements come out.

418
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,660
Let's make the judgement.

419
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,820
Shame on you

420
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,800
Thank you so much for what you did just now.

421
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,340
Hey brother, what are you saying thank you to between us?

422
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,140
Before, I was too young and ignorant.

423
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,320
Now it's just the two of us.

424
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,140
Whatever decision you make, I will stand by you.

425
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,720
Balls

426
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,260
You really grew up

427
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,500
Some things in the past

428
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,140
I had no choice.

429
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,260
Please forgive me

430
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,240
Don't worry, brother.

431
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,620
I will definitely help you

432
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,940
Then you go ahead

433
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,460
I went to work too

434
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
Hello everyone,

435
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I am Zhang Shiyu

436
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,620
As the agent of Story Army, I ask for help from all netizens

437
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,680
If anyone can see this person please contact me via the link below the video

438
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,580
I really hope to have a face-to-face communication with Director Wang to solve this problem.

439
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,860
If anyone could see

440
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,080
what happened again

441
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,600
Another little girl is ruined. Why did you pick on her?

442
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,220
Come in at this time.

443
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,640
Do you treat this place as your home?

444
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,940
What are you doing?

445
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,900
The town is actually like this

446
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,580
Although Wang Dao has clarified the slander against Chi Jun

447
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,180
But after all, this incident also had a series of adverse negative effects on the pool bacteria.

448
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,980
You have to know that the entertainment industry is actually very forgetful

449
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,620
From the initial Li Qianger scandal to now, Director Wang has come out to clarify all the truth of the matter

450
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,560
I believe it is absolutely impossible if there is no one behind the scenes.

451
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,660
So what Wei Shan and I are doing now is to find the host behind the scenes.

452
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,420
How to find the host behind the scenes?

453
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,860
Of course, we have to find Director Wang first.

454
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,600
We need to mobilize the wisdom of all netizens to start a human flesh search engine

455
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,400
snort

456
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,939
Hum

457
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,600
Dear netizens

458
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,760
Just a few days ago

459
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,380
Director Wang Xin, who threw dirty water on famous national male god Gu Chijun, suddenly disappeared at the press conference

460
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,020
Director Wang said at the time that he only believed that the Li Qianer incident was planned by Gu Chijun from beginning to end.

461
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,840
Why did such a determined person suddenly disappear?

462
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,980
Is there any hidden story behind it?

463
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,159
Hello everyone, I am Zhang Shiyu

464
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,759
As Gu Chijun's agent

465
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,580
I ask for help from netizens

466
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,639
If anyone could see this person

467
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,080
Please contact me via the link below the video

468
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,460
I really hope to have face-to-face communication with Director Wang to solve this problem.

469
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,720
elder brother

470
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,680
I think we can't let this go on any longer.

471
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,680
Although the situation with my uncle has been resolved at the last board meeting,

472
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,140
But there are twists and turns

473
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,340
I am afraid that if there are other directors on the board, they will also renew the time slot.

474
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,420
So what do you mean?

475
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,060
Why not leave it to me?

476
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,040
What are you going to do?

477
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,340
Hey brother, just wait for my good news.

478
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,160
Why do I feel a little uneasy?

479
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,680
Is this address reliable?

480
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,500
What if I find the wrong person?

481
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,820
What are you afraid of? Just play dumb and leave.

482
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,840
Life is like a play

483
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,060
All depends on acting

484
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,640
I've been with my boy for so long.

485
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,180
I haven't learned this yet.

486
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,740
Don’t underestimate the power of social networks.

487
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,660
The only thing in the world that is more accurate than Google Maps

488
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,460
It's Chinese netizens.

489
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,740
Let's not talk about this anymore

490
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,840
Are you ready for everything I asked you to prepare?

491
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,080
of course

492
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,540
You're absolutely 100% sure.

493
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,080
Hey

494
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,780
Kobayashi

495
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,620
Come in

496
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,960
Where is Mr. Xiaolin going?

497
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,140
Where did he go

498
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,360
You are late

499
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,680
I bought him a plane ticket.

500
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,200
We are already several thousand meters in the air.

501
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,180
What did you say

502
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,500
Where is he going? Mr. Xiaolin, um?

503
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,500
Do you mind if I ask a few questions?

504
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,020
First, why do you know Director Wang?

505
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,940
second

506
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,420
Why did you buy him a plane ticket?

507
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,100
And I want to know if this is your personal wish or Gaia's strategic behavior

508
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,140
And the most important thing

509
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,460
Have you never considered Xu Zhi and Zhijun?

510
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,340
Of course I considered it

511
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,300
But you also know

512
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,620
Gaia Entertainment is our neighbor's industry

513
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,360
Now this incident has affected the image of the entire company.

514
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,900
I can't just sit there and watch.

515
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,900
As for Gu Chijun and Xu Zhen

516
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,200
One is just Gaia Entertainment's long-term cooperation obligation

517
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,660
Xu Zhen said to our company

518
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,700
He is just a temporary worker.

519
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,620
So you put the interests of these two people and the interests of the company before me at the same time

520
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,020
How should I choose

521
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,180
You should know better than me.

522
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,380
excuse me

523
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,300
I'm coming

524
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,800
Weishan, why do you look so bad?

525
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,380
Xiaozhen, I tell you

526
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,140
This world is really crazy

527
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,720
Um

528
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,160
Hey, what happened?

529
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,140
Don't be angry. Speak slowly.

530
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,000
We arranged everything today.

531
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,980
I want to bet on Director Wang who framed you.

532
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,040
The result arrived

533
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,780
The person waiting there turned out to be Lin Jinxiu

534
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,840
This is nothing

535
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,100
It was his later words that made me angry.

536
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,900
I really get angry when you mention it.

537
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,900
Okay

538
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,380
When we arrived, Mr. Kobayashi looked completely different than usual.

539
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,480
When we went

540
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,520
He has helped Wang Dao escape abroad

541
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,280
The most annoying thing is that he said it out loud.

542
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,760
He can sacrifice anyone for Gaia's benefit.

543
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,160
What's so strange about this?

544
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,060
Gaia originally belonged to both of them.

545
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,340
He is just saying now that he has been holding back all the things in his heart.

546
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,500
Xiaozhen, what are you thinking about?

547
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,640
I don't believe Xiaoxiu is such a person

548
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,120
I'm going to go ask him face to face.

549
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,580
Xiaozhen Xiaozhen

550
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:57,140
I'm really afraid that Xiaozhen will feel even worse when he hears these words himself.

551
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,140
Some things may not be as simple as we think, right?

552
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,920
Xiaoxiu

553
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,640
No matter what Weishan and Shiyu said to me,

554
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,660
I don't believe what they say.

555
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,180
I want you to tell me what's going on.

556
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,000
I

557
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,020
They will believe you

558
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,060
Xu Zhen

559
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,060
You are really important to me.

560
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,500
But Gaia belongs to our Lin family.

561
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,740
I thought about it for a long time

562
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,220
I can only lose the most important person in my life now

563
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,540
I can't leave our family with nothing.

564
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,060
Everything you heard

565
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,220
That's what happened

566
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,700
believe

567
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,500
I don't need to explain anything to you anymore.

568
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,960
Minor repair

569
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,980
Are you still the Lin Jinxiu I know?

570
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,240
Oh, Xiao Qiu

571
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,500
I really didn't expect it

572
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,900
You handled this so well.

573
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,860
Brother, you really underestimate me. You're praising me for such a small thing.

574
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,120
Lin
