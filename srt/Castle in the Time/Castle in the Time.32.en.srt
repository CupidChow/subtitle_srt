1
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,540
The pain of time continues

2
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,780
Long look

3
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,940
Don't worry, I will take good care of this matter.

4
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
Hello, Propaganda Department

5
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,700
You didn't go to work today.

6
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,380
Why did you deal with the fabricated scandal of the stubborn army?

7
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,380
What

8
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,020
What does it mean that the company prohibits you from expressing any opinions on the Tenth Army incident?

9
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,880
The 10th Army has not been reviewed yet.

10
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,020
The company certainly has an obligation to protect his image

11
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,880
What

12
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,900
The above means that you have no say in the matter.

13
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,000
snort

14
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,420
good

15
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,540
Hello, reporter Lin, yes, it's me.

16
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,600
Of course this story is fake.

17
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:42,380
Would you mind deleting that?

18
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,900
What does powerless mean?

19
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,500
Listen to me, reporter.

20
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,840
Hello

21
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,780
These people change their attitude faster than turning the pages of a book

22
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,900
It's not something I did

23
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,700
No need to rush to edit

24
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,620
The comments of Kechijun are obviously out of control now.

25
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,600
Do you know what the comments are saying now?

26
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,040
Kneeling circle chaos new way

27
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,800
I didn't expect Gu Shijun to be such a person.

28
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,200
I really misjudged him.

29
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
Did you see it?

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,260
If you don't explain, people will think it's true.

31
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,740
I thought Lin Jinyang would come up with some clever tricks.

32
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,180
I didn't expect that it was such a despicable method to fabricate a scandal for others.

33
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,360
If things get out of control

34
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,060
I'm just afraid that more things will happen next

35
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,680
Mr. Li

36
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,180
We have arranged for the company's public relations and publicity departments to remain silent on the Story Army incident as you requested.

37
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,940
In addition, there are live interviews from several media outlets

38
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,460
They have been waiting for you in the conference room for a long time.

39
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,260
ah

40
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,140
We will give the media some more information.

41
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,300
Let the story marry you

42
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,180
More selfish.

43
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,220
Actually, I thought so too.

44
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,580
Hey, Mr. Lin is here. Hey, Mr. Lin is here. Mr. Lin, Mr. Lin, say a few words. Mr. Lin

45
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,900
Please wait a moment.

46
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,300
Hello, Mr. Lin

47
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,120
Ever since the news of the stubborn army's unspoken rule over Li Qian was exposed

48
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,700
A large number of netizens condemned the immoral behavior of the stubborn army

49
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,780
Even started a war of words with the middle fans who defended the stubborn army

50
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,260
Caused an image crisis

51
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,100
What do you think of this

52
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,780
As the president of the Asia Group

53
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,460
A moral advocate for his artists

54
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,780
I deeply regret

55
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,440
To give an explanation to the palace

56
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,820
Eliminate adverse effects

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,780
The Asia decided to suspend all Story Army activities in Hong Kong

58
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
Please also ask Gu Zhijun to admit his mistakes

59
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,660
Serious reflection

60
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,980
Does stopping work mean that the City of Time that Gu Zhijun is currently filming will also be affected?

61
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,900
After the decision of the senior management of the Asian Group

62
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,500
To avoid more severe consequences in the future

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,500
City of Time will replace the role played by Gu Zhijun

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,540
thank you all

65
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,660
The next question is asked by my assistant.

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,100
I am here to answer your questions on behalf of Gaia Entertainment

67
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,340
Lin Xinyang, why do you treat Gu Shijun like this?

68
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,960
From what I know about him

69
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,740
Then he would never fall in love with Li Qianer

70
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,300
Yeah

71
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,140
I do one thing

72
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,420
Do you need to explain it to others?

73
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,540
But the public service army didn't do that at all.

74
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,360
That’s all for today’s press conference.

75
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
thank you all

76
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,260
You let go

77
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,900
Let go. I advise you not to talk nonsense.

78
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,540
You're going to be my fiancée.

79
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,480
If you don't like it now

80
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,500
How can you be the boss lady of Gaia Group beside me in the future?

81
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,980
I advise you to recognize your own identity

82
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,660
And you listen to me.

83
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,340
What you need to think about now is how to be a good Mrs. Lin.

84
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,700
Don't question my decision.

85
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,940
What are you looking at?

86
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,080
Gaia did a great job

87
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,760
This kind of morally corrupt star should not be scolded but beaten directly

88
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,780
We, Gu Chijun, will never do such a thing.

89
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,980
Oh, stop looking.

90
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,640
These people on the Internet are all keyboard warriors

91
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,680
All words are spoken without thinking

92
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,380
You don't have to care about what they say.

93
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,820
As your fans, they will still support you as always.

94
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,740
ah

95
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,940
You see, I just bought a car model

96
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,220
But I can't fight well

97
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,660
Could you help me spell it out?

98
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,360
Where are the drawings?

99
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,700
After I scattered the drawings, I don't know where to put the others.

100
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,180
Only the last complete picture.

101
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,180
Can you put it together?

102
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,420
Then I'll get you some water.

103
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,740
It's done.

104
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,580
So fast

105
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Come on, Gucci, come and put on your eye mask

106
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,420
I don't like SM

107
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,100
What nonsense are you talking about?

108
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
How long have you not had such a leisurely day?

109
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
This is a rare opportunity so you should take a good rest

110
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,280
Come put on the blindfold

111
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,020
I'll take you to a mysterious place.

112
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,660
Okay, let's go.

113
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,700
hurry up

114
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,060
Come on, come on

115
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,500
Where are you taking me?

116
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,100
This looks stupid.

117
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,620
I'm a big star after all.

118
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,220
Could you please pay a little attention to my image?

119
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,200
Oh, not stupid, not stupid

120
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,300
If you come with me, you will discover a new world.

121
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,580
Okay, now you can take off the blindfold.

122
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
Thump thump

123
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,680
It would be nice if mom and dad could come to the aquarium with us.

124
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,780
Mom doesn't want me anymore?

125
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,600
Little Jane

126
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,180
Xiaozhen, do you see the fish here?

127
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,620
They came here from a distant sea.

128
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,020
Just want to tell you

129
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,460
Mom is completing her important tasks.

130
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,140
You can't hate your mother.

131
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,620
And encourage mom

132
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,340
Because what mom has to accomplish is very important

133
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,940
I need your love to encourage me

134
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,540
How can my mother receive my encouragement?

135
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,660
You stand here

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,660
Whisper to one of the fish

137
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,340
They will tell your mother.

138
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,540
Mom will get your encouragement.

139
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,180
Wa hahaha

140
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,340
ha

141
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,160
So what happened next?

142
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,640
I come here often.

143
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,860
I want to tell the fish what I told my mother. You can try it now.

144
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,020
So what should I say?

145
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,360
oh

146
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,040
Tell the fish all the unhappiness in your heart and they will take your troubles to the depths of the sea.

147
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,220
Make you braver

148
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,080
Fish have small brains

149
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,740
They can't handle my troubles.

150
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,020
They have small brains and thus have few worries.

151
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,640
You see, they are so carefree every day helping us share our little troubles.

152
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,940
It's totally trivial

153
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,700
Don't believe me? Then I'll go first.

154
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,280
The long city of time is not easy now

155
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,640
It's not easy for the stubborn army to be hit

156
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,300
It's even harder for me who wanted to study paleontology but accidentally fell into the entertainment industry.

157
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,220
Fishes

158
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,820
Please take all these things away.

159
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,660
Please

160
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Gu Shijun, what are you doing here? This is an aquarium.

161
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,040
My spiritual mirror is about to be tarnished by you

162
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,340
Fish are short-sighted, they can't see

163
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,820
Myopia is not okay

164
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,120
Fish have a memory of only 7 seconds

165
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,780
Even 7 seconds is not enough

166
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,340
no

167
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,020
Hahahaha you can't defile my pure land here

168
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,460
Well, look

169
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,220
His name is Xiao Meng. Hi Xiao Meng.

170
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,900
Thank you for accompanying Xu Zhen through so many lonely times.

171
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,580
Let him be so brave

172
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,380
I will recover soon.

173
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,340
I will take over your responsibility to protect his beauty.

174
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,180
As for being unhappy

175
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,420
I'll ask you to feed it to the sharks.

176
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
How about Xiaoxiu

177
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,300
Have you contacted Blind Island and Li Qian'er? No, I called them but their phones were either turned off or busy.

178
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,180
It feels like he's deliberately avoiding me.

179
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,580
They must be guilty of something.

180
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,120
Xiaoxiu, do you believe in Gu Chijun?

181
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,660
Of course I believe him.

182
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,340
Although I really hate Gu Chijun, I believe he would not do such a thing.

183
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,780
My brother

184
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,680
It was obvious that Gu Chijun was framed, but he still wanted to terminate the contract

185
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,540
Besides, he's been very busy lately and won't see me.

186
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,640
Xiaoshun

187
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,360
Don't worry too much

188
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,860
After all, he is my brother. If I beg him again, he will definitely help us.

189
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,420
It's okay. We can definitely solve it on our own.

190
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,060
Aren't those Director Wang and Li Qian'er?

191
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,060
Go fast

192
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,600
Director Wang has a lot of face.

193
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,380
I called you more than 20 times but you didn't return the call.

194
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,740
Hahahahahahaha Mr. Kobayashi

195
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,980
It's me, Mr. Hu.

196
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,740
What do you want from me?

197
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,180
I just want to ask why you framed Gu Chijun.

198
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,460
Miss Li, you have always known that this matter has nothing to do with Gu Chijun, right?

199
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,660
I have nothing to say

200
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,760
You are the party

201
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,740
Only if you testify will people believe you.

202
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,120
Xiao Lin, this stubborn general wants to take advantage of Li Qianer

203
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
We have evidence

204
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,600
Don't make it difficult for us.

205
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,300
Besides, we must lie according to the facts.

206
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,620
But all your so-called facts are false.

207
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,680
This Li Qianer is a witness

208
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,900
We also have the registration form as physical evidence.

209
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,060
All this shows that Gu Zhijun intends to do something bad to Li Qianer.

210
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,600
We don't mean anything else.

211
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,400
We just want justice.

212
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,980
Besides, Gaia Entertainment has obviously given up on Gu Zhijun.

213
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,180
If you do this again

214
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,380
It's nothing more than an ant biting an elephant

215
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,020
wishful thinking

216
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,180
Don't be so beautiful.

217
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,980
If you have a way, tell the media.

218
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,140
Don't worry about the town.

219
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,580
I think we'll find a breakthrough.

220
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,640
Hey, think about it again.

221
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,860
Is there any evidence to prove that the stubborn army is innocent?

222
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,340
How about it

223
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,020
What do you think of this place?

224
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,880
So this is your plan.

225
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,260
Remember, don't tell anyone about what happened today, understand?

226
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,940
If I am not mistaken

227
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
The day Li Qianer was sexually exploited by Director Wang

228
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,660
This is the day when Gu Chijun confessed his love to Qin Ziqing

229
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,620
Gu Chijun recorded the video

230
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,940
Gu Chijun has done this kind of thing before?

231
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
As long as you find the confession video recorded at that time

232
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,280
It can prove that Gu Chijun was not with Director Wang and Li Qianer at all.

233
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,380
It can prove that Gu Chijun is innocent.

234
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,260
Look, the energetic king Xu Zhen in my mind is back again

235
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,900
But as my assistant, you have always been thinking about Gu Chijun

236
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,500
Isn't that good?

237
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,440
Gu Chijun has helped me get it back.

238
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,500
Hey, I haven't agreed yet.

239
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,480
Juzhen, please come back to my place

240
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,220
You don't have to think about so many things when you come to me.

241
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,340
Xiao Xiu, you are my best friend forever

242
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,940
You know I can't let the City of Time be affected

243
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,580
We must not let Gu Chijun be framed by those bad guys.

244
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,740
Because this movie has placed too many people's hopes on it.

245
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,940
I know, so I will help you.

246
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,380
Thanks

247
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,500
Then I'll go first.

248
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,100
What are Wang Dao and Li Qian'er doing here?

249
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,260
Brother, does this matter have anything to do with you?

250
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,880
Brother, when do you think our dad will wake up?

251
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,500
Don't worry about it.

252
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
The doctor is already doing his best to help

253
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,660
I'm sure he'll wake up soon.

254
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,860
Brother, I think

255
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,680
The incident between Li Qing'er and Wang Dao

256
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,700
Gu Zhijun was framed

257
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
We should support him

258
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,180
Rather than

259
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,100
Adding insult to injury

260
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,880
Showshow

261
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,260
You don't know this.

262
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,780
This incident of Gu Chijun has a great impact on the company

263
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,980
Affects the company's great interests

264
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,460
I do this for my own reasons.

265
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,700
Just stop asking.

266
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,860
Go home quickly

267
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
dad

268
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,920
Look at you now.

269
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,180
How can you tell me to get out?

270
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,340
Where is this?

271
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,220
Why am I going here?

272
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,660
Could this have something to do with recent events?

273
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,380
Gongming Welfare House

274
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,860
It turns out that my brother and the man in black really have a relationship

275
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,380
Could it be that the person who did this to Xu Zhen was really my brother?

276
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,780
impossible

277
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,060
Impossible Town

278
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,080
It's so late, Xiaoxiu

279
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,380
How did you come

280
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Small town

281
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,980
I found the man in black.

282
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,820
and

283
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,860
He is very close to my brother.

284
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,220
Yeah

285
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,220
what does it mean

286
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,900
Did you know that my brother did this?

287
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,540
Yes or no

288
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,380
Brother is still not asleep, Xiaoqing

289
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,720
How can I sleep if you don't come back?

290
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,480
He left the hospital earlier than me.

291
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,140
Why didn't you come back so late?

292
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,660
I called you but you didn't answer

293
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,780
How can I not worry?

294
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,320
Director Wang recently broke the news to the media

295
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,140
It is said that the previous Li Qie's unspoken rule incident was instigated and slandered by the international superstar nurse army behind the scenes.

296
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,360
He also produced the hotel check-in documents to prove that Gu Chijun was also present at the time.

297
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,480
Fans were heartbroken after the incident

298
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,920
Although Gu Chijun stated that this incident had nothing to do with him

299
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:38,360
However, Gaia Entertainment, the company to which Gu Chijun belongs, issued a statement saying that it would not tolerate such behavior. This is what you did.

300
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,700
Apologize for the negative impact caused by one person in the company on society

301
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,260
Suspected of what you are talking about Gu Chijun's unspoken rule over Li Qianer

302
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,020
It's getting late

303
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,940
Go back to your room and rest early.

304
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,700
I went to the Citizens' Welfare Institute today.

305
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,860
Saw the man in black

306
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,100
What's your relationship with him?

307
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,220
Did you ask him to hurt the town and Gu Zhijun?

308
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Xiaoxiu

309
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,120
There are some things you shouldn't worry about.

310
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,940
I have to take care of the town's affairs.

311
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,740
For an outsider

312
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,120
You talk to me in this tone.

313
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,180
You really disappoint me.

314
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,620
I guess I'm the disappointed one.

315
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,500
You know clearly that what I care about most is the small town

316
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,140
Why are you still hurting him?

317
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,500
Would you like to have a drink with me?

318
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,100
Listen to my mother tell you

319
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,460
You have to give me an explanation

320
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,060
Why would you do that?

321
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,200
good

322
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,580
I'll give you an explanation

323
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,140
because

324
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,780
I must get what I want.

325
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,420
Over the years, I have been working hard to build a dental

326
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,980
There is absolutely no room for error.

327
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,540
The only mistake

328
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,660
The mistake is that Xu Zhen knows too many things

329
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,780
I can't let him be an uncertain factor.

330
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,860
I want everything

331
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,820
All under control

332
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,260
I don't want to be like when I was a kid anymore.

333
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,780
Living a life of dependence and looking at other people's faces

334
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,420
Mom, mom, wake up.

335
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,060
Over the years

336
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,100
I have always wanted to show my talents in the company.

337
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,500
Get Dad's approval

338
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,980
But I never thought that no matter how hard I tried

339
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,860
Dad doesn't care at all

340
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,540
Even if I pay more

341
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,500
He also didn't get his approval.

342
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,340
Sometimes I really want to ask him

343
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,260
Why are you targeting me like this?

344
00:26:59,120 --> 00:26:59,920
go

345
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,900
Dad never thought about it that way.

346
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,400
You really misunderstood him.

347
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,020
You don't have to speak for Dad.

348
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,640
Dad always says I do things by any means necessary

349
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,980
Quick success

350
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,120
But in today's society

351
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,020
To achieve the goal, of course, we must choose an effective method

352
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,460
Dad is like this

353
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,420
The more prejudiced I am

354
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,340
The more I prove it to him

355
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,420
I have the ability to inherit the mortgage

356
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,860
kind

357
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,940
Fame, wealth and status

358
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,980
I can hold everything in my hands

359
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,140
I don't want to be that wild child that everyone can bully anymore.

360
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,700
So I don't allow myself to make even the slightest mistake.

361
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,860
To achieve the goal

362
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,300
I have to be a little cruel

363
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,540
But that's not a reason for you to hurt others.

364
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,580
I don't want people to go to Shanghai town

365
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,980
My silly brother

366
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,820
The only person I won't hurt in this world is you

367
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,460
My only brother

368
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,460
As for Xu Zhen

369
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,740
terribly sorry

370
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,180
I really can't guarantee it.

371
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,340
For those who pose a threat to me

372
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,580
I must strangle him in the cradle

373
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,660
You just pretend to be the heir of Gaia Entertainment and do whatever you want.

374
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,100
Brother Mingheli

375
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,320
It's so important to you

376
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,900
Of course fame and fortune are important

377
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,580
If my father and I hadn't worked so hard for so many years,

378
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,060
Where does your current abundant life come from?

379
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,580
Isn't it based on the second son of Gai Ya Entertainment?

380
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,060
Such a simple truth

381
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,580
You should understand

382
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,940
alright

383
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,660
Think about it yourself

384
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,640
We can't go on like this.

385
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,980
We have to be tougher with them.

386
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,720
Everyone has a chance to make you a gentleman

387
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,740
They think you are a coward

388
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,100
So what are you going to do?

389
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,700
I have a solution

390
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,580
Gu Zhijun, do you remember your confession to Qin Ziqing?

391
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,260
I have long forgotten such embarrassing things.

392
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,000
The day you confessed your love to Qin Ziqing was the day when Li Qianer and Director Wang had a scandal.

393
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,120
If we can find the video, we can prove you weren't there.

394
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,940
That rumor is dispelled.

395
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,220
Yeah, didn’t we shoot a video at that time?

396
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,020
No video

397
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,160
Gu Shijun, losing face at this time is a small matter

398
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,760
The most important thing is to prove your innocence

399
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,540
I have deleted all the videos

400
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,740
There's nothing we can do about it.

401
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,220
Maybe we can find a parent-child relationship to prove that we don't need it.

402
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,400
Are we just going to sit there and watch others frame us?

403
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,060
I really can't accept it

404
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,880
Senior

405
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,380
Don't we have a GoPro?

406
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,800
Didn't it fail later?

407
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,540
So I returned the hook basin.

408
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,500
Now I don't know where to put it.

409
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,020
Company warehouse

410
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,940
It was clearly placed here last time.

411
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,020
I don't know where to go now

412
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,340
I sorted out props when I was on the set.

413
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,160
It will be difficult to find for those who don't know it.

414
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,760
But those who know will have their own logic and rules.

415
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,220
That would be much simpler.

416
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,620
I found it

417
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,920
oh

418
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,080
Which one is GoPro?

419
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,200
They all look the same

420
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,620
I don't remember which one is which.

421
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,260
Then we can only choose the simplest method

422
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,580
Xu, this is the good method you mentioned.

423
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,200
Sorry, Brother Shiyu

424
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,300
There is no other way now except to check them one by one

425
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,180
Thank you for your hard work.

426
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,460
You've worked hard, have some coffee, little dinosaur.

427
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
it does not matter

428
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,340
We'll find that video.

429
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,740
Wow give the baby a deep kiss

430
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,600
ah

431
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,700
Oh, so greasy! So greasy!

432
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,380
Goosebumps all over the floor

433
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,100
I didn't expect that the usually steady Shi Yu would be so cheesy when sending WeChat messages.

434
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,020
ah

435
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,560
snort

436
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,840
Two great gods

437
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,460
You are allowed to show your affection, but I am not allowed to show it

438
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,620
Can you please also consider the feelings of a man who doesn't have a girlfriend around him?

439
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,340
Um

440
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,520
Alas, I have watched so many videos but there is no Gu Shijun

441
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,340
Did you actually film it?

442
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,140
Of course I took the photo as I am so serious.

443
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,260
Okay, I'll keep looking.

444
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,579
I know you are also looking forward to receiving my sweet WeChat

445
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,380
Then I will generously meet your request

446
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,100
Thanks for everything you have done for me

447
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:57,740
childish

448
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,380
Oh, show your affection

449
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,380
I really hate it. Huh

450
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,820
Ziqiang

451
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,780
The whole world knows that you are my favorite person

452
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,540
God destined us to be together

453
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,820
Although there are many misunderstandings between us

454
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,420
I also have a lot of things I do poorly.

455
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,420
I know

456
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,860
I didn't have any fame before.

457
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,540
No status

458
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,340
Can't give you the life you want

459
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,580
Xu Chen

460
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,100
I like you

461
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,580
I just want to be with you

462
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,460
You just need to take a step towards me

463
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,100
9,999 steps remaining

464
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,540
I'll make it all up

465
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,760
Wu Zhijun, are you childish or am I childish?

466
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,820
I need water now

467
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,180
Don't look at it. It's too embarrassing.

468
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,360
ha

469
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,760
ha

470
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,700
stop looking

471
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,180
Were you particularly upset when you were rejected by Qin Ziqing?

472
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,580
Actually, I have thought carefully about what you said to me recently.

473
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,540
He is right.

474
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,820
I don't like him.

475
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,540
What I can't accept more is being rejected by him.

476
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,900
When he rejected me

477
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,740
Rather than being sad

478
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,900
It's more like a child's obsession of not being able to get his favorite candy.

479
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,580
But you can't blame me for this.

480
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,380
People can never imagine what they have never seen.

481
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,300
Only when true love comes

482
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,460
I understand what love feels like

483
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,100
After being rejected by you

484
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,180
I understand the feeling of heartache

485
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,480
Whether you are an adult or a child

486
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,980
I like them all the same

487
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,120
Now we finally have the evidence

488
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,160
It will clear their slander against you.

489
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,780
I want them to apologize to you.
