=Episode 14=

3
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,510
What a coincidence.

4
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,070
Where are you guys from?

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,390
Are you two on a date?

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,480
Have you both cleared the air
and resolved all past misunderstandings?

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,960
I was just about to ask.

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,840
How did you guys end up together?

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,490
Miss Gu and I are heading
to the tailor shop.

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,030
That's right.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,070
Mr. Gao mentioned

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,460
he's been in Rongcheng for days
and hasn't bought any new clothes.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,280
He asked me for advice.

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,600
We have something to handle first.

15
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,320
I'll come back later and tell you more.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,030
Mr. Gao.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,790
Shall we go now?

18
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,200
If we're late,
the shop might close soon.

19
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,670
Let's go.

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,560
The fries today were really good.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,710
Let's meet again next time.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,450
I know you're doing it out of spite,

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,040
but I'm still very happy.

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,350
If you ever need anything in the future,

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,870
I'll always be there.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,790
You decided to come back at last?

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,870
Of course.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,060
It's time for dinner.

29
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,450
I need to be home for dinner.

30
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,710
Were you

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,280
with Gu Mengqiu all day today?

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,730
I bumped into her on the way.

33
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,200
Oh right,

34
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,760
I also stopped by her place.

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,640
You went to her place as well?

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,790
I always had a feeling
there was something odd about her.

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,520
Today, I discovered
she's quite peculiar.

38
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,430
Guess what I found out?

39
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,350
I don't want to know.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
I'm talking about the case.

41
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm talking about feelings.

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,710
What Jiang Junsheng wanted
to convey to me today

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,630
wasn't just an apology.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,030
He wants to start over with me.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,310
So, how did you respond to him?

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,590
What about you?

47
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,800
How would you feel

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,780
if someone pursued me?

49
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,590
I...

50
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,750
I...

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,870
I don't understand what you mean.

52
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,360
Oh, by the way,

53
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,400
do you recall

54
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,750
Zhang Zhiran

55
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,800
from Zhang's Tailor Shop?

56
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,310
I always found this person

57
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,120
somewhat strange.

58
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,930
He was present at the scene
during the deaths

59
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,110
of General Jin and Cao Liang.

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,190
We may have overlooked
some crucial clues.

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,560
I went to his tailor shop...

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,310
I told you,

63
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,430
I don't want to know!

64
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,360
What

65
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,030
do you want to know?

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,470
Forget it.

67
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,080
I don't want to hear anything.

68
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,000
(Give you a chance to call me back.)

69
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,840
One.

70
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,080
Two.

71
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,710
Three.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,430
Don't you have anything...

73
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,960
you want to explain?

74
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,590
Darn it!

75
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,910
Even as I try to get close
to Jiang Junsheng,

76
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,080
my energy recovery

77
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,630
is slowing down.

78
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,100
(The best in the world)

79
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,060
(The best in the world)

80
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,830
It's done.

81
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,680
Did you make a mistake?

82
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,120
Why are you the best in the world,

83
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,190
and I'm the second best?

84
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,920
You even drew a fish on it.

85
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,720
What does that mean?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,600
Fishing?

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
The fish represents me,
[*Yu: fish]

88
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,800
and being the best
in the world is my goal.

89
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,720
I believe

90
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,950
I'll eventually surpass you one day.

91
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,510
Your dream

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,390
seems unattainable in this lifetime.

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,430
I'll take it slow.

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,750
There's plenty of time anyway.

95
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,240
Get up.

96
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,950
Do it.

97
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,820
(The best in the world)

98
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,240
It's getting more unstable now.

99
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,720
I don't know

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,160
how much time is left.

101
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,430
Please enjoy, Miss.

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,950
You're early.

103
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,240
The newspaper is upside down.

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,310
No, it's not.

105
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,630
Have some warm drink.

106
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,600
Special for you.

107
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,870
What a nice try.

108
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,950
Where are you going?
Why not take me along?

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,880
Didn't you say you didn't want
to handle the case today?

110
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,560
No, I didn't say that.

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,860
(Zhang's Tailor Shop)

112
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,900
(Zhang's Tailor Shop)

(Various Designs)

114
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,070
It's the same as in Gu Mengqiu's house.

115
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,120
Mr. Gao?

116
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,480
What can I do for you?

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,980
I'm here to order a suit.

118
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,480
I'm sorry, Mr. Gao.

119
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,980
Our shop only takes orders from acquaintances.

120
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,670
I'm late.

122
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,360
Mr. Gao is my friend.

123
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,120
Miss Gu, it seems you're the one

124
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,790
who introduced Mr. Gao to us.

125
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,790
You're right.

126
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,750
Mr. Zhang,
you wouldn't refuse it, would you?

127
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:41,600
How could I?

128
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,320
Please, come in.

129
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,390
Why does this smell

130
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,750
exactly like what Miss Gu has

131
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,630
at her house?

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,030
That's because

133
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,120
Miss Gu

134
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,390
is a regular customer here.

135
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,840
I naturally recall her preference for tea,

136
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,650
so preparing it comes naturally to me.

137
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,550
Mr. Zhang,
you have always been so thoughtful.

138
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,270
As I should be.

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,360
Mr. Zhang.

140
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,720
Please display the suit fabrics

141
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,360
you have on hand

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,670
for Mr. Gao to have a look.

143
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,000
Certainly.

144
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,390
Hao, bring over the fabric.

145
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,440
Alright.

146
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,870
Mr. Zhang, having a customer

147
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,870
like Miss Gu

148
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,750
explains why your business
keeps growing.

149
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,460
Our profit margins are narrow,

150
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,480
so we greatly
value Miss Gu's continued patronage.

151
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,550
By the way,
Miss Gu also has many of the sachets

152
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,790
from your shop at her place.

153
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,960
Is there any significance?

154
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,320
It's a tradition in Rongcheng.

155
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,750
Sachets symbolize safety and joy,

156
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,910
and people often buy them

157
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,080
to give to someone important.

158
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,320
Mr. Gao, would you like to pick one too?

159
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,510
How about this, Mr. Gao?

160
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,630
Hao.

161
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,000
Bring over the new batch

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,510
of sachets.

163
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,960
Alright.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,510
Give to someone important?

165
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,240
Mr. Gao.

166
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,720
Please choose.

167
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,510
I'll get this one.

168
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,320
Our shop also offers embroidery services.

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,030
Mr. Gao.

170
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,200
Would you like
to have a name embroidered on it?

171
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,630
No, thank you.

172
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,910
I'm getting it for myself.

173
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,630
Alright then.

174
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,200
Mr. Zhang,
I'd like to pick a few as well.

175
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,440
We also have a new batch of sachets designed

176
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,120
for calming and soothing the mind.

177
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Try this one.

178
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,670
Miss Gu, who are you buying it for?

179
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,870
I'm also buying it for myself.

180
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Besides wishing well for others,

181
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,120
one should also

182
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,000
prioritize self-care.

183
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,240
Master, the fabric is here.

184
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,000
You may go.

185
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,120
Mr. Gao, please take a look.

186
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,510
Miss Yu.

187
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,390
The deputy said you were looking for me.

188
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,000
How did the interrogation

189
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,840
of Yan Hekun go?

190
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,480
Any leads on the blood jade?

191
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,790
Did you come to me today

192
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,080
just to talk about this?

193
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,670
What about the matter

194
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,840
I asked you yesterday?

195
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,240
We aren't suited for each other.

196
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,960
We're not from the same world.

197
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,960
I know.

198
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,030
In the past,

199
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,960
it was my fault.

200
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,960
It's natural that you feel disheartened.

201
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,960
But I will strive harder in the future.

202
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,030
Where there's a will,

203
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,750
there's a way.

204
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,120
That's not what I meant.

205
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
What I'm saying is,

206
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,910
someday I will leave.

207
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,080
Do you understand?

208
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,480
I'll follow you

209
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,840
wherever you go.

210
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,440
Forget it.

211
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,320
Let's talk

212
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,480
about the blood jade matter.

213
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,840
Yan Hekun's testimony

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
aligns with Wang Ming's.

215
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,710
After they received the first share of profits,

216
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,550
both of them acknowledged the jade's existence.

217
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,670
However, they only

218
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,630
saw the blood jade once.

219
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,510
They described it as blood-colored

220
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,690
with an ancient jade texture.

221
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,750
Yet, I've never

222
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,630
seen such an item.

223
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,600
My father runs an antique pavilion.

224
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,440
I'll thoroughly

225
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,630
check it out later.

226
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,960
More hands make lighter work.

227
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,510
Why don't we search together?

228
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,910
The antique pavilion
isn't accessible to outsiders.

229
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,910
Miss Yu.

230
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,840
Why are you suddenly so interested
in this jade?

231
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,360
I can't explain the reason clearly
at the moment.

232
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,960
But I'm not doing it for the treasure.

233
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,360
You must believe me on this.

234
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,720
Of course, I believe you.

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,670
Regardless of the reason,

236
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,150
as long as you want the jade,

237
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,250
I will definitely get it for you.
