One.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,150
Wait.

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,430
She's here.

I don't want you to marry anyone else.

No.

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,240
Calm down.

110

Miss Yu, do you still remember me?

111
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040

Didn't I tell you to be polite?

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,390
We cannot delay

116
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,630
the Grand Marshal's autopsy.

117
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,270
Please.

(An autopsy? This is intense.)

119

Get changed and follow me
to the police station.

120

121

(Why hasn't the game)

126
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,830
(told me anything?)

127

Miss.

128
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,040
You're going to get married
to the Marshal soon.

129
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,360
How come

130
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,920
he's still so harsh with you?

131
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,560
Married?

132
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,160
Him and me?

133
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,560
(No way.)

134
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,430
(Does this game have no boundaries?)

135
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,480
(How can I push an extramarital affair?)

136
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,310
If you're ready, come with me now.

137
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,510
To where?

138
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,240
To the autopsy.

139
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,800
Me? Autopsy?

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,560
I'm not going.

141
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,950
This is not my story.

142
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,070
Put me down.

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,120
I want to go back.

144
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,000
Miss.

145
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,420
(Rongcheng Police Station)

146
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,510
Lift it.

147
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,830
Coroner Yu, he's yours.

148
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,920
(No way.)

149
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,680
(Is my character this time)

150
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,310
(a coroner?)

151
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Must I do it?

152
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,920
With your relationship

153
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,630
to the Grand Marshal,

154
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,480
you are the best candidate

155
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,160
for the coroner.

156
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,950
Relationship?

157
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
What relationship?

158
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,240
He's your father.

159
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
He's my father.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
What?

161
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,600
Incest?

162
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,630
No.

163
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,750
He's not your birth father

164
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,630
but father-in-law.

165
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,310
Husband.

166
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,390
Get it now?

167
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,720
Say, did the fever

168
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,270
damage Miss Yu's brain?

169
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,630
Let's start.

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,920
(I'll just give it my best.)

171
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,190
(Why do I,)

172
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,040
(a Cupid NPC,)

173
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,390
(have to examine a corpse?)

174
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,040
(I will demand a pay raise later.)

175
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,510
(What do I do now?)

176
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,000
(How am I meant to do this?)

177
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,070
(I wonder)

178
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,360
(if this game)

179
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,800
(has those features.)

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,830
Activate R18 content filter.

181
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
It's pixelated.

182
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,920
Not bad.

183
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Thank goodness the game didn't fail.

184
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,920
(Why is the filter gone?)

185
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
(Must the game glitch out)

186
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,390
(at this time?)

187
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,310
(Oh gods. Someone,)

188
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,800
(anyone, help me.)

189
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,070
(I promise to do anything.)

190
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,720
(Are you sure you want to activate)

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
(Autopilot mode?)

192
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,360
(What?)

193
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,040
(Who is that?)

194
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
(Is this a new feature?)

195
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,950
Miss Yu.

196
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,800
Why aren't you starting?

197
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,750
(This auto-something mode,)

198
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,070
(I accept.)

199
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,920
(Is this the developer)

200
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,360
(of the game?)

201
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,030
(Autopilot mode activated.)

202
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,630
(Name, Jin Hongming.)

203
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,240
(Male, age 56.)

204
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,490
(Grand Marshal
of the Rongcheng Military.)

205
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,870
(Recorded cause of death)

206
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,650
(spontaneous combustion
in the Grand Marshal's residence.)

207
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,390
(Still, his mouth and nose)

208
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,720
(are free of soot.)

209
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,840
(No heat-induced damage)

210
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,720
(or signs of smoke)

211
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
(in the chest cavity.)

212
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,790
(He did not burn to death.)

213
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,790
(The true cause of death)

214
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,240
(is heavy loss of blood)

215
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,200
(from being stabbed.)

216
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,550
(It's clearly a murder.)

217
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,630
(Was he set on fire after death)

218
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,790
(to destroy the evidence)

219
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,870
(or to create chaos?)

220
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,670
The Master is on fire!

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,240
(Don't tell anyone
about the corpse's anomalies.)

222
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,770
(It's hard to tell friend from foe.)

223
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,550
(I'll find you soon.)

224
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,750
(Done.)

225
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,510
(Examination complete.)

226
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,270
(What was that just now?)

227
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,840
(Was that the feeling)

228
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,240
(of autopilot?)

229
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,320
Coroner Yu.

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,550
Anything unusual?

231
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,870
None at all.

232
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,440
Are you sure?

233
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,720
If you don't believe me,

234
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,360
get someone else to examine him.

235
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
(The corpse right here)

236
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
(is his birth father,)

237
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,120
(yet he shows no reaction.)

238
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,830
(There must be something wrong with him.)

239
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,550
You may leave.
