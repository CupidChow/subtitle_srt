00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,360
I know where the blood jade is,

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,200
but I demand a person in exchange.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,120
Jiang Junsheng and his men

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,240
are hot on my trail now.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,200
If you help me,

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,400
I'll give you the blood jade.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,800
It's fair,

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,000
right?

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,120
I'll give the blood jade to the Marshal.

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,680
You'll never get your hands

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,640
on this treasure.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,960
See you tomorrow night.

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,600
Are you leaving?

16
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,800
Yeah.

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,840
I'd like

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,640
to have dinner
with you all tomorrow night.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,440
You're my best friend.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,080
You must come, okay?

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,120
I'll invite the Marshal.

22
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,600
As for Mr. Gao,

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,360
could you pass on the message to him?

24
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Okay, we'll definitely be there.

25
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,280
Great.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,920
That's settled then.

27
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll take off now.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,480
Escort her out.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,320
Miss Gu, please follow me.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,600
She's in such a hurry to leave.

31
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,060
Something must be going on.

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,920
From the looks of it,

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,730
I think
she's most likely the real culprit.

34
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,250
We're just one step away
from solving the case and going home.

35
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,120
Now it all depends on tomorrow night,

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,560
whether she'll reveal any flaws.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,840
This time,

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
we cannot let her get away.

39
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
Are all the smuggled items here?

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Yes.

41
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,840
Open it.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,840
It really is her.

43
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,720
(Miss Gu.)

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,720
Here's what

45
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,840
my master left for you.

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,120
It seems like he knew

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,050
he would be in trouble.

48
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,400
So he

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,680
made all your clothes

50
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,800
for a year in advance.

51
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,560
I've been waiting for you.

52
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
What happened?

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,960
Don't you know?

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,960
How would I know?

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,040
I was packing at home.

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
Come in first.

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,840
Marshal, I remember

58
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,120
you used to love this sweet and sour fish.

59
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,400
Have a try

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
at my cooking.

61
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,590
There are still a few dishes
being cooked in the kitchen.

62
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,290
Despite we have been siblings
in name for years,

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,440
we've rarely had the time
to sit down together

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,960
for a simple home-cooked meal.

65
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,000
(Tea)

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,200
Mengqiu.

67
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,360
You're leaving Rongcheng.

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
Do you have any lingering wishes?

69
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,240
My wish

70
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,240
is to leave Rongcheng.

71
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,080
Looks like you don't have anyone

72
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
to miss in Rongcheng.

73
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000
They are here.

74
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,880
I heard you're leaving Rongcheng.

75
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,880
We brought you a little gift.

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,240
There's no need for a gift.

77
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,320
That's too polite.

78
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Please come in first.

79
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,040
The tea has just been brewed.

80
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Have a taste.

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,720
No rush to drink the tea.

82
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,600
Let's open the gift first.

83
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
Gifts can wait.

84
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Tea cannot.

85
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,080
Tea isn't good when it's cold.

86
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,280
Thank you all for coming today.

87
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,960
I'll use tea instead of wine.

88
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,240
Cheers to you all.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,560
You all came,

90
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,200
supposedly to bid me farewell.

91
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,520
Yet, none of you wants
to drink a sip of tea.

92
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,800
It seems you have some doubts.

93
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,520
If you still consider me

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,760
a friend,

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,200
why not openly express your doubts?

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,800
Please, Miss Gu.

97
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
Clear up our doubts.

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,580
Miss Gu, you should

99
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,200
be familiar with these things.

100
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,200
Antique papers?

101
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,520
Over the years,

102
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,240
I've bought dozens of them

103
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,120
to copy the works of famous artists.

104
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
I doubt they're just for copying.

105
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,840
They're for forgery, right?

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,840
I gave most

107
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,280
of the paintings to Father.

108
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,120
As for what he was doing with them,

109
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,720
I have no knowledge.

110
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
You've produced dozens

111
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,990
of ancient paintings over the years.

112
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,560
How could you not know?

113
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,360
Marshal.

114
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,560
You know that.

115
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,000
I did whatever Father

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,080
instructed me to do.

117
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,160
That was how

118
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,440
it had always been for us,

119
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,240
wasn't it?

120
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,350
Miss Gu, since you claim to be unaware,

121
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,290
allow me to inform you
about the whereabouts

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,680
of those ancient paintings.

123
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,440
Several pieces were used as bonuses
by the Grand Marshal

124
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,790
and given to those
who were involved in the blood jade,

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
such as Wang Ming.

126
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,000
There were also some forgeries,

127
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,840
unknown

128
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,200
to the Grand Marshal,

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,040
placed

130
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,600
in the antique pavilion.

131
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,440
Are you really sure

132
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,720
that all of these are forgeries?

133
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Do you trust me?

134
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,000
Today, you come

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,520
to bid me farewell,

136
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,390
but it turns out you're here
to investigate me.

137
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,960
I'm just a weak woman,

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,440
coerced by the Grand Marshal

139
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,480
to replicate a few paintings.

140
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,520
Does that make me

141
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,600
an unforgivable criminal?

142
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,280
Miss Gu.

143
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,760
What you'd replicated
wasn't just ancient paintings.

144
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,440
This is what everyone
has been searching for,

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the blood jade.

146
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,120
Father, take a look.

147
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,240
It's alike.

148
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,800
It's strikingly alike.

149
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,120
You've handled it very well.

150
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,120
Tell me.

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,360
How would you like me to reward you?

152
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,560
You agreed before

153
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,360
to let me leave Rongcheng.

154
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,320
I'd like...

155
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,280
You want to leave?

156
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,200
Sure,

157
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,920
but not now.

158
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,680
Wait a few more years.

159
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,800
You said the same thing last time.

160
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,760
Get out.

161
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,400
This is great.

162
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,520
So this is the thing

163
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,720
that caused the deaths of many.

164
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,440
Is this the blood jade?

165
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,360
How did it end up in my house?

166
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Is it a curse coming for me?

167
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,920
Miss Gu.

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,480
Keep going.

169
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,760
You must have felt smug

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,100
when you helped the Grand Marshal

171
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,800
create the blood jade, right?

172
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,120
But surprisingly,

173
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,480
the curse you fabricated

174
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,960
could actually kill people,

175
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,320
and it even forced

176
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,680
your only loved one to death.

177
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,240
I was an orphan before I was adopted.

178
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,890
I don't have any loved ones.

179
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Miss Gu.

180
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,140
Do you recognize this piece of cloth?

181
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,560
In Rongcheng Orphanage,

182
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,400
every orphan's clothes

183
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,120
would be sewn with such a piece of cloth

184
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,600
to mark their names.

185
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,200
A few days ago,

186
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,720
I dropped by Rongcheng Orphanage.

187
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,120
The director there still

188
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,760
remembers a smart little girl

189
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,960
from over a decade ago.

190
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,150
(Rongcheng Orphanage)
Gu Mengqiu?

191
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,400
Of course, I remember.

192
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,560
Over a decade ago,

193
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,120
when the explosion in Gunan Mountain
caused a landslide,

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,520
she followed the fleeing villagers here.

195
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,520
Qiu was great.

196
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,640
She was fortunate too

197
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,480
to be adopted by the Grand Marshal.

198
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,520
Was she also orphaned

199
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,040
because of the explosion?

200
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,840
After the disaster,

201
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,560
we took in

202
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,880
quite a few babies.

203
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,880
At a young age, Qiu was skillful

204
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,720
and could help

205
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,200
sew the names onto the clothes

206
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
of children even younger than her.

207
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,200
Just a moment.

208
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,760
I still have those

209
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,280
stored in the archives.

210
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,480
I'm sorry to trouble you.

211
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,920
Finding records from so long ago

212
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,880
must be difficult.

213
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
No trouble at all.

214
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,510
You've come at the right time.

215
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,720
A few days ago,

216
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
someone else was asking about her too.

217
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,080
That's why I haven't

218
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,160
kept the records away.

219
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,120
Have a look at this piece of cloth.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,900
(Qiu)

221
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,900
(Gu Mengqiu, age 6,
orphaned by Gunan Mountain explosion.)

222
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,040
You mentioned

223
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,490
someone else also inquired recently.

224
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,240
Do you remember who it was?

225
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,160
Yeah.

226
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,240
I know him.

227
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,080
I was quite surprised

228
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,320
when he asked about Qiu.

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
Stop. Don't say anymore.

230
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,640
The director could only

231
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,000
remember so much,

232
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,080
but I also learned something else.

233
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,040
Apart from me,

234
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,750
there was another person inquiring

235
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,680
about the little girl's whereabouts.

236
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,280
It was Mr. Zhang

237
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,990
from the tailor shop in town.

238
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,360
I told you to stop!

239
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
- But he was your...
- No, he wasn't!
