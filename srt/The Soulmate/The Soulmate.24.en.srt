=The Soulmate=

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,160
Your plan is indeed meticulous,

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,870
but the human heart

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,190
can see through all meticulous plans.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,030
Miss Gu.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,160
It's all thanks to your brother.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,600
Mr. Gao.

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,240
You disrupted my plans indeed.

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,790
Don't trust Hatoyama.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,070
Nobody better lay a finger on her.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,670
Why would you assume

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,790
that the "her" my brother mentioned

14
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,320
referred to me?

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,560
I was also puzzled at first.

16
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,840
He killed Third Lady

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,790
and gave you

18
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,000
a self-igniting brooch.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,070
Who exactly did he want to protect?

20
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,310
Later, I realized

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
I prematurely assumed

22
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,200
you were the victim.

23
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,510
In fact,
the person who tampered with the brooch

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,070
was not Zhang Zhiran

25
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,310
but you.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,400
Zhang Zhiran knew you framed him,

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,510
yet he let you use him
to your advantage.

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,000
We've been trying to figure out

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,200
what your relationship is,

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
but based on my experience,

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,200
you two don't seem

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,560
like lovers.

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,040
I sent people

34
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,400
to inquire at the tailor shop.

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,430
You and Zhang Zhiran

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,000
had no inappropriate interactions.

37
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,280
Unlike with Third Lady,

38
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,510
there was no romantic involvement.

39
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,400
Therefore,

40
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,280
for a man to go to such lengths

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,310
for a woman,

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,030
another relationship I can think of is

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,360
you are family.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,680
You did so much

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,910
to confuse us,

46
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,750
but as soon as we discovered the key,

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,910
all the problems

48
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,470
were also solved easily.

49
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,590
You

50
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,590
turn out
to be a pleasant surprise for us.

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,840
Marshal.

52
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,500
We have had Hatoyama's men under control.

53
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,630
Take Hatoyama away.

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,630
Make him spit out everything

55
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,960
he shouldn't have embezzled

56
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,710
over these years.

57
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,280
Understood.

58
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,080
Marshal, let's make a deal.

59
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,120
Marshal, let's make a deal!

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
I'll offer you double,

61
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,150
no, triple the price

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,960
I had offered your father!

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,910
Marshal Jiang!

64
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,520
The murderer has been caught.

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,190
Why hasn't this game ended?

66
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,000
Because we've found the real murderer,

67
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
but we're still not clear

68
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,400
on how she killed the Grand Marshal.

69
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,910
Let me tell you a story.

70
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,910
Once upon a time, a little girl

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,680
blundered
into the Grand Marshal's residence.

72
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,240
She thought she had struck luck,

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,430
only to find

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,150
she had arrived in a living hell.

75
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,840
The girl was forced
to learn to make forgeries.

76
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,080
She thought as long as she was obedient

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,430
and was of use,

78
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
she could have a little bit of dignity.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,750
The Grand Marshal appeared upright
and honorable on the surface,

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
but behind closed doors,

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,120
he tormented the girl
in every possible way.

82
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,400
Father.

83
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,870
I've changed into my new dress.

84
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,490
I am ready
to accompany you to the banquet.

85
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,430
Look.

86
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,800
Do I look pretty?

87
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,680
Did I say you were
my banquet companion?

88
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,290
Do you really think
you're some sort of prestigious lady?

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,040
Who do you think you are?

90
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,160
You are just a dish on the table.

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,920
Whoever wants a bite

92
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,800
takes a bite.

93
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm leaving.

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Later, the girl

95
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,680
secretly sold the authentic works
for money,

96
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,270
hoping to escape Rongcheng.

97
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,100
Unfortunately,
the Grand Marshal discovered her plan.

98
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,070
The humiliation she faced

99
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
was a hundred times worse.

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,430
Do you remember

101
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,430
there was

102
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,240
a blood-stained birdcage in the house?

103
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,950
Father once said
it was used for keeping birds of prey.

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
Could it be...

105
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,390
The girl

106
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,000
was unable to control her own fate.

107
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,430
She was like a bird, chained

108
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,040
and kept in a cage

109
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
for his and his distinguished guests'

110
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,120
amusement

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,920
and mockery.

112
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,160
Not only that.

113
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,800
Take off your clothes.

114
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,240
Take it off.

115
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,920
Weren't we supposed

116
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,510
to attend a ceremony held here?

117
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,360
Yes.

118
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,160
You're the offering.

119
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,000
You don't need clothes.

120
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,270
Do you

121
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,270
want me to die?

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,950
Since the shaman

123
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,190
has chosen you,

124
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,070
that's your value!

125
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,240
Take off your clothes.

126
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,950
No! Get away from me!

127
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,920
Take it off!

128
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
No! Let go of me!

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,600
Take it off!

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,390
Get away from me!

131
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,750
I will skin you alive today!

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,190
I want you

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,720
to see what you really are!

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,560
Help!

135
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,390
Run!

136
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,830
Hurry! Leave!

137
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,190
You two

138
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,920
are dead.

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,360
It's you who's dead.

140
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,630
Why help me?

141
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm actually helping myself.

142
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,920
I have a sister.

143
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,070
If she were alive today,

144
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,750
she'd be about your age.

145
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,680
Both my brother and I

146
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,560
were at fault.

147
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,350
But does that mean
Grand Marshal Jin didn't deserve to die?

148
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,270
Thank you for listening to my story.

149
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,200
Do you really have
to take Gu Mengqiu away?

150
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,630
I will explain the situation

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,750
and ask for leniency.

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,460
The blood jade case has been solved.

153
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,670
I remember

154
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,600
you once said you would leave

155
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,870
after the case ends.

156
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,840
Jiang Junsheng.

157
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,360
You're a good person.

158
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,240
I won't

159
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,390
forget this friendship.

160
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
I might also leave Rongcheng.

161
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,910
Outside, there are many like Hatoyama

162
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,870
waiting for their chance.

163
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,630
I can't just sit and wait.

164
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,670
My vision

165
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
can't be limited to Rongcheng.

166
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,840
So,

167
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,320
it's very likely
we won't see each other again.

168
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,550
These are chaotic times.

169
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,550
You must live a long life.

170
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,390
Maybe one day,

171
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,750
we'll meet again.

172
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,150
The case is solved,

173
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,910
so are we going back now?

174
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,720
You survived.

175
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,840
You can go home, too.

176
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,360
Will you remember me

177
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,720
after I go back?

178
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,150
How could I forget

179
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,000
such a unique partner like you?

180
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,840
Just a partner, huh?

181
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,080
You're my junior,

182
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,960
the owner of the fish print sachet,

183
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,390
and also the most important person
in my heart.

184
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
Greetings, both of you.

185
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,320
I'm the system operation engineer

186
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,750
for this game.

187
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,720
Congratulations

188
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,510
on completing the game.

189
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,870
However,

190
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,600
I have some unfortunate news.

191
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,270
I don't want to return to my world.

192
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,630
I want to stay with him.

193
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,150
You can't go there.

195
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,480
Then, I'll go to her world.

196
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,550
You can't go there, either.

197
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,080
This won't work, that won't work,

198
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,720
then what can be done?

199
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,750
Unfortunately,

200
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,790
Gao Han triggered an irreparable glitch

201
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,840
in his attempt to save you.

202
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,790
Now, I only have two options.

203
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,480
Option one.

204
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,790
According to the game rules,

205
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,910
I have

206
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,080
to completely delete Gao Han.

207
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,960
Then, I choose option two.

208
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,550
Option two?

209
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,080
The cost of option two

210
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,910
is severe.

211
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,720
No matter how severe,

212
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,360
I'm willing to bear it.

213
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,510
It's okay.

214
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,320
I don't agree.

215
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,360
If you truly choose option two,

216
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:33,390
Gao Han

217
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,000
will stay in this world forever.

218
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,080
Option two, then.

219
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,550
United in thought, huh?

220
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,670
Actually, option two

221
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,200
involves Gao Han helping me

222
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,720
to fix the game's glitches

223
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,790
and redeem his faults.

224
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,080
If that's the case,

225
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,360
I want to stay, too.

226
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,670
It seems

227
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,080
I've inadvertently helped you two.

228
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,480
How will you thank me?

229
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,960
Thank you?

230
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,150
Gao Han.

231
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,270
Do you remember what we said

232
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,390
about what to do
if we met the rotten programmer

233
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,480
who caused us

234
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:06,720
all this trouble?

235
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,080
Give them a good beating.

236
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,240
But I helped you

237
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,790
stay in this game world.

238
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,440
How can you treat me like this?

239
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,390
You guys...

240
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,150
You guys really have no conscience.

241
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,120
Our show doesn't come for free.

242
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,150
(Yugao Detective Agency)

243
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,030
Aren't we there yet?

244
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,240
Almost.

245
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,750
What exactly are you
giving me as a gift?

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,750
Open your eyes.

247
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,320
(Yugao Detective Agency)

248
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,120
Yugao Detective Agency.

249
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,480
Yugao?
[*Fish cake]

250
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,580
It really does sound
like a name you would pick.

251
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,870
Isn't this name great?

252
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,200
You don't like the name?

253
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,240
I like it.

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
I really like it.

255
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,000
That's great.

256
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,000
We can't get
the old detective agency back,

257
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,130
but now we have a new one.

258
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,440
From now on, we'll take on cases,

259
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,240
solve mysteries, and do what you,
the great detective,

260
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,270
love most.

261
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,630
For me,

262
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,120
the happiest thing

263
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,550
is being with you.

264
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,630
How could the detective agency

265
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,720
open without my congratulatory gift?

266
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,120
Why are you here?

267
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,230
Didn't you say
you were going to pursue your ambitions

268
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
and follow your dreams?

269
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,150
I decided to pursue my ambitions

270
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,270
with my ideal partner.

271
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,550
That's too much.

272
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,440
Bring up the congratulatory gift.

273
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,320
Understood.

274
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,480
