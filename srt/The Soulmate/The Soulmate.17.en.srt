=Episode 17=

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,760
There's not just perfume

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,920
in this brooch, but also

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,160
white phosphorus.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,800
I smelled the strong

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
garlic scent of white phosphorus,

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,450
so I stopped you
from putting out the fire with water.

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,719
Thank you, Miss Yu.

10
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,679
He gave me a bird brooch

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,799
and said it would keep me safe.

12
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,200
Is this how it kept me safe?

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,479
Who gave you this brooch?

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Zhang Zhiran.

15
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,560
Over these years, I've been
under the Grand Marsha's control.

16
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:04,519
He forced me to use my looks

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,480
to please those

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,079
who could bring him benefits.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,879
Once, he held a banquet,

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,920
and someone
had ill intentions toward me.

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:12,560
It was Zhiran...

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,040
It was Zhiran who saw it

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,920
and helped me out.

24
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,200
I thought he genuinely cared for me,

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,400
but turns out it was all fake.

26
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,799
Do you know

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,319
about his relationship with Third Lady?

28
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,439
I had my suspicions,

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
so I asked him about it.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,879
He answered that he and Ms. Hong

31
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,239
were both from Yacheng,

32
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,890
so their bond is in something in common.

33
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Please don't tell me

34
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,719
that Ms. Hong's recent overdose

35
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,920
was related to him.

36
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,120
No.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,599
Third Lady woke up and admitted to us
that the fact that she poisoned Miss Yu

38
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,550
and why she framed me
was under your instructions.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,000
She's slandering me.

40
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,200
I didn't do it.

41
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,560
Mengqiu.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,400
The situation
is unfavorable for you now.

43
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,640
Given the current situation,

44
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,599
you should tell the truth.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,520
I helped him cover up for so long,

46
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,639
yet in the end,
he still chose Ms. Hong.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,719
Alright.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,080
I'll tell the truth.

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,000
I saw it with my own eyes

50
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
that Zhang Zhiran
killed the Grand Marshal.

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,240
Did you...

52
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,039
Did you witness it with your own eyes?

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,759
This is bad.

54
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,680
If Zhang Zhiran was the mastermind,

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,240
he must have been monitoring nearby.

56
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,199
After seeing Gu Mengqiu unharmed,

57
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,570
he would worry getting exposed.

58
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,159
We need to find him now.

59
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,439
Let's go to the hospital.

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,319
Where's the patient?

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,280
She left.

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,000
She left?

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,960
When did she leave?

64
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,639
With who?

65
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,000
The patient left on her own will.

66
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,919
Around noon,
she suddenly wanted to discharge.

67
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,500
Come on, let's go to the tailor shop.

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,000
(Zhang's Tailor Shop)

69
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,680
We're a step too late again.

70
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
As expected, everything valuable
has been taken away.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,439
The blade is facing upward,

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
and there's no sign

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
of a struggle around here.

74
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,159
That means

75
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,960
Third Lady never anticipated

76
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,080
that Zhang Zhiran would attack her.

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,800
Judging from the wound,

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,159
Zhang Zhiran stabbed deeply.

79
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,810
He intended to kill with one blow.

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,480
After Third Lady fell,

81
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,480
Zhang Zhiran still stood in that spot,

82
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,759
observing for a while.

83
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,920
After ensuring Third Lady was dead,

84
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,839
he left.

85
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,800
This indicates

86
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,680
the two didn't just

87
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,879
have a sudden argument,

88
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,560
but Zhang Zhiran

89
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,800
deliberately intended to kill her.

90
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,040
(Zhang's Tailor Shop)

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,839
All these years,

92
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,560
you must've suffered.

93
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,079
Now,

94
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,199
we can finally leave.

95
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,720
Yes.

96
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,240
We can finally leave.

97
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm sorry, Qianhong.

98
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,839
I'm sorry, Qianhong!

99
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,199
Don't shout.

100
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,079
Eloping was just an excuse.

101
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,759
Zhang Zhiran lured her out

102
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,360
in order to keep the secret.

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,040
Then, he killed her.

104
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,800
That's highly possible.

105
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,279
Go on.

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,439
Tell our men

107
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,839
to set up checkpoints in Rongcheng.

108
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
We must not let Zhang Zhiran escape.

109
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,879
It has been arranged.

110
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,590
Third Lady and Zhang Zhiran
are from the same hometown,

111
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,150
and even with their years of friendship,

112
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,000
he still chose to kill her
to keep his secret.

113
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,000
Gu Mengqiu has just escaped danger.

114
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,580
Could he have gone back for her?

115
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,199
I've already arranged for our men
to protect her at her place.

116
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,160
But Marshal,

117
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
as soon as you left just now,

118
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,360
Miss Gu insisted on going back to rest.

119
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,319
Even Miss Yu couldn't stop her,

120
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,279
so she went with her.

121
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,839
Why didn't you guys stop her?

122
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's not argue here.

123
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,900
The girls are at risk.

124
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,790
We need to hurry back.

125
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,639
Mengqiu.

126
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,079
The culprit hasn't been caught yet.

127
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,920
You should go back
to the Grand Marshal's residence.

128
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,279
I'm staying in my house.

129
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,240
It's safe.

130
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
Besides, I have He with me.

131
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,120
He.

132
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,480
He.

133
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,120
Where is he?

134
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,480
I'll stay with you.

135
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,040
Don't worry.

136
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
You should go back.

137
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,439
Don't let them worry.

138
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,639
I'll be fine. Be careful.

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,879
Why are you here?

140
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,399
Miss Gu.

141
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,279
He, save me!

142
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:31,759
Shut up.

143
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:33,879
Stop shouting!

144
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,680
Stop shouting!

145
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,279
Listen to me.

146
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,480
I won't hurt you.

147
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll let go of my hand now,

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,279
but you must stay quiet.

149
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,800
He, save me!

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,319
Don't shout!

151
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,439
Help me! Help...

152
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:55,959
Don't shout!

153
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,160
I told you not to shout.

154
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,920
I'll tell you one more time.

155
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,639
I'm here to take you away,

156
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,879
not to hurt you.

157
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:05,680
But now,

158
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,519
we don't have time.

159
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,279
Once we're out of here,

160
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,480
I will tell you

161
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,120
everything.

162
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:10,759
Alright?

163
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,480
Don't make a noise.

164
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,240
- Help me!
- There's no time to explain. Come on.

165
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,639
I'm not leaving!

166
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,759
Come on. Be good, Mengqiu.

167
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,800
Be good and listen to me.

168
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,879
Come on!

169
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,519
What brings you guys here?

170
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,639
Gu Mengqiu is in danger.

171
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,120
We don't have time.

172
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,000
Let's go, Mengqiu.

173
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:38,639
Help!

174
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,240
Mengqiu.

175
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,720
Save me!

176
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,240
Mengqiu.

177
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,480
Save me!

178
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,480
Save me!

179
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,960
Calm down and put down your knife.

180
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,559
Don't move.

181
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:51,639
Don't move.

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,759
Calm down.

183
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:53,480
Drop the knife.

184
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,279
Calm down.

185
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,919
Shall we die altogether?

186
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,679
Calm down.

187
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,679
Mengqiu.

188
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,639
Come on.

189
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,159
Stop coming closer.

190
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:14,919
Calm down.

191
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,600
