00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,100
(Rongcheng Hospital)

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,100
(Pharmacy)

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,100
(Keep this area clean.)

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,350
(Keep quiet.)

7
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,879
What's up with your…?

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,520
It's all your fault.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,159
You've got my nose all out of whack.

10
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:48,600
It's fine.

11
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,200
Did Third Lady really wake up?

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,290
Yes. As soon as she woke up,

13
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,690
she requested to see us, saying she

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,170
had something important to tell us.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,759
This way.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,070
(Keep quiet.)

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,560
Marshal, Miss Yu.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,239
It's all my fault.

19
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,159
What do you mean?

20
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,159
You poisoned Miss Yu,

21
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,719
didn't you?

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,239
Yes, I did,

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,780
but it has nothing
to do with the Marshal.

24
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,280
What in the world do you mean by that?

25
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,200
You were dead set on framing me earlier,

26
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,079
and now you're suddenly confessing.

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,280
Seriously, what's your game?

28
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,480
What more can I scheme

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,760
after I've died once?

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,640
As for your question, Miss Yu,

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,719
the one

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,680
who got me

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,920
to poison you

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,280
is Gu Mengqiu.

35
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,200
Nonsense.

36
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,040
First, you frame me,

37
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
and now you're framing Gu Mengqiu.

38
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,719
Marshal.

39
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,519
Miss Yu.

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,400
Let me explain.

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,200
Gu Mengqiu

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,079
really did it all.

43
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,680
She has always been resentful
toward the Grand Marshal

44
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,200
and jealous of how much

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,120
he favored you.

46
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,159
She wanted his assets all to herself,

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,520
so she killed him.

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,479
Then she instructed me

49
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,080
to poison Miss Yu and frame you.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
She promised me

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,520
a third of the assets

52
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,120
and my freedom

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
once it's done.

54
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,319
I was foolish

55
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,280
to have believed her in the first place.

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,639
You're saying

57
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,759
it's all Gu Mengqiu's doing.

58
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:36,879
But do you

59
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,159
have any evidence?

60
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,400
I've died once.

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,520
I have no reason to lie.

62
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,639
But well, you can

63
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,280
verify everything I said.

64
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Gu Mengqiu also

65
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,039
gave me the poison

66
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,759
I took that day.

67
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,319
She told me

68
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,159
it was just a regular pill

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
that would only give me a stomachache

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,199
and nausea.

71
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,439
I didn't expect it

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
to be deadly.

73
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,280
After how vicious
she has been towards me,

74
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,120
there's no way I'm helping her again.

75
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,319
I swear, everything I said is true.

76
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,250
I'm willing
to confront her face-to-face.

77
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,639
Have someone guard the ward.

78
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:22,479
No one else is allowed in.

79
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,039
Yes, sir.

80
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,439
Do you two think

81
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,039
she's telling the truth?

82
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,599
If she's willing
to confront Gu Mengqiu face to face,

83
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,240
she probably isn't lying.

84
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,039
Whether it's true or not,

85
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,280
we should find Miss Gu

86
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,280
and ask her directly.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,319
(That smell just now…)

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,960
What's wrong?

89
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,479
Just now, I caught a scent

90
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,360
on Feng Qianhong that smelled

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,280
just like Zhang Zhiran.

92
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,120
How do you know what Zhang Zhiran

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,199
smells like?

94
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,520
I've smelled this scent

95
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,319
before.

96
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,879
It's like a mix of sachet

97
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,840
and disinfectant.

98
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,919
That means Zhang Zhiran

99
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
must have been at the hospital before

100
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,319
and lingered here

101
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,400
for quite some time,

102
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:14,879
which is why she's picked up that scent.

103
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,120
Still,

104
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,959
why would he come to the hospital?

105
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,319
Was he here for treatment

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
or something else?

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,199
By the way,

108
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,920
when did the Third Lady marry your father?

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,000
I think

110
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,600
it was like ten years back.

111
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,959
Did Zhang Zhiran's tailor shop

112
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
open around that time, too?

113
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,160
That's right.

114
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,759
Jun.

115
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:40,759
Yes, Marshal.

116
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,680
Check the connection

117
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,399
between Zhang Zhiran and the Third Lady.

118
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,079
Yes, sir.

119
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
I'll talk to Gu Mengqiu

120
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,120
to get some information.

121
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,480
Wait for my update.

122
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,399
Wait up.

123
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
Let me go instead.

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
You?

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,240
Yes.

126
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,920
Well,

127
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,360
one of you might
have a personal vendetta against her,

128
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,360
and the other is a great detective.

129
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,279
Either of you going
will raise suspicions.

130
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,800
Gu Mengqiu trusts me more,

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,360
so it's better if I go.

132
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,399
But…

133
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:11,120
Alright, we'll leave it to you then.

134
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,620
(Rongcheng Hospital)

135
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,590
(I'll meet you
at our love nest once it's done.)

136
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
I love you so much,

137
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,000
but you still want me

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
to fake an affair with Jiang Junsheng.

139
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,279
Can I even pull that off?

140
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,920
It's the only way.

141
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,920
He's…

142
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,319
Up.

143
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,090
He's not even close
to being on your level.

144
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,720
Seriously,

145
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
what if they

146
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,120
don't believe us?

147
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,839
The Gu family doesn't
only have one adopted son

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,639
but also an adopted daughter,

149
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,120
Gu Mengqiu.

150
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,240
Are you saying

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,319
I should frame her
if things don't work out?

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,720
That's the idea.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,680
And once that's done,

154
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,399
how will you repay me?

155
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
Hi, Miss Yu.

156
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,879
What brings you to meet me today?

157
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,680
I've been troubled by something lately.

158
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,680
Your brother kept trying

159
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:58,360
to break off the engagement with me

160
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,759
when the Grand Marshal was alive,

161
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,560
and now that he's gone,

162
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,360
he's agreeing to this marriage again.

163
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,839
I don't know what he's up to.

164
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,079
So, you're here to talk
about relationships, right?

165
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right.

166
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,639
You're my only friend in Rongcheng.

167
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
So, you have to help me out.

168
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,079
How can I help you?

169
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,720
That Jiang Junsheng has been

170
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,959
toying with my feelings.

171
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,519
After thinking it through,

172
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,160
I've decided to call off this marriage.

173
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,120
Could you please

174
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,680
convey my thoughts to him?

175
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,759
I never expected you
to come to me for help.

176
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
But…

177
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,040
But is it difficult for you?

178
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,360
I've heard before that your relationship

179
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,240
with your brother

180
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,319
isn't great.

181
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,839
Are you worried about offending him

182
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,959
if you help me?

183
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
Although Marshal and I

184
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,959
were both adopted,

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,660
we're still
the Grand Marshal's children.

186
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,120
How could our relationship be bad?

187
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,160
Besides,

188
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,720
we live

189
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
under the same roof,

190
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,480
so there's some mutual understanding.

191
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,319
Be straight with me.

192
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,759
Wasn't the Grand Marshal

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,759
particularly harsh on you guys?

194
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,000
I heard he

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,959
had some strange quirks.

196
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,639
Now that he's gone,

197
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
isn't it

198
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,000
a relief for you?

199
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,160
Who do you think you are?

200
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
You're just like a dish.

201
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,879
Whoever wants a bite

202
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,519
takes a bite.

203
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
Today, I'll skin you alive.

204
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,559
I'll show you

205
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,080
what you really are.

206
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,919
Help!

207
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,639
Miss Yu.

208
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,360
Please not speak rashly.

209
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
My father's already gone.

210
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,559
Let's not talk about this anymore.

211
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,159
But,

212
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,639
if I may ask,

213
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,440
why do you want to cancel the engagement
with the Marshal?

214
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,879
Well,

215
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,879
there's a reason for it.

216
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,879
Is it

217
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,080
because you've fallen for someone else?

218
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,879
Is he someone

219
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,799
who's far away

220
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,399
yet close at hand?

221
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,440
Do you get jealous

222
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,039
when you see him talking to other girls?

223
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,519
And when you can't see him,

224
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,759
do you miss him a lot?

225
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
Is he with you

226
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,279
day and night,

227
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,480
through thick and thin?

228
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,320
No,

229
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
he wouldn't.

230
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,279
When you mention "he",

231
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,240
is it…?

232
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Fire.

233
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,480
There's a fire.

234
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,360
Fire!

235
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,399
This is white phosphorus.

236
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,200
Don't splash it!

237
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,639
Are you okay?

238
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,559
I'm fine.

239
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,080
It's the blood jade curse.

240
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,320
It must be the blood jade curse.

241
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,399
Let's get out of here first.

242
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,440
Let's go.

243
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,559
Marshal.

244
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:26,600
(Land Property Transfer Agreement)

245
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,250
Feng Qianhong was once a female lead
in the Yacheng Opera Troupe.

246
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,360
She was favored by my father.

247
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,559
It's surprising

248
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:34,120
they knew each other so early.

249
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,840
So,

250
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,159
Zhang Zhiran and Feng Qianhong

251
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,190
came to Rongcheng together.

252
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,159
Feng Qianhong
bought the tailor shop for him,

253
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
but he never told anyone

254
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,759
about it.

255
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,919
He was present at both Grand Marshal

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,039
and Cao Liang's deaths.

257
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,350
Grand Marshal didn't die

258
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,799
because of the blood jade

259
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,919
but because he

260
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,919
found out the secret

261
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,879
between these two,

262
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,000
and then Cao Liang

263
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,080
found the clues he left in the study.

264
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,480
So…

265
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,759
What do you think he did?

266
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,190
He killed those who knew the secret.

267
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,159
Therefore,

268
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,960
Zhang Zhiran,

269
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,399
fearing we'd find out,

270
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,279
had his old lover Feng Qianhong

271
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,039
use Gu Mengqiu

272
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,200
to divert our attention,

273
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,399
giving cover to himself

274
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,240
and Feng Qianhong.

275
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,679
Did Zhang Zhiran give her the poison?

276
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,799
But there's a loophole.

277
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,919
If she knew

278
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,879
the poison was real,

279
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,639
why would she help him?

280
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,759
She would.

281
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:35,679
People will do anything

282
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,000
for someone they love.

283
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,240
Fire.

284
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,039
Fire.

285
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,200
Big fire.

286
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,360
Blood jade.

287
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,759
Blood jade, don't kill me.

288
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,559
Blood jade.

289
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,759
Mengqiu, don't be afraid.

290
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:48,960
It's okay now.

291
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
It's not the blood jade
that wants to kill you.

292
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,720
It's this.

293
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:10,759
Why?

294
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:14,960
