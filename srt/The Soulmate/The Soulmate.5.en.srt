00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,350
The doctor has checked on her.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,160
Third Lady has eaten the drugged pastries

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,760
and has temporarily fallen asleep,

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,230
but there's no serious harm.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,150
Where are the pastries?

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,440
They've all been sealed away.

9
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,350
Something is fishy about it.

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,710
We'll stay here and wait
for Third Lady to wake up.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,750
Let's see if there are any new clues.

12
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,690
(The cabinet is made of Phoebe wood,)

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,950
(exclusively used to store
official and imperial robes,)

14
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,150
(thus the high-quality wood.)

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,390
(Though there are many cheongsams,)

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,190
(they are not stored closely together)

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,590
(to prevent friction)

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,760
(and snagging when hanging.)

19
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,760
(With camphor balls, charcoal bags,)

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,710
(and such a fine wardrobe,)

21
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,120
(taking these measures
against moths and dampness)

22
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,000
(shows these cheongsams)

23
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,920
(hold special significance
for Third Lady.)

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,590
(From the tailoring style
and the attention to detail,)

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,590
(it appears these cheongsams
were made by the same tailor.)

26
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,760
I find Third Lady

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,790
a bit odd.

28
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,430
It's unclear whether she

29
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,680
ordered the pastries herself

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,230
and is putting on an act here

31
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,840
or if someone is truly out to get her.

32
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,640
What do you think?

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,890
Take a look for yourself.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
Brocade.

35
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,910
Hangluo.
[*A type of silk.]

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,400
Pure silk.

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,060
Gambiered Guangdong gauze.

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
So?

39
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,510
It's not quite appropriate

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,490
for a gentleman to rummage
through someone's home

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,690
on his first visit, is it?

42
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,630
Sorry about that.

43
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,870
It's my first visit.

44
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm unfamiliar with such grandeur.

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,870
Allow me to introduce this gentleman.

46
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,000
He is

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,150
my senior, Gao Han,

48
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,120
a renowned detective.

49
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,360
(Gao Han?)

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,910
(Could this be the Mr. Gao
she sent the watch to?)

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,440
(Rongcheng Watchmaker's Shop)

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,360
Marshal, you're here.

53
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,910
How may I assist you today?

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,080
Adjust the time for me.

55
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,590
Certainly, it'll be just a moment.

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,030
Please take a seat over there.

57
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,620
(Rongcheng Watchmaker's Shop)

58
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,600
(Rongcheng Watchmaker's Shop)

59
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,750
Miss.

60
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,520
How may I be of service to you?

61
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,750
Show me the most attractive watches

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,710
in your store.

63
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,430
Alright, I'll get them for you.

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,310
These

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,750
are the finest pieces we have.

66
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,120
(How persistent.)

67
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,000
This one.

68
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,870
I'm giving it as a gift.

69
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,110
Could you wrap it up nicely for me?

70
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Sure, no problem at all.

71
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,240
Do you need a card?

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,960
Yes.

73
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,120
Please write on it for me.

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,120
"To Mr. Gao".

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,750
Alright.

76
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
Here you go, miss.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,910
It costs a silver coin.

78
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,630
Thank you.

79
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,870
Thank you for your patronage.

80
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,080
Take care on your way out.

81
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,080
(A detective, huh?)

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,920
Doesn't sound
like a very serious profession.

83
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,070
Mr. Jiang.

84
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,000
It seems you have some prejudice

85
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,950
against the profession.

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Gao Han.

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,430
This is my...

88
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,190
The Mashal of Rongcheng,
Jiang Junsheng.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,390
Miss Yu's fiance.

90
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,090
Aren't we going
to call off the engagement?

91
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,390
Third Lady is awake.

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,070
Why suddenly address me as your senior?

93
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,360
You're skilled in autopsies
and solving cases.

94
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,750
How could I not refer to you one?

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,700
Then, why don't you see me
as your mentor?

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,510
Have you ever heard

97
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,040
the saying,

98
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,800
"Once a teacher, always a mentor"?

99
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,120
So, you should see me as...

100
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,560
Miss Yu fainted

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,950
after eating the pastries.

102
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,560
I realized something was wrong
and tried to go out for help,

103
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,390
but I didn't expect to faint as well.

104
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,800
Miss Yu, are you alright?

105
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
I'm fine.

106
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,190
This is...

107
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,120
Where did the pastries come from?

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,430
I had ordered them from the kitchen.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,120
I didn't expect such an issue to arise.

110
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,630
Marshal.

111
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,720
Could someone be trying to harm me?

112
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,830
How could this happen?

113
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,270
I've involved Miss Yu as well.

114
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,040
Go.

115
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,630
Investigate everyone
who handled the pastries.

116
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,560
Yes, Marshal.

117
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's go check the kitchen.

118
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,240
Let's go, too.

119
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
Third Lady.

120
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,160
Rest well.

121
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,560
Did you smell

122
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
a particular scent?

123
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,870
What scent?

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
The smell of garlic.

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,920
The smell of garlic?

126
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,510
Ms. Wang.

127
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,800
Ms. Wang!

128
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,870
Marshal, you called for me?

129
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,310
Did you tamper with the pastries?

130
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,630
Miss Yu, you said

131
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,800
that you would protect me

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,720
if something happened.

133
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,950
Me?

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,360
It was you who poisoned the food?

135
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,720
I didn't.

136
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:02,830
No.

137
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,630
There must
be some misunderstanding here.

138
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,800
How about this?

139
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,000
Let Ms. Wang finish

140
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,830
what she was saying.

141
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,750
Poison?

142
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,480
No.

143
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,240
I...

144
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
It was aphrodisiac.

145
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,630
Aphro-what?

146
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,070
Aphrodisiac.

147
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Marshal.

148
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,830
Last mid-autumn,

149
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,160
Miss Yu had me

150
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,560
add something to your soup.

151
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,560
I...

152
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,830
dared not follow through.

153
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,720
Are you sure it was only once
that you added the aphrodisiac?

154
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,070
Ms. Wang.

155
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,750
If I discover it's a lie...

156
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,560
It's true.

157
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,310
It's just once.

158
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,160
Tell me.

159
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,120
What is

160
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,000
with today's pastries?

161
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,510
The pastries?

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,830
Do you mean

163
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,720
the ones made for Third Lady today?

164
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,190
They were all made normally,

165
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:01,800
without

166
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,190
any unidentified substances.

167
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,390
The ingredients
are still in the kitchen.

168
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,750
You can check them.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,070
Of course I will.

170
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,190
You may leave now.

171
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,480
Aphrodisiac, huh?

172
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,200
I seem to be a bit unsettled.

173
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,360
Let's head back first.

174
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,360
Miss Yu.

175
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,150
I'll continue the investigation

176
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,120
and surely give you an explanation.

177
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,840
Okay.

178
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,200
We'll be leaving now.

179
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,080
Let's go.

180
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,240
Gao Han.

181
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,320
Are you alright?

182
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm fine.

183
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:04,750
Let's go.

184
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,000
Miss Yu, please wait.

185
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,200
What are you doing?

186
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,200
It's fine.

187
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,550
You don't have to.

188
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,790
Just leave it

189
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,720
to me.

190
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
That's enough.

191
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,630
(This handkerchief)

192
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,840
(has the same fabric
as Third Lady's cheongsam.)

193
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,320
Miss Yu.

194
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,670
How come you've never mentioned

195
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,150
having such a good senior before?

196
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,960
I probably

197
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,080
didn't have the time.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,750
Miss Yu.

199
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,360
May I have a word with you?

200
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll come with you.

201
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,080
It's okay. I'll go by myself.

202
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,080
Let's go.

203
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,320
I saw you at the watchmaker's shop.

204
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,960
The pocket watch you bought

205
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,600
was for that gentleman, right?

206
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,910
This has nothing to do with you, right?

207
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,720
Until the engagement is terminated,

208
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,200
you are still my fiancee.

209
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Please speak and act cautiously.

210
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,870
(No matter)

211
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,120
(how good-looking he is,)

212
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,600
(no one would date him)

213
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,510
(in my Cupid game.)

214
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,360
I haven't finished speaking yet.

215
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,080
Hey...

216
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,200
Are you feeling unwell?

217
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,790
