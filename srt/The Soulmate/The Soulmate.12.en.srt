1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:15,160
=The Soulmate=

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,720
Yeah, that's the one.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm telling you,
I've made a lot of money there.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,680
You can make money there?

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,360
Of course. Why not?

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,590
I'll take you there next time.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,920
Yeah, take me there.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,560
I've been lucky at the tables.

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,680
Commander.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,440
Let go of me.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,880
Move.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,720
Hurry up.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,640
Hey, that's rough.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,040
Miss Yu.

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,840
Welcome.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,680
Miss Yu.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,160
Welcome to be here.

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,960
Who are you?

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,720
Me?

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,160
Come on, Miss Yu.

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,640
Stop acting like you don't know me.

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,280
But I really don't know you.

24
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm Yan Hekun,
the second in command in Rongcheng.

25
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,960
Served in the army my whole life

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,560
with great achievements in war.

27
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,520
People call me Commander Yan.

28
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,240
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,840
Second in command, huh?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,200
Is that a big deal?

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,390
Doesn't that mean there
is someone above you?

32
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,400
(Gao Han.)

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,600
(Gao Han.)

34
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
(Can you hear me?)

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,080
(I'm in trouble over here.)

36
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,040
That's pretty impressive.

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,720
You insolent wretch.

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,040
That brat Jiang

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,560
has turned Rongcheng upside down
for you.

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,800
I'll trade you
for the blood jade with him.

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,280
He'll definitely agree.

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,160
Get her inside.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,880
Move.

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,480
Let go of me.

45
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,880
Let go of me.

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,640
Move.

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,200
Hurry up.

48
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,920
Hurry up.

49
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
Before sending her back,

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,040
can we get a bit of her for ourselves?

51
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,320
We need the Grand Marshal's
approval.

52
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,680
We can't just touch her as we please.

53
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,280
You two

54
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,640
may do as you wish.

55
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you, Commander.

56
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,280
Let's go.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,800
Nan Yu.

58
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,340
(Blood jade for her.
Midnight at the old warehouse)

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,180
(south of the city.
The Marshal must come. Yan Hekun)

60
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm going to shoot him dead.

61
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,240
Who's going first?

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,240
I'm warning you,

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
stay back.

64
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,360
You first.

65
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,000
You first.

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,560
After you.

67
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm warning you,

68
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,640
stay back.

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,760
How about together?

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,160
Okay.

71
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,890
Stay away from me.

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,600
Go away.

73
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
Look at her. She's so petite.

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Get lost.

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,360
How dare you hit one of us?

76
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,400
Trying to run, eh?

77
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,320
She hit me just now.

78
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,530
Get something to bind her with.

79
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,560
Let go of me.

80
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,080
Tie her up.

81
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,800
Let go of me.

82
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,440
Come on.

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,040
Can't you guys keep it down?

84
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Let go of me.

85
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,720
Tie her tighter.

86
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
Let go of me.

87
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
Commander is here.

88
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,880
What's going on here?

89
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,920
Miss Yu.

90
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
I wanted you to relax a bit,

91
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,160
but I didn't expect you
to have such a fiery temper.

92
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,840
Resorting to the lowdown trick

93
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,440
of kidnapping a woman,

94
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
you must have no one to love you.

95
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,080
No one? Who do you mean?

96
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,880
Cao Liang is dead,

97
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,790
yet his over 30 concubines
still miss him dearly.

98
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
You can't even compare to that.

99
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,590
No wonder you've been second fiddle
your whole life.

100
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,920
How dare you.

101
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,240
Just shut up and stay here.

102
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,000
You and your sharp tongue.

103
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,240
Commander.

104
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,760
They're here.

105
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Can't you speak properly?

106
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,320
Alright, everyone, get ready.

107
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,720
Alright.

108
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,160
Okay.

109
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Get them.

110
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
That brat Jiang

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
really will give up the blood jade
for you, eh?

112
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,080
Stay where you are.

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
Where's the jade?

114
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,280
Nan Yu, are you okay?

115
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,080
Are you alright?

116
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,400
Look closely.

117
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,560
Your woman

118
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,240
is totally unscathed.

119
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Where's the jade?

120
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
Can you give it to me now?

121
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,280
The jade is here.

122
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Let her go first.

123
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,280
How would I know
if you'll use a piece of fake jade

124
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,360
to fool me?

125
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
You don't believe me?

126
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,880
If you don't,

127
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,920
I'll smash it right now.

128
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,520
Don't.

129
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,840
Fine.

130
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
I'll hand her over,

131
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,600
and you'll give me the jade.

132
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,180
- Are you okay?
- Run.

133
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,200
I have a bomb on me.

134
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,120
How dare you trick me with fake jade!

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,680
Watch out.

136
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Be careful.

137
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,800
You guys...!

138
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Marshal, sorry for being late.

139
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,480
Jiang Junsheng.

140
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,200
Are you okay?

141
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,120
I'm fine.

142
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,400
You shameless coward.

143
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,280
You brought people with you.

144
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,160
You only asked
that Marshal come in person.

145
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,280
You didn't mention
not to bring others along.

146
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,480
Take them away.

147
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:03,960
Roger that.

148
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,840
Move.

149
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,680
I can walk by myself.

150
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,600
- Get up now.
- Move.

151
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,040
- Move.
- Get up.

152
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,780
Why did you risk your life like that?

153
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,960
Why are you smiling?

154
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,120
Nothing.

155
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,480
What about you? Are you okay?

156
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,280
Running away, huh?

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,760
Let's go.

158
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,800
Is she okay?

159
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,640
I brought her

160
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,500
some butterfly crackers
from Yulan Restaurant.

161
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
The doctor just left.

162
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,600
She's already asleep.

163
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,840
How's everything on your end?

164
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,440
Yan Hekun spilled everything.

165
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,470
He got suspicious
because of Mengqiu's words,

166
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,400
so he kidnapped Miss Yu

167
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
on the spur of the moment

168
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
and found out about our trap.

169
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
It was all my fault.

170
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,920
I should have left quietly.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,120
Why did I have

172
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,480
to mention the butterfly crackers

173
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,880
and cause so much trouble?

174
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
I'd rather bear the suffering
in Miss Yu's place.

175
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,720
Miss Gu.

176
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,800
If you really

177
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,720
feel bad about it,

178
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
you can go back and slap yourself.

179
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,320
If you still feel uneasy,

180
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,560
then tie your hands

181
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
and strap on some explosives.

182
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,400
I know whatever I say

183
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,040
won't make up for my faults.

184
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,920
I promised Miss Yu this.

185
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Please give this to her.

186
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,320
I have to go.

187
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,400
Thank you

188
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,200
for saving me.

189
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,280
I did it to save her.

190
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
I have

191
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,400
done too many things wrong before.

192
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,360
Now I just want to make things right.

193
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
I...

194
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,960
still want to ask you for that favor.

195
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,840
Sorry.

196
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,760
Let me finish.

197
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,400
I knew you'd turn me down.

198
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,600
But this time,

199
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,760
only you can help me.

200
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,160
I just want

201
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,280
to apologize to her in person.

202
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
You two have a good rest.

203
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,680
Sorry for bothering you.

204
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,240
Are you free tomorrow?

205
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,590
