=Episode 9=

3
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,719
Contestants, please get ready.

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,600
You can't beat me.

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,320
How do you know without trying?

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
Three.

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,320
Two.

8
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,399
One.

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,560
Start.

10
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:54,840
(Why did I feel)

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,399
(a surge of energy just now?)

12
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,439
(I was right.)

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,680
(There's energy again.)

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560
Gao Han wasn't ready just now.

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,680
I shouted too quickly.

16
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,359
Let's try again.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,359
Three.

18
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,760
Two.

19
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,120
Put some effort into it.

20
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,319
One.

21
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,120
Start.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Best of three.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,120
There's no need to continue.

24
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,920
Who said it's best of three?

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,760
It's best of five.

26
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,159
It's not over yet.

27
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,719
Right. Let's continue. Quickly.

28
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,480
Again.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,920
Can you be serious?

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,239
Do you really want him to move in?

31
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,159
I know.

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:54,920
I'll be

33
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,280
serious this round.

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,920
Three.

35
00:01:59,239 --> 00:01:59,920
Two.

36
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:00,920
One.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,719
Start.

38
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,519
Come on.

39
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,639
Put some effort into it.

40
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,039
Defeat him.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,560
Two to one.

42
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,479
Gan Han won.

43
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,520
Not bad.

44
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,080
Again.

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,639
Bring it on.

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,439
(Why?)

47
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:32,719
(Why does my energy
recover like never before)

48
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:33,680
(when I touch him?)

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,199
(Jiang Junsheng, you're the one.)

50
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,380
Are you going to compete?

51
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,759
Of course.

52
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,360
Three.

53
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,400
Two.

54
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,439
One.

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,719
Start.

56
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,280
Yes.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,759
That's the look.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,080
Come on, Gao Han.

59
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,520
Two to two.

60
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,360
It's a tie.

61
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,319
You can do it.

62
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,159
This time,

63
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,439
let's both go all out.

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,759
Start.

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,479
Come on.

66
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:14,879
Gao Han won.

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,319
You lost, Marshal.

68
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,280
You may leave now.

69
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,479
No.

70
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,039
Jiang Junsheng must stay.

71
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,240
Have you gone nuts?

72
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,319
Look. He's so weak.

73
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,080
After such

74
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,120
intense exercise,

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,719
he must be feeling weak.

76
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,280
It would

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,080
be mean of us

78
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,960
to make him leave now.

79
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,800
Yes.

80
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:42,719
I...

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,759
Fine. I concede.

82
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,000
The room at the end
of the second-floor corridor

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,520
is yours, Marshal.

84
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,439
If you don't mind,

85
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,960
you can squeeze with me tonight.

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,520
What do you want to talk to me about?

87
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,240
Mr. Gao.

88
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,360
I've always been curious of your relationship

89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,759
with Miss Yu.

90
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:13,879
How have I

91
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,039
never heard her mention you?

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,240
Regardless of our relationship,

93
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,399
it doesn't have anything

94
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,879
to do with you from today onward.

95
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,399
After calling off the engagement,

96
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,639
you both will go your separate paths.

97
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,680
But considering
that you've helped me before,

98
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,079
I'd advise you

99
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,959
to part on good terms.

100
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm telling you.

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,879
I won't give up easily

102
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,600
on what I have set my eyes on.

103
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,439
That's not up to you.

104
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,319
Have you ever considered her feelings?

105
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,399
Have you ever asked her?

106
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,519
The most important thing for girls

107
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,800
is respect.

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,560
Respect?

109
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,079
I'll treat her very well

110
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,399
from today onward.

111
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,040
I'll buy her whatever she wants

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
in the whole of Rongcheng.

113
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,879
Is that what you call respect?

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,160
I can see

115
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,040
that Miss Yu trusts you a lot.

116
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,839
I actually have a favor to ask.

117
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,360
Since you know it's a favor,

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,519
there's no need to ask.

119
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,759
I know what you're thinking.

120
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,040
It's just that she was the one
pursuing you,

121
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,390
so you feel discontented now
that she's no longer doing it.

122
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,370
You couldn't believe it.

123
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,759
That's not true.

124
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,519
I

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,120
sincerely

126
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,720
love Miss Yu very much.

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,639
She is forthright, generous,

128
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,319
admits her mistakes,

129
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,839
and intelligent.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,079
Indeed she is.

131
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,480
Have you noticed

132
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
that she's very meticulous now?

133
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,800
She is attentive

134
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,720
when listening to gossip.

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,839
You feel that too?

136
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,079
Well done

137
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,000
(in the Golden Summit Battle, kid.)

138
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,360
You're truly my son.

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,319
As a reward for you,

140
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,240
I've arranged

141
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,439
a marriage for you.

142
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,959
She's a coroner

143
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,920
who studied abroad

144
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,199
called Lady Yu.

145
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,920
Her family background is extraordinary.

146
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,199
She's more than suitable for you.

147
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,439
I don't agree to this marriage.

148
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,399
How dare you?

149
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,399
I picked you up outside.

150
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,439
You must do

151
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,800
whatever is say.

152
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:39,399
All these years, you raised me

153
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,879
because you wanted

154
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,839
an obedient dog.

155
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,680
I've repaid you by risking my life

156
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,000
for you over the years.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,759
You're asking for it.

158
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,959
Listen here.

159
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,560
Rongcheng

160
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
is no longer

161
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,160
just yours alone.

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,480
Jiang Junsheng.

163
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,920
You're just a dog!

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,160
Why is Jiang Junsheng here?

165
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,439
They're acting so strange.

166
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,720
No way.

167
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,159
Why are you exclaiming?

168
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,639
He's almost

169
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,559
as good as I am.

170
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,679
Are you sure

171
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,200
it's just a little difference?

172
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,720
Feel it for yourself.

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,519
I have it too.

174
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,080
Good evening.

175
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
Oh, Jin.

176
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
You're so selfish

177
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,519
for not telling me where you hid it
when you died.

178
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,480
It's so much trouble to look for it.

179
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,000
What's this?

180
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,080
