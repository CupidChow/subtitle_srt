=Episode 7=

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,760
Marshal, good morning.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,710
Governor Cao.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,960
What brings you

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,120
here today?

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,870
Wait.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
Didn't the Third Lady tell you?

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,350
Third Lady?

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,840
I invited Governor Cao here.

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,150
Third Lady.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,430
Third Lady.

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,030
You seem to have misunderstood

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,240
what I said last night.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,280
I did not.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,350
But the Grand Marshal has been buried,

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,000
and there are some posthumous matters
that need to be dealt with.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,790
Governor Cao.

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,320
Thank you for coming.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,240
It's nothing.

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,750
The Grand Marshal and I
had a close relationship,

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,150
and everyone trusts me.

23
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,870
For that, I'd like to help

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,640
by managing this matter from the side.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,840
How are you going to help?

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,430
Third Lady, do you mean

27
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,000
Governor Cao will serve as a witness

28
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,040
as we divide the family inheritance?

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,870
Marshal.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,200
The Grand Marshal has been laid to rest,

31
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,970
and I have to return to my hometown
to take care of his grave.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,510
But before I leave,

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,680
there are some matters
that need to be addressed.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,680
I'll fetch Mengqiu.

35
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,230
As for Miss Yu,

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,710
perhaps you should pick her up.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,280
That's right.

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,350
Your marriage to Miss Yu

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
was arranged by the Grand Marshal.

40
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,400
Although you haven't married yet,

41
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,070
she's considered half of the family.

42
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,760
Besides, Miss Yu conducted

43
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,280
the Grand Marshal's autopsy,

44
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,230
so it's appropriate
for her to be present.

45
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,200
I'll fetch Mengqiu.

46
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
No need.

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
I'll arrange for someone to go.

48
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,560
As for Miss Yu,

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,680
I'll personally invite her.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,120
That's fine.

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,560
Let's go
with the Marshal's arrangement.

52
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,080
Marshal.

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,430
Governor Cao.

54
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,910
Is there something else you need?

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,240
Why don't we

56
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,520
find somewhere private to talk?

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,250
That won't be necessary.

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,240
We can talk right here.

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,560
That's fine, too.

60
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,840
Marshal, you do know

61
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,560
that the Grand Marshal and I

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,910
have made an important deal

63
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,840
involving a priceless treasure, right?

64
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,870
Governor Cao.

65
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,080
You might as well speak directly.

66
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,520
Beating around the bush not only
prevents you from getting what you want,

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,120
but it also wastes my time.

68
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,680
Marshal, you're straightforward.

69
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,280
Then I'll get to the point.

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,030
Do you know the whereabouts
of the blood jade?

71
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,190
The blood jade?

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,400
My father did mention this
before he passed away,

73
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,910
but it disappeared after his death.

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,430
By saying so,

75
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,030
it means you still don't trust me.

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,310
Marshal.

77
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,750
In Rongcheng,

78
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,280
only I, Cao Liang,

79
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,360
am dedicated to you.

80
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,000
After obtaining the treasure,
we can split the profits fifty-fifty...

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,560
Marshal, the car is ready.

82
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,190
Governor Cao.

83
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,710
Please have a rest.

84
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,520
Marshal.

85
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,750
You usually dislike having Miss Yu over.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,960
Why are you personally
going to pick her up?

87
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,360
Who knows what the Third Lady is up to?

88
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,470
Since she wants to put on a show,

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,030
I'll get her more audiences.

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Detective Gao.

91
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,560
Marshal, why are you here?

92
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,100
To annul your engagement with my junior?

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,130
Why were you looking for me?

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,000
Since our engagement is still in effect,

95
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,910
your private meetings with other men

96
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,240
may not be appropriate.

97
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,840
Speaking of engagements,

98
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,280
you seem rather inefficient
in handling such matters.

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,900
It shouldn't take so long
to annul an engagement.

100
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,840
Are you in a hurry?

101
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,560
That's correct.

102
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,030
Who would want to be engaged to someone

103
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,150
they don't like?

104
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,750
You seem to have forgotten
how you pursued me in the past.

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
Marshal.

106
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,310
Life has had its ups and downs.

107
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,070
Let's not dwell on the past.

108
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,160
We're dividing
the family inheritance today,

109
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,870
and all related personnel
have to be there.

110
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,680
You need to come with me.

111
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,920
It's your family matter,

112
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,120
so I won't be joining.

113
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,830
You can go alone.

114
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,680
Please leave.

115
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,510
We have to go.

116
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,750
The amount of time I can stay outside
is uncertain.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,230
This is the perfect opportunity

118
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,990
to have a look
around the Grand Marshal's residence.

119
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,720
Okay.

120
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,830
I'll go with you.

121
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,390
Junior, why don't I accompany you?

122
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,160
This is our family matter.

123
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,450
We have no time to entertain guests.

124
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,950
First, you asked
to annul your engagement,

125
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,630
and now you're
discussing family matters with her.

126
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,040
How could I feel assured

127
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,360
when a young woman like her

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,310
keeps getting ordered around?

129
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,240
(When did this guy become so eloquent?)

130
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,270
(He's making it awkward.)

131
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,490
The others haven't arrived yet.

132
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,600
I'll take a stroll.

133
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,830
Alright.

134
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,310
Let's talk here.

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
I shouldn't have come here.

136
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,560
What are you afraid of?

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,750
No one has discovered

138
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,120
what you did.

139
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,950
(Third Lady.)

140
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,830
(Who is she talking to?)

141
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,750
Ms. Hong.

142
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,480
What are you talking about?

143
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,190
I don't understand.

144
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,190
Gao Han, why are you here?

145
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
What's the matter?

146
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,390
The Third Lady

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,190
is arguing with a woman

148
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,480
in a dress.

149
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,070
A woman?

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,950
Who is it?

151
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,270
There's no one there.

152
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,510
They left.

153
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,630
Let's go back.

154
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,390
This is such an important matter,

155
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
but why isn't Yan here yet?

156
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,390
You know

157
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,430
that Commander Yan and Marshal Jiang

158
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,920
don't get along.

159
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
Now that the Grand Marshal passed away,

160
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,240
do you

161
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,920
think he would come
to testify for the Marshal?

162
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:42,870
You're right.

163
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,270
He chose not to come.

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
If we get news

165
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,560
of the blood jade's whereabouts today,

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,850
it would be a great steal for us.

167
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,480
Governor Cao, Chief Wang.

168
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,630
What are you discussing?

169
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,040
You look quite happy.

170
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,870
The Marshal has returned.

171
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,510
(That same outfit.)

172
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,120
(Could the one)

173
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,310
(arguing with the Third Lady)

174
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:16,950
(be her?)

175
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,920
I've met most of you,

176
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,360
but you...

177
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,390
Marshal.

178
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,070
Who is this gentleman?

179
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,430
This gentleman is Gao Han,

180
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,800
Miss Yu's friend

181
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,680
and a detective.

182
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,120
This is my foster father's
foster daughter,

183
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,360
Gu Mengqiu.

184
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,480
Detective Gao.

185
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,240
Nice to meet you.

186
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,360
Nice to meet you.

187
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,310
Marshal.

188
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,000
Why did you bring a detective here?

189
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,120
The reason
for my father's death is still unknown.

190
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,800
With a detective
aiding our investigation,

191
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,190
I'm sure the culprit
will be caught soon.

192
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,240
Marshal.

193
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,360
This case is currently

194
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
being investigated

195
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,390
by the police.

196
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,430
What you're doing

197
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,750
might be a bit inappropriate.

198
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,830
Since Mr. Gao is the Marshal's friend,

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,630
let's give him a seat.

200
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,920
Now that everyone is seated,

201
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,900
let me say a few words.

202
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,390
Father passed away too suddenly

203
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,070
and didn't leave a will.

204
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,480
From today onward,

205
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,390
I will temporarily take over

206
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,490
all matters
at the Grand Marshal's residence.

207
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,750
Before my father's belongings
are sorted out,

208
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,100
everything will remain the same.

209
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,360
Any objections?

210
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,750
No objections.

211
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,480
May I know if his belongings

212
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,240
include a blood jade or other treasures?

213
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,880
I've only heard about the blood jade.

214
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,840
As for other treasures,

215
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,550
those are just groundless rumors.

216
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,720
I've never believed in them,

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,200
nor have I asked about them.

218
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,270
Groundless rumors.

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,480
Groundless rumors?

220
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,360
I've had enough of being nice.

221
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,000
Marshal!

222
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,150
Governor Cao.

223
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,750
Calm down.

224
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,150
That's a hefty sum.

225
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,120
If you want to take it all,

226
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,080
you should first

227
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,030
know if you can do it.

228
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh, Governor Cao.

229
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,670
We're on the same side.

230
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,000
We can discuss an agreement.

231
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,910
Okay? An agreement.

232
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,910
Marshal.

233
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,480
I, too, have a question.

234
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,960
Will you and Miss Yu still

235
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,790
annul your engagement?

236
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,910
There are many things still
waiting to be dealt with,

237
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,440
and Father has just been laid to rest,

238
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
so it's not the right time

239
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
to annul the engagement.

240
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,360
Besides,

241
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
this marriage was arranged

242
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,750
before Father passed away.

243
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,030
The matter between Miss Yu and me

244
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,030
shouldn't be discussed
in this situation.

245
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,790
On the contrary,

246
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,670
it's quite necessary.

247
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,150
What's the necessity?

248
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,550
Since you're so indifferent to me,

249
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,440
I see no need

250
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
to help you keep it a secret.
