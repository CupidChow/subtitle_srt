=Episode 19=

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,120
Congratulations to Mr. Gao Han

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
(Live Heartthrob)
for being crowned

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,160
(Live Heartthrob)
the top detective in our realm.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,000
Do you have any tips to share with us?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,200
(Gao Han, Ace Detective)
Stay alive.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,040
(Case Success: 99%, Solve Rate: 99.99%)

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,040
Are you saying staying alive
is more important than solving cases?

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,680
(Charm: 100%)

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,640
(Charm: 100%)
Only by staying alive longer

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,760
can you solve more cases
and save more people.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:35,680
(Warning.)

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,520
(Gao Han is about to disappear.)

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,080
(Gao Han, wake up.)

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,960
(Gao Han.)

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,960
(How come I'm not gone?)

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,160
(Is there a glitch in the game?)

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,560
Thank goodness.

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,720
I managed to save you.

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
You're awake.

22
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,720
It hurts.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,120
I am

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,800
a wounded patient now, you know.

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,080
So you can feel pain, huh?

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,680
I thought you weren't afraid of death.

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,000
No matter what happens,

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,120
I'm a detective.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,380
Detectives are indifferent
to life and death,

30
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,350
so of course I'm not afraid.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,600
But I'm scared.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,360
Do not

33
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,680
do this ever again.

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,640
By the way,

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
we're still here,

36
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,120
which means

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,960
Zhang Zhiran isn't the murderer.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,520
Then why did he

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
plead guilty?

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,320
The good die young,

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,480
but pricks live forever.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,320
I knew you'd be fine.

43
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,960
(Holding onto him won't charge me up.)

44
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,200
Not again.

45
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,580
Gao Han, what's wrong with you?

46
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,880
What are you hiding from me?

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
Come on, tell me.

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,680
(The case isn't over yet,)

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,440
(but my time is running out.)

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,080
By the way,

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,760
here are some butterfly crackers

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
for you two.

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,320
Butterfly crackers.

54
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
Mung bean cake.

55
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,840
Orange red cake.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
They're all my favorites.

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,160
Gao Han, when you're better,

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,680
I'll take you to Yulan Restaurant.

59
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,080
The chef who makes butterfly crackers

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
is having a break

61
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,320
for a month.

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,320
Then I'll go next month.

63
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,600
In any case,
I'll definitely get to eat them,

64
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,240
right?

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,040
Gao Han.

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,160
You're not here

67
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,960
just to see how I'm doing, are you?

68
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,400
I just got back from the police station.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,130
The case involving my father

70
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,000
has been closed,

71
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,960
but I still have my doubts.

72
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,640
I suspect

73
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,000
Wang Ming.

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,160
I'm suspicious

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,040
of another person.

76
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,060
(Keep quiet. Noise is prohibited.)

77
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,120
Let's split up from here.

78
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,720
You go

79
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,880
look into what I just said.

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,720
Remember,

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,800
be careful.

82
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,520
I'll have my aide go with her.

83
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,160
You should rest up.

84
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,630
You discharged yourself
from the hospital.

85
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
Why not let Marshal go instead?

86
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,800
Don't worry. I'm fine.

87
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,800
Let's go.

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,540
(Keep quiet. Noise is prohibited.)

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,880
Are you okay?

90
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,360
Or should I go instead?

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm fine. The case is more important.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,960
You said you suspect Wang Ming.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,080
Is it because of Feng Qianhong?

94
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,640
That's right.

95
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,280
Feng Qianhong is listed

96
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,140
as the buyer on the deed
to Zhang Zhiran's shop.

97
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,320
Deed changes must be registered
at the police station.

98
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,520
In other words,

99
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,160
Wang Ming knew about their relationship

100
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,880
from the beginning,

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,880
but he never mentioned a word

102
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,000
to us about it.

103
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,360
Wang Ming is the only person left now

104
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,960
who is safe and linked

105
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,640
to the blood jade treasure case.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,720
That's right.

107
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,840
It seems

108
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,200
we need to ask Wang Ming in person.

109
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,220
(Rongcheng Police Station)

110
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,440
You've just recovered.

111
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
It's a miracle

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,640
that you can walk now.

113
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,920
You really need to rest well.

114
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,320
I don't have much time left.

115
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
Please don't let Nan Yu

116
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,780
know about my health condition.

117
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,640
Okay. Let's go.

118
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,120
Calm down, Chief Wang.

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,120
You see, my little business

120
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,520
can't afford such delay,

121
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,160
right?

122
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
Why is Hatoyama here?

123
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,080
What are they arguing about?

124
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,680
- Let's see what's going on.
- Chief Wang.

125
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,800
It's only fair to repay debts.

126
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
You have the blood jade treasure,

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
so you shouldn't be

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
owing me this little money, right?

129
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,160
If you need money, I don't have any,

130
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,480
but I

131
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,000
have a bullet ready for you.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
You have a share

133
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,200
in the blood jade treasure.

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
Just go to Marshal Jiang

135
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,840
and get your share from him.

136
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,690
That should settle it.

137
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,680
Hatoyama.

138
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Do you think I have no idea

139
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,000
what you are up to?

140
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,720
You just want to know

141
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,150
where the blood jade treasure is, right?

142
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
Well, so do I.

143
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,760
Marshal, you're here.

144
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,120
What an honor for you

145
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,840
to grace us with your presence.

146
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,600
Marshal.

147
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,160
Don't tell me you've found out

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
who killed the Grand Marshal.

149
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,990
So you're really aware of the affair
between Zhang Zhiran and Feng Qianhong.

150
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,920
I've checked the deed
to the tailor shop.

151
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,800
I thought this adulterous couple

152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,680
would kill the Grand Marshal and flee

153
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,840
with the blood jade.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,700
I checked their bodies
when they were brought

155
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,640
to the police station,

156
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,580
but neither of them
had the blood jade on them.

157
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,160
Jiang Junsheng.

158
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,120
Do you have the blood jade?

159
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
Take it out.

160
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,400
The blood jade is with me.

161
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:15,990
Take him away.

162
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,640
Yes, Marshal.

163
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:17,960
Move.

164
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,120
Another ruined

165
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,520
thanks to the blood jade, huh?

166
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:27,960
No.

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
He's ruined by his own greed.

168
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,760
Marshal, thank you
for saving me this time.

169
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,440
We also have to thank you

170
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,240
for putting us in danger, Mr. Hatoyama.

171
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,440
It was an accident.

172
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,280
Mr. Hatoyama.

173
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,480
No more accidents next time.

174
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Good luck won't always be on your side.

175
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,400
Okay.

176
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,080
Come on.

177
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,800
You're here.

178
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,880
Everyone.

179
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
This is my foster daughter,

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Miss Gu Mengqiu,

181
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,160
the top singer in Rongcheng.

182
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,080
Here.

183
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,640
Say hello to our guests for me.

184
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,120
Here's to everyone.

185
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,200
Cheers to a great time.

186
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,000
Come on.

187
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,680
Cheers.

188
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Let's drink.

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,120
Bottoms up.

190
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,720
