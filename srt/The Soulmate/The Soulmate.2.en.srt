=Episode 2=

3
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,920
Just where is it?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,960
Lady Yu and Jiang Junsheng,

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,390
taken during mid-autumn.

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,640
May their love be as full as the moon.

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,960
Could it be that my character
has a one-sided crush again

8
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,880
and will die for a man?

9
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,070
Why has the game's art style

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,070
changed as well?

11
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,840
Miss.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,430
Chief Wang is here to see you.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,310
Alright.

14
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,400
Miss Yu.

15
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,000
Chief Wang, please sit.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,640
Do you feel better now, Miss Yu?

17
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,870
Much better.

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,350
Chief Wang.

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,560
If you're here for the autopsy report,

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,150
you might need to wait a while longer.

21
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,680
There's no need to rush with the report.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
Once I have everything sorted out,

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,200
you and the Marshal

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,070
just need to sign.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,920
Although,

26
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,710
I have some doubts

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,840
about the Grand Marshal's body.

28
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,070
Miss Yu.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,840
Can I ask you

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,310
to check it out again?

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,430
I'll go with you.

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,640
The Marshal won't be going.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,120
My health

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,870
might not allow that.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Why don't you ask someone else?

36
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,760
Okay.

37
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,190
Please remember

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,150
to collect the autopsy report tomorrow.

39
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,030
Xue, see our guest out.

40
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,630
This way, Chief Wang.

41
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,520
What's going on?

42
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,680
This storyline

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,840
is just weird.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,560
There are no quest hints either.

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,220
(Rongcheng Police Station)

46
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,400
Marshal.

47
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,150
Miss Yu.

48
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,000
Please check

49
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,960
the autopsy report.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,080
If there are no issues,

51
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,120
you can sign it now.

52
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,240
Oh, right.

53
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,030
Can I have another look

54
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,030
of my father's corpse?

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,470
The stab wound on the corpse

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
was quite horrifying.

57
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,960
It has been sewn up.

58
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,960
It would be quite hard

59
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,280
if you want to look at him.

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,080
Forget it.

61
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,000
(Horrifying stab wound on the corpse?)

62
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,680
(I remember the stab wound
was fine yesterday.)

63
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,750
(I feel like they're keeping secrets.)

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,430
(I have to stay away from them.)

65
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,520
Wait, Miss Yu.

66
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,710
(Why is he following me?)

67
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
(I must have lost him.)

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,800
(A suicide and a murder?)

69
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,800
(This world is too dangerous.)

70
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,360
(I must find a way out soon.)

71
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,080
(That hurts.)

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
(What kind of stupid story is this?)

73
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,390
(Why is there an assassin?)

74
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,830
(Game, where are you?)

75
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,240
(Game!)

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,480
(Where is this?)

77
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,830
(This update made the game unrecognizable.)

78
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,950
(He's so handsome.)

79
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
(I didn't think)

80
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,160
(I would be starred in the scene
of a prince welcoming his princess)

81
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,990
(even though
I'm forever the supporting actress.)

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,260
You were the one
who examined the corpse.

83
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,000
That's me.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
I'm also the game system.

85
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,160
(Flowers from the game?)

86
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,390
If you really want to live,
you'll obey me.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,160
Are you really the game?

88
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,720
This game

89
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
has a few bugs.

90
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,160
Thus, I need you to give me permission

91
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,360
to correct them.

92
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,360
If you have no objections,

93
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,430
please sign now.

94
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,390
Okay.

95
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,480
All done.

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
I finally have it.

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,510
Have what?

98
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,600
I'll be honest.

99
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,600
Just like you,

100
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,800
I don't belong in this game.

101
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,510
You're just luckier compared to me.

102
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,750
You have Lady Yu, a shell

103
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,750
to load your data into.

104
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,160
That also means
I didn't have a body to load into.

105
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,270
That's why

106
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,870
my data

107
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,160
was nearly deleted like temporary cache.

108
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,360
Thankfully, I got this

109
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,070
in the end.

110
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,070
What?

111
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,750
Why hasn't it stopped?

112
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,830
Didn't you sign?

113
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,720
I did.

114
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
Look at what I signed.

115
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,560
You signed

116
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,310
Southern Snowy Dream?

117
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,310
Signing with my real name

118
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,480
without reading anything?

119
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,630
Do you think I'm a fool?

120
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,310
Ma'am.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Please.

122
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,240
Stop that.

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,680
Please have mercy

124
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,950
and let me in.

125
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,430
Otherwise,

126
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,430
we'll both be dead.

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
How am I dragged into this?

128
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay.

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,920
I'm not the game.

130
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,190
I am Gao Han,

131
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,240
a top-tier, truth-seeking detective NPC.

132
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,390
Do you think I'd believe you?

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,190
That's up to you.

134
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,510
Anyway, after all this time,

135
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,800
you must have surely noticed

136
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,510
that this

137
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,600
is not Cupid's Guide.

138
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,830
From the results of that day's autopsy,

139
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,430
the Grand Marshal died

140
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
at the same time

141
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,870
as when we arrived.

142
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,510
Finding the real culprit

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,190
might be the key to our return.

144
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,000
That's why if you want to leave,

145
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,950
you have to obey me.

146
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,600
Why should I obey you?

147
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,000
Have you forgotten?

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,520
Someone outside is trying to kill you.

149
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,270
Stop hesitating.

150
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,660
Those people are catching up to you.

151
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,800
Okay, fine.

152
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,160
Consider me unlucky.

153
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,680
You have five minutes.

154
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,480
Five minutes.

155
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,930
It's enough to deal with those pests.

156
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,270
(The killer seems to know
we would be walking through here.)

157
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,510
Coroner Yu.

158
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,310
I heard sounds
of a fight coming from here.

159
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
You were mistaken.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,390
How did you get this wound?

161
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,870
Are you pretending to self-harm again?

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
(Just as we were attacked, he appears.)

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,360
What a coincidence.

164
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,360
Men and women cannot touch.

165
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,390
Please stay away from me.

166
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,270
Don't touch me.

167
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,240
You're hurt.

168
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,660
I'll take you to the hospital.

169
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,390
It's fine.

170
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,910
I can clean and dress it at home.

171
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Oh, yes. Marshal Jiang.

172
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,200
Did you find me

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,550
because you heard sounds

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,600
of fighting?

175
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,270
What do you mean?

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,910
I thought

177
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,480
you knew the future

178
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,960
and knew I would be attacked.

179
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,590
(The Marshal
is the Grand Marshal's foster son.)

180
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,480
(He's key to further investigations.)

181
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,120
Miss.

182
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,790
Xue.

183
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,840
Say, does the Marshal

184
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,720
have any other woman

185
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,840
he likes?

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,030
Everyone in Rongcheng

187
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
knows of your love for him.

188
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,150
Even with all the courage in the world,

189
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,720
I will never dare desire the Marshal.

190
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,840
Why are you panicking?
I wasn't talking about you.

191
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,910
I just wanted to ask

192
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,550
if there are any women the Marshal

193
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,790
is usually close to.

194
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,200
The Marshal

195
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
never cares for women.

196
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,080
He has a heart of stone.

197
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,270
Putting aside the fact

198
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,000
that he is unmoved by your love,

199
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,150
a few days ago,

200
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,440
he actually said he wanted

201
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,630
to annul the engagement.

202
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,200
Due to his cold attitude,

203
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,030
you have a very poor appetite

204
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,870
and need medicine to help you sleep.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
Still, two days ago,

206
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,360
the Marshal suddenly sent you some wine.

207
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
You were so happy

208
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,080
that you downed it in one night.

209
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,270
When we checked on you in the morning,

210
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,120
you were unconscious

211
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,510
with the wine and medicine beside you.

212
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,150
(Could it be)

213
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,150
(that Lady Yu took her own life)

214
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,670
(because of the annulment?)

215
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,910
That's not right.

216
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,200
There's still a lot
of the medicine and wine left.

217
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,840
She shouldn't have passed out from this.
