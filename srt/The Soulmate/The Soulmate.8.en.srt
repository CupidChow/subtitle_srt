=The Soulmate=

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,440
Miss Yu.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,390
Have you

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,230
almost lost your life twice?

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,800
Yes.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,480
Once with poisoned wine.

8
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,280
And once in the alleyway ambush.

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,600
Do you want to know

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,640
who did these

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,600
and why?

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,520
Today,

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
I'll tell you right before everyone.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,920
Miss Yu.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,960
I did

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
both of those things.

17
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,840
And the reason

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,430
was because of him.

19
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,200
You must be curious

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,710
why I treat you like this.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I'll tell you the truth, Miss Yu.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,230
Before you arrived,

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,310
Junsheng and I had a good relationship.

25
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,070
He promised me

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,000
that if we worked together
to kill the Grand Marshal,

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,640
he would take me away.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,400
But then,

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,070
you had to be

30
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,480
around him every day,

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,230
making me jealous and annoyed.

32
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:39,840
Guards.

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Take this mad woman away.

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,680
What now?

35
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,840
Getting anxious?

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,510
You want to attack me

37
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,200
for your master?

38
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,990
You accused me
of planning a crime with you.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,070
What evidence do you have?

40
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,480
No one touches me.

41
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,850
She's going to poison herself.

42
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,150
Mad woman.

43
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,840
Do you think

44
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,080
I only have one poison?

45
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,560
And you want the blood jade?

46
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,120
Let me tell you.

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,750
The blood jade curse is real.

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,750
Everyone will die.

49
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,280
No one can escape.

50
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,150
Jun, quickly.

51
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,360
Send her to the hospital.

52
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,630
Blood jade curse?

53
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,520
The blood jade curse...

54
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,870
The blood jade curse is real.

55
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,000
It's all nonsense.

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,280
There's no such curse.

57
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,630
Governor Cao.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
The blood jade treasure
is very dangerous.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,840
Do you still want it?

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,310
It's human nature to seek wealth.

61
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,870
I kill in war.

62
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,400
My hands are covered in blood.

63
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,630
Only ghosts fear me.

64
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,150
I fear nothing.

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Marshal.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,910
She has vomited the poison.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,490
And they've taken her to the hospital.

68
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,000
This is a private matter
of the Grand Marshal's residence.

69
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,240
The police station

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,910
will not intervene.

71
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,360
The police must intervene.

72
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,190
Third Lady's life is still in danger now.

73
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,190
If she dies today,

74
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,520
it'll be a murder case.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,360
Please thoroughly investigate
the Grand Marshal's residence.

76
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,710
To avoid suspicion,

77
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,560
I'll stay elsewhere temporarily.

78
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,590
Marshal.

79
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,280
If you leave, who will take over all the things
at the Grand Marshal's residence?

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,630
If you don't mind,

81
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,310
I can.

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,680
I promise

83
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,240
not to move a single thing here,
not even a blade of grass.

84
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,450
I'll fulfill my duties faithfully.

85
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,270
As long as I'm here,
the residence will be safe.

86
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Why...

87
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,560
Go.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
Have someone bring the keys

89
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,750
and give them to Governor Cao.

90
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,560
Understood.

91
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,430
I'll go with you.

92
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,920
Marshal.

93
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,630
I'm worried about Ms. Hong.

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,270
I'll go to the hospital
and check on her.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
Sorry for today's trouble, Miss Yu.

96
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,720
I'll come and apologize
in person another day.

97
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
Better not.

98
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,390
Your family and I
don't seem to get along well.

99
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,160
Every time I come, there's trouble.

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,630
It's better if I don't visit.

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,720
What happened today

102
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,120
has left me confused.

103
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,270
Could it be that my guess was right?

104
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,120
My guess was right.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,750
Didn't you see
the Marshal's gaze at her?

106
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,830
Do they

107
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,560
look like

108
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,800
they used to be in love?

109
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,950
And you claimed to be

110
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,870
an expert

111
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,000
in love.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,070
It's quite normal.

113
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,870
Men become cold when they stop loving.

114
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,750
Look at him.

115
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,190
He wanted to kill Lady Yu.

116
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,750
Your theory

117
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,870
is quite rich indeed.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,470
But the person
who killed the Grand Marshal

119
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,720
certainly wasn't Third Lady.

120
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,500
Otherwise, the case would
have been solved by now.

121
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,350
The game would be over.

122
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,590
We should have gone back long ago.

123
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,120
Following your logic,

124
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,920
Jiang Junsheng isn't
the murderer either.

125
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,120
Otherwise, we could have gone back
after catching him.

126
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,000
Also,

127
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,360
what exactly is

128
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
the blood jade curse?

129
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,720
It's too terrifying.

130
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,310
They keep mentioning blood jade,

131
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,190
indicating a connection between blood jade
and the Grand Marshal's death.

132
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,560
We must find out

133
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,190
the details of this blood jade.

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,830
You don't look

135
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,070
too good.

136
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,630
You shouldn't have gone out today.

137
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,070
You should have rested well instead.

138
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,870
I do need to rest.

139
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,430
But,

140
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,040
my dear junior,

141
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,360
do you want to take care

142
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,950
of this dashing and handsome

143
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,870
good senior of yours?

144
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,560
You seem

145
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,560
quite healthy to me.

146
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,000
Miss, we've got a problem.

147
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,950
Looks like I'll have to trouble you
for a while, Miss Yu.

148
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,390
The "elsewhere" you mentioned is here?

149
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,070
Marshal.

150
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,310
You're not welcome here.

151
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,920
Whether I stay or leave
is Miss Yu's decision.

152
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,430
Gao Han.

153
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,510
Escort the guest.

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,600
Okay.

155
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,560
I brought a special gift

156
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,510
for you, Miss Yu.

157
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,390
Marshal.

158
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
What...

159
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,390
He's the one who drugged the wine.

160
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,750
One of them served poisoned wine.

161
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,480
The other encouraged you to drink it.

162
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
What's going on?

163
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,310
Feng Qianhong wasn't sure

164
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,630
if you'd drink the poisoned wine,

165
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:18,870
so she needed some assistance.

166
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,830
Third Lady bribed you, right?

167
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,480
Miss.

168
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,920
Please spare us.

169
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,310
Third Lady told me

170
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,630
that the wine was all laxatives.

171
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,560
Huang and I really didn't know
there was poison in the wine.

172
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,510
Please spare us.

173
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,600
You don't need to beg her.

174
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,430
She always hits and scolds you.

175
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,800
There's no way she'll let us off.

176
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,780
It's precisely because you usually
seek death and court danger

177
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,710
that we had the chance
to turn fiction into reality.

178
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,950
You brought this upon yourself.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,950
Who can you blame?

180
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,390
Stop the nonsense.

181
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,070
The fact remains.

182
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
If you still don't believe it,

183
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,720
you can search

184
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,560
the maid's room.

185
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,830
You should find

186
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,430
evidence of Third Lady bribing her.

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,040
Is that really the case?

188
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,270
I won't pursue it further.

189
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,120
Let them go.

190
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,360
Indulging in evil
only leads to endless trouble.

191
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,360
Xue, go.

192
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,240
Thank you, Miss.

193
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,160
Are you done now?

194
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,630
Marshal, are you leaving on your own,

195
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,510
or shall I escort you out?

196
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,360
Wait a moment.

197
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,480
I have one more gift

198
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
to give to Miss Yu.

199
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,320
Take a look inside.

200
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,940
Property deed?

201
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,080
(Property Deed)
Property deed?

202
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,580
(Jiang Junsheng)

203
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,790
Why is your name on it?

204
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,910
This is one of the dowries
prepared by your father.

205
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,360
I didn't want it at the time,

206
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,960
but I've changed my mind now.

207
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Is that so?

208
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,120
Nobody told me about this.

209
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,840
To be precise,

210
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,480
the true owner of this property

211
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,440
is me.

212
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Marshal.

213
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,440
I know you're quite generous.

214
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Can you offer us this house

215
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,750
for two days?

216
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,790
Of course.

217
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,510
But it's not for both of you.

218
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,440
Only you.

219
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,440
That won't do.

220
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,910
Wherever my senior goes, I go.

221
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,840
Wherever he goes, I go.

222
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,480
Fine.

223
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,600
Reserve the room at the end
of the second-floor corridor

224
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,440
for Mr. Gao.

225
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,600
Isn't this bullying?

226
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,910
That's a storeroom.

227
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,790
How can I live there?

228
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,390
Marshal.

229
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,120
We should be fair in our actions.

230
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,320
How about we have...

231
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,120
an arm-wrestling match?

232
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,990
Whoever wins, we'll listen to them.
How about it?

233
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,270
Sure.

234
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,360
Junior, good luck.

235
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,080
Who said I was competing with him?

236
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,790
Senior.

237
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,360
