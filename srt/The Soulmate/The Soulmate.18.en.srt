=Episode 18=

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,290
- Put the knife down.
- Stay away!

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,240
Don't hurt her.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,720
You found us here.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,840
Impressive skills you've got.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,440
Let us go.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,040
I won't harm her.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,440
Don't trust him.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,920
Stay there.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,040
You have no way out.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,160
I'm in control of my fate.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,360
You won't catch me.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,880
You're just going to jump?

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,480
What are you trying to hide?

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,240
Stay there.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,360
Speak.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,880
What do you mean?

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
All of this

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,280
was part of your plan.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,960
You and Feng Qianhong set a trap

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,520
to elope long ago.

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
Grand Marshal.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,390
You used the legend of the blood jade
to scare the Grand Marshal

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,090
into bringing a shaman home
for a ritual.

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,000
While everyone

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
was gathered in the hall

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,360
watching the shaman perform,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,790
you two teamed up
to kill the Grand Marshal.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Crazy woman!

31
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,280
How dare you try to kill me.

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,800
You crazy woman.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
Later, to shift the focus away

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,840
and to cover up the traces
at the scene,

35
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,120
you scattered white phosphorus
over the body.

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,080
You tied steel wire to the outside handrails

37
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
and connected it

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,680
to the Grand Marshal's body.

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,000
This way,

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
you could remotely

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
ignite his body with fire

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,440
and erase all traces,

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,190
thus creating the false impression
of the blood jade curse.

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,600
There's a fire!

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,000
When the Grand Marshal's body was found,

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,280
you blended in
with the crowd of onlookers

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
to create an alibi of just arriving.

48
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,840
Amidst the chaos, you fled the scene.

49
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,760
But because

50
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,640
of our deductions,

51
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,580
you could only instigate Feng Qianhong

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,880
to use her life

53
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,800
to further amplify the blood jade curse.

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,240
You found out Miss Yu had woken up
and was involved in the investigation,

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,200
so you got close to her.

56
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,120
Miss Yu.

57
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,640
You disrupted our investigation

58
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,160
with some supernatural nonsense.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
When you remembered there were traces

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,080
left on the handrails,

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,760
you sneaked back

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
to remove them.

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,240
Unexpectedly, you ran into Cao Liang,

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,720
so you killed him,

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,160
and recreated the look

66
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,520
of the blood jade curse.

67
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,680
The next day, you returned

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,200
and reported finding the body,

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
to confuse us.

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,640
Master.

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,120
After shifting our focus away,

72
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,650
you realized you made a mistake,

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,280
so you pinned all of this

74
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,680
on Gu Mengqiu.

75
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,200
Poor Feng Qianhong.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,280
She...

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,920
Shut up.

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,880
Yet you killed her.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,480
I told you not to mention Qianhong.

80
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,960
Why did you do that?

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
If all this started

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,680
because

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,640
your affair with her

84
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,440
was exposed,

85
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,280
why did you kill her still?

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,320
Mr. Gao got it right,

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,560
but not entirely.

88
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,240
I killed the Grand Marshal
not just because of Qianhong.

89
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,680
This was caused by Grand Marshal Jin.

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,640
Back then, for mining,
he illegally blew up the mountain,

91
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,390
resulting in my parents' deaths
and my sister's missing.

92
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,280
Later, I ended up in Yacheng,

93
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
where I met Qianhong.

94
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,040
She learned to sing opera,

95
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,800
and I learned tailoring.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
Our lives back then

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,560
were pretty good.

98
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,040
But I never forgot

99
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,880
about what he did.

100
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,480
I tried to get close

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,320
to the Grand Marshal

102
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,720
to avenge my parents' tragic deaths,

103
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,280
my missing sister,

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
and the innocent lives

105
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
of the villagers.

106
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,040
You can't die.

107
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,120
It's not
just the Grand Marshal who should

108
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,200
take responsibility for the tragedy.

109
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,920
You can tell the Marshal

110
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,120
what you know.

111
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,800
He's not like the Grand Marshal.

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,840
He will ensure justice for you.

113
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,080
I promise

114
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,360
to reopen the mountain explosion case

115
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,640
to ensure justice for your dead parents.

116
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,240
Will you swear?

117
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,920
I swear by the title

118
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
of the Marshal.

119
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,160
If I lie, may I not

120
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,840
die a peaceful death.

121
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,360
Good.

122
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,120
Put down the knife.

123
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
I'll come with you.

124
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,440
Mr. Gao.

125
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,680
You disrupted my plans indeed.

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,960
I did kill the Grand Marshal, Cao Liang,

127
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,280
and Feng Qianhong too.

128
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,190
Except for Qianhong's death,
I have no regrets.

129
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,400
Now I'll give her my life!

130
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
What are you trying to do?

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Gao.

132
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,200
I can't let you live.

133
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,560
Gao Han!

134
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,280
Let go.

135
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,160
No.

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,520
Let go.

137
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,320
You'll fall too.

138
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,800
I won't let go.

139
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,000
Let go.

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,080
Nan Yu!

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,800
Nan Yu.

142
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,920
Nan Yu, wake up.

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,400
Nan Yu.

144
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,560
Don't sleep.

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
Please wake up.

146
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,600
Nan Yu.

147
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,360
What are you all looking at?

148
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
Get lost!

149
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,560
Wake up.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please wake up.

151
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,640
Nan Yu.

152
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,880
Time.

153
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
Right.

154
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,760
I need to stop the time.

155
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,480
Why did the hub become like this?

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,440
Developer.

157
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,640
Developer.

158
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,040
I want

159
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,560
to rewind this game's time.

160
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,920
(Gao Han.)

161
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,800
(The game system is on the brink of collapse.)

162
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,840
(You need to leave now,)

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
(or you'll disappear)

164
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,280
(along with the game data.)

165
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,680
I need to turn back time.

166
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,800
It needs to go back.

167
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,800
(Gao Han.)

168
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,040
(Stop now.)

169
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,240
(Invading the system)

170
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,440
(and forcefully altering time)

171
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,360
(will lead to contamination and backlash.)

172
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,640
I don't care

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
about them.

174
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,360
I want to save her.

175
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
(Gao Han.)

176
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,360
(If you don't stop now,)

177
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,680
(you'll be considered as a bug,
and the system will eliminate you.)

178
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,920
(As the developer,)

179
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,560
(I command you to stop immediately.)

180
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,560
(Stop now.)

181
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
I don't care who you are.

182
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,680
I want to save her.

183
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,800
Time.

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,880
I need to stop the time.

185
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Nan Yu!

186
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,480
Let go.

187
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,360
You'll fall too.

188
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,840
I won't let go.

189
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,240
Gao Han, hang in there.

190
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,880
Gao Han.

191
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
I can't pull you if you do this.

192
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,880
Gao Han, what are you doing?
