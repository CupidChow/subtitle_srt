=Episode 10=

3
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,960
Master, let me.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,719
It's okay. We need to hurry.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,519
Let's go.

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:28,760
Master.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,679
The colors of these fabrics

8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,640
are really beautiful.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,960
People from the General's residence
will surely order a few more sets from us.

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,960
Good child.

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:47,240
Master.

12
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:48,280
Don't panic.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,119
Call the police now.

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,320
Commander, we have bad news.

15
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,890
Cao Liang was murdered
in your residence.

16
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,119
What?

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,079
Everyone, please.

18
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,920
Commander.

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,319
We've examined the body.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,239
Where we found the body

21
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,959
was just the dumping site.

22
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,439
And this place

23
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:22,760
is the actual

24
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,560
crime scene.

25
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,280
There are marks here.

26
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,200
It means

27
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,760
there was a fight here.

28
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,800
There are burn marks on the railings.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,120
It should be

30
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,479
used to cover up evidence.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,919
What do you

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,919
mean by evidence?

33
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,479
Let me look into this more.

34
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,879
Commander. May I have a moment please?

35
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,790
I have some important matters
to discuss with you.

36
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,319
Commander.

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,000
What're your thoughts

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,080
on Cao Liang's sudden death?

39
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,840
Is the blood jade curse

40
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,919
truly something that exists?

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,280
What do you think, Chief Wang?

42
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,000
How would I know?

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,319
Cao Liang had ulterior motives

44
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,280
when he volunteered to guard

45
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,039
the General's residence.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
His goal was

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,879
to find the blood jade.

48
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,560
Perhaps he met his karma.

49
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,560
If the blood jade curse is real,

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,080
with my father and Mr. Cao killed

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,879
while Third Lady still

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,599
hasn't woken up yet,

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,159
I wonder who will be

54
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:09,360
the fourth victim?

55
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,240
Oh, Commander.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,120
You must help me with this.

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
Think about it.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,080
By helping me

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,759
you're actually helping yourself too.

60
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:19,479
Isn't that right?

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,560
Chief Wang.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,319
I really want to help you..

63
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,439
I've only heard

64
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,870
about Father obtaining a blood jade.

65
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,319
Why don't you

66
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,439
tell me more

67
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,560
about this treasure?

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,719
Alright.

69
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,639
I'll tell you.

70
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,080
On that day, Commander Yan, Governor Cao,

71
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,319
and I

72
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,479
formed an alliance with your father

73
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,840
to dig up this treasure.

74
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,120
Can such a small thing

75
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,599
really make us all rich?

76
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,520
Liang.

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,479
The pattern on this blood jade

78
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
is the route to the treasure.

79
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,240
Inside,

80
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,159
there are priceless treasures

81
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,840
from the former dynasty.

82
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Once we open that underground palace,

83
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,199
all those treasures

84
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
will be ours to have.

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,519
All of it.

86
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,519
But

87
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,480
to open it,

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,160
we need men and explosives.

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,600
It all costs money.

90
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,199
Once you find the treasure,

91
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,600
we still need money

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,240
to dig it up.

93
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,519
General.

94
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,040
I have

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,560
the money.

96
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,480
But how can we be sure

97
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,079
that blowing up

98
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,199
this underground palace

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,790
will definitely yield treasure
just based solely on your words?

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,879
Cao is right.

101
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,360
But didn't you all

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,079
obtain the money

103
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,519
I promised you previously?

104
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,639
To make money,

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,879
you have to take risks,

106
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:04,800
right?

107
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,800
Yes.

108
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,519
If the General didn't share

109
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,920
this money-making opportunity

110
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,680
with us,

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,439
I wouldn't have made my first fortune

112
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,439
too.

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,279
I'm in.

114
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,480
The General has always

115
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,959
stood by his words.

116
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,399
I'm in too.

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,600
Good.

118
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,480
Brothers.

119
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,959
Only we

120
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,759
know about this.

121
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,720
I didn't even tell Hatoyama.

122
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,639
This belongs to our ancestors.

123
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,380
What does it have to do
with that Japanese man?

124
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,480
Exactly.

125
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,360
Let's enjoy the good life

126
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,720
under the General's lead.

127
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,399
This matter is highly confidential.

128
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,040
I don't know what happened.

129
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,959
But Hatoyama got wind of it

130
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,360
and asked me several times about it.

131
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,279
He also asked your father.

132
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,439
But it seemed

133
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,360
that your father refused him.

134
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,160
Is a treasure

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,800
really hidden in the blood jade?

136
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,120
How did you all believe it so easily?

137
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,319
Well,

138
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,560
they gave

139
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,680
the first payment

140
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
to us on time.

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,399
I got carried away

142
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,480
and pumped in more money.

143
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,519
I even mortgaged

144
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,920
my ancestral home.

145
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,160
So you all

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,399
really got the first payment?

147
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,399
Did they really

148
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,959
unearth the treasure?

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,120
Something is fishy.

150
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,040
Cao Liang and Father's death

151
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,160
are so similar.

152
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,160
I'm back now.

153
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
I will investigate thoroughly

154
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
whether it's something supernatural

155
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,800
or someone playing tricks.

156
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,279
Thank you, Commander.

157
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,560
With your words, I feel relieved.

158
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,120
Why is he gone for so long?

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,260
Isn't he finished with the chat?

160
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,399
And there's not a sound at all.

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
Could something have happened?

162
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,240
Let's check on him.

163
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,120
Let's go.

164
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
What have you found?

165
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,770
Why have you been watching him
so closely lately?

166
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,759
It's complicated.

167
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,240
I don't care. Explain.

168
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,519
That's not important now.

169
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
Let's hear what he has to say first.
I'm not a police dog.

170
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,790
Why should I listen for you?

171
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,879
Police dog?

172
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,079
Are you alright?

173
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm fine.

174
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,480
What were you talking
to Chief Wang about?

175
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,879
Any new discoveries?

176
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,439
Director Wang has handed over

177
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,680
the investigation to us.

178
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,959
We can question all the relevant people
at any time.

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,079
That's great.

180
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,720
I'll go find someone to question.

181
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh right, Detective Gao.

182
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,040
The favor I asked of you last time.

183
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:21,959
Again?

184
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,680
I really can't help you.

185
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,560
Didn't we agree on it last night?

186
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
Didn't you promise me?

187
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,199
Last night...

188
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,079
I fell asleep last night

189
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,080
and forgot.

190
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,200
Gao Han.

191
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,159
I'm leaving first.

192
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,000
(Let's split up.)

193
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,840
(Nan Yu.)

194
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,950
(You'll question staff
of General's residence.)

195
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,190
(Commander and I will question the tailor,
Zhang Zhiran.)

196
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,960
(He discovered the crime scene.)

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,840
Ms. Wang.

198
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,320
Please just say what's on your mind.

199
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,399
Don't keep crying.

200
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,919
Miss Yu. I don't know.

201
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,120
What will people think of me
when they see you crying?

202
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:16,679
Miss Yu.

203
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,639
Why are you both so exhausted?

204
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,919
We went

205
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,480
to question Cao Liang's concubines

206
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,399
to confirm his interpersonal relationships.

207
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,759
That's all you did?

208
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,759
Do you know how many concubines
Governor Cao has?

209
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,919
Take a big guess.

210
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,480
I'm guessing...

211
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,399
32.

212
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,240
That many?

213
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
That's scary.

214
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,440
That is hard work.

215
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,320
Here.

216
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,279
Eat something.

217
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,159
Buns

218
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,480
and this.

219
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,200
This chicken soup is for Commander.

220
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,200
It's for me?

221
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,799
Thank you, Miss Yu.

222
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
This is yours.

223
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:07,240
Actually,

224
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,799
I don't usually drink soup.

225
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,080
Why don't you check it out first?

226
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,639
Why does this

227
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,159
smells a bit like coke?

228
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,000
Impressive, right?

229
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,759
I spent a lot of time

230
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,039
to make this.

231
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,799
Try it.

232
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,720
Why does it taste like Chinese medicine?

233
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,919
Really?

234
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,200
Which brat

235
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,399
took my bottle

236
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,639
of cough syrup?

237
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,639
Careful.

238
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:55,840
Don't cough into my bowl.

239
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,840
What's wrong with you?

240
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:04,919
Gao Han, are you alright?

241
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,519
Gao Han.

242
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,639
