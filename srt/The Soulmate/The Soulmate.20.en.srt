=The Soulmate=

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,840
I heard

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,880
Wang Ming got arrested.

5
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,160
This means

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,880
there are no leads pointing to us.

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,320
We can rest easy now.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,600
But I keep dreaming

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,360
about a little boy

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,640
holding a half-eaten stick
of candied haws.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,160
He was crying,

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,960
looking disappointed

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,680
and sad.

14
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,960
Hello?

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Bring me clothes?

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,600
It's not a good time.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,160
Just come over.

18
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,440
Someone's coming later.

19
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,440
You should leave first.

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,080
Miss Gu.

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,160
Here's what

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
my master left for you.

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,840
Take them back. I don't want them.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,280
But...

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,000
It seems like he knew
he would be in trouble.

26
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,080
So he

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
made all your clothes

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,520
for a year in advance.

29
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,360
Fine.

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,400
Leave them here.

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,780
(To Gu Mengqiu)

32
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,720
Zhang Zhiran.

33
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,000
You're spouting nonsense.

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,280
You think this letter

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,600
will keep me up at night?

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,920
I won't believe a single word of it.

37
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,140
You think you can use this trick
to get back at me?

38
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,520
Don't even think about it.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,760
(This is a custom in Rongcheng.)

40
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,440
(I present you this sachet,)

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
(wishing for you to be safe.)

42
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,880
How is this possible?

43
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,200
How could you be...

44
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,360
Show us all the transaction records
from your place

45
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,390
for the past three months.

46
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
Miss Yu.

47
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
I've found out
what you asked me to look for.

48
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,560
It changed hands a few times in between,

49
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,600
but I eventually

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,520
found the real buyer.

51
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,360
That's not bad.

52
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,580
You'll soon surpass me.

53
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,640
That's of course.

54
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm clever, you know.

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,840
But

56
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,440
why did she buy so much antique paper?

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,480
You're clever.

58
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,440
Think about it again.

59
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,820
Even if I'm gone in the future,

60
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,190
you'll be able to manage on your own.

61
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,400
Why do you talk in such a weird way?

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
I mean,

63
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,360
in the future, we'll each

64
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,520
return to our own worlds.

65
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,280
In your game world,

66
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,560
you can still

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,200
be a great detective like me.

68
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,760
Will you miss me

69
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,480
after you go back?

70
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,920
I mean,

71
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,080
will you still

72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,600
remember our time as partners

73
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,160
after you go back?

74
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,180
We'll talk about it when we get back.

75
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,120
Wang Ming has been arrested.

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,190
Those involved in the blood jade case

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,360
are either dead

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,240
or arrested.

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,600
But the two of us

80
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,080
are still here.

81
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,720
But we've checked out everyone
we needed to look into.

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
Is there anything we overlooked?

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,040
There are still two people left.

84
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Jiang Junsheng

85
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,960
and Gu Mengqiu.

86
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,960
But Mengqiu was previously

87
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,480
held hostage by Zhang Zhiran.

88
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,040
As for Jiang Junsheng,

89
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,040
I don't believe

90
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,400
he would do such things.

91
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,480
But

92
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,960
I trust your judgment.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,080
I'll go see him again.

94
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,240
I'll go with you.

95
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,240
No need.

96
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,280
I believe Jiang Junsheng

97
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,520
wouldn't hurt me.

98
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,960
You go talk to Gu Mengqiu.

99
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,880
We're partners,

100
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,640
not a burden to each other.

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,560
Trust me.

102
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,360
I'll do as you say,

103
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
partner.

104
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,000
Buns.

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,960
Freshly made buns.

106
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
One red bean bun, please.

107
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,640
Sure.

108
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,320
Two of them.

109
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,440
No problem.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,080
Watch out. They're hot.

111
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,560
Thank you.

112
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,520
Buns.

113
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,440
Be careful. It's hot.

114
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,880
Just one red bean bun
and you're this happy?

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,440
It's because I like it.

116
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Seems fine.

117
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,560
No need to follow them.

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,880
If you like it,

119
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,080
I'll buy it for you every day
from now on.

120
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
Give me one too, please.

121
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,080
Sure.

122
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,600
Here. Thank you.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,060
Is something bothering you?

124
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,320
You didn't ask me out

125
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
late at night just to have buns,
did you?

126
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
Just ask whatever you want.

127
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,560
As for me,

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,270
I'll tell you everything I know.

129
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,040
Where were you on the day

130
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,200
Grand Marshal died?

131
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,640
You're not suspecting me, are you?

132
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,550
I've been working with you two
on the case every day.

133
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,720
I wonder

134
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,880
why you and Gao Han

135
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,760
are so fixated on my father's murder case.

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,600
Well, we're detectives.

137
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
It's just natural

138
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,760
for detectives to solve cases.

139
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,350
Then what's next
after the case is solved?

140
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,080
You once said you would leave

141
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,800
with him.

142
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,240
Not anymore.

143
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,400
After we're done with the case,

144
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,680
maybe we'll never

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,600
see each other again.

146
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,440
Tastes awful.

147
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,800
What's with this red bean filling?

148
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,080
It's not sweet at all.

149
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,440
It's so bitter.

150
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,520
Wait a minute.

151
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Let me help you

152
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,280
with the bitter stuff.

153
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,960
Come on,
I'll take you to eat something sweet.

154
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,400
I don't want to eat anymore.

155
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,440
Can you take me home?

156
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,800
Can you

157
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,320
stay for me?

158
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,920
I've told you many times before.

159
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,640
The past is the past.

160
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,160
The one who always had eyes for you

161
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,920
was Lady Yu, not me.

162
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,440
But I only have eyes

163
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
for you now,

164
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,040
Nan Yu.

165
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
Jiang Junsheng.

166
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,080
Let's go.

167
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,560
Gu Mengqiu.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,800
Gu Mengqiu.

169
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,040
Gu Mengqiu.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,880
Gu Mengqiu.

171
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,280
Are you okay?

172
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,360
Gunshot.

173
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,120
Nan Yu is still there.

174
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,480
Who are you?

175
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,040
Just come at me instead.

176
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,920
Gao Han.

177
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,520
