2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:26,760
Marshal.

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,960
We've checked it out.

5
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,290
The remaining cough medicine
has poison in it too.

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,359
It wasn't me.

7
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,520
Plenty of folks know where I

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,799
keep my cough medicine.

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,290
And there are always people coming
and going through the kitchen.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,520
Ah, how the heck should

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,600
I explain this mess?

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,640
Then explain it slowly.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,119
Tell me every detail

14
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:00,119
you've heard and seen.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,880
Are you okay?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,719
I'm fine.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
The poison in this world

18
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,959
won't take me down.

19
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,959
I've been using this cough medicine
all along.

20
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:15,760
How did it suddenly become poisonous?

21
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,640
Could it be that someone noticed me

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,879
mixing drinks every day

23
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,000
and decided to poison me?

24
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:22,719
Ms. Wang owns that medicine.

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,799
So maybe someone wants her dead.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,159
I'm not in a stable condition right now,

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,560
so I may be unable
to carry on the mission for a while.

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
Someone wants Ms. Wang dead?

29
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:32,840
She's just

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,799
a regular kitchen lady.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,190
Who could she have possibly angered?

32
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,970
Are you feeling any better?

33
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,480
Junsheng.

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,599
I might

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,079
recover faster

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,719
if you could spend more time with me.

37
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:49,359
Quit joking around. Be serious.

38
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,359
What did you find out

39
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,799
from Ms. Wang?

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,400
I suspect she's

41
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,319
a key witness to Cao Liang's death.

42
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,879
So someone wants her silenced.

43
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,480
The night Cao Liang died,

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,920
Ms. Wang slipped out to gamble,

45
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,159
leaving the back door open.

46
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,480
When she came back,

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,560
she found an intruder.

48
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,840
Does she remember any important features

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,960
of that person?

50
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,039
All she said was

51
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,319
a shadow flashed by.

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,580
She was afraid of the gambling
being exposed afterward,

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,039
so she didn't tell anyone.

54
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:18,599
So, the only thing

55
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,840
we know for sure right now

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,719
is that the night Cao Liang died,

57
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,960
there was an intruder
at the Grand Marshal's residence.

58
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,319
I got it.

59
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,319
Maybe Ms. Wang

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,039
didn't recognize the person,

61
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:31,680
but the murderer recognized her,

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,879
so he wanted her dead.

63
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:35,039
Is it someone from the residence?

64
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,120
The intruder might

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,639
have been here to kill Cao Liang

66
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,159
or to erase traces

67
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,240
on the railing,

68
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,039
but Cao Liang stumbled upon him.

69
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,000
But why was Cao Liang even

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,120
in the Grand Marshal's room?

71
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,360
For the blood jade treasure.

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,759
After my father passed away,

73
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,000
I went to that room but didn't

74
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,000
find the whereabouts of the blood jade.

75
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,560
Everyone's after the blood jade.

76
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,950
What if the reason the murderer

77
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,479
sneaked into the residence and killed him

78
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,680
was to steal the blood jade

79
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,639
for himself?

80
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,039
If I were the murderer

81
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,039
and had the treasure,

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,199
my next move would be…

83
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,879
To leave Rongcheng.

84
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,719
Jun.

85
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,960
Marshal.

86
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:17,039
Immediately impose a city-wide curfew.

87
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,790
Set up road checkpoints for inspection.

88
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,800
Enforcing a curfew

89
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,680
without a reason might cause riots.

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,800
There's a reason.

91
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,240
You can say

92
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,159
the Marshal's fiancee was poisoned,

93
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,940
so he's hunting down
the culprit city-wide.

94
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,400
Me?

95
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,000
Fiancee?

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,639
Quit making things up.

97
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,680
What are you two big guys thinking?

98
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,520
I mean, let's just spread some rumors,

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,800
like me being poisoned.

100
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Meanwhile, we can just

101
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,639
lay low at the residence.

102
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,759
Let's do that then.

103
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,960
You guys rest first.

104
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,319
Let's go.

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,159
It's all my fault

106
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,199
for making that coke.

107
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,520
I don't want to cause trouble
for you guys anymore.

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
What? Do you want to end this?

109
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,719
Are you going to leave behind this mess
and run away?

110
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
Am I that kind of person?

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,680
Actually, I want

112
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
to learn a few moves from you.

113
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,800
Your martial arts are impressive.

114
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,720
Could you teach me?

115
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,720
That way,

116
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,270
I'll have some self-defense skills too.

117
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,290
It's really challenging.

118
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,290
Are you sure about this?

119
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Once I master it,

120
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,839
I'll protect you.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,410
You're really taking this seriously.

122
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,930
While mastering the basics is crucial,

123
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,199
unfortunately,

124
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,639
you missed the prime time.

125
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,879
So, let's start with an adult crash course.

126
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,879
Now,

127
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,319
throw a punch at me.

128
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,720
Really?

129
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay.

130
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,959
Did you just

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
throw a punch at my handsome face?

132
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,319
Come on.

133
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,600
That's how fights go.

134
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
My bad, Master Gao.

135
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,759
How about this?

136
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,639
Just teach me

137
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,319
one killer move.

138
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,120
Watch closely

139
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:53,879
and learn well.

140
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,000
When the enemy,

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,839
strikes at your face…

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,759
Hold on.

143
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,680
Are you really going

144
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,240
to hit my pretty face?

145
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,360
What's life like

146
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,600
in your world?

147
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,160
We solve cases every day.

148
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,639
One day, it's a locked-room murder.

149
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:22,639
The next, it's a high-rise explosion.

150
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,320
Then, a snowy mountain manor mystery.

151
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,480
Life there…

152
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,490
- is thrilling every day.
- Sounds thrilling every day.

153
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
I would love

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,439
to see what your world is like.

155
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,439
Master Gao.

156
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,279
I'll continue practicing.

157
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,120
Here.

158
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,600
That hurts.

159
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,920
Miss, there's a visitor for you.

160
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm not seeing anyone.

161
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,279
It's Miss Gu.

162
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,639
She seems worried about you.

163
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,040
(She came to see me so quickly.)

164
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,480
(Could it be that Gu Mengqiu)

165
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,639
(and Lady Yu were friends?)

166
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,120
Then let her in.

167
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:18,959
Yes, Miss.

168
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,879
Miss Yu.

169
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,240
I heard you got poisoned.

170
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,680
I was really worried about you.

171
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,199
Here, I brought some ginseng for you.

172
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,600
Take good care of yourself.

173
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,879
Thanks.

174
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,040
Look. I'm perfectly fine.

175
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,880
Don't worry about me.

176
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,040
You scared me.

177
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,079
Let's talk about what happened here

178
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,079
another time.

179
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,480
Miss, Commander Yan is also here.

180
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,720
Didn't I say

181
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,800
I didn't want to see anyone?

182
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,240
I'll only meet with Marshal Jiang

183
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,260
and Miss Gu, nobody else.

184
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,920
I'm so glad to see that you're okay now.

185
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,680
I'll come to see you
in a couple of days.

186
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,040
I'll bring you
some delicious butterfly crackers then.

187
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,800
I want the ones from Yulan Restaurant.

188
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
Alright,

189
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,240
it's a deal then.

190
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,439
Rest well.

191
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:11,120
I'll leave now.

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,759
Okay.

193
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,439
What do you mean?

194
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,240
Commander Yan.

195
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,040
Miss Yu isn't feeling well.

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Please visit next time.

197
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
Miss Gu, please come this way.

198
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,039
Commander Yan.

199
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,879
Why bother harassing a few servants?

200
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,240
If Miss Yu isn't feeling well,

201
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,720
how can she see you?

202
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,039
We only

203
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,159
exchanged a few words,

204
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,679
then Miss Yu went to rest.

205
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,440
I'll take my leave now.

206
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,320
Oh, and tell Miss Yu that I'll bring her
favorite butterfly crackers

207
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,600
in a few days.

208
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Thank you.
Please come this way, Miss Gu.

209
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,639
Didn't the doctor

210
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,720
say someone poisoned shouldn't eat?

211
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,879
What's with the butterfly crackers?

212
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,559
