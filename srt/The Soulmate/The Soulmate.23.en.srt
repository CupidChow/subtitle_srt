00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:15,160
=The Soulmate=

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,870
(Miss Gu Mengqiu,)

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,320
(I hope you're doing well.)

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,670
(When you read this letter,)

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,670
(you must have many questions.)

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,030
(But I'm afraid I won't be able to tell you
the answers in person.)

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,070
(I'm sorry.)

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,190
(I originally
wanted to watch you grow up)

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,790
(and see you grow old)

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,280
(with the man you love.)

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,880
(Unfortunately,
I can't accompany you through)

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,270
(the most important stages
of your life.)

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,640
(Perhaps everything)

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,920
(is written in the stars.)

16
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:49,670
(When we first met,)

17
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,710
(I was sure)

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,000
(you were my younger sister.)

19
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,920
This is Zhang Ziran, the tailor
from the Grand Marshal's residence.

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,030
Miss Gu.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,790
Hello.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
(It must be fate.)

23
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,280
(Fate brought us together
in a foreign land.)

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,400
(Fate has given us)

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,150
(a tacit understanding of each other.)

26
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,760
(Thank you)

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,200
(for being willing to confide)

28
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,430
(in me, a stranger.)

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,070
I knew you would like it.

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:18,760
(But)

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
(I have long known)

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,430
(that you are no longer Qiu)

33
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,790
(but Miss Gu.)

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,280
(But I am also content.)

35
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,680
(You have been my motivation)

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,840
(for many years.)

37
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,200
(For you,)

38
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,070
(I am willing to give up everything.)

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,680
We can finally leave.

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,120
I'm sorry, Qianhong!

41
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,280
Who's there?

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
(Even my life.)

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,280
I did kill the Grand Marshal, Cao Liang,

44
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,480
and Feng Qianhong too.

45
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,350
Except for Qianhong's death,
I have no regrets.

46
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,350
Now I'll give her my life!

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,480
What are you trying to do?

48
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,590
(I beg you.)

49
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,870
(Can you give up everything)

50
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,150
(and start over?)

51
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,710
(Your compassion.)

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,910
(Your resentment.)

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,840
(I also wish for you)

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,150
(to live well)

55
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,960
(to prove that my coming here)

56
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,910
(was not in vain.)

57
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,190
(Qiu.)

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,150
(Everything in the world)

59
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,190
(ends beautifully.)

60
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,310
(You will always move forward.)

61
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,840
(This is a custom in Rongcheng.)

62
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,470
(I present you this sachet,)

63
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,960
(wishing for you to be safe)

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,310
(when crossing rivers)

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,150
(and overcoming mountains,)

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,710
(until you reach the stars
in your heart.)

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,430
(Zhang Zhiran.)

68
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,240
You truly are a big brother.

69
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,910
You kept protecting me,

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,190
but I caused you
to end up like this.

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,960
No.

72
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,910
It's them.

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,840
They did this to you.

74
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,430
Zhiran.

75
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,310
I want to avenge you.

76
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,800
I didn't kill him.

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,150
It was you.

78
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,630
You killed him.

79
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,630
You guys forced him

80
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,240
to his death on the balcony!

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,030
He died because he wanted

82
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,430
to protect me.

83
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,430
So you killed the Grand Marshal.

84
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,630
He deserved to die anyway.

85
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,360
You guys drove my brother to his death.

86
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,870
So you deserve to die, too.

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,240
It looks like we fell into her trap.

88
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,070
Miss Gu.

89
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,600
You're determined to die

90
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,310
along with us,

91
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
but have you considered

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,600
that your actions

93
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
will only benefit

94
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,120
the person behind you?

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,000
My men have intercepted that batch
of authentic works

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,430
at the black market pier.

97
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,120
The destination of the smuggling ship

98
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,360
is Japan.

99
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,950
The mastermind

100
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,360
benefiting from all this

101
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,240
is Hatoyama, right?

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,310
Everyone here
is indeed a great detective.

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,560
You have it all figured out.

104
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,040
Here.

105
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,070
I propose a toast.

106
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,190
Why are you drinking that?

107
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,120
What if it's poisoned?

108
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,720
Quick, spit it out!

109
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,160
It's okay.

110
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,040
Miss Gu

111
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
knows we came prepared

112
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,430
and wouldn't poison us.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,630
Miss Gu.

114
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,920
Who else is coming?

115
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,390
I said it just now.

116
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
You deserved to die, too.

117
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,390
The person
sending you off has arrived.

118
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,920
I'm here to fulfill my promise.

119
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,720
The thing you promised me.

120
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,430
You wouldn't deceive me,

121
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,000
right?

122
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,830
We agreed on the phone

123
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,270
that after you get your revenge

124
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,000
and I safely escort you
out of Rongcheng,

125
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,800
you will give me the blood jade.

126
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,120
The terms have changed.

127
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,040
I don't want to leave Rongcheng.

128
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,270
I want you to help me

129
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,920
kill them.

130
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,830
That's not easy to do.

131
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,190
Didn't you turn several
of the Marshal's men against him

132
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,160
because you wanted to take over

133
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,920
Rongcheng?

134
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,600
It's not impossible.

135
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,830
Jun.

136
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,560
How could you?

137
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,160
The headlines for tomorrow's news
might as well be

138
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,950
Marshal Jiang caught in an affair
with his adopted sister.

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,480
Why you...

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
Caught red-handed by fiancee

141
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,720
and all three perished together.

142
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,510
You have no shame.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,560
If you break your promise,

144
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,750
tomorrow,

145
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,040
my men
will send the police and journalists

146
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,630
a document that exposes you

147
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,160
for smuggling national treasures.

148
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,430
Miss Gu.

149
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
These two must be the documents

150
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,000
(Tip-off) you had He send.

151
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,390
You formed an alliance with me,

152
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,390
but at the same time,

153
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,800
you betrayed me.

154
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,600
Is this what you Chinese

155
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,720
call "friendship above honesty"?

156
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,160
What did you do to He?

157
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,430
What do you mean, what did I do?

158
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,040
She was originally

159
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,920
the spy I planted by your side.

160
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,950
You want to kill me?

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,630
I'll destroy the blood jade.

162
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
Where's the blood jade?

163
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,390
Where's the blood jade?

164
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,310
- The blood jade...
- It's fine, Miss Gu.

165
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,870
After you're dead,

166
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,720
I can still find it on my own.

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,720
Then what are your plans

168
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,240
for me, Mr. Hatoyama?

169
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Mr. Gao.

170
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,240
I haven't figured out

171
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,920
what role you should play in this story,

172
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
but you previously

173
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,830
reminded me

174
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,600
to cherish my luck.

175
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,360
Now it seems

176
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,270
that luck has been on my side all along.

177
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,630
Then how about I

178
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,600
trade the blood jade for good luck?

179
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
Mr. Gao.

180
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,510
Don't beat around the bush.

181
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,510
Take a look.

182
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,560
Is this the blood jade you're after?

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Mr. Gao.

184
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,560
Can I exchange

185
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,950
the blood jade for my safety?

186
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,720
Of course.

187
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,720
You jerk!

188
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,440
Hatoyama.

189
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,840
I have news for you.

190
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
A good one

191
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,550
and a bad one.

192
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,630
The good news

193
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,870
is that the one I dropped

194
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,080
is not the real jade.

195
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,790
The bad news

196
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,030
is that the so-called blood jade treasure

197
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,360
does not exist.

198
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,000
What he said is true.

199
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,150
The blood jade

200
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,600
is a fake jade
that the Grand Marshal had me dye.

201
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,720
If you want one,

202
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,960
I can make plenty for you.

203
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,440
Mr. Hatoyama, you've given my father

204
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,630
many forgeries,

205
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,750
and we're only reciprocating.

206
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,120
Shut up!

207
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,190
Do you think only you know how to clap?

208
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,030
What have you prepared?

209
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,840
Nothing.

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,480
But we can't lose momentum.

211
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Miss Yu.

212
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,270
Now is not the time

213
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,030
to show off your wit.

214
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,080
Hatoyama.

215
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Put the gun down.

216
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,080
Marshal Jiang.

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,630
You can barely take care of yourself.

218
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,600
Stop trying to be the hero.

219
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:48,870
Jun.

220
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,720
Didn't you hear?

221
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
The Marshal said to put your gun down.

222
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,750
Do you think money

223
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,200
can get you everything?

224
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,390
You've underestimated human nature.

225
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,910
Before he surrendered to me,

226
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,630
I found him beaten half to death.

227
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,840
Was that also a part

228
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,750
of your plan?

229
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,790
If I weren't harsh on myself,

230
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,390
how would you believe

231
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,480
that I betrayed Sheng?

232
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,320
Impossible.

233
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,550
This can't be.

234
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,200
You couldn't have prepared in advance.

235
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,440
I hid so well.

236
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,320
You couldn't have found out in advance.

237
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,120
Your plan is indeed meticulous,

238
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,910
but the human heart

239
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,320
can see through all meticulous plans.

240
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,960
Miss Gu.

241
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,790
It's all thanks to your brother,

242
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
