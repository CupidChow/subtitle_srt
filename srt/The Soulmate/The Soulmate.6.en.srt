00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,190
=The Soulmate=

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,199
Are you alright?

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,519
Someone was in trouble,
so I had to do something.

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,960
Luckily, my willpower was strong enough

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,839
to breach the barrier

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,000
and show up briefly.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,920
But it did

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,799
drain a bit too much

10
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,880
of my code energy.

11
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,079
Sorry, it's all my fault.

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,359
At least you know now.

13
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,880
So, have you

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,600
found a way to roam freely

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,450
without depending
on this world's vessel yet?

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,560
Not really.

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,759
I'm more like an energy entity now
that can only briefly manifest.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,960
But the upside is

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,840
that I'm immune

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,039
to fatal harm here

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,280
as long as I recharge my energy.

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,920
This cheongsam
belongs to the Third Lady,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,630
and the handkerchief
is Jiang Junsheng's.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,950
Do you have any thoughts on that?

25
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,120
Not really.

26
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,760
A glamorous concubine

27
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,920
and a young marshal.

28
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,000
Why not put your thinking cap on and see

29
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,799
if there's any connection there?

30
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,879
I'm just a Cupid NPC,

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,359
not a detective.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,879
I'm only good at gossiping

33
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,519
and stirring up trouble.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,100
I can start problems, one after another.

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
That's when you came to my rescue,

36
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,920
not just once but twice.

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,359
So?

38
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,719
So, I really can't help with the investigation.

39
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:53,280
That's the most spot-on guess
you've ever made.

40
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,359
Solving cases is

41
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,519
indeed a hassle.

42
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,200
Leave it to me.

43
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,439
You don't have to worry.

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,280
I'll handle it.

45
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,159
Just trust me with your body.

46
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm not that useless.

47
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,000
While detective work
might not be my forte,

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,519
gossiping is my specialty.

49
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,120
Given that a foster son

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
and a young concubine

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,439
are spending every day together,

52
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,960
how could there not be some feelings?

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,759
Maybe they're in love.

54
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,039
That's why Jiang Junsheng

55
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,599
wanted to split with Lady Yu

56
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,280
and elope with the Third Lady.

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,199
But then the Grand Marshal
caught wind of it,

58
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
so the Marshal had

59
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,880
to get rid of the Grand Marshal.

60
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,039
That is

61
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,879
the Nan Yu, I know.

62
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,680
How is my reasoning?

63
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,560
It's solid, even I'm convinced.

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,280
But to solve a case, we need evidence,

65
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,520
which we're lacking right now.

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,840
Hey, recharge yourself.

67
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,039
Hurry up.

68
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:04,439
Once you're feeling better,

69
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,159
we'll gather the evidence together.

70
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,680
Jiang Junsheng and Third Lady…

71
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:28,879
Marshal, no.

72
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,719
We can't do this.

73
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,599
No, don't.

74
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,360
We can't.

75
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,039
If my father can,

76
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,080
so can I.

77
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,360
No, you can't.

78
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,000
No, that's enough.

79
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,270
Terrifying thoughts are creeping back
into my head again.

80
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,719
Just go away.

81
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:56,919
Why is there

82
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,879
a loose thread?

83
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:02,039
This is my most important garment.

84
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,159
Why am I so useless?

85
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,570
I can't even keep a garment intact.

86
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,639
Who's there?

87
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,560
It's me.

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,399
Anything you need? It is late.

89
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,519
Third Lady, are you feeling better?

90
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,839
Thanks for asking, Marshal.

91
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,759
I'm much better now.

92
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,120
How about Miss Yu?

93
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,920
How's she doing?

94
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,240
She's fine.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,399
I'm just wondering,

96
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,639
who in this household would

97
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,160
dare to drug you and Miss Yu?

98
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,199
They clearly don't fear

99
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,160
me tracking them down

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,399
and putting a bullet

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160
in their head.

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,000
Marshal, have some tea.

103
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,639
Third Lady.

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,040
Have you thought of anyone suspicious?

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Who could I suspect?

106
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,240
My head's

107
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,279
still foggy from being drugged

108
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,040
a couple of days ago.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,759
Marshal, have some tea.

110
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,519
This is your favorite green tea.

111
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Third Lady.

112
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,680
I think you're mistaken.

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,800
I don't drink this tea.

114
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,560
I understand

115
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,000
life was tough back when you

116
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,920
were with my foster father.

117
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,800
But if I find out you've

118
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,439
been sheltering the culprit

119
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
or hiding the drugs yourself,

120
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,839
you know there will be consequences.

121
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,639
As I was about to leave,

122
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,480
I decided to check out the kitchen,

123
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,319
and I stumbled

124
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,680
upon something interesting.

125
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:56,839
Third Lady.

126
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,439
I can't believe you
actually drugged yourself.

127
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,120
Me?

128
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,240
Marshal.

129
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,959
I'm completely lost now.

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
Why on earth

131
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,120
would I

132
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,240
drug myself out of the blue?

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,879
That's exactly what I want to know too.

134
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
Where did the drug come from?

135
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,399
Who was it intended for?

136
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,040
Miss Yu.

137
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,959
Yourself

138
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,759
or me, who's also in this residence?

139
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,480
Marshal, I swear.

140
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,680
Ever since I married Grand Marshal
at 16 years old,

141
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,040
every item I possess

142
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,199
and every meal I consume

143
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,950
has been provided by purchases made
through the Grand Marshal's residence.

144
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,079
How could I possess drugs?

145
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,480
If you're not convinced,

146
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,920
feel free to search the house.

147
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,279
I'll investigate

148
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,199
thoroughly.

149
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,240
No matter if it's internal conspiracy,

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,279
external collusion,

151
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,879
or smuggling into the residence,

152
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:54,360
I'll get to the bottom of it.

153
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,240
Until I've cleared this up,

154
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,839
I want you to stay put

155
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,959
in the residence

156
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,879
and don't take a step out.

157
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:15,759
Got it.

158
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,050
Starting tomorrow,
we won't let Third Lady leave the mansion.

159
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,920
I need you to find out who she's

160
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,879
been in contact with before.

161
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:23,560
Yes, sir.

162
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,560
Oh, by the way,

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,360
can you check again
the garlic purchases made

164
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,390
at the Grand Marshal's residence
in the last three months?

165
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,240
Garlic?

166
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:32,240
Yes, sir.

167
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,240
Have you had your fill?

168
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,370
Let's go and find the clues.

169
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,319
Let's go.

170
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,160
You vixen.

171
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,560
How dare you seduce my husband?

172
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,319
(Why do I always end up
getting splashed with water?)

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,199
Sorry, wrong person.

174
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,160
Are you okay?

175
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,839
I'm fine.

176
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,720
How could you mix someone up like that?

177
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
Sorry, my bad.

178
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,120
(No. 1 Cupid)
(Hey there, system administrators.)

179
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,240
(Livestream room)
(I'm Nan Yu,)

180
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,050
(and I'm ready to assist you
however I can.)

181
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,190
(This NPC)

182
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,070
(is so well-designed.)

183
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
(She's gorgeous,)

184
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,870
(like a classic
female supporting character.)

185
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,270
(She's not only pretty)

186
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,840
(but incredibly resilient too.)

187
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,720
(It doesn't faze her at all
to get splashed repeatedly.)

188
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,850
(ColaCat: She always gets splashed)

189
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,950
(StarSaver just followed the host)

190
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,050
(Welcome Storm to the live stream)

191
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,120
(Noble: She's just a pretty face)

192
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,750
(Future: Don't listen to their nonsense)

193
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,080
What's wrong?

194
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,679
I'm used to it.

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,990
A Cupid NPC is meant
to get splashed with water.

196
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,639
You're not an NPC.

197
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,440
Not when you're with me.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,840
Let's go home now.

199
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,679
Tomorrow,

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,519
you'll be free.

201
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,600
The same goes for me.

202
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,039
From now on,

203
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,919
the sky's the limit.

204
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
