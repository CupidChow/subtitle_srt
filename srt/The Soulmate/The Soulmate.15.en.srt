00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,110
Why are you here?

4
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,520
Marshal.

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,110
Since you've caught me,

6
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,750
I'll be honest with you.

7
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,070
I want to leave Rongcheng.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,390
Before I go, I plan to take stock
of the Grand Marshal's residence's assets

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,240
and take what rightfully belongs

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,880
to me.

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,510
No one can leave Rongcheng

12
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,400
before the case is cleared.

13
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,790
But everyone says people
from Grand Marshal's residence

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,950
are cursed by the blood jade.

15
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,760
Who can guarantee

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't be next?

17
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,000
You believe that curse, too?

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,710
I don't want to believe it either,

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,230
but so many

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,310
have already died.

21
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,120
It's precisely because so many have died

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,840
that you can't act recklessly.

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,150
Trust me.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,590
We will find out the truth.

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,280
Okay?

26
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,200
Okay.

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,950
I'll leave first.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,040
You're different from me.

29
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,150
You have a chance.

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,950
Why won't you fly away?

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,310
Miss Gu. This bird's flight feathers
have been clipped.

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,580
I'm afraid it can't fly anymore.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,950
Greetings, Miss Gu.

34
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,840
Mr. Zhang.

35
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,120
We meet again so soon.

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,890
Your chief steward
asked me to settle the accounts.

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,800
Give this to you on the way.

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,030
It was somewhat inconvenient

39
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,030
when Mr. Gao was around.

40
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,840
Is it for me?

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,190
I made it myself for you.

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,290
I've added some soothing
fragrance powder to it.

43
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,840
Thank you, I like it.

44
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
I knew you would like it.

45
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,680
I will get back to work now.

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,630
Miss Gu.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Thanks to the tea
Mr. Zhang brought over,

48
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,470
you've been sleeping
more soundly at night lately.

49
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,910
You look much better.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,120
How can I truly sleep peacefully

51
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,630
without the matters being resolved?

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,690
I returned
to the Grand Marshal's residence today.

53
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,120
The Marshal still disagreed

54
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
with me leaving Rongcheng.

55
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,960
That Marshal

56
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,870
is still so unsympathetic.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,960
By the way, Miss Gu,

58
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,070
that detective
has been investigating for so long.

59
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,560
What has he found out?

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,150
Mr. Gao has been asking me

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,030
about Mr. Zhang's affairs.

62
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,470
I don't know why,

63
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,800
but he seems to be suspecting Mr. Zhang.

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,430
Mr. Zhang

65
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,030
is the only person who treats you well.

66
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,470
Anyone who wants to harm Mr. Zhang
is harming you.

67
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,870
My life was given by you.

68
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,000
If you have anything you want me to do,

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,750
I would do it,
even at the cost of my life.

70
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,470
Silly girl.

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,630
What do you want to do?

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,590
Drive that detective out of Rongcheng?

73
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,190
There are many ways
to silence that detective.

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,120
I've learned quite a few tricks
during the time

75
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,800
I hid from place to place

76
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,560
with my gambling-wreck dad.

77
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,560
Back then,

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,230
if it weren't for your righteousness
in buying me off,

79
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,670
- I would've died long ago in the ditches.
- Alright, enough.

80
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,500
This conversation
is going off the rails.

81
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm hungry.

82
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,960
Get me something to eat.

83
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,910
Please wait a moment.

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,720
There are so many ways

85
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,560
to silence that detective.

86
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,390
(Zhang's Tailor Shop)

87
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,290
Zhang Zhiran specializes
in making cheongsams,

88
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,360
but Gu Mengqiu

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,070
rarely wears cheongsams on normal days.

90
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,150
Why would she be a regular customer
at this shop?

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,360
It seems that Gu Mengqiu's relationship
with this shop

92
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,800
is unusual.

93
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,000
Mr. Gao.

94
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,240
Are you waiting for me?

95
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,160
Please come in.

96
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,750
Mr. Gao.

97
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,600
You've been visiting frequently.

98
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,680
Could it be you've fallen for the tea in my shop?

99
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,190
Your tea always has a way

100
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,870
of calming people.

101
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,190
Mr. Gao.

102
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,950
I heard from Miss Gu

103
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,920
that you used to be a detective.

104
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,560
Mr. Zhang.

105
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,490
You're quite familiar with Miss Gu,
aren't you?

106
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,240
Seems that you two
usually talk about everything.

107
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,600
About this.

108
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,430
Miss Gu

109
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,870
is a regular customer here,

110
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,870
so naturally, we talk more.

111
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,830
Mr. Gao, did you come today

112
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,040
to order a suit?

113
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,750
No, it's for a friend of mine,

114
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,630
a lady.

115
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,190
I'm sorry, Mr. Gao.

116
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,510
Our schedule is fully booked.

117
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,430
I'm afraid

118
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,560
it might delay you.

119
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,240
It's okay.

120
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,800
If not this month,

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,510
then next month.

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
If not this year, then next year.

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,390
But...

124
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,070
Miss Gu's cheongsam

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,000
is so beautiful.

126
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,510
Even if it means waiting a bit longer,

127
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,390
it's no problem at all.

128
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,160
In that case,

129
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Mr. Gao.

130
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,160
Do you know the measurements of the lady

131
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,370
for whom the clothing is intended?

132
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,190
I have them ready.

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,600
Mr. Zhang.

134
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,720
(Lady Yu's Measurement)

135
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,560
I'll write it down.

136
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,040
Mr. Zhang. With such excellent craftsmanship,

137
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,090
have you ever considered
developing your business elsewhere?

138
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
Mine is just a small business,

139
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,990
and I aim for a peaceful life.

140
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,590
There's no other place
as peaceful as Rongcheng.

141
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,240
From what you said,

142
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,780
you must have been
to other places before.

143
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,750
You're not a local, are you?

144
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,430
Right.

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,120
When did you work as a tailor
at the Grand Marshal's residence?

146
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,600
And when did you

147
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,680
see the cheongsam I made

148
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,510
at Miss Gu's place, Mr. Gao?

149
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,430
The day before yesterday
or the day before that?

150
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,560
I've forgotten.

151
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,480
So, Mr. Gao.

152
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,160
You think Miss Gu's cheongsam is pretty.

153
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,000
Which one do you prefer more?

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,070
Miss Gu's rose purple one

155
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,000
or the pearl pink one?

156
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,830
So, I can have a reference.

157
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,720
The rose purple one.

158
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,430
The rose purple one.

159
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,800
(Lady Yu's Tailoring Order)

160
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,800
I seem to have

161
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,270
never made a rose purple one

162
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,600
for Miss Gu.

163
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,090
Then, it must be the pearl pink.
I must've remembered it wrong.

164
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,160
The scheduling for the clothes

165
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,630
is six months later.

166
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,120
Mr. Gao.

167
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,270
Please sign here.

168
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,290
(Lady Yu's Tailoring Order)
To complete the reservation.

169
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,720
By the way, Mr. Zhang.

170
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,630
I noticed

171
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,830
the scent in your shop

172
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,070
is different from before.

173
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,950
What is it this time?

174
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,920

the fragrance powder

176
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,360
according to the season.

177
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,720
I appreciate your effort.

178
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,360
See you again.

179
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,800
See you, Mr. Gao.

180
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,430
I will share with you

181
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,670
the strange scent I smelled
in the tailor shop just now.

182
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,390
Why are you sharing it with me?

183
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,630
Aren't you a detective?

184
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,240
I can't distinguish the scent.

185
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,790
That's why I'm asking for your help.

186
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,390
Let's get involved together.

187
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll consider it a favor.

188
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,510
I'll owe you one.

189
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,670
It's not this one.

190
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,720
What about this?

191
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,000
Not this, either.

192
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,360
Are you sure?

193
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,480
Could it be this fragrance pouch

194
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,360
is mixed with some other scents?

195
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,000
That's why you find it strange.

196
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,670
I can't say for sure,

197
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
but I just feel that the scent appearing
in the tailor shop

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
is odd.

199
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,770
It's like I've smelled it
somewhere before.

200
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,360
Is this scent very important?

201
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,030
My intuition tells me

202
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
it is.

203
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Okay.

204
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,390
I'll help you.

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,750
Not this one.

206
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,870
How about this?

207
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,510
No.

208
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,670
No.

209
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,000
Neither is this one.

210
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,550
This one is a bit like it.

211
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,720
Are you sure?

212
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,120
It's got a kind

213
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,030
of fermented grape scent.

214
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,630
That's the scent.

215
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,480
I'll smell it, too.

216
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,270
Is there a need

217
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,510
to be so close to smell it?

218
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,270
I didn't do it on purpose.

219
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,720
Here's the Rongcheng Antique Pavilion

220
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,960
shipment record
for the last three months.

221
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,180
Haven't seen the blood jade.

222
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,750
The safe was also pried open.

223
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,440
Only some gold bars
and bricks were left.

224
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,510
Search the black market.

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,510
The blood jade is invaluable.

226
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,120
They must be eager to sell it.

227
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,630
Search among all kinds of people

228
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,240
and ask around.

229
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,000
Understood.

230
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,120
Report.

231
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,440
Marshal, Third Lady is awake.

232
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Let's go to the hospital.

233
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,960
She wants to see Miss Yu as well.
