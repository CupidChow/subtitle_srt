Gao Han.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,679
Marshal.

5
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,479
Marshal.

6
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:22,280
I never thought

7
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,040
my life would

8
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,599
end like this.

9
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,040
Instead of dwelling

10
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,159
on the case,

11
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,239
she's all I think about.

12
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,200
It's a shame

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,680
I never got the chance

14
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,799
to confess my feelings to her.

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,280
Gao Han.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,360
What's wrong with you?

17
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,479
I'm fine.

18
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
Why won't you

19
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,120
tell me the truth,

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,800
even now?

21
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,879
Is it

22
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,000
because of that game?

23
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,080
Hey, Game,

24
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,479
are you crazy?

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,840
Why did you treat him like this?

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,360
It serves you right
to stay single forever.

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,319
Stop scolding me.

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,599
He dug his own grave.

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,319
Look

30
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,000
at what he's done.

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,879
Nan Yu.

32
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,680
Time.

33
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:16,800
Right.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,360
I need to stop the time.

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,120
Gao Han.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
(Stop now.)

37
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:49,560
(Invading the system)

38
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,800
(and forcefully altering time)

39
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,680
(will lead to contamination and backlash.)

40
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,039
I don't care

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,479
about them.

42
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:57,360
I want to save her.

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,560
I want to save her.

44
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,800
You ended up like this

45
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,919
because of me.

46
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,199
You were trying to save me.

47
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,160
Are you dumb?

48
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,279
You called me "senior".

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,879
Of course, I should protect you.

50
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,160
I promised

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
to always be there for you

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
whenever you need me.

53
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,199
I won't let you disappear.

54
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,279
Trust me.

55
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,160
Okay.

56
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,120
I wish I hadn't

57
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,279
shown you this side of me.

58
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,519
I'm not cool at all.

59
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,920
I won't let you disappear.

60
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,240
As long as we find the real culprit

61
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,120
before you dissipate,

62
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,600
we can return to our own worlds,

63
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
and you can survive.

64
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,560
You saw the incident today.

65
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,759
That shooter looks a lot
like Gu Mengqiu.

66
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,600
She's probably

67
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,639
the real culprit behind all this.

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,279
I've also thought

69
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,879
the same thing.

70
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,279
But there's just one thing

71
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,519
that I can't figure out.

72
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Let's assume Gu Mengqiu

73
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,800
is the real culprit.

74
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,750
Zhang Ziran has already
taken the blame for her.

75
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,480
So why would she

76
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,160
still want to kill us?

77
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,319
You're too weak

78
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,439
to make deductions right now.

79
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,360
Then let's

80
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,439
ask someone

81
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,240
who knows her well.

82
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,040
Help me

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,480
call Jiang Junsheng over.

84
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,519
We have one more place to go.

85
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,839
Where to?

86
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,920
To the orphanage.

87
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,800
Find the director

88
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,720
and dig into Gu Mengqiu's background.

89
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,360
Alright.

90
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,680
I'll make sure to get it done.

91
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,160
In that case,

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,879
let's split up.

93
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,160
I'll make sure

94
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,800
to uncover the truth behind all of this.

95
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,600
Is your leg alright?

96
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,000
I thought

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,120
you would need a crutch.

98
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,639
The doctor did suggest it,

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,959
but it's bothersome.

100
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,800
I don't need it.

101
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,480
Thanks for coming by.

102
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
Let's get down to business.

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Nan Yu told me

104
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,360
that you guys suspect Gu Mengqiu.

105
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,079
The shooter purposely covered her face

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,240
to avoid being recognized.

107
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,800
Both Nan Yu and I think

108
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,000
that person's figure

109
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:58,560
is very much like Gu Mengqiu's.

110
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,399
Take a look at this.

111
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,040
This gun

112
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,319
was found at the scene.

113
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,600
Father gave her one

114
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
just like it years ago.

115
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,879
It's sleek

116
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,399
and lightweight,

117
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,680
perfect for a woman's use.

118
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,600
Throughout Rongcheng,

119
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,959
I've only seen

120
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,519
the one Father gave her.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,399
If what you say is true,

122
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,600
why would she want
to kill you and Nan Yu?

123
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,560
Honestly, I don't get her.

124
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,000
Although we're called siblings,

125
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,759
I've never really

126
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
approved her actions.

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,919
We hardly interact,
and there shouldn't be any grudges between us.

128
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,039
What do you mean

129
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,039
by her actions?

130
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,970
She always blindly
obeyed Father's orders.

131
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,120
I'm unaware of what she

132
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,879
was forced into.

133
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,200
Those are just her words.

134
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,600
The truth might not be as she says.

135
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,679
Check this out.

136
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,480
This is

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,679
an expensive antique paper.

138
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,440
Over the years,

139
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,120
Gu Mengqiu has been buying lots of them.

140
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,759
Jun already told me about this.

141
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,559
He investigated this with Nan Yu.

142
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,679
But what can these papers tell us?

143
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,200
I suspect these antique papers are

144
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,290
related to the antiques circulating
in the market.

145
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,480
If that's the case,

146
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,159
I need to verify it immediately.

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
I'll go with you.

148
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,159
You should rest.

149
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,820
When an information is passed
back and forth, errors may occur.

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,279
I want to verify it personally.

151
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,519
Gao Han, take a look at this.

152
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:20,960
Gao Han.

153
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,480
I'll let you know immediately

154
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,759
if there's any progress.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,060
I'll wait for your update.

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,990
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

157
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Nan Yu's not here.

158
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,519
I checked Nan Yu's school

159
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,190
and found no one by your name.

160
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,679
Who are you?

161
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,039
Me?

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm Detective Gao Han.

163
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
Did you vanish

164
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,639
because of that gunshot?

165
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,320
Are you okay?

166
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,039
Why are you suddenly
so concerned about me?

167
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm just worried Nan Yu would be upset.

168
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,519
If something happens to you,

169
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,240
she'll be heartbroken.

170
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,039
If I really

171
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,039
disappear one day,

172
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,679
can you make sure she

173
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,799
doesn't get too upset?

174
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:18,360
Just kidding.

175
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,399
I'm back, Gao Han.

176
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,840
Mission accomplished.

177
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,120
You left.

178
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Gao Han.

179
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,440
Don't scare me like that.

180
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,559
You big fat liar.

181
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,480
We agreed to go back together, remember?

182
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:08,080
What's all this?

183
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,799
Why did you leave like this?

184
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,039
I haven't even finished

185
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,080
saying all I need to.

186
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,320
I have so much more to say to you.

187
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,720
How could you just leave like this?

188
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,679
What do you want to tell me?

189
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:28,919
I like you.

190
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,519
You didn't leave?

191
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,159
Why did you lie?

192
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,120
When I wasn't here just now,

193
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,440
you call me a liar.

194
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,360
Now that I'm here,

195
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,720
you still call me a liar.

196
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:52,799
So, tell me.

197
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,400
What exactly did I lie to you about?

198
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,679
I just heard someone

199
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:03,639
say they like me.

200
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:07,799
No, I didn't.

201
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,159
You were hearing things.

202
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,159
Nan Yu.

203
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,960
Listen to me.

204
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,759
I like you.

205
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,759
I've liked you

206
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,000
for a long time.

207
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,440
That's impossible.

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,759
It was love at first sight for me.

209
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,000
I didn't expect you

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
to be so sarcastic.

211
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,799
Did you forget

212
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,080
we met

213
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,720
before entering the hub?

214
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,480
Oh, and here,

215
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,320
this fish print sachet

216
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:06,279
is for you.

217
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,360
Whenever you miss me,

218
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,200
just look at this.

219
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,320
Actually,

220
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,559
I don't want to go back either,

221
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,000
but don't worry,

222
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,000
we'll definitely find the culprit

223
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,200
and be safe at last.

224
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,360
Miss Gu.

225
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,519
I don't want to leave.

226
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,990
I don't want to be apart from you.

227
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
Silly girl.

228
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,799
All good things must come to an end.

229
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,240
I have to leave too.

230
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,000
Miss Gu, you…

231
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,399
Take care.

232
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,120
I know where the blood jade is,

233
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,360
but I demand a person in exchange.
