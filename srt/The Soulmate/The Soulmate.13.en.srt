00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,500
(Firenze Restaurant)

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,119
Are you not coming in with me?

5
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,399
I don't think it's appropriate
for me to join in.

6
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,320
Rest assured.

7
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,119
I'm here for you

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,039
whenever you need me.

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,280
Alright then.

10
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,240
You actually came.

11
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,479
All Jiang Junsheng wanted
was a chance to apologize to Lady Yu.

12
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:04,920
But when you

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,840
entered Lady Yu's body,

14
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,879
she was already poisoned to death.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,159
We all have

16
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,400
to return to our world someday.

17
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,200
And after we leave,

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,239
Jiang Junsheng will have
to face the news of Lady Yu's death.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,640
If he doesn't

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,239
speak up this time,

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,959
it'll probably be a regret
for the rest of his life.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,560
Oh, by the way,

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,840
I've ordered some food,

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,220
but I'm not sure if you'll like it.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm not into fancy food.

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,159
I just like some burgers

27
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,519
and fries.

28
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,200
Can you get me some…

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,239
Barbecue sauce, please.

30
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:45,879
Sure thing.

31
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,760
I like dipping my fries

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,879
in barbecue sauce.

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,799
I hope you don't mind.

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,159
Not at all.

35
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,599
I usually do that too.

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,280
Then, go ahead.

37
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,690
Back then, it was
just about solving cases

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,240
and none of this relationship stuff.

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,120
But now we

40
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,919
have to deal

41
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,080
with all this drama.

42
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,760
Wow, look at them
having a blast eating without me.

43
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,719
I should go in

44
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,439
and recharge with Jiang Junsheng.

45
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:04,680
Wait.

46
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,520
I can't just

47
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,280
barge in while they're having a good time.

48
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,360
Be careful.

49
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,319
Mr. Gao,

50
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,759
it's really you.

51
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,840
What's wrong?

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm fine. I'm just
dealing with an old issue.

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,680
You look pale.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,319
My apartment is nearby.

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Why not

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,360
come over and rest for a bit?

57
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,159
Thanks for the offer, Miss Gu,

58
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,280
but I'm afraid it might be inconvenient.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,240
Don't worry, Mr. Gao.

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,919
Miss Yu is my good friend,

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,080
and since you're her senior,

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,919
it's only right

63
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:48,240
that I look out for you.

64
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,039
Alright then,

65
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
if you insist.

66
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,680
Thanks, Miss Gu.

67
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,560
This way, please.

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,919
Enjoy your tea, Mr. Gao.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,160
How are you feeling, Mr. Gao?

70
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,639
Much better. Thanks.

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,680
No problem.

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,040
Even if we

73
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,360
were strangers,

74
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,920
I wouldn't just turn a blind eye.

75
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,079
Miss Gu,

76
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,199
this tea smells unique.

77
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,839
It has cloves and ginseng.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,120
Cloves calm the nerves,
while ginseng boosts energy.

79
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,279
Have you been feeling unwell lately?

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,759
So you know

81
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,240
about tea, too, Mr. Gao.

82
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,839
This is a special blend of flower tea.

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,260
Since the incident
at the Grand Marshal's residence,

84
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,839
I've been restless.

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,190
I also have insomnia and headaches.

86
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,860
Actually, I invited you over
to rest at my place today

87
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,360
with an ulterior motive.

88
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,240
I heard from Junsheng

89
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,439
that you're a detective.

90
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,439
Lately, I've seen you

91
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,800
around him quite a bit,

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,879
so I'm wondering if there's

93
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,150
any progress in my father's case.

94
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,920
To be honest,

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,879
I'm quite scared.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,360
I can't find peace of mind

97
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,240
until the culprit is caught.

98
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,399
So, Miss Gu,

99
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,120
do you think the Grand Marshal's death

100
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,680
was suspicious

101
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,639
and unrelated to the blood jade curse

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
that has been causing a stir lately?

103
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,279
If ghosts and spirits were real,

104
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,800
how could there still be

105
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,040
so much injustice in the world?

106
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,399
I prefer to believe that someone

107
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,360
is intentionally playing tricks.

108
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,319
Mr. Gao, I put my faith in you

109
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,160
to uncover the truth
about my father's death.

110
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,680
Actually,

111
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,439
from the first time I met you,

112
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,519
I felt

113
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,839
you were different
from others in Rongcheng.

114
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,519
You're righteous and brave…

115
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,680
By the way,

116
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,720
Miss Gu,

117
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
your cheongsam

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,160
is beautifully tailored.

119
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,920
I came to Rongcheng in a hurry
with just a few clothes,

120
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,460
so I want to get some tailored outfits.

121
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,720
Tailored outfits?

122
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,240
Actually, it's easier
to buy ready-made ones,

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,759
but if you prefer custom-made,

124
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,240
I suggest you visit Zhang's Tailor Shop.

125
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,360
This dress I'm wearing

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,839
was made there.

127
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,680
Is it the tailor shop that specializes
in making clothes

128
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,720
for Grand Marshal's family?

129
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,600
Mr. Zhang often

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,399
brings the latest fabrics to our door.

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
(Zhang's Tailor Shop?)

132
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,319
(I remember the shop owner,
Zhang Zhiran,)

133
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,680
(was also present at the deaths)

134
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,170
(of Grand Marshal Jin and Cao Liang.)

135
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:57,800
(He can also freely)

136
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,360
(enter the Grand Marshal's residence.)

137
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,800
You don't like dipping fries
in barbecue sauce,

138
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,439
do you?

139
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,040
I can see the agony

140
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,800
on your face

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,319
when you eat it.

142
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,120
Have you

143
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,279
learned my eating habits

144
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,160
from Gao Han?

145
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,040
That meddling detective

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,720
has been up to no good behind my back.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,879
When I see him again,

148
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,759
he's in deep trouble.

149
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,800
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:29,800
I did

151
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,800
ask Gao Han

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,720
for a favor.

153
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,680
Apologize?

154
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,959
Is it about Yan Hekun's matter?

155
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,639
It's not entirely your fault.

156
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
I messed up a lot

157
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,439
in the past

158
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,399
and hurt your feelings.

159
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,720
I know

160
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,879
saying sorry doesn't mean much to you.

161
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,959
But still,

162
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,759
I wish you could

163
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,800
give me a chance

164
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,759
to start over with you.

165
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,439
Start over?

166
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,680
What do you mean?

167
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
I don't get it.

168
00:07:58,959 --> 00:07:59,759
It's getting late.

169
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,480
I'm heading back.

170
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,160
Wait.

171
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,560
Take this painting. It's for you.

172
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,639
Is this me?

173
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,519
Where did you get it?

174
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,959
I painted it.

175
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,480
Barbecue sauce might not be tasty,

176
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,560
but I enjoyed eating it

177
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,600
because I was with you.

178
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,159
I thought of you

179
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,799
while painting this yesterday,

180
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,440
so I wanted to give it to you.

181
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
I've also planted many red poppies

182
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,720
you like at home.

183
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,200
If you…

184
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
We don't have a chance to start over.

185
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,480
I have a new name now.

186
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,320
You can call me

187
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,200
"Nan Yu" from now on.

188
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,519
Lady Yu liked Jiang Junsheng,

189
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,120
but Nan Yu was different.

190
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,399
(Nan Yu?)
