3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,980
(Rongcheng Police Station)

4
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:28,879
Sorry, Miss Yu.

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,920
The Marshal has taken
the Grand Marshal's body

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,079
for the funeral.

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,560
Thank you.

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,079
(Lady Yu's Autopsy Application Form)

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,479
(What should I do now?)

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,520
(Enter the space.)

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,640
(I have an idea.)

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,799
Where is this?

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,679
This is the hub

14
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,320
where our consciousness communicated.

15
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,880
I decorated it.

16
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:15,959
Are all these real?

17
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,760
To be precise,

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,320
my consciousness formed all these.

19
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,239
But they can be used in real life.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
Isn't it cool?

21
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:29,640
You seem quite relaxed.

22
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,140
Aren't you investigating anymore?

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,599
When we left the hotel,

24
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:39,959
Jiang Junsheng was

25
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:41,560
secretly following you.

26
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,159
He was also eavesdropping from behind

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,560
when Cao Liang mentioned the stone.

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,359
Is this stone really so important?

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,680
Important stone.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
Diamonds?

31
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,920
Rubies?

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,519
Sapphires?

33
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,400
Jade.

34
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,680
Blood jade.

35
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,840
The blood jade curse.

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,800
Did Jiang Junsheng

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,840
kill his father for the blood jade?

38
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,439
No wonder he was acting strange

39
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,599
when I saw him in the morgue.

40
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,199
He must be

41
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,439
afraid I'll find something on the body.

42
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,199
Although you make sense,

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,719
we can't

44
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:29,879
just come to conclusions like this.

45
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:31,680
From my experience,

46
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,280
we need to look for more evidence.

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,990
Let's go to the Grand Marshal's residence
and investigate.

48
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,120
Makes sense.

49
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,919
What're you waiting for then?

50
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,240
Miss Yu.

51
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,560
What brings you here?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,360
I'd like to meet the Marshal.

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,350
He is out and hasn't returned yet.

54
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,479
Why don't you...

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,199
It's alright.

56
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:55,599
I can wait for him inside.

57
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm afraid that's inconvenient.

58
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,390
I'm here to discuss
the engagement's cancellation.

59
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
He's been thinking about this.

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,120
I believe no one can afford the consequences
of delaying this matter.

61
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,360
What do you say?

62
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,840
Well, please.

63
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,759
(According to custom,)

64
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,319
(the Grand Marshal's body
should be laid in the residence.)

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,840
(But they didn't set up a mourning hall.)

66
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,159
(Nothing seems unusual)

67
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,680
(at first glance too.)

68
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,199
(I need to look more.)

69
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,719
Miss Yu, please stay here.

70
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,690
The Marshal has ordered that no one
can enter without permission.

71
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,879
I'll just take a look, just one look.

72
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,159
Miss Yu.

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,319
(This is...)

74
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,680
She's barely 30 years old.

75
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,680
Beautiful and wearing expensive jewelry.

76
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,080
She should be the Grand Marshal's
favored Third Lady,

77
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,360
Feng Qianhong.

78
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,639
Third Lady.

79
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,080
Why are you acting so distant?

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,400
You used to call me Ms. Hong.

81
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,520
I know

82
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,159
it's all because of the Marshal.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,159
Forget about him.

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,599
Why did you suddenly come?

85
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,919
I...

86
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,920
wanted to pay respect
to the Grand Marshal.

87
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:20,759
That's thoughtful of you.

88
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,439
But the Marshal isn't back yet.

89
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,959
Why don't you come sit with me?

90
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,879
That would be too much trouble.

91
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,800
But you can't

92
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,839
just stand here all alone.

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
Come sit in my room.

94
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,759
I'll send someone

95
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,199
to ask Marshal to return quicker.

96
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,800
That sounds like a good plan.

97
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,920
Miss Yu.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,600
Please don't be mad at Grand Marshal.

99
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,480
He's got a lot

100
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,680
on his plate these days.

101
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,920
So he might be cranky.

102
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,560
Whether his temper is good or bad

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,800
has nothing to do with me.

104
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,240
Ms. Hong.

105
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,839
What's the matter

106
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,480
with the blood jade curse?

107
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,000
This is a long story.

108
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,920
Some time ago,

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,639
Master acquired
a particularly valuable red jade.

110
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,439
It was then

111
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,759
that strange things started happening.

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,040
Qianhong.

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,959
Grand Marshal.

114
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,600
What just flashed by?

115
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,160
Ignore it.

116
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
Grand Marshal!

117
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,879
Grand Marshal.

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,319
Save me.

119
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,160
Grand Marshal.

120
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
Save me!

121
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,399
Grand Marshal.

122
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
Save me.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
Save me, Grand Marshal.

124
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Someone! Come!

125
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
There's blood.

126
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,040
Someone come!

127
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,839
Master's portrait is on fire!

128
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,519
This jasmine tea is nice.

129
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,279
Try some.

130
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,079
Thank you.

131
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,160
What happened next?

132
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,680
Then,

133
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,439
the old kitchen

134
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,839
that hasn't been used for years

135
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,160
suddenly caught fire.

136
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,759
Master looked like he was cursed.

137
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,600
He lost his appetite,
and his health deteriorated.

138
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
We invited

139
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,639
a shaman from the capital.

140
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,120
After a thorough investigation,

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,560
she said something evil
has entered the house,

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,680
and we must exorcise it
on an auspicious day.

143
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,879
Then,

144
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,360
Master died on the day of the exorcism.

145
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,079
What's wrong with me?

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're tired, Miss Yu.

147
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,920
Let me help you

148
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
to rest on the bed.

149
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,000
How strange.

150
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,519
Why do I suddenly feel sleepy?

151
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,160
Nan Yu, wake up!

152
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,079
Wake up.

153
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:43,879
Nan Yu.

154
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,079
Nan Yu.

155
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,759
Nan Yu.

156
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,000
Caution.

157
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,319
Do not force relocation,

158
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,480
or it will cause irreparable damage.

159
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,319
Nan Yu!

160
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,959
Nan Yu!

161
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,639
Caution.

162
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,159
Who are you?

163
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,240
Let go of her.

164
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,559
He's Gao Han.

165
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,039
He saved me just now.

166
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,320
Don't make it difficult for him.

167
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,480
What happened to you?

168
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:39,799
I ate the pastries Third Lady offered me.

169
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,639
Then my head started spinning.

170
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,039
I think

171
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,960
someone even wanted to harm me.

172
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,200
Where's Third Lady?

173
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,840
I heard you were in her room,

174
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,720
so I came to find you

175
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,279
and found her fainted at the door too.

176
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,799
Marshal.

177
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,159
The doctor is here.

178
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,879
Carry Third Lady in.

179
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,080
We'll investigate the matter
after the doctor's diagnosis.

180
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,679
Yes.
