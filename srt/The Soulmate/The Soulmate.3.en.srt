=The Soulmate=

2
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,600
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,920
(The other day,)

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,490
(something strange did happen
at the Grand Marshal's residence.)

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,160
We've been unlucky

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,400
ever since we

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,760
got that jade piece.

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,880
Don't worry.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,120
The Grand Marshal had a shaman
perform rituals,

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,110
and surely, fortune
will turn in our favor after this.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,240
(Shortly after that shaman left,)

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,960
(Master died.)

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,960
Help! There's a fire!

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,240
There's a fire!

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,320
Master!

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,520
(The Grand Marshal)

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,600
(was on his knees,)

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,760
burning in a ball of flame.

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,880
It was eerie.

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,120
That's what the maid said,

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,440
but I still feel

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,480
there's something wrong.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
How could there be ghosts

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,280
in this world?

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,080
This is man-made.
I've seen a lot of this.

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,680
Since the Grand Marshal's residence
became haunted,

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,480
we've been pulled into this space.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,160
It seems finding out the cause
of the Grand Marshal's death

29
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,480
is the key to our return.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,240
What do you think?

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,880
We need to gather more clues.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,710
Since they mentioned the blood jade curse,

33
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,920
it means this thing

34
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,920
is closely related to his death.

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,840
I don't believe in curses at all.

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,120
I reckon it's more likely

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,440
someone close to him

38
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,960
spun this as a distraction.

39
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,920
Looks like you're not entirely blinded
by love either.

40
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,360
Of course not.

41
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,240
I'm a top-tier support.

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,720
In this world,
street smarts are everything.

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,480
So I believe

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,920
this must be a...

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,560
A what?

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
A crime of passion.

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,560
In this chaotic era,

48
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,480
a woman fell victim

49
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,440
to the Grand Marshal's cruel hands.

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,640
Unable to be

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,360
with her beloved

52
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
and feeling desperate,

53
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,280
she could only resort to killing him
to ease her hatred.

54
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
It's truly pitiful.

55
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,320
So that's your inference?

56
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,090
What do you think?

57
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,760
Isn't it quite reasonable?

58
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,120
There's absolutely no basis for it.

59
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,760
Solving a case isn't about speculation.

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
It's about clues and evidence.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
You don't actually think

62
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,000
Lady Yu overdosed

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,450
on sleeping pills,
and it was just an accident, do you?

64
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
That makes sense.

65
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,240
Let's test for drug.

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,520
I have a beaker, a pipette,

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
and an alcohol burner here.

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,360
These equipments should suffice.

69
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,240
Next,

70
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,440
just follow my steps
and carry out the procedure.

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,840
After adding this reagent,

72
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,150
you'll be able to spot any irregularities
in the wine.

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,800
What does this mean?

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,040
The blue color indicates a high presence

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,360
of phenobarbital in the wine.

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,400
It's a potent tranquilizer.

77
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,400
This is the cause of Lady Yu's death.

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
There's a needle hole

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
in the wine cork.

80
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,520
This indicates that the tranquilizer

81
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,120
was injected into the wine beforehand.

82
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,560
The wine was a gift from the Marshal.

83
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,200
Did the Marshal really plan
to kill Lady Yu then?

84
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,440
Why the sigh?

85
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,440
Lady Yu must have never imagined

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,320
that the one who killed her

87
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,200
was actually her beloved.

88
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,560
If Lady Yu hadn't been poisoned,

89
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,960
you wouldn't have had a body.

90
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,440
In other words,

91
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,320
you're the biggest beneficiary
in this murder case.

92
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,040
Alright.

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,440
Just shut up.

94
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,440
Come in.

95
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,600
Miss.

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,440
The police chief sent an invitation.

97
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
He's inviting you
to Lihua Palace tonight.

98
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,520
I've already asked.

99
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,960
The Marshal will attend.

100
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
Alright, I got it.

101
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,320
Now is our best time to get close

102
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,160
to Jiang Junsheng.

103
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,440
Maybe we might even meet some

104
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,520
of the Grand Marshal's close associates
and find more clues.

105
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,720
You want to approach Jiang Junsheng?

106
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,190
Of course, that's for you to do.

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,400
We need clear division of labor.

108
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,920
I'll handle the suspect,

109
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,000
and you'll deal with the men.

110
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,880
What if

111
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,360
I face danger?

112
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,160
Don't worry.

113
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,200
If you ever face danger,

114
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,450
I'll protect you,
even if it means risking my own life.

115
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,800
I mean to protect your body.

116
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,600
You must protect me at all costs.

117
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,380
If something happens to me,
you're dead.

118
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
(Rest assured.)

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,160
(If something really happens,
we'll switch anytime.)

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,320
I, Yan,

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,760
have long admired you, Coroner Yu.

122
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,880
Let's toast

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
to our meeting tonight.

124
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,240
Come, Miss Yu.

125
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
Miss Yu.

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,400
Are you looking down on me?

127
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,440
How about this, Commander Yan?

128
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,760
Let's have a drink together.

129
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
That's the spirit.

130
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,320
Come on, Miss Yu.

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,160
I'll drink first.

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,760
Here.

133
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,840
Good.

134
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,240
Great.

135
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,720
Commander Yan.

136
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,840
You're underestimating me.

137
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
I meant...

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
let's drink a bottle each.

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,080
Seriously?

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,320
You, a man,

141
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,560
can't outdrink me?

142
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,280
Miss Yu.

143
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,720
Are you provoking me?

144
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,440
Commander Yan.

145
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
There's an old saying.

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,920
Women are no less capable

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,720
than men.

148
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,120
Since Miss Yu dares
to set the challenge,

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,800
Commander Yan.

150
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,880
How can you not accept it?

151
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,400
Alright.

152
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,360
Miss Yu, since you're this bold

153
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
and confident,

154
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,920
why don't you take the first drink?

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,160
Well...

156
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,440
Sure.

157
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,600
Who else dares

158
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,720
to challenge me?

159
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,360
Missy.

160
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,200
You shouldn't drink anymore.

161
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
If you keep drinking,

162
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,920
and I get drunk,

163
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,640
who's going to protect you?

164
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,640
Fifteen.

165
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,760
Two little bees.

166
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,480
Little bee, come.

167
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,200
Sure, come. Let's do it.

168
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,800
Alright.

169
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
Two little bees,

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,360
flying among the flowers.

171
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,000
Go.

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,720
I won.

173
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,200
What?

174
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,960
Drink it.

175
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,880
Miss Yu, since you said so, I'll drink.

176
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,200
I put down ten.

177
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,200
Right.

178
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,280
Come on.

179
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,160
Let's continue drinking.

180
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,760
Hurry up.

181
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,880
Come on.

182
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,920
I'll drink.

183
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,400
(Detective Gao.)

184
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,550
(Have you figured out
the identities of these men?)

185
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,920
Based on their conversation,

186
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,300
I've come to the following conclusions.

187
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,520
Cao Liang, Governor Cao,

188
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,520
has a Jiangnan accent

189
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,480
and is steady-minded.

190
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,790
(Cao Liang, Governor of Rongcheng)
He's originated from cavalry.

191
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,080
Yan Hekun, Commander Yan,

192
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,430
(Yan Hekun, Commander of Rongcheng)
has a Northeastern accent

193
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,520
and tends to be impulsive.

194
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,500
He has an infantry background.

195
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,480
And then there's Wang Ming,
who has been observing

196
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,240
and acting according
to Yan Hekun's cues.

197
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,920
(Wang Ming, Rongcheng Police Chief)
It seems that this chief

198
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,520
is most likely just a puppet.

199
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,120
Then, there is the Japanese man
who hasn't spoken much,

200
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,720
Hatoyama.

201
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,480
(Hatoyama Miichiro, Hatoyama Corp)
The President of Hatoyama Corp.

202
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,800
(Jiang Junsheng
has been watching me closely.)

203
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,470
(It seems that we won't be able
to get much out of them tonight.)

204
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
(I should leave first.)

205
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
Alright, I'll drink.

206
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,640
The liquor

207
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,680
is running low.

208
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,760
I'll go get some more.

209
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
Come back soon.

210
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,080
That's close.

211
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,640
I thought I couldn't get out of it tonight.

212
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm here for you.

213
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Don't worry.

214
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,360
Stop boasting about yourself.

215
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,680
How was my performance just now?

216
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,440
There was a problem.

217
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,880
What problem?

218
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,040
You were too perfect,

219
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,600
far beyond my expectations.

220
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,600
But next time,

221
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,760
can we drink a little less?

222
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,200
Stop commanding me.

223
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,240
Miss Yu.

224
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,480
What were you

225
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,840
muttering about?

226
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,760
Governor Cao.

227
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
What are you doing here?

228
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,760
Just now,

229
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,960
I forgot to ask you something.

230
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,280
I'm curious whether you
discovered anything noteworthy

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,200
from the Grand Marshal's autopsy

232
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,760
the other day.

233
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,680
Something noteworthy?

234
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,760
Something like a stone.

235
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,560
A stone?

236
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,040
Do you mean a kidney stone?

237
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,840
It's common for someone
of Grand Marshal's age to have that.

238
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,560
That's okay.

239
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,840
I won't bother you any further, Miss Yu.

240
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,080
(It seems there are clues
on the Grand Marshal's body)

241
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,320
(Sweet Life)
that we missed.

242
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,960
(Rongcheng Watchmaker's Shop)

243
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
