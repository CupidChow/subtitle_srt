YEONSHIN UNIVERSITY
MEDICAL SCHOOL

13
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,513
Early entrance to college? At what age?

14
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,599
Seventeen.
Top score on the entrance exam.

15
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,686
- She must be smart.
- Yeah, she's smart.

16
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,439
But so what? She's a loose cannon.

17
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,691
My advice? Watch out for her.

18
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,152
So this Seok Jeong is that bad, huh?

19
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:59,072
I just got back and this is
the very first thing you had to tell me.

20
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,033
Believe me,
that's how much trouble she is.

21
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,743
Something's wrong with her.

22
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,371
And she talks way too much.

23
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,873
She talks too much?

24
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,082
I'm serious.

25
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,335
Once she gets going…
…she'll talk for an hour.

26
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,881
She's got so much to talk about
and complain about.

27
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,757
And she's a know-it-all.

28
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,301
Sounds like a handful.

29
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,637
Yeah, she definitely is.
But she's also good at what she does.

30
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,097
She pushes herself hard.

31
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,642
You're acting like all hell's broken loose
'cause of this kid.

32
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,062
I had a bad feeling when I read her essay.

33
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,482
What did it say?

34
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,276
Read it when you get a chance.

35
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,702
-Oh! Dr. Choi!
-Ah… Ms. Na.

36
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,370
Oh, it's been so long.

37
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,125
Wait. I heard you were still in Boston.

38
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,085
Are you back for good now?

39
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,129
Yes. I'm back for good.

40
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,422
How have you been?

41
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,341
Oh my goodness.

42
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,426
I'm so happy to see you, I'm crying.

43
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,473
-Oh…
-So, how are your knees? They holding up?

44
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,100
Oh, you know,
I'm just trying to go easy on them.

45
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,275
Come on, eat first.
I'll help you out after.

46
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,485
Don't worry about me.

47
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,694
Hmm…

48
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,114
Come in.

49
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,535
Uh… It's open. Come in.

50
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,582
Huh?

51
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,667
Seok Jeong.

52
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,635
-Dr. Choi.
-Huh?

53
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,528
Residents must have a lot of free time
these days,

54
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,238
seeing as how you're not in the ward.

55
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,825
-Today is my day off.
-If you're off, you should rest.

56
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,244
Your eyes are even red.

57
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,746
That doesn't matter.

58
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,832
Who cares about sleep?

59
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,558
There has to be a reason
you've barged into a professor's office

60
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,685
without any kind of formal introduction.

61
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,022
I heard that you were back in Korea.

62
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,691
I ran all the way here
because I wanted to show you this.

63
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,111
It's this week's neuro quiz.

64
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,450
If you look along the neuraxis
here and here,

65
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,951
three-millimeter tumors.

66
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:51,995
Two of them.

67
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,830
They're Chordomas, right?

68
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,855
When Dr. Song was with you,

69
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,774
he'd talk smack about me, huh?

70
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,443
Did he tell you I'm a weirdo?

71
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,736
'Cause it's not true.

72
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,532
Honestly, I don't like him
that much either.

73
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,035
He yawns in the operating room.

74
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,037
Not to mention his research papers.

75
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:44,005
I've read them all, ya know.
And not one was worth reading.

76
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,175
He pieces together other people's work.

77
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,721
So you dare talk about Dr. Song like that
in front of me?

78
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,309
Dr. Song, he used
to be your student, right?

79
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,019
Like me.

80
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,189
Like you?

81
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:02,982
Yeah.

82
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,152
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for you.

83
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,739
I've been waiting for you
to come back from Boston.

84
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,157
Every day.

85
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,952
Since before I even graduated
from med school.

86
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,914
Every one of your papers, all,
all of your research,

87
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:21,084
I've read all of it.
Hmm. I even memorized a few.

88
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,545
That's a waste of your time though.

89
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,130
Why do that?

90
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,551
Every single word is perfection.

91
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,052
So it's not a waste.

92
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,043
YEONSHIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

93
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,263
Dr. Choi!

94
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,353
Seok Jeong?

95
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,438
What is it?

96
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,525
Please teach me, doctor.

97
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,777
You're the only one I want to learn from.

98
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,573
-Really?
-I want you to teach me everything please.

99
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,992
Everything you've ever learned!

100
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,161
Every surgical skill in your head!

101
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,996
If you know it, I want it.

102
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,668
Don't keep anything to yourself.
Don't hold anything back from me.

103
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,753
Please teach me everything.

104
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,007
And why would I do that?

105
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:35,593
Doctor.

106
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,638
I have staked

107
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,100
my entire life on this.

108
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,689
I should've seen it
right then and there.

109
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,109
She had absolutely no self-control.

110
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,069
She was all over the place.

111
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,906
In the end, she said
her dream was to die while operating.

112
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,617
I know exactly what that feels like.

113
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,995
What?

114
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,333
- It's love.
- Oh, my.

115
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,835
She was in love with you?

116
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,504
Yeah, right.

117
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,883
No, not with me.

118
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,677
With this right here.

119
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,638
I was just like her at that age.

120
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,644
While my classmates were busy
obsessing over girls, I was in the OR.

121
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,147
I was falling in love

122
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,774
with brain surgery.

123
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,194
I was captivated by the brain.

124
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,073
That's amazing actually.
You and she are so similar.

125
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,745
You have never seen a brain, have you?

126
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,913
Only in pictures.

127
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,832
You can't understand what I mean
unless you see it.

128
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:53,213
The human brain, it pulsates,
just like the heart.

129
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,174
You've gotta see it for yourself.

130
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,811
You see, the brain's not an organ
you're meant to cut open.

131
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,397
It doesn't have a lid.

132
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,984
That's how it was designed,

133
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,654
for no one to open it.

134
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,324
But I was lucky enough to look inside.

135
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:26,871
It was so delicate and fragile,

136
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,499
yet at the same time,

137
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,085
incredibly beautiful and elegant.

138
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,090
You can't help but fall in love with it.

139
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,802
Once it's gone, you miss it
and want to touch it again.

140
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,596
So to die in the OR, that's what you want?

141
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,474
Yeah. I'd be happy to.

142
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,809
Wow.

143
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,688
So that girl, you seem to like her a lot.

144
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,482
What? Like her?

145
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,568
Disgraceful.

146
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,910
Hello, Dr. Kang.

147
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,082
HAN HYEONHO'S
ANESTHESIOLOGY &amp; PAIN MEDICINE

148
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,171
Thank you.

149
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:46,534
From what I hear, you only treat patients
everyone else has given up on.

150
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,913
Yes, those are usually
the kinds of patients who come to us.

151
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,043
Since what you're doing is illegal,

152
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,879
why not charge them more money then?

153
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,799
I charge them what's fair,
given their situations.

154
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,011
MEDICAL VOLUNTEER SERVICE

155
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,806
You charge them a fair amount,
and your clinic looks like this?

156
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,226
That's a bit of a mystery.

157
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,654
Oh.

158
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,283
Dr. Baul Yoon was your professor, huh?

159
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,620
I heard he hit some rough patches
towards the end,

160
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,998
living off one of his students
because he had nowhere else to go.

161
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,000
Tragic, really.

162
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,127
You're mistaken, Doctor.

163
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,839
Dr. Yoon was more dignified
and more at peace than anyone.

164
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,383
Even in his remaining days.

165
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,932
You're headed for a sad ending.
Just like your professor, I guess. Hmm?

166
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:54,894
Looking after the rejects
in this tiny little clinic.

167
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,647
It's a waste of your time and talent.

168
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,822
So you're one of those
who look down on the less fortunate.

169
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,325
Now that
I've gotten a little older, Doctor,

170
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,703
it's harder to tolerate people
who think my work here is worthless.

171
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,582
I'm really sick of hearing
that kind of talk.

172
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,253
Couldn't agree more.

173
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,131
No job is fun all the time.

174
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,134
That's rare, you know. Hmm?

175
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,017
This is not the kind of case
you should bring to us.

176
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,229
You should do the operation yourself.

177
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,940
It would be ideal
if I could do it, of course.

178
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,901
Yet, I can't operate on myself, can I?

179
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,786
Dr. Han.

180
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,122
Oh, thank you.

181
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,833
How are your studies by the way?

182
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,794
Maybe I'm stupid.

183
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:04,255
All of the English, it's really hard,
you know?

184
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,885
I won't do it. Just let him die.

185
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:12,597
- Dr. Jeong.
- I already said I won't.

186
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,183
Why the hell are you pushing this on me?

187
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,977
Maybe I just hate to see you
wasting your talent like this.

188
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,396
Yeah. This is a waste of my talent.

189
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,649
I'd be happy to just keep being
the only one who gets to see your work.

190
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,443
But it wouldn't be fair.

191
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,655
You have to do it.
That's the right thing to do.

192
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,412
You need everyone to see what you can do.

193
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:40,583
You can't keep sneaking around different
hospitals for the rest of your life,

194
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,210
like some thief in the night.

195
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,921
Dr. Choi said if you do this,

196
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,132
he'll talk to the medical board
and get your license reinstated, so--

197
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,800
So I get my license back, and what?

198
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,345
Open up a local clinic or something?

199
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,765
What the hell do you think
I could possibly do there?

200
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,517
All I would be telling my patients is

201
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,936
"Go to the hospital."

202
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,274
I'm fine where I am right now.
I like things the way they are.

203
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,318
You understand?

204
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,669
Ms. Seok, wait.
What are you doing with all that stuff?

205
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,087
I'm going to burn this shit.

206
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,880
All of it!

207
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,344
What is all this?

208
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,305
There's another box in the storage room.

209
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,266
-Go get it.
-But Ms. Seok.

210
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:39,642
Go get it now!

Ah shit, shit, shit!

217
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,057
You doing okay?

218
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,685
'Cause you look like something's wrong.

219
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,023
You need more alcohol swabs?

220
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,407
What happened the other day?

221
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,286
That guy who was with you,
he ended up in an ambulance.

222
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,081
I mean,
he collapsed right in front of you,

223
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,958
but you didn't even look at him.

224
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,670
And what the hell
were you stomping on so hard?

225
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,881
You know, something tells me

226
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,966
you're not like other women.

227
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,973
So what?

228
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,728
Oh, nothing.

229
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,023
I don't know what that was all about

230
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,610
but I figure you must be pissed
about something.

231
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,575
I could take you to Seoul.

232
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,494
How about a drink, huh?

233
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,037
Just the two of us.

234
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,083
And why would I get a drink with you?

235
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,046
Oh, what, is it 'cause of this?

236
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,090
But they'll be taking this off
in a couple days.

237
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,468
I've had it for a year.

238
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,969
Good for you.

239
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,723
Ms. Jeong. Sorry I'm late.

240
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,226
The alarm didn't go off.

241
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,979
Just think about it.

242
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,777
Well, that was creepy.

243
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,322
Hey, come here! Now!

244
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,575
Come here!

245
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,744
- Don't make me ask again.
- Please, stop.

246
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:13,999
Who the hell do you think you are?
Huh? Huh? Huh?

247
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:17,169
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, stop whining.

248
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,839
Damn it. Get back here. Now!

249
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,091
Get up.

250
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,014
You're pathetic.

251
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,560
Poor Mari, that's just terrible.

252
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,105
I can't even imagine having a brother
who hits you.

253
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,484
I'm gonna take my lunch break now, okay?

254
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,444
Lunch break? Where?

255
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,197
Where else? Mari's Diner.

256
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,244
Wait a sec. He's beating her
out front, are you serious?

257
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:53,706
He's more likely to stop
if I go over there. I'm a customer.

258
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,541
Please stop.

259
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,959
Wait for me!

260
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:18,355
That creep, he's showing us
his ankle on purpose, right?

261
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,984
He's just trying to get us to look at him,
you know. That's all.

262
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,832
Thank you, Ms. Mari.

263
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:42,504
Did you get a good look at her face?
We should go ahead and call the police.

264
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,007
What will calling them even do?

265
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:48,344
She'll just tell them she fell again.
Just ignore it.

266
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,770
We didn't order this.

267
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,188
It's not for you.

268
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,272
It's for her.

269
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,233
-Have a taste.
-I don't really eat mackerel.

270
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,818
Oh, come on.

271
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,195
It's on the house.

272
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,910
Why's he acting like this all of a sudden?

273
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:17,498
He's completely fearless, that's why.

00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:27,800
Yeah.

276
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,718
Dr. Jeong,
can you operate tonight?

277
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,264
Yes. Absolutely.

278
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,600
Dr. Kang brought in the case.

279
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,727
The patient has a diffuse midline glioma.

280
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,522
He was discharged from Daeseo Hospital
after six months.

281
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,817
Send over the chart. See you there.

282
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,778
Um… Be right back, okay?

283
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,571
What?

284
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:19,059
MS. SEOK

285
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,500
The person you have reached
is not available.

286
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,002
Please hang up and try again.

287
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,921
What the hell is he doing that
he can't even answer his phone?

289

This is my friend's clinic,
but it's shut down.

290
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,587
Listen, you have no idea how thankful
I am that you're doing this,

291
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,214
even though the pay sucks.

292
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,676
I tried not to get involved
but I just felt so bad for the guy.

293
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,598
You made it.

294
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,892
Wouldn't miss it.

295
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,512
Of course I remember.

296
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,183
That day Dr. Jeong,
for the first time ever,

297
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,602
took the lead on a surgery.

298
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:30,107
I was so nervous assisting her
during the procedure.

299
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:31,692
But

300
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,027
she was perfect.

301
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,032
I guess she was a genius already.

302
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,201
She was a genius for sure…

303
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,413
but also a fool.

304
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,874
I wish…

305
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:47,958
Hello.

306
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,253
-…Dr. Choi had chosen to send Dr. Jeong…
-Is Dr. Choi's schedule posted yet?

307
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,505
-…to Boston back then.
-Wait. What?

308
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,090
Things wouldn't have turned out this way.

309
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,426
Weren't you off today?
What were you doing in the OR?

310
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,553
Ah, got called in
for an emergency.

311
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,764
- Dr. Song drunk again?
- Yeah.

312
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:06,393
Stop agreeing to cover for him whenever
he calls you, before it ruins your health.

313
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,728
No, it's fine.

314
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,606
I'll gladly cover for him if that means
I get to be in the OR again.

315
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,441
Don't do that to yourself.

316
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,569
You're going to be so bored
when I'm in Boston.

317
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,574
If you're gonna go, just go already.
So I can relax.

318
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,790
Someone from our department
made it, but no one from orthopedics.

319
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,417
Seok Jeong's back there.

320
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,794
I was seriously thinking that
it was gonna be me this time around.

- Is it for a year?

325
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,305

330
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,067
why is he going to Boston instead of me?

331
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,610
Can't you see I have company?

332
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,737
You said you were gonna send
the one most qualified though.

333
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,698
-Maybe you've forgotten already.
-We'll talk about this later. Now get out!

334
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,868
Tell me why you chose to send
that complete idiot to Boston right now!

335
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,667
Apologize to Uyeong's mother.

336
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,632
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were his mother.

337
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,511
Nevertheless, you're also at fault here.

338
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,680
This is all thanks to you buying my spot
for your son.

339
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,099
You're so educated but you have
no problem stooping that low.

340
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,059
-Seok Jeong, get a hold of yourself!
-Why?

341
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,936
-What is wrong with you?
-What the hell do you expect

342
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,188
when you took away what's mine!

343
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,696
I'll come back later.

344
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,121
You bitch!

345
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,922
After that,

346
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:04,428

from performing any surgeries.

00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,406
it was the worst one
she could have possibly gotten.

350
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:30,078
She was treated like she was invisible
for nearly a year

351
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,247
until the incident.

352
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,126
While Dr. Choi was away
at some conference,

353
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:40,589
the department head gave Dr. Jeong
permission to operate on a patient.

354
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,009
That was a bad idea, wasn't it?

355
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,901
Seok Jeong, stop it.

356
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,153
Stop what you're doing!

357
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,833
Damn it, I said stop now!

358
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,635
Hey, you heard him.

359
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,303
Don't make a scene. Just walk away.

360
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,023
I got paged to the ER.
Car accident victim.

361
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,150
We did a full-body scan
and found multiple trauma,

362
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,069
including fractures and bleeding all over.

363
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:48,115
CT and MRI scans were ordered
and they showed an acute SDH.

364
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,367
The patient clearly needed
emergency surgery,

365
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,119
but there was no one else available.

366
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,788
So I did it myself.

367
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,624
I performed a transfusion,
removed any hematomas,

368
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:59,835
found the source of the bleeding
and stopped the hemorrhage.

369
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,295
I've been operating for two hours
and 20 minutes.

370
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,422
The patient's vitals are stable.

371
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:06,883
And all that's left to do now is suction
and close them up.

372
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,387
I haven't made a single mistake
throughout the procedure.

373
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,724
So why should I get out of my own OR

374
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,352
when my patient's still lying here
on the table?

375
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,479
So you did nothing wrong?
You refuse to leave?

376
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,398
-Yeah.
-Get her out.

377
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,317
I said out!

378
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:29,531
Get off.

379
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,657
-No!
-That's enough!

380
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,242
-This is my surgery!
-Hey, Seok!

381
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,451
-Mine!
-Seok!

382
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:34,995
Let me finish my surgery!

383
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,289
RIGHT OF RETENTION IN EFFECT

384
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,094
Dr. Kang is gone, isn't he?

385
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,349
He's nowhere to be found
and he's not answering his phone either.

386
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:59,644
This is strange. It isn't like him.

387
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,856
I bet there was never any patient
to begin with.

388
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:04,858
We should go now.

389
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,415
JEIL NEUROSURGERY CLINIC

390
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,292
I guess you're having fun preventing me
from performing surgeries, huh?

391
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,338
I did it for you.

392
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,383
I got you a spot at Boston University.

393
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,387
Apparently, getting your license back
just wasn't enough for you.

394
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,432
Go to Boston.

395
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,517
Just go.

396
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,478
And perform all the surgeries you want.

397
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:27,732
-And in exchange I have to operate on you?
-Why not?

398
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,360
It wouldn't even be that hard for you.

399
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,195
Let's say I agree to do it.

400
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,699
If I nick even one little nerve, you know,

401
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,827
I could paralyze those precious hands.

402
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,829
Aren't you scared?

403
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,540
You're too proud to make any mistakes.

404
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,583
You're not fooling anyone.

405
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,010
I hate you.

406
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,431
I'd make that mistake 'cause I hate you.

407
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:03,810
I wish you'd die soon

408
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,146
in the back of some awful nursing home.

409
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,150
One that's out in the middle of nowhere
so you're all alone.

410
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,235
No friends or family.

411
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,154
No one to take care of you.

412
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,948
I want you delirious on painkillers.

413
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,117
Stumbling around in a filthy diaper

414
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,827
filled with your piss and shit.

415
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,537
Wasting away.

416
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,915
Reminiscing about your glory days

417
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,919
thinking "Wow, I used to be someone."

418
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,380
Listen to you rattle on and on.

419
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,507
You really have no self-control.

420
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,426
Do you?

421
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,262
You are going to save my life

422
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:41,056
and go to Boston after.

423
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,727
I'm gonna make sure of it.

424
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,400
Let's go.

425
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,752
Should I open the window for you?

426
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,171
Would you like some fresh air?

427
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,298
Yeah.

428
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,385
After all that drama,

429
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,680
I feel sick.

430
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:28,812
You still want her to do it?

431
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,066
She really didn't seem
on board with it all.

432
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,486
I mean, you heard what she said.

433
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,406
What if she opens you up and

434
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,075
-you know?
-What? Just kills me?

435
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,536
Well, she's not exactly normal, is she?

436
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,871
She'd never do that.

437
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,332
You trust her that much then?

438
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,172
Just don't let your guard down.

439
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,050
She's capable of anything.

440
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,893
The city of Busan is bustling
with activity

441
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:12,230
as it prepares to host
the 24th annual Ichida Awards.

442
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,899
Attention will be focused
on Dr. Deokhee Choi

443
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:18,111
from the Neurosurgery Department
at Yeonshin University.

444
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,364
Dr. Choi is once again nominated
for Surgeon of the Year.

445
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,576
The question that everyone is asking is
if he'll manage to win again,

446
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,787
as it would mark the tenth consecutive
year he has taken home that award,

447
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,914
setting a significant milestone
in the field of neuros--

448
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,169
Hey, I was watching that.

449
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,172
Yeah, right.
Since when do you watch the news?

450
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,674
I like to keep up with current affairs.

451
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,092
This is all you have to return?

452
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,844
Yeah, that's all. I'll see you.

453
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,928
Okay.

454
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,930
-Bye.
-Uh… Yeah.

455
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,314
Ms. Seok.
Can't the two of us just go to Boston?

456
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,065
Going to America would be cool.

457
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,277
-If you really want to, just go.
-Wait, really?

458
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,863
I'll kill you
before you even make it to the airport.

459
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,365
If you're gonna kill me,
just make it quick.

460
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,450
Obviously.

461
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,951
Also,

462
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,621
I'm not going anywhere.

463
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,874
My house, my dogs, my work,

464
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,876
my diner…

465
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,961
MARI'S DINER

466
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,798
Everything is right here.
So where am I supposed to go?

467
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,009
What? You've lost your mind.

468
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,719
How's Mari's Diner yours?

469
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:28,139
I go to eat there every day,
so of course it's mine.

470
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,559
Yeah, yeah.
Of course it's yours, Miss Seok.

471
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,271
You ignore my calls and now this?

472
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,941
You sure have gotten a lot of nerve
all of a sudden.

473
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,318
That again?
You chewed me out earlier.

474
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,903
You should've answered your phone
when I called!

475
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,239
I told you I couldn't
because I'd lost my phone.

476
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,991
I saved your life. So show some gratitude.

477
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,087
He's doing that in front of me
on purpose, right?

478
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:03,550
What's he up to?
I'm starting to get really worried.

479
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,596
I've got enough to stress over as it is.
This guy…

480
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,350
Hey, listen. Listen.

481
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,104
Why don't we just go get jjajangmyeon
right about now instead?

482
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,816
No way.

483
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,318
It's stir-fried pork day, after all.

484
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,467
Daddy!

485
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,595
Daddy!

486
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,109
Dr. Choi.

487
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,320
Alan. Is this a bad time?

488
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,863
No, don't worry about it.

489
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:08,823
When will you be here?

490
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,659
Will I see you at the Ichida Awards?

491
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:15,997
Ah… Unfortunately I don't think I can go.
I actually have a surgery scheduled.

492
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,081
You do?

493
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,669
I only have one vial left
of the Ceralib-A.

494
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:27,050
-What will you do?
-Well, I'll have to stretch it out.

495
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,927
How bad are your symptoms?

496
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,679
They're all right.

497
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:35,141
I can manage with the patches for now.

498
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,312
It's just a bit worrying.

499
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,858
Okay, I'll let you know
as soon as I'm able to book a flight.

500
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,568
I appreciate it.

501
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,714
You watching a drama?

502
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,008
Yeah.

503
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,010
Is it any good?

504
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,557
Hey, look at this.

505
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,601
I don't want to.

506
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:19,894
Just look!

507
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,355
That's gross!

508
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,241
What?

509
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,535
Dr. Choi's surgery,

510
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,620
is it that hard?

511
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,330
Yeah, it's in an awful spot.

512
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:41,374
But you love that kind of stuff.

513
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,670
I feel for him.
He's not exactly young.

514
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,547
Poor guy.

515
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,134
Everyone dies when they get old.

516
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:53,011
Why do you care?

517
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,263
Ms. Seok, don't--

518
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,237
All right, I see.

519
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,087
Oh, Mr. Kang, good evening.
Mr. Pak, you're out and about too.

520
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,963
-Yeah.
-Coming back from your hunt?

521
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:15,176
We struck out. A big one ran off
this way. Did you see it?

522
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,887
No. If it came around here,
my dogs would've let you know.

523
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,223
That was a big one.

524
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,225
So are you busy these days?

525
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,977
-Why?
-You should hunt wild boars.

526
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:27,355
The reward 300,000 won per head now.

527
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,190
Come show off a bit.

528
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,275
Yeah. I've been thinking about
getting out there soon.

529
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,820
I heard one of them wrecked
Grandma Jinju's ginseng farm.

530
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:35,655
That's not the only placed they trashed.

531
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,033
My family gravesite too.
We might have to move the graves.

532
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,910
-Oh, jeez.
-Good evening.

533
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:44,705
Hey! Long time no see!

534
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,792
Oh, right. You said
you wanted to expand your pharmacy.

535
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,753
-Thought about relocating?
-Do you know of a good location?

536
00:43:50,837 --> 00:43:52,672
Right across the street. Mari's Diner.

537
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:56,551
Her brother won't stop beating her
for money, so she has no choice.

538
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,595
She's selling her restaurant to get him
some cash and be done with it.

539
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,722
Oh, man. That's too bad.

540
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,476
I see you going into Mari's Diner
every day. So now what?

541
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,105
It's not the only restaurant, silly.

542
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,735
FOR LEASE

543
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,447
Ms. Seok, calm down. There are
plenty of other places we can go to eat.

544
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:21,200
MARI'S DINER

545
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:24,245
It's not like you're gonna starve to death
just 'cause the diner's closing.

546
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,498
Why is everyone doing this to me?

547
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,960
That restaurant is mine.

548
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,629
I don't deserve this.
I mean, it's my restaurant!

549
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,756
Stop it already. It's not yours!

550
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,927
I'm gonna murder this guy.

551
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,139
Oh, come on. Not again!

552
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,809
No way. I can't let you do it.

553
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,604
Why do you keep trying to kill people?

554
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,440
Why can't I kill him?
Give me one good reason.

555
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,609
-Well, obviously--
-You know me.

556
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,987
Telling me "Because you're not
supposed to" won't stop me.

557
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,785
You know I actually have exams
this whole week.

558
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,996
-You're done tomorrow.
-Just with Intro to Nursing.

559
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,957
I still have Basic Anatomy
and IV Injection Skills.

560
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,709
So what?

561
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,253
You're busy?

562
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:15,838
Is that it?

563
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,632
Yes.

564
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,803
Okay.

565
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,639
Prioritize your studies.

566
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,808
I'll have to make peace with it.

567
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:29,894
Wait, really?

568
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,897
Welcome.

569
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,778
What can I get you?

570
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,406
- Ah… Two specials, please.
- Coming right up.

571
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,160
- Can we have some more water?
- Of course.

572
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,664
Here you are.

573
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,596
FOR LEASE

574
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,941
Have you thought about it?

575
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,028
About what?

576
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,947
Ah… You know.
Getting drinks with me in Seoul.

577
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,493
I don't know.

578
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,120
Hey.

579
00:47:53,204 --> 00:47:57,708
A tough girl like yourself
gotta be going out with a guy like me.

580
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,044
You see it too.

581
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,962
You and me,

582
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,715
we're meant to be.

583
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,762
Ah… But you're a high class pharmacist,
I get it.

584
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,225
So people are gonna have a lot to say
about the two of us dating, aren't they?

585
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,937
I've already thought
all this through, you know.

586
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,482
No more ankle monitor.

587
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:24,902
That makes things a little easier for us.
Don't you agree?

588
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,908
The monitor's finally off.

589
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,246
I should buy you a drink to celebrate.

590
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,497
How's tomorrow?

591
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:39,417
Um…

592
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,505
Well, then.

593
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,424
I hope it's not raining tomorrow.

594
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,759
I know, right?

595
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,194
BAREUN PHARMACY

596
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:06,712
It's so hot out.

597
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:09,089
You want a drink?

598
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,091
Hmm?

599
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,345
Aw… You didn't have to.

600
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:19,808
So good.

601
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,895
Well, I made it just for you.

602
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,989
- Come on in.
- Hmm? Yeah.

603
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,175
- Bring it in here.
- Okay.

604
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:57,846
Okay.

605
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,973
Man, this is…

606
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:03,018
What were you gonna do
if I wasn't here to help you?

607
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,233
Aw. You're looking kinda tired.

608
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,235
Sit down for a minute.

609
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:14,697
Here.

610
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,160
Hey, take off your jacket. It's dirty.

611
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:48,647
Here.

612
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,742
Be back in a sec.

613
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,826
Mm-hmm…

614
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:37,005
It's okay.

615
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:38,507
It's okay.

616
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,191
Yes, Ms. Seok?

617
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,400
Can you talk?

618
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:42,362
What the heck
are you still doing up so late?

619
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,115
Good question.

620
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,910
What am I still doing up so late?

621
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,245
You didn't.

622
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,998
No. The guy from Mari's Diner?

623
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,251
Yeah. It just happened.

624
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,756
You said you weren't going to kill him.
You'd make peace with it!

625
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,551
I need you to head over there and clean.

626
