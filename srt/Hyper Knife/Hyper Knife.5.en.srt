1
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:18,143
Kiyoung.

2
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,483
Listen, all right?
Now pay attention to what I'm saying.

3
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,656
You see, I want to be on my own
without any burdens.

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,700
I wanna be free.

5
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,205
So don't worry about me, okay?

6
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,041
Focus on your studies.

7
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,716
I believe I'm owed an explanation here.

8
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,561
It was a while back.
You asked me for a pretty unusual favor.

9
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:44,813
Do you recall?

10
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,066
You wanted to buy some land
in the mountains. That's what you said.

11
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,404
Mmm. I do recall.

12
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,326
<i>So I found you a few options,</i>

13
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:01,580
<i>but for some reason, you chose one</i>
<i>that was packed with wild dogs.</i>

14
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:05,667
<i>There were so many of them, in fact,</i>

15
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,087
<i>that even the seller was at his wit's end.</i>

16
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,798
<i>He didn't know what to do.</i>

17
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
So then,

18
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,534
you followed me there?

19
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,623
<i>Well, it was so strange,</i>
<i>I got curious.</i>

20
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,834
<i>I'll admit that I was torn.</i>

21
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,838
<i>But even then, I couldn't bring myself</i>
<i>to call the police.</i>

22
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,968
<i>So the first thing I did</i>
<i>was save his life.</i>

23
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,846
<i>Because I'm not a murderer.</i>

24
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,975
And what if he woke up
and reported it to the authorities?

25
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,019
Things didn't work out that way, did they?

26
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,982
He'd suffered so much brain damage
that he didn't even know his own name.

27
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,956
<i>So I had him admitted to the hospital</i>
<i>under the name of a homeless man I knew.</i>

28
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,752
HANSARANG NURSING HOME

29
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,546
<i>Just think of it this way.</i>

30
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,548
<i>I did you a favor.</i>

31
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,259
<i>Nothing to get upset about,</i>
<i>wouldn't you agree?</i>

32
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,599
<i>Don't worry.</i>

33
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,895
<i>He died three months ago</i>
<i>at the nursing home he was transferred to.</i>

<i>We're the same, you and I.</i>

00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,228

<i>We can see through each other.</i>

00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,891
Do you want them to go extinct?
Enough already.

39
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,684
They're classified as vermin.

40
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,229
I'm just contributing
to the community's safety.

41
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,067
Hey, what's going on with you?
What's the matter?

42
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,945
Just talk to me.
I tell you everything, you know.

43
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,489
What do you want me to tell you?

44
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,199
Are you serious?

45
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,786
You've been hunting boars nonstop
for two days without eating.

46
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,995
What are you doing?

47
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,122
Thought I was a psychopath, remember?

48
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,916
They all kill animals, don't they?

49
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,420
It's obvious you've been sad lately.

50
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,588
Just tell me why.

51
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,926
If all you want to do is stand there
and whine, just beat it!

52
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,469
Get lost!

53
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,648
<i>I want you to know something.</i>

54
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,608
You should've told me
the truth right away.

55
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,738
All because it's like you've always said.
I was pathetic even then!

DONGHAE SUNGSIM HOSPITAL

57
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:44,029
We're doing everything we can.
But given the extent of his injuries…

58
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,489
I imagine it's a tough road ahead.

59
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,502
Why do you keep showing me the same thing?

60
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,672
Do you think anything is gonna change?

61
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,467
I told you, this is what happened.

62
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,554
I'm sorry for making
you come all this way,

63
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,390
but a man died last night.

64
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,852
And the assailant, Kim Kiyoung, is
in a coma so he can't give his statement.

65
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,396
How is Kiyoung the assailant here?

66
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:23,526
Could you tolerate someone who tried
to use your missing father to exploit you?

67
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,320
It's despicable.

68
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:30,700
That guy, he was stringing Kiyoung along
and lying to his face to get the reward.

69
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,331
How many times do I have to say it?

70
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,416
Stop calling. It's getting annoying.

71
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,252
Are you leaving?

72
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,505
Yeah.

73
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,175
Going to the hospital to visit Kiyoung.

74
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,386
Gonna follow me?

75
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,187
Thank you.

76
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,992
Why'd you come here?

77
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,121
You gonna kill Kiyoung too?

MEDICAL CHECKUP CENTER

79
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,961
If he dies, the blood will be
on your hands, not on mine.

80
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,299
He ended up like that 'cause you were
sticking your nose where it didn't belong.

81
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,718
You haven't learned.

82
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,803
That's how I understand it.

83
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,309
The police found some dog hair
on the nurse's clothes.

84
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,357
My hands are getting slower.
Slower by the day.

85
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,447
Sooner or later, you're gonna end up
on the suspect list.

86
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,824
We don't have much time left.

87
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,994
We're in the same boat, aren't we?

88
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,749
To not get caught by the police…

89
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,793
I would have to operate on you.

90
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,212
Is that it?

91
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:13,470
Well, sometimes, the things you have to do
aren't exactly what you want.

92
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,440
I didn't tell anyone Myeongjin was there.

93
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,026
No one else knows the truth.

94
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,905
You don't have to worry about
the police coming after you.

95
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,450
Dr. Choi,

96
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,121
you really used to be
such a great teacher back then.

97
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,964
I really hope we never
see each other again.

103
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,044
I heard that Wanil disappeared.

104
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,339
Mmm.

105
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,843
Now who the hell would have the guts
to touch one of us, huh?

106
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,219
Who kidnapped him then?

107
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,605
- Hello, Mr. Seong.
- Oh, hey.

108
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,481
- Hello, sir.
- Uh-huh.

109
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,192
Anything turn up at Wanil's?

110
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,987
We searched everything, even the fridge.
Didn't find anything unusual.

111
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,575
Okay, then.

112
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,244
Gather all the security footage
from that night.

113
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,580
Trace where he went
when he left the station.

114
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,207
We gotta track him down.

115
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,499
Understood, sir.

116
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,588
Sir, I was wondering,
should I look into Min again?

117
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,758
What are you talking about?
He's off in China.

118
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,511
Detective Lee thought he was still in the
country and he wanted me to look into it.

119
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,265
- When was this?
- He told me the last day he was at work.

120
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,850
While we were eating lunch.

121
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,393
Is this the guy, Min?

122
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,896
Yeah, he's a black market surgery broker.

123
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,232
So it's him? He's the one who got Wanil?

124
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,858
- Hey, rookie.
- Yes?

125
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,152

- Hello, Detective Seong.
- Yeah, hi.

131
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,545
I pulled up the calls he made.

00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,749
Yeah, keep up the good work.

134
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:36,274
Detective Wanil Lee,
the one in charge of this case,

135
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,859
he's nowhere to be found.

136
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,569
And Inspector Yang?

137
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,237
He's nervous as hell.

138
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,032
It wasn't you guys, right?

139
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,744
I was just asking.

140
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,379
There.

141
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,138
This clown is the one who tipped him off.

142
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,432
Don't you think you should
take care of it?

143
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,734
Hmm. Don't worry.

144
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,320
No one knows yet
about your boss's operation.

145
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,072
That's for sure.

146
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,219
A detective going missing for a week?

147
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,554
That's not normal, is it?

148
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,141
No, it isn't.

149
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,313
Is there anything you want to tell me?

150
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,316
Tell you what?

151
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,402
That day, Wanil and you were meeting up.

152
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,613
I got his call log.

153
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,448
You were the last person he called.

154
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:13,788
Really?

155
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,125
<i>We were supposed to meet up,</i>
<i>but I couldn't make it.</i>

156
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,459
<i>I wasn't feeling so well.</i>

157
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,920
<i>Why didn't you mention it to me?</i>

158
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,631
<i>He said he had something to tell me.</i>

159
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,383
<i>And it needed to be private.</i>

160
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,887
I'm a suspect now, is that it?

161
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,972
No, that's not it.

162
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,349
We just gotta investigate it.

163
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,020
Actually, we were getting together
because of you.

164
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,690
He said that you were taking bribes.

165
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,487
Wanil, that crazy bastard.

166
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,535
- Why would he talk to you though?
- I don't know.

167
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,539
I was going to tell you about it
after listening to what he had to say.

168
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:03,921
So then, if I may…

169
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,175
You never met Wanil that night.
Is that right?

170
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:08,968
You mind if I check?

171
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,221
Even if I said I minded,
you would still do it.

172
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,939
One minute.

173
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,245
Yeah.

174
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,080
<i>I'm at Dr. Choi's residence right now.</i>

175
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,749
I've checked the security camera footage

176
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,001
and also just talked to his butler here.

177
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,130
It looks like he went to bed early
immediately after he came home from work.

178
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,924
Yes.

179
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,482
So you're here alone today?

180
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,192
Yeah.

181
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,950
Look at you.
You look like you're on top of the world.

182
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,743
Did your brother leave for good?

183
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:21,123
Yeah. He was always telling everyone he
wanted to go to Seoul, and then he left.

184
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,708
I'm glad to hear he's gone.

185
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,088
By the way,
when will the pharmacy open again?

186
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,383
Oh, next month.

187
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:34,136
I haven't seen Ms. Jeong for a while.
She hasn't even been here to eat.

188
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,680
Is she under the weather?

189
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,516
Yeah, I guess she's been feeling sick.

190
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,769
She doesn't seem to want to eat anything.

191
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,902
<i>The police found some dog hair</i>
<i>on the nurse's clothes.</i>

192
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,821
They found dog hair, you guys.

193
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,910
What are we gonna do? What do you think?

194
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,291
My hands… They're getting
slower and slower by the day.

195
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,934
You aren't out hunting boars tonight?

196
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,479
What are you doing here so late?

197
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,398
Wow, the air's so nice here.

198
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,657
Seo's really worried so that's why
I came over here to check up on you.

199
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,952
Oh, for the love of…

200
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:42,830
What's his deal? He's so annoying.

201
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,374
What has he been babbling about?

202
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,753
He's worried that you're feeling down.

203
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,674
We haven't had any surgeries lately.
You can't deny that.

204
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,891
Things aren't looking good.
So what should we do?

205
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,695
Honestly, at times like this,

206
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,866
I wanna run away and go be locked up.

207
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,327
Locked up? Really?

208
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,080
Yeah, like in a jail.

209
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,459
A jail with only surgery.

210
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,339
I'd wake up every morning
and spend the day in the OR.

211
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,426
And after I was done, I'd have dinner.

212
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,888
Then go to sleep.

213
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,852
Day in, day out, day in.

214
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,106
Nothing but operating.

215
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,237
I'd give anything for that kind of life.

216
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,241
I wouldn't have to do anything else ever.

217
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,996
No worries. I'd have everything I'd need.

218
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:15,131
A life sentence hopefully.

219
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,135
You have to know that Seo and I both
would follow you.

220
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,804
Willingly. Life sentence and all.

221
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,227
However, our reasons for going
would be different.

222
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,063
I would agree to go as a doctor.

223
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,442
That's the road
that I have chosen to follow.

224
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:37,945
And ultimately, you and I
are heading in the same direction.

225
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,908
But Seo, he would go there
just to follow you.

226
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,704
He'd be loyal to the very end.
No questions asked.

227
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,417
Do you see the difference?

228
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,211
That's Seo.

229
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,089
That young man has a kind heart.

230
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,842
He cares for you.

231
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,319
I brought some painkillers,
but I'm not sure if this will be enough.

232
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,071
Did you eat today?

233
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,458
Your clothes are drenched in sweat.

234
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,876
You'd better go change now.

235
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,671
Dr. Jeong, could you hand me
his pajamas back there?

236
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,516
Thanks.

237
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,144
Oh, right. Sorry.

238
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,815
That's Dr. Seok Jeong.
She'll be coming by from time to time.

239
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,117
You ever had a job before?

240
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:14,208
Associate, chief, manager…
Which one do you like?

241
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,296
I think I like manager actually.

242
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,799
Yeah, let's go with that.

243
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,345
You know what I like most about you?

244
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,473
I heard you don't have any parents.

245
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,438
I used to work at a hospital
but now I'm in pharmacy school.

246
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,692
I'll get my own soon.

247
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,360
Some adorable dogs too.

248
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,531
So this big boy, this tumor here…

249
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,743
It's growing from your skull,
and when it gets bigger like yours did,

250
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,162
it gives you a huge lump like that.

251
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,917
The one inside your head right now,
that one's malignant.

252
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:59,211
It's a messed-up one.

253
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,964
I don't want surgery. I told you.

254
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,843
Why? Is it money?

255
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,679
We already said we'd do it for free.

256
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,933
Geez.

257
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,656
Hey.

258
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,369
You're actually tired of living.
Is that it?

259
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,706
You just want to die peacefully
in your bed.

260
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,376
Did I nail it?

261
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,050
But it isn't gonna be all that peaceful.

262
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,887
You haven't felt anything bad yet.

263
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,890
Soon, no amount of painkillers will help.

264
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,643
The lump will only get bigger,

265
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,228
and you'll have all these
splitting headaches every day.

266
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,024
Not to mention the vomiting.

267
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,734
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

268
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,653
So what should I do then?

269
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,077
If you go out like this,

270
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,413
it'll be a slow death,
so you'll be in pain for a long while.

271
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:23,337
Now, if you die during surgery,
it's all over in a second.

272
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:29,134
We put you to sleep,
and then you just don't wake up.

273
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,095
That's it.

274
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,639
Could you imagine?

275
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,641
How easy is that?

276
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:40,104
I mean, you wanted to die peacefully.
It's better this way.

277
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,610
I'll take care of it, okay?

278
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,535
You swore.

279
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,704
You'll take care of it?

280
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,330
Of course.

281
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,375
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

282
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:16,890
Here.

283
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,738
I want my thanks.

284
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,201
Why don't you sing me something?

285
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,631
Where's my song?

286
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,346
Let's hear it.

287
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,807
I'm not kidding.

288
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:01,310
MEDICINE

289
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,907
Hello, there.

290
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,826
We actually haven't reopened just yet.

291
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,288
You alone?

292
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,086
That's good then.

293
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,484
Hey, come out here.
I want you to try this.

294
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,076
Are you still sulking in there?

295
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,329
I said, are you still sulking?

296
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,722
<i>Hello?</i>

297
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,058
Hey, where were you all last night?

298
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,979
<i>I slept at the pharmacy</i>
<i>after I cleaned up. Why?</i>

299
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:28,981
What do you mean, why?

300
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,651
I've got this juice I made for you.

301
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,278
Hurry back here.

302
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,698
<i>You can have it. I'm in class right now.</i>

303
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,410
Wait, you have class today?

304
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,454
<i>Yeah. I got to go.</i>

305
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,791
What the hell?

306
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:14,735
<i>What is it?</i>

307
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,362
Hey, it looks like all the classes
are letting out.

308
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,072
Why aren't you coming down?

309
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,867
<i>You're at the academy? Why?</i>

310
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:24,119
Thought we could get dinner together.

311
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,919
I'm going to the movies
with some friends from class.

312
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,587
<i>Movies?</i>

313
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,632
Yeah, that's right.
We're about to go in now.

314
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,721
I can't talk anymore, okay?

315
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,186
Knowing her, she'll keep calling.

316
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:54,066
You should probably just turn it off.
She can be pretty obsessive about things.

317
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,570
Hey, let's get this over with.

318
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,614
You killed her, right?

319
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,660
- No, I didn't.
- Then who did?

320
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,956
- Was it your boss?
- Ms. Seok is a doctor.

321
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,250
Why would a doctor kill someone?

322
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,836
She's not just a doctor though, is she?

323
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,590
Why are you doing this? It wasn't me.

324
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:22,552
Hey. There were only three of you
there that day,

325
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,721
and my guy said he didn't do it.

326
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,556
So it's got to be one of you two.

327
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,309
You wanna keep stringing me along
like this…

328
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,396
or should I just call your boss myself?

329
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:24,281
- Hello. How are you?
- Can I get a combo, please?

330
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,158
Here you go.

331
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,316
She's here to watch a movie.

332
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,364
When's the last time you've gone out?

333
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,593
We'll need meat, won't we?

334
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,677
I guess so.

335
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:29,846
Get a good cut.

336
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,770
BEEF, 50% OFF

337
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,315
This should be good enough, right?
It's not for people.

338
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,443
- We have more of that.
- No thanks. Not this one.

339
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,279
Korean sirloin, please.

340
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,115
Your best cut.

341
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,617
ULSAN, GEOCHANG, POHANG

342
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,589
This info stays between us.

343
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,259
No one can find out I told you.

344
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,886
If it gets back to Min, he'll kill me.

345
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,597
Don't worry, you're safe with me.

346
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,310
Just give me his number.

347
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,487
Keep your word.

348
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,532
Appreciate it. Go.

349
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,668
Hi. It's Inspector Yang.

350
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,129
Special Investigations Unit.

351
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,715
I'd like to chat for a bit.

352
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,925
Oh, yeah.

353
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,552
I know who you are.

354
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,471
How did you get my number?

355
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,351
Now, why would he do that?

356
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,190
He would never. Absolutely not.

357
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,236
Actually, you can ask yourself.
He's right here.

358
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,322
One moment, please.

359
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,995
This is Deokhee Choi.

360
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,538
<i>Hey, Dr. Choi.</i>

361
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:23,251
Oh, I had heard you left for China.
I guess I was mistaken.

362
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:27,464
Well, to be honest,
that's not really any of your concern.

363
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,635
I just got off the phone
with Dongyeong Yang

364
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,095
from the Special Investigations Unit.

365
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,932
I'm pretty pissed about it, actually.

366
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,769
Why did he call? What did he say exactly?

367
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,897
Did you leak my number, Doctor?

368
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,981
<i>No.</i>

369
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,233
I don't have it.

370
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,109
I never asked for it.

371
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,115
I can't help you unless
you tell me what's going on here.

372
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,368
Why don't you start
with what Yang said to you?

373
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,296
That jackass is basically writing a novel
at this point.

374
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,673
Hmm.

375
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:14,219
Spouting some BS about a huge
black market surgery ring causing trouble.

376
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,472
Now he's saying they murdered a nurse

377
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,350
and kidnapped one of the detectives
or whatever.

378
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,399
He'll let me off the hook
if I tell him everything I know.

379
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:33,488
Mr. Min,
you don't know a thing about it anyway.

380
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,575
You're really doubting me?
I know quite a lot.

381
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,161
Like that Ms. Jeong.

382
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,832
Yeah, I know about your precious student.

383
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,334
<i>You're still looking for that crazy girl.</i>

384
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:52,424
<i>I've agreed to meet with Yang later.</i>
<i>I bet you're a little interested now, huh?</i>

385
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,843
We should meet first.

386
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,178
I'll think about it.

387
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,106
What's going on?

388
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,275
Dr. Choi!

389
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,075
Yang. It's me.

390
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,578
Where are you? Can you meet with me?

391
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,997
I didn't expect you
to call first like this.

392
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,458
No, I can't today, because I'm booked.

393
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,794
<i>Come on, I'll go to you. Where are you?</i>

394
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,590
I really can't. You'd be a third wheel.

395
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,176
<i>Who are you gonna see?</i>
<i>I said I can come to you.</i>

396
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,263
We'll talk later. Bye.

397
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,603
I'm a suspect now, is that it?

398
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,396
Is it?

399
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,029
- Kim, hold on.
- Yes?

400
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,156
Besides the three of us here,

401
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,409
does anyone know we're seeing Min today?

402
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,703
No one else knows, sir.

403
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:06,998
Right.

404
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:14,923
Yeah, sorry I'm late.

405
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,550
I didn't want to show up here
empty-handed, that's all.

406
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,304
It's okay, I just got here myself.

407
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,610
Damn, look at this place.

408
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,446
No one ever comes here besides me anyway.

409
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,324
Kick up your feet. Make yourself at home.

410
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,661
I was already getting tired
of bouncing around motels.

411
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,372
Now I get to live in luxury,
thanks to you.

412
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,667
So when were you planning
on going to China?

413
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,087
Well, I need to find
a ship again and stuff.

414
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:55,880
So we'll see.

415
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,303
Hey.

416
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:07,183
Hmm.

417
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:16,609
To get into med school
with the highest score at 17 years old,

418
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,571
just how high must your IQ be?

419
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,333
Star neurosurgeon at Yeonshin University,
Seok Jeong.

420
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,797
I was shocked
when I found out who she was.

421
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,258
Man, chick's got some real balls on her,

422
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,178
doing black market brain surgery,
you know? Huh?

423
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,893
Hyeonho Han. Know the guy?

424
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:56,733
He's probably busting his ass right now,
trying to clean up after her, huh?

425
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,985
Ah, it's a shame
that he partnered with her.

426
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,988
Guy should have just
worked for me instead.

427
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,579
So what's the plan?

428
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,332
What are you going to do if you meet Yang?

429
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,293
Well, that depends.

430
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,921
I have to see what kind of deal
they're offering, you know?

431
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,882
Nothing about it is set in stone yet.

432
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,135
He says they'll drop
all the charges against me and whatnot,

433
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,721
which sounds nice,
but I can't trust those bastards.

434
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,890
I know the guy pretty well.

435
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,059
His word is worthless.

436
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:33,102
That's the kind of guy he is.

437
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:35,188
So what kind are you?

438
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,398
You a man of your word then?

439
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,029
More often than not.

440
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:48,535
Way things are now, all I gotta do is
point out who did the surgeries,

441
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:51,788
and that'd be enough to put
a stupid little smile on their faces.

442
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,385
Did you do her? That Jeong chick.

443
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,470
Ah, you totally did!

444
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,242
Just kidding. I'm messing with you.

445
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,660
Take a joke.

446
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,877
But seriously, I just don't understand it.

447
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:43,631
Well, if it's not about that,
then what the hell is it, huh?

448
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,176
Why would you do all this
for a girl who tried to kill you?

449
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,602
Oh, here he is.

450
00:39:56,853 --> 00:40:00,106
- Hey, Inspector. You've arrived?
- Yeah. Where are you?

451
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,150
I'm here at the spot.

452
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,278
<i>Ah, geez.</i>
<i>And it must have been a long trip too.</i>

453
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,114
<i>I'm sorry, but something</i>
<i>really urgent just came up.</i>

454
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,241
<i>Stop messing with me.</i>

455
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,577
<i>I know you're around here somewhere.</i>

456
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,120
<i>I really didn't bring anyone.</i>

457
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,710
<i>Well, to be honest,</i>
<i>I brought the rookie on my team with me.</i>

458
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,712
<i>Come on, let's talk in person.</i>

459
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,509
And I do have a lot of info for you,
but I haven't made up my mind yet.

460
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:34,182
I think I'll just piss you off
if I keep talking, so I'm hanging up now.

461
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,767
<i>No, wa-wait, Min. Hold on.</i>

462
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,062
Let me think on it for a while
and then I'll call you back.

463
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,897
- All right, bye.
- <i>No, wa-wait, hold on--</i>

464
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,109
That son of a bitch.

465
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,362
You gotta be kidding me.

466
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,953
Well, I hope…

467
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,914
…that you don't think about it
for too long.

468
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,291
I know, I know.

469
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:03,878
I gotta make a decision soon, don't I?

470
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,422
So, yeah. I'll be in touch.

471
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,134
If that's what you want…

472
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,347
…that's what we'll do.

473
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,569
But seriously, what's your deal
with her, huh?

474
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,740
Is it something that someone like me
just wouldn't get?

475
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,166
I'll just say goodbye here.

476
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,803
Hey, yeah, it's me.

477
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,347
Just wanted to share
the good news with you.

478
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:59,350
I think we can go ahead
and schedule the surgery now.

479
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,980
Of course he's a big shot.
He's at Yeonshin University Hospital.

480
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:06,941
Yeah, you have nothing to worry about.

481
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,944
Top surgeon in the country. That's right.

482
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,133
Hey! What the hell?

483
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:40,767
Yes?

484
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,394
So what?

485
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,648
Where do I need to go?

486
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,530
Please have a seat.

487
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,287
You heard about the nurse
that was killed, right?

488
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,040
You see, it's putting me in a tough spot.

489
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,876
If the authorities start digging around,

490
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,339
soon enough they'll be able to trace it
all back to me and my men.

491
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,675
And we'll take the rap for it.

492
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:59,220
We needed to know what went down so we
could figure out what we're dealing with.

493
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,222
Luckily your friend confessed
to everything

494
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,015
so we got the whole picture from him.

495
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,767
- He said that he killed her?
- So he claims.

496
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,561
But we all know he doesn't have the guts.

497
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,771
So he's gotta be lying through his teeth.

498
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:11,357
Oh? You clearly have some thoughts.

499
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,901
I think I'm tired of dancing around this.

500
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,363
Just say what you've gotta say.

501
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,616
So it was you. I knew it.

502
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:28,499
The thing is, I can take care of myself.

503
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:33,004
This won't cause problems for you,
because I already have it all handled.

504
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,173
So stop being dramatic, will you?

505
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:40,344
You know, I've always been
a great judge of character.

506
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:42,972
Even at first glance, I could tell…

507
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,641
You're something else.

508
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,768
Sanggi, the picture.

509
00:44:58,196 --> 00:44:59,530
Okay. So?

510
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,240
What do you want me to do?

511
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:03,826
You said you won't cause me
any problems, right?

512
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:07,038
So make sure this guy doesn't say
another word to the cops.

513
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:08,831
Ever.

514
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,001
Are we clear?

515
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:36,275
<i>Well, sometimes, the things you</i>
<i>have to do aren't exactly what you want.</i>

516
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,578
Wanna move to the Philippines together?

517
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:52,208
The Philippines? Just like that?

518
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,712
- So, listen. I've been thinking--
- No, stop it. Stop.

519
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,715
I don't want to hear about
what you were thinking.

520
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,470
Hey! Hey, listen to me!

521
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:06,973
Hey!

522
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:09,892
Just hear me out!

523
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:12,812
I don't wanna hear any of your nonsense.
The Philippines, really?

524
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,314
I mean, why not, huh?
We could open a clinic there.

525
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,025
Oh, it's that easy?
Where would we get the funds?

526
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:22,154
The deposit on the house.
And also money from the pharmacy.

527
00:46:22,238 --> 00:46:25,533
- I hear it's affordable there.
- Oh, what is going on with you?

528
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,576
Can you come to your senses, please?

529
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,208
I'm just sick of it here.
I can't stand it.

530
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,669
So, what? You wanna run away?

531
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:38,838
It's not running away.

532
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,674
Let's just pack up and get outta here!

533
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,427
"My house, my dogs, my work, my diner."

534
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,721
You went on and on
about it all being yours.

535
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,890
You even killed someone for that diner,
and now you just wanna go?

536
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,185
You said it! You said
that you'd follow me anywhere I went.

537
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,478
Did I now?

538
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:56,314
I can't just follow you anywhere.

539
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,275
I thought you would. You wouldn't?

540
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,111
What are you talking about?
I can't just go!

541
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,997
FIRE DEPARTMENT
SPECIAL RESCUE TEAM

542
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:45,404
Ms. Jeong. Finally, you're here.

543
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:47,406
- Hey, where were you?
- What happened?

544
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,658
What happened here? What? Wh…

545
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,702
I was patrolling the area
and saw the fire.

546
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,413
I called it in, but luckily
only your shed was burning.

547
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,248
The rest of the house seems fine.

548
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,795
It's not a shed.

549
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,422
It's where I keep my dogs.

550
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:07,426
Ms. Jeong!

551
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,886
It's too dangerous!

552
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,168
<i>Is it done?</i>

553
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,794
Yes, Doctor.

554
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,213
The fire department just came
to put out the fire.

555
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,424
Everything is handled, but…

556
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,345
…I do worry how she'll take it.

557
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,974
<i>Knowing her,</i>
<i>she's not going to let this go.</i>

558
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:39,143
MOBILE
JEONG SEOK

559
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:43,022
She's actually calling me
right now. Sorry.

560
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,323
It's me.

561
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,407
<i>I know.</i>

562
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,870
Is there anything you want to tell me?

563
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,997
<i>There is, actually.</i>

564
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,208
<i>My hands are starting to go.</i>

565
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,585
<i>At this rate, forget operating.</i>

566
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,463
<i>I won't even be able to hold a spoon.</i>

567
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,633
Where are you right now?

568
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,762
I'll head to you.

569
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,438
<i>The eagles found in</i>
<i>the Colorado canyons in the United States</i>

570
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:29,235
<i>are known to peck and push their chicks</i>
<i>out of the nest once they're big enough.</i>

571
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,779
<i>Just before the chicks hit the ground,</i>

572
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:36,408
<i>the parents swoop down and</i>
<i>spread their strong wings to catch them.</i>

573
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:40,746
<i>This is their way of teaching their young</i>
<i>how to fly. It may seem har--</i>

574
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,062
What the hell?

575
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,772
Ms. Seok, what are you doing?

576
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,573
HWANGTOHYEON VILLAGE

577
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,525
Oh, you can't!

578
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,753
Shit.

579
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,662
It doesn't really look like it
was caused by a short circuit, does it?

580
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,047
How did the fire only burn this part here?

581
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:43,387
Ms. Seok said it was the short circuit.
And then she sent the police away.

582
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,598
They could have looked into it.

583
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,560
That's what I said.

584
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,689
I think we might move abroad.

585
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:56,400
Move?

586
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,068
To where?

587
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,612
To the Philippines.

588
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,322
The Philippines? Why there?

589
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,199
I have no idea.

590
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,586
RONDA

591
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,014
Wait, what's this guy doing here?

592
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,737
You didn't spit in it, did you?

593
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,491
Just kidding.

594
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,995
Ah.

595
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,041
Perhaps you should drink your coffee
and be on your way.

596
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:39,002
Dr. Jeong and I have absolutely
nothing at all to say to you, okay?

597
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,216
I'm the victim here. So who do you think
you are speaking to me like that?

598
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,010
Well, we never did anything to you,
so how can that be the case?

599
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:50,264
Ah, it seems you've forgotten.
Though that's not really a surprise.

600
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,434
Do you know how much I had to pay because
you two bailed out on me back then?

601
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,646
We didn't know
it involved organ trafficking.

602
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,899
If we did, you can be sure neither
one of us would've agreed to do it.

603
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,612
You were med school hotshots
who ended up underground.

604
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,074
You should've been prepared
for that kind of stuff from the get-go,

605
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,742
so spare me the sob story.

606
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,789
If I had known you were just a couple
of snobs who didn't know their place,

607
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,833
I wouldn't have hired you.

608
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,713
Glad you're here, Mr. Min.

609
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,966
I was thinking of calling you actually.

610
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,217
This works out.

611
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,889
Are you sick or something?

612
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,809
You look like shit, you know.

613
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,603
I recommend you go get a checkup.

614
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,649
I could say the same thing to you,
Dr. Jeong.

615
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,445
Here.

616
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:48,697
MRI FINDINGS REPORT

617
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:52,242
It's not organ trafficking.

618
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:53,327
It's what you like.

619
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,620
Surgery.

620
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,958
Dr. Han and I? We agreed
we're not gonna work with you again.

621
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,296
- Just open it first, yeah?
- Are you hard of hearing, or what?

622
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,798
Come on, Dr. Jeong. Are you kidding?

623
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,134
I said we're not touching
your filthy work!

624
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:17,434
Dr. Han, how do you even work
with someone like her? Huh?

625
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,953
You might have forgotten this.

626
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,789
You still owe me, you know.

627
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:43,710
Oh.

628
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:45,879
That's right.

629
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:48,799
How much was it?

630
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:52,552
120 million.
And that's with interest. Total.

631
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:54,137
That's my debt.

632
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,724
- We can talk about it later.
- Come on, Doctor, get real.

633
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:59,893
You think I fronted the money
because of you?

634
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,604
I don't really care who used it where.

635
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,941
I lent that money to Dr. Jeong.

636
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,568
Didn't I?

637
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,844
Ugh, I get seasick.

638
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:37,889
On this large ship you'll be just fine.

639
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,560
They wouldn't get a ship that rocks
so hard when they need surgery.

640
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,272
So who's the patient anyway?

641
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,023
Did he tell you anything else?

642
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:49,401
I don't know. He didn't tell me a thing.

643
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,946
Well, I heard
that you can't do this surgery alone.

644
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,823
No, you need two surgeons.

645
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,658
Did they find someone else then?

646
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,744
Min said that he had someone ready to go.

647
00:58:58,827 --> 00:58:59,953
They'll be here soon.

648
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:01,037
Ah.

649
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,832
When's the other surgeon getting here?

650
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,751
I think any second now.

651
00:59:08,587 --> 00:59:10,422
Oh, there he is right there. Yeah.

652
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:58,929
So you already know each other, right?

653
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,098
What's that look?

654
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:04,601
You're upset, aren't you?

655
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:09,940
Yeah.

656
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,192
Maybe I am.
