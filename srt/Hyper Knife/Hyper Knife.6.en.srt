1
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>Seok Jeong?</i>

2
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,268
- She's trouble.
- Why?

3
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,937
She has no money, no home.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,730
Showed up to school with only a backpack.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:22,856
And listen to this.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,692
She came to the entrance ceremony
with a social worker.

7
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,028
I was no different.

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,656
The head of my local community group
brought me.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,535
Yeah, well, everyone was
struggling back then.

10
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,994
Things are way better now.

11
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,040
No one was struggling in my class.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,628
They all drove Mercedes.
Their moms wore mink.

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,839
Well. She's still nothing like you.

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,469
Anyway, she's got some
serious mental health issues. Mmm.

15
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:54,930
What do you mean?

16
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,765
When I first saw her
at the entrance ceremony…

17
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,849
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello.

18
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:01,019
I thought, "She's a smart kid in need,
so I'll try to help out."

19
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,230
She started
becoming very demanding.

20
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,941
Used getting into school
with a top score to her advantage.

21
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,735
The alumni association
gave her a scholarship and grants.

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,488
Her freshman year,
I bought her new clothes each season.

23
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,324
Wasn't that the understanding
you two had when you poached her?

24
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,576
From Daeseo U?

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,246
Well, sure it was.
But she can't have it all.

26
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,041
So if you look at the cross-section,
is it any more clear?

27
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,002
- Yes.
- Seok Jeong. Are you here?

28
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,337
- Uh, what…
- Seok Jeong!

29
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,089
Uh, excuse me. Who are you?

30
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,508
We're in the middle of a class!

31
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:35,137
<i>While I was teaching,</i>
<i>some men burst in looking for her.</i>

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,388
<i>Do you know what she'd done?</i>

33
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,933
<i>The nutcase, she decided</i>
<i>to borrow money from loan sharks.</i>

34
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,061
What's wrong with you?
Get a part-time job if you need money.

35
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,355
I don't have time
for something like that, though.

36
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,774
- Huh?
- I only have time to study.

37
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,235
I wanna learn absolutely everything.

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,698
Here it is. Seok Jeong's
residency application.

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,367
If you wanna know why
I absolutely can't stand that girl,

40
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,036
just read that and you'll understand.

41
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:34,780
Mr. Min.

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,159
What?

43
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,331
No, I'm listening. Please go on.

44
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,515
HYPER KNIFE

45
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,891
All right, for security reasons, I need
you all to hand over your phones, please.

46
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:11,084
Hey, come on.
What's with that scowl on your face?

47
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,211
Are you still pissed off or something?

48
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:15,755
Are you kidding?

49
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:17,966
You couldn't have gotten anyone else?

50
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,092
- Dr. Jeong.
- Ms. Seok.

51
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,887
You had to pick him of all people.
Tell me why!

52
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,348
Will you please just calm down a bit?

53
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,976
It's not like I'm the one who asked
for him, it was the patient.

54
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,770
He said he wouldn't have the surgery

55
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,314
- unless I got him the best surgeon.
- What?

56
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,109
That's Dr. Choi.

57
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:41,156
And you? You're not the lead
on this operation, so simmer down.

58
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,657
Okay?

59
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,144
Whoa! Incredible.

60
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,900
No way. They even have
a portable CAT scan.

61
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,737
You still don't know
who the patient is, do you?

62
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,282
No idea, but I'm guessing he's loaded.

63
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:49,784
Why?

64
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,622
No reason.
We should start prepping things.

65
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,471
This is the first time I've ever seen
Ms. Seok not be the lead surgeon.

66
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,430
I'm worried.

67
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,683
There is no reason to worry.
Dr. Choi is excellent.

68
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,937
I know he's really good.
He was Ms. Seok's professor.

69
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,107
I'm not worried about him.
She's the one I'm scared about.

70
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,318
She might flip out on him.

71
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,490
- Dr. Jeong still holds a grudge?
- You have no idea.

72
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,951
She's just…

73
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,348
RONDA

74
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,888
Oh.

75
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,685
Let's go.

76
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,895
Yeah.

77
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,893
Min told you, right?

78
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,187
That I'm the lead surgeon?

79
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,857
You can enter
through the sinus endoscopically.

80
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,864
Why did you come here?

81
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,493
It's not like you need
the money or anything.

82
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,580
Given how full of yourself
you are these days,

83
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,248
I was a little curious.

84
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,795
I thought I might as well see it
firsthand, your criminal lifestyle.

85
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,218
What are you talking about?

86
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,638
Are you still angry about the dogs?

87
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,100
I told you the authorities were onto you.

88
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:04,104
That was a careless mistake you made.
That's why I took care of your mess.

89
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:05,855
So be grateful.

90
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,863
I could've hidden them all away
somewhere, you know.

91
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,618
But you burned them alive.

92
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,455
It was just a few dogs.

93
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,834
Get over it.

94
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,727
Ms. Seok! Ms. Seok!

95
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,896
Ms. Seok!

96
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,818
Let go!

97
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,570
- Dr. Jeong! Please stop!
- Let go!

98
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,823
- Please stop!
- Let go!

99
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,868
Dr. Choi, are you all right?

100
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,498
Dr. Choi.

101
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,916
My goodness.

102
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,422
Are you okay?

103
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,639
Ms. Seok.

104
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,766
Ms. Seok!

105
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,730
You can't beat him up. The man has cancer.

106
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,569
Come on. Let's just talk about it, okay?

107
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,454
Ms. Seok.

108
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,581
Ms. Seok!

109
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,629
Come on,
will you please just open the door?

110
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,797
I'm really worried about you!

111
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,640
Ms. Seok. Why don't you
just come out here and talk?

112
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,018
What the hell is going on? Huh?
Did she beat up Choi?

113
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,895
No, she didn't really exactly…

114
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,522
Yeah, she sure did.

115
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,901
The guy's doing surgery tomorrow.
Why's she beating him up?

116
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,236
How should I know?

117
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,363
I didn't think she should've.

118
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,157
Jeong.

119
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,117
Jeong, open the door.

120
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,285
Hey, Jeong!

121
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,996
Ah, shit.

122
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,543
Hey. You need to keep her
under control, huh?

123
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,631
If she botches this operation,
then no one's getting off this ship alive.

124
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,591
All of us will be finished.

125
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,011
Who are we operating on? Some criminal?

126
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,056
If only it were that simple.

127
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,225
If not that, then who?

128
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,272
God.

129
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,540
I don't get why someone like you
is willing to work with Seok Jeong.

130
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,334
Look at what she did here, huh?

131
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,045
She clearly has severe mental issues.

132
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,298
I've never thought of her
as being unstable.

133
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:22,093
That's only because
you don't really know her.

134
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
You could be the grown-up
in this situation.

135
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,139
Stop bullying her and leave her alone.

136
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,850
Hey, I was just assaulted.

137
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,184
But I should stop bullying her?

138
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,857
I showed a friend your CT scans.

139
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,984
Seongtae Kwak at Daeseo Hospital.

140
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,611
I told him it was my cousin
and needed his help.

141
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,031
I never asked you to do that.

142
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,907
You should let Dr. Kwak operate on you.

143
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,452
He's more than capable of doing the job.

144
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,205
Seongtae Kwak.
I've heard of him. He's not bad.

145
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,499
But the best? That he isn't.

146
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,461
- Is Dr. Jeong truly the best?
- I made her that way.

147
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,589
So, yes. I instructed her. I trained her.

148
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:03,342
Every skill she displays
in the operating room,

149
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:07,680
all of it, every bit of knowledge
in her head, came from me.

150
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,350
And I'm bullying her? I'm not, actually.

151
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,353
She owes me everything
and insists on not repaying me.

152
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,564
The people that you teach
don't owe you anything.

153
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:30,578
You know what?
I'd like to get some rest now.

154
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,183
<i>Look at it.</i>
<i>This thing is a ticking time bomb.</i>

155
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,352
You should page Dr. Choi.

156
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,771
Actually, Dr. Choi's taking time off.

157
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,607
Is he? Who'll do it? Should I?

158
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,862
- I'll do it.
- Very good, then.

159
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,202
Choi is taking time off? What's going on?

160
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,454
It's personal. That's all anyone knows.

161
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,874
Wait, what kind of personal reasons
could he have?

162
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,960
It's not like he has a family
to take care of.

163
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,211
No idea.

164
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,588
- If you don't know, who does?
- Why do you care?

165
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,016
- Oh, yes. There you are!
- Hi!

166
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,769
- Good to see you! You're finally here!
- Oh, good to see you too!

167
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,941
Alan Kim, if I'm not mistaken?

168
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,945
Yeah.

169
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,708
- For you.
- Oh.

170
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,627
If there's anything you need
or somewhere you want to go,

171
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:05,047
please reach out to me or Mr. Kim.
He's the butler here and happy to help.

172
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,635
So, uh, can I speak to Dr. Choi directly
or is that not possible?

173
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,097
Unfortunately, he can't answer his phone
where he is right now.

174
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:16,058
He told me to tell you,
"I'm sorry I can't greet you.

175
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,187
No need to be polite. My home is yours."

176
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,663
Ugh, that little…

177
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,767
Hey there, Dr. Jeong,
did you get something to eat? Huh?

178
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,414
Yeah, so, um, he's, uh…

179
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,375
Yeah, yeah. Good luck.

180
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,925
Hello, sir. I'm Deokhee Choi.

181
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,718
Oh, Dr. Choi.

182
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,846
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

183
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,265
Wait. What happened to your face?

184
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,935
It's nothing. A dispute, that's all.

185
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,772
Oh, you're still throwing punches
at your age?

186
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,315
Guess you're young at heart, huh?

187
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,900
Oh, have some.

188
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,653
As you know, the patient can't eat,
but the doctor should.

189
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,737
Right.

190
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,829
Hey, c-can I have one sip? M-m-maybe?

191
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:17,221
The surgery is this evening, right?

192
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,931
Yes.

193
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,892
It could be the very last day I get

194
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,894
to spend among the living, I guess.

195
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:29,734
I might die in the OR.
Could be that's how it ends.

196
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,865
That view.
I should enjoy it while I can.

197
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,869
Save my life. You have no choice.

198
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,953
Got it?

199
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,455
You're gonna live forever anyway.

200
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,334
You've got no reason to worry.

201
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,377
Well, that's what
all my followers believe.

202
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:51,505
That's why I can't even go
to the hospital when I have cancer,

203
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,883
and I'm doing this with you
in the middle of the ocean.

204
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,596
Looking back on it all,

205
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,891
I believe I've had a pretty good life,
doing whatever I wanted.

206
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,519
But now that death has
caught up to me, maybe not.

207
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,649
Do you believe in God?

208
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,359
Not really.

209
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:15,071
Someone at your age,
you gotta believe in something, you know?

210
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:20,493
Well, you could always join us.
Never too late.

211
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:34,965
Miss Seok. Hot stuff fresh from the oven.

212
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,595
Mmm! It smells so good.
Wanna split this one?

213
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,013
No, you can have it all.

214
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,725
Have you seen Dr. Choi anywhere?

215
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,435
No, I haven't. Why?

216
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,689
I was just wondering how he was doing.

217
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,858
If he was okay.
Those injuries looked like they hurt.

218
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,156
Well, sorry. I don't really
feel like talking about that.

219
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,621
All right. We can talk about it
at a later time if you want to.

220
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,001
Ah, I'm good, I'm good.

221
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,715
You know, you shouldn't
have beaten him up like that.

222
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,342
The man is your teacher after all. Right?

223
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,512
You totally messed up his face.
What are you going to do, huh?

224
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,933
I heard that the surgery starts at night.
Why are we doing it so late?

225
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,185
Because night is when
our patient wants it done.

226
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,772
That forces us
to stay up til morning though.

227
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,358
Well, that's what the client
wants us to do, okay?

228
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,944
He wants to feel like he's going to sleep
when you put him under.

229
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,488
He's the one in charge
so take it up with him.

230
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,074
Pretty demanding
for a guy getting black market surgery.

231
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,287
It's not like we have a choice.
We have to honor his wishes. Don't we?

232
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,790
Hey, Han, tell me. Am I wrong here?

233
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,129
Thanks for the assist.

234
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,301
All right, you should all eat something

235
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,471
and rest up while you still can, okay?

236
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,514
I'll call you
when it's time for the surgery.

237
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:08,684
Enjoy.

238
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,186
- Yongryeol.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,818
Since when has he ever
cared about the patient's wishes?

240
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,738
When Euntae Kim is the patient, he does.

241
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,868
- Euntae Kim?
- The cult leader?

242
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,629
Ah, shit.

243
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,888
It's incredible.
How the heck can he afford this?

244
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,307
His cult has over 200,000 followers.

245
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,062
That's a lot of weirdos. Who knew?

246
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,690
Min really screwed us over.

247
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,110
Okay, look, I'm really worried here.

248
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,987
This is my first time assisting,

249
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,949
and I feel like if I mess up,
they'll literally kill me.

250
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,033
It's all right.

251
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,536
Just remember what you learned
in class, okay? Hmm?

252
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,164
Dr. Han, can we talk for a minute?

253
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,137
It's Dr. Choi.
He's having trouble with his hands.

254
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,139
I thought I should let you know.

255
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,519
Oh, yeah.

256
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,312
I've got the endoscopy to handle.

257
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,275
So I need you to do me a favor.
Keep an eye on him.

258
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,111
It's bound to be an issue
during the surgery.

259
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,655
But if it was that bad,
he would've said something.

260
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,657
He would have stepped away
from doing the procedure.

261
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,075
With an ego like his?

262
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,786
He only ever cares about himself.

263
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,798
Why are you headed there at this hour?

264
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,176
It's supposed to be
a great eel restaurant.

265
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,720
I'm meeting someone for a drink.

266
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,265
I think that place closed down
a while ago.

267
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,975
Did they reopen?

268
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,267
He was right.

269
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,119
<i>What was he doing</i>
<i>all the way out there?</i>

270
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,123
What we've gathered so far is that he was
gonna meet someone but we don't know who.

271
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,875
He's been missing
for two weeks now,

272
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,377
and there's still no sign of him.

273
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,087
What are you going to do, huh?

274
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,215
Are you going to sit around
until his body turns up?

275
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,468
A fellow officer has gone missing
in the middle of a case!

276
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,678
What's your plan here?

277
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,929
Well, we have one theory.

278
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,181
Lee had discovered
something important,

279
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:38,227
and the culprit kidnapped him to stop him
and slow the investigation, I think.

280
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,187
- Maybe.
- I agree with that theory.

281
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,563
Then find them already.

282
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:44,233
It sounds like you don't have
any leads yet.

283
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,235
Are you that incompetent?

284
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,364
- No, sir. I'll find Min.
- You said you lost him.

285
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,493
If you can't handle this, let Seong
take over and get the fuck off the case.

286
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,248
Just give me a week, please.

287
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,379
- Thank you, sir.
- All right.

288
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,881
See you later.

289
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,094
See you later, Boss.

290
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,063
Mr. Pyo,
we're Special Investigations Unit.

291
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,266
Let's get you in the operating room.

292
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,811
All right.

293
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,350
This way, please.

294
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,283
This is the anesthesiologist,
Dr. Hyeonho Han.

295
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:43,996
And this young lady is Dr. Choi's
finest student, Dr. Seok Jeong.

296
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,665
Hey, I knew it was a lady doctor.

297
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,251
What I didn't know was
that she was just a kid.

298
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,170
Aw.

299
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,506
I knew you had to be old,

300
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,092
but I didn't know you were this old.

301
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,387
You look like you're over a hundred.
Are you sure you want to do this?

302
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,764
The kid's got some nerve.

303
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,726
- And I'm tired too, Grandpa.
- I don't care.

304
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,771
What are you going to do in my head?
Explain it to me.

305
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,732
- Well, Dr. Jeong and I are going to--
- No.

306
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,233
Choi, not you.

307
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,319
You.

308
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,994
- This is your brain here.
- Mmm.

309
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,621
This is your tumor.

310
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,039
- You see it?
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,499
Given its shape,
it's very difficult to remove.

312
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,793
So Dr. Choi will approach it from up here,

313
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:34,963
and I'll access it endoscopically
through your sinus here.

314
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,007
In other words,
we're removing it from both sides.

315
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,635
- Mm-hmm.
- But based on what we see here,

316
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,095
there's a very strong chance
the tumor has hardened.

317
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,474
So we're gonna remove it
by breaking it up.

318
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,769
Are you getting all that?

319
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,229
Mmm. Mmm.

320
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,244
What?

321
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,542
During surgery,
if you think you can't finish…

322
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,170
I don't think that'll happen.

323
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,255
Your hands are shaky.

324
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,094
We can switch positions
if something happens in there, okay?

325
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,054
So don't be a stubborn old man.

326
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,808
I'm getting changed.

327
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:29,685
You gonna watch?

328
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,389
That's not enough.
You need to remove more.

329
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,307
Well, that's what you think.

330
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,311
If you've got a problem with
what I'm thinking, then let me rephrase.

331
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:15,647
Do as you're told. Remove more.

332
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,698
Yes, that's better.

333
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,330
I'll be assisting you today, Dr. Choi.

334
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,041
Okay, let's go.

335
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:11,787
Inguk Pyo, please be advised
that this interview is being recorded.

336
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,673
Should I call you Captain or something?
You own at least ten boats.

337
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,469
Money's not an issue for you,

338
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:31,765
so why'd you get into smuggling instead
of just fishing for squids or something?

339
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,022
The organ trafficker Hyeonju Min.

340
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,733
Smuggling him into China.
That's what you were trying to do.

341
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,277
I have no idea who this Min guy is,

342
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,988
and I've never done that.

343
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:51,076
Your navigator told us
it was your idea to call it off.

344
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,745
You learned that day
the coast guard was on patrol.

345
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,082
I thought we had an understanding here.

346
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,292
I'm the one who gave you Min's number.

347
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,261
Yes, you did,

348
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:12,472
- and now he's off the grid again.
- What do you expect me to do?

349
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,185
A detective is missing right now.

350
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,021
Please believe we take this seriously.

351
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,898
Tell me where he is.

352
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:29,698
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

353
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,784
Funny, I've been meaning
to give you a call actually.

354
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,787
How's it going?

355
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,038
Oh, you know.

356
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,750
I have been feeling kinda stuck,
like life was one big fog,

357
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,377
but things turn around, yeah?

358
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,131
Found a few new scores,
new connections too.

359
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,300
MIN

360
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,968
<i>Hello? Inguk?</i>

361
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,095
Min, it's Yang here.

362
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,643
Ah, Inspector Yang, huh?

363
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,063
Hey… …sorry,
can't really talk right now.

364
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,440
Got a few things cooking.

365
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,778
If you hang up on me, I'm gonna assume
you killed Detective Wanil Lee.

366
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,559
Do you wanna switch positions?

367
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,107
Just keep doing what you're doing.

368
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,466
Through-cut forceps.

369
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,652
Will you focus?

370
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,663
What's on your mind?

371
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,167
Nothing's on my mind, Doctor.
Just keep working.

372
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:51,339
As I recall, your
first operation as a lead surgeon was--

373
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,549
Absolutely perfect.

374
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,260
Oh, is that how you remember it?

375
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,347
You're so self-absorbed.
That's why no one likes you.

376
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,934
Dr. Han, let me ask you.
What do you think her problem is?

377
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,730
I have to say, I've never heard you
talk so much, Dr. Choi.

378
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:12,402
She's dangerously impulsive,
completely selfish,

379
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,155
and ungrateful as well.

380
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,242
And who exactly
am I supposed to be grateful to?

381
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,661
So, you're not grateful to me at all.

382
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,497
I'm grateful to you.

383
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:31,004
You didn't know that, did you? Hmm?

384
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,758
Those times when we worked together were

385
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,510
the most exciting and fulfilling
moments of my life.

386
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,180
So of course I'm grateful to you.

387
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:43,558
Very much so. I hope you believe that.

388
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,563
I never realized
that teaching could be so exciting,

389
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,024
until you came along.

390
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,611
I didn't even think it was possible.

391
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,496
Ah, I see it.

392
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,837
That you?

393
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,904
Why are you here?

394
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,113
You should go rest.

395
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,493
You seem to be in a good mood.

396
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,872
Hmm, first time in a while.

397
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,466
If you have something to say, just say it.

398
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,552
It's no secret you hate me.

399
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,597
I don't hate you.

400
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,266
It's the other way around.

401
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,361
Back then…

402
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,031
working with you at the hospital…

403
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:48,576
I felt the same way.

404
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,080
It was the happiest time in my life.

405
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,585
I really loved working there.

406
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,254
More than anything.

407
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,884
But thinking back on all those days now…

408
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,221
it feels like torture.

409
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:13,893
All of it's in the past. It's a bit sad.

410
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,773
I know.

411
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,033
This was it.

412
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,036
Our last surgery together.

413
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,998
I'm right about that, aren't I?

414
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:41,337
If you're saying it's the last one,
then maybe it really is.

415
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,896
Thank you for everything.

416
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,489
Good to see you, Dr. Ha.

417
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,657
- Hi.
- Oh.

418
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,117
I thought Dr. Choi might be sick.

419
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:56,079
Sorry, but he's actually
out of town for a few days.

420
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,331
Oh, really?

421
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,417
While you're here,
why don't you have a cup of tea?

422
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:03,127
Sure, thank you.

423
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,779
So, you work with Dr. Choi
at Yeonshin University.

424
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,074
How did I not know about this?

425
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:35,827
Mmm.

426
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,663
So, Dr. Jeong, you know her as well?

427
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,124
Yeah, I do. How do you know Seok?

428
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:45,378
Well, there's this thing I was planning
on doing, and I wanna do it with her.

429
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,296
Do what with her exactly?

430
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,340
A challenge.

431
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,592
Brainstem glioma case I have.

432
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,971
The tumor has grown.
We can't operate due to that.

433
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,390
Therefore, this whole section…

434
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:04,814
This whole section, from here to
over here, is the area we're cutting out.

435
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,816
- It's tricky.
- Hmm.

436
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,038
Hold on.

437
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,056
Dr. Han is gonna stick around to observe?

438
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,224
One of us has to stay here.

439
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,772
Yeah, but it doesn't feel right
to leave him behind on this ship.

440
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,046
- I feel bad leaving you here all alone.
- It's all right.

441
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,049
You did well. Good work, Doctor.

442
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,552
- See you later, then.
- Okay.

443
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,012
Man, there's so much to do.
I'm all over the place.

444
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,223
Han, I'll see you next week, then. Yeah?

445
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,058
- See you later, Boss.
- Yeah, see ya.

446
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,019
Dr. Choi isn't here?

447
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,272
Oh, he already left.

448
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,857
Yeah, he's long gone.

449
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,108
Let's go, hmm?

450
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,236
Come on! I made a reservation.

451
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,320
Can't be late.

452
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,080
Ah, hi, Dr. Choi.

453
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,457
Well… …sorry
we didn't even get a chance

454
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,960
to say a proper goodbye, yeah?

455
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,588
You know, you really helped me out
a lot back there.

456
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,881
I wanted to thank you.

457
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,799
Yeah, we should.

458
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,385
I'll take you out
for a night on the town then, on me.

459
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,553
Yeah.

460
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,346
<i>All right.</i>

461
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,849
Doctor, do you know Hoirangak
at Sinpo Market?

462
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,350
We're all having dinner there later.

463
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,602
- Why don't you join us?
- No, no.

464
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,395
You must be exhausted. You should rest.

465
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,856
Next time we get together,
I'll be sure to invite you.

466
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,774
All right, bye.

467
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,619
So, what did Min say?

468
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,538
He's going to use Seok Jeong
as leverage, you know?

469
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,541
He'll force you to perform surgery.

470
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,628
Are you okay with that?

471
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,839
Do you mind a slight detour?

472
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,960
<i>Dear Dr. Jinu Song.</i>

473
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,297
<i>I hope this is all just</i>
<i>a misunderstanding,</i>

474
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,633
<i>but I've heard that you strongly opposed</i>
<i>my residency</i>

475
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,301
<i>in the neurosurgery department.</i>

476
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,722
<i>You've hated me</i>
<i>for a long time now, haven't you?</i>

477
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,392
<i>I'd like to think</i>
<i>you're not so petty a person</i>

478
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,477
<i>that you can't admit to feeling that way.</i>

479
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,522
<i>You wanna know why I'm bringing this up?</i>

480
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,440
<i>To make it clear to you that I know.</i>

481
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,150
<i>I know you don't like me.</i>

482
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,447
<i>Neurosurgery has always been</i>
<i>my only option.</i>

483
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:27,326
<i>I have to become a neurosurgeon,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

484
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,746
<i>You may not understand</i>
<i>how important it is to me,</i>

485
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,748
<i>or why I've dedicated my life to it,</i>

486
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,086
<i>but here's the reason why I'm applying</i>
<i>for a residency in neurosurgery.</i>

487
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,171
Sir, can you wake up?

488
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,340
Sir, are you all right?

489
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,010
Doctor!

490
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:50,016
- All right, ready?
- One, two, three!

491
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,518
- All right.
- All right. Okay…

492
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,105
<i>Ever since I was little,</i>
<i>my mind would never stop racing.</i>

493
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,524
<i>I was constantly thinking,</i>

494
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,776
<i>and that kept me from doing</i>
<i>anything at all.</i>

495
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,323
<i>I couldn't eat or sleep,</i>
<i>all because of my mind.</i>

496
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,283
<i>It just wouldn't stop.</i>

497
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,495
<i>No matter what I did or how hard I tried,</i>

498
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,498
<i>I couldn't get away</i>
<i>from all the thoughts in my head.</i>

499
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,251
<i>Every minute of every hour was like that,</i>

500
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,588
<i>and before I knew it,</i>
<i>the days would be over.</i>

501
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,509
<i>It felt like there were</i>
<i>these tiny explosions.</i>

502
00:47:26,344 --> 00:47:28,596
<i>They were going off</i>
<i>in my brain every moment.</i>

503
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:31,349
<i>I enjoyed the feeling,</i>

504
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,226
<i>but it was actually painful.</i>

505
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:39,315
<i>My teachers would say I was very bright,</i>
<i>but also overly distracted.</i>

506
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,652
<i>I thought that was unfair,</i>
<i>because it wasn't my fault.</i>

507
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,573
<i>I was convinced there was</i>
<i>a tiny worm living inside my brain.</i>

508
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,034
<i>This worm was very busy,</i>

509
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,454
<i>crawling through all the wrinkles</i>
<i>and folds of my brain,</i>

510
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,373
<i>poking around,</i>

511
00:47:55,456 --> 00:47:56,624
<i>making me think.</i>

512
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,877
<i>That's why I had headaches,</i>

513
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,130
<i>why I couldn't sleep at night,</i>
<i>why I couldn't focus on anything.</i>

514
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:09,387
<i>I wished I could slice open my head</i>
<i>and catch that worm in my brain.</i>

515
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:14,850
<i>But that was impossible.</i>

516
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,020
<i>Of course, there was nothing I could do.</i>

517
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,190
FIGHTING FOR LIFE…
PROTEST AGAINST REGIME…

518
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,462
<i>I knew it was a ridiculous idea</i>
<i>to begin with.</i>

519
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:48,968
<i>As you know yourself,</i>
<i>the human brain isn't meant to be opened.</i>

520
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,848
<i>In the end, I never got to</i>
<i>open up my own head.</i>

521
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,439
<i>But when I walked into the operating room</i>
<i>for the very first time,</i>

522
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,859
<i>I finally saw a live human brain.</i>

523
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,112
<i>When they removed the dura mater</i>

524
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,323
<i>and revealed everything</i>
<i>that was hidden underneath it,</i>

525
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,745
<i>I felt the artistry of whoever it was</i>
<i>who had designed that maze.</i>

526
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:22,877
<i>It was an intricately woven maze</i>
<i>of winding paths,</i>

527
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,714
<i>so delicate, yet at the same time,</i>
<i>incredibly detailed.</i>

528
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,888
<i>Right then,</i>
<i>my mind finally stopped racing,</i>

529
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,558
<i>and for the first time,</i>
<i>I wasn't distracted.</i>

530
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:43,522
<i>In the operating room,</i>
<i>I was stepping into uncharted territory,</i>

531
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,984
<i>areas that no other human</i>
<i>had ever explored.</i>

532
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:54,033
<i>I was the only one in the whole world</i>
<i>who had come to see this brain,</i>

533
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:55,868
<i>this maze,</i>

534
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,995
<i>this universe.</i>

535
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:38,702
Wow, I'm just walking on air today,
you know?

536
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,081
Seo, my man, you did good, huh?

537
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:44,416
The three of us make a good team.

538
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,544
Team? Sure.

539
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:47,795
Ah, come on.

540
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,757
We're in the same boat now, so we gotta
stick together till the end, okay?

541
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,717
We even got Dr. Choi on board.

542
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,470
Gotta milk him
for everything he's worth, am I right?

543
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,890
Hey, Jeong,
I know you must be starving, huh?

544
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,100
Yeah, we're almost there.

545
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:02,184
Come on, yeah.

546
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:08,440
<i>You know, if I put my mind to it,</i>
<i>I can very easily take you down.</i>

547
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:10,943
What are my options then?

548
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,654
<i>What can I do</i>
<i>to make you feel better, Inspector?</i>

549
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:16,865
<i>Tell me what you know.</i>

550
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,579
What if I gave you the surgeon?

551
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,248
Would that be enough for you?

552
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,921
What's wrong?

553
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,798
Ugh, bad headache.

554
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,010
Can you go get me some painkillers?

555
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,429
I'll be right back. Hang on.

556
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,260
Ah, shit.

557
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,679
Where'd she go?

558
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,598
- Mr. Min.
- Holy…

559
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:24,933
Hey, I was looking for you just now.
Where were you?

560
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:28,062
Before we sit down,
I wanted to have a little talk.

561
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,813
Let's go somewhere quiet.

562
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,443
Wait, uh, can't…
Can't we just talk over dinner?

563
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:37,738
And hang on. Where did Seo go?

564
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,114
Where are you taking me?

565
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:42,701
Anywhere the two of us can be alone.

566
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,287
Yeah?

567
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:46,538
<i>It's me, Uyeong.</i>

568
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,248
Why are you calling?

569
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,335
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>Are you with Dr. Choi right now?</i>

570
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,337
It's none of your business.

571
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,924
If you are, tell him to answer the phone.

572
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,677
<i>Maybe he doesn't want</i>
<i>to talk to you. I have to go.</i>

573
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,888
- Do you even know how sick he is?
- Yeah, brainstem glioma.

574
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,723
<i>You don't know.</i>

575
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:07,017
What? Just quit being
so annoying and spit it out!

576
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:09,645
He doesn't have much time left.

577
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:24,493
<i>He's going to die soon.</i>
<i>So tell him to come to the hospital now.</i>
