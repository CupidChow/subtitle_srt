1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,096
It was around February
a couple of years back.

2
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,183
There was a call about a homicide.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,811
It took place in one of the rooms
at a motel in Sillim-dong.

4
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:26,526
When I got to the scene,
Inspector Yang was already standing there.

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,283
I definitely saw him pick up something
that looked like a lighter,

6
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,828
but he hid it as soon as he saw me.

7
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:44,211
I checked the evidence log later,
but there was no lighter.

8
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:50,008
<i>That's when I got suspicious.</i>

9
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,136
<i>So I started looking into him.</i>

10
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:57,224
<i>Dongyeong Yang, it turns out,</i>

11
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:01,853
<i>had been destroying key evidence</i>
<i>in multiple cases.</i>

12
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>He also blackmailed suspects,</i>
<i>shaking them down for money…</i>

13
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:08,819
ALL RECORDINGS

14
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,821
<i>…in exchange for his silence.</i>

15
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,365
Could you get any more corrupt than that,
Inspector Yang?

16
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,702
That testimony is worthless.
You drugged him to get it.

17
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,121
I'd need solid evidence, of course.

18
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,299
I know an agency
that has good investigators.

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,677
I asked them to look into the cases
that Lee mentioned,

20
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,054
and they confirmed everything.

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,098
Tell me,

22
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,519
did you really not know
that Min and I were working together?

23
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,939
Weren't you focused on him
'cause you knew?

24
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,318
Min was working with another surgeon.
Seok Jeong, wasn't it?

25
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,822
Why would you do it?

26
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,577
Working where I do, that hospital,
it's monotonous.

27
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,040
In all honesty, I was afraid
I would get stuck there for life.

28
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,959
However, Min helped me out.

29
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:11,214
He found me cases that were stimulating.

30
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:12,382
It was perfect.

31
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:18,055
You know, if I hadn't killed that nurse
at Gwanggyo Temple…

32
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,142
things wouldn't have escalated this far.

33
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,646
Wow.

34
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,735
So, what now?

35
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,363
What do you want?

36
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,541
You're gonna keep investigating.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,920
Then you catch me.

38
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:06,061
HYPER KNIFE

39
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,984
I'm afraid Dr. Choi won't be
joining us tonight.

40
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,152
He won't?

41
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,488
Why?

42
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,199
Does he think he's too good
for a place like this?

43
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,202
Well, that's not it exactly.

44
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:26,331
He's been planning this for a while,
down to the very last detail.

45
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,708
Everything from the timing,
to the location,

46
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,962
and, of course,
choosing who will be involved.

47
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,051
Tell him he'd better just get down here
right now if he wants to live.

48
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,553
I'll take care of everything.

49
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,264
You can't perform the surgery here
with this equipment

50
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,392
- or with these people either.
- You can think that all you want.

51
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,478
Anyone else couldn't,
but that's exactly why I'm doing it.

52
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,535
Ceralib-A. He's self-medicating.
This completely screws things up.

53
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,289
Ceralib-A could cause
unknown complications during the procedure

54
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,374
that we just have no way to predict.

55
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,751
You're ill-equipped here.
You can't handle it.

56
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,253
For how long?

57
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,130
When did he start taking this?

58
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,048
Last year.

59
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,594
After he was diagnosed at my hospital,
that's when he started.

60
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,304
You should have told him no!

61
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,558
Come on, really?
You know how stubborn he is.

62
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,730
HANUL SUNGSIM HOSPITAL

63
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,482
What was he thinking?

64
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,900
Is he insane?

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,401
Damn it.

66
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,530
I'm gonna go see Dr. Choi.

67
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,990
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

68
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,366
You stay here!

69
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,175
You're gonna keep investigating.

70
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,260
Then you catch me.

71
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,100
SERGEANT KIM WONPYO

72
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,061
SPEAKER

73
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,730
What?

74
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,316
<i>You asked me to call you</i>
<i>in two hours, Inspector.</i>

75
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,734
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

76
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,280
No, no, no. Nothing's wrong.

77
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,699
I'm returning to the station now.

78
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,087
Dr. Han,
is Ceralib-A really that dangerous?

79
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,841
It's a painkiller designed for
terminal cancer patients.

80
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,927
It's effective,
but it has a lot of severe side effects.

81
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,429
Our biggest concern is
we'll have to figure out

82
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,431
how to keep him under anesthesia.

83
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,183
It makes things difficult.

84
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,810
You're kidding.

85
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,397
How could he do this to Ms. Seok?
What's wrong with him?

86
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,568
The thing is, manufacturing was halted
because of all the side effects.

87
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,196
- How did he even get it?
- Who cares about that?

88
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,906
Now that I think about it,

89
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,451
he was surprisingly healthy on the ship
for someone with cancer.

90
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,162
He performed surgery and everything.

91
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:15,417
I guess that the Ceralib-A
got Dr. Choi through it

92
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,211
in spite of his condition.

93
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,261
Excuse me. You have a moment?

94
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,568
<i>I understand that Dr. Choi</i>
<i>has devised his own plan of action.</i>

95
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,030
I get it,
but what exactly is the plan here?

96
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:49,326
Dr. Jeong and I will operate on him
a month from now at Yeonshin,

97
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,286
over in the new annex's operating room.

98
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,706
Is Dr. Jeong on board with this?
Does she know the arrangement?

99
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,125
I explained it to her earlier.

100
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:01,421
And if you're interested, Dr. Han,
I'd like you to join us.

101
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,256
- Are you serious?
- Well, of course.

102
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,508
You're a team, after all.

103
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,597
Dr. Jeong,
she left a while ago to see Dr. Choi.

104
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,267
Let's wait till she's back.
We'll talk this through.

105
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:18,229
Um, I don't think she'll be able to
talk to him. Not before the surgery.

106
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,817
As it turns out, Dr. Choi has run away.
He's trying to avoid her.

107
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:24,861
"Run away"?

108
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,370
Shit.

109
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,229
Now that she knows about the Ceralib-A,

110
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,024
Dr. Jeong will wanna move fast
and get him into surgery right away.

111
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,776
Yes, of course she would want to.

112
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,029
That's why he left.
He wants to wait it out.

113
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,324
Delay the surgery.
That's what he decided to do.

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,243
You mean he's…

115
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,746
I do. He's trying to
make his condition a lot worse.

116
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,457
He still wants the surgery though, right?

117
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,750
Of course.

118
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,002
Hold on.

119
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,090
So he's purposefully making
his condition worse before the surgery?

120
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,885
Yeah. That's exactly right.

121
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,931
But wait.
That doesn't make any sense at all.

122
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,975
He's deliberately doing all this…

123
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,897
to die on the table?

124
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,464
Good. You're here.

125
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,174
What's going on?

126
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,092
We received a call just after midnight.

127
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,177
And who called it in?

128
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,596
It was a woman.
She wanted to be anonymous.

129
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,889
Whose building is this?

130
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,266
- Actually…
- What?

131
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,977
It's Dr. Choi's place.

132
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,083
KOREA CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION

133
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,482
He's already cleared out.

134
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,986
Wow, he did that fast.

135
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,283
You got yourself
pretty worked up yesterday.

136
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,785
Are you feeling a little better?
Can we talk?

137
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,298
Tell me.

138
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,634
He wants to die on the table.
I wanna know why.

139
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,512
Does it mean he wants to die
in my hands? Is that it?

140
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,638
You're right.

141
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,725
She has to fail.

142
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,188
Fail at least once to experience it.
So she learns from it.

143
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:33,109
Are you saying that she's never had
a failure in any surgery?

144
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,986
Mmm. Not that I know of.

145
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,240
That's why I need to break her down now.

146
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,164
What kind of teacher
would even do such a thing?

147
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,249
Shit.

148
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,044
So he breaks me down. What then?

149
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,422
She has to feel the weight of a death,
sit there and cry.

150
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,800
Realize there are things
surgeons can't do.

151
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,053
Bear the full agony of it.

152
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,808
And what if she succeeds?
What if she doesn't lose you on the table?

153
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,187
This surgery is definitely going to fail.

154
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,357
I'm going to make sure it does.

155
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,243
Are you all right?

156
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,544
Why did you get involved in any of this?

157
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,923
Do you want to fail too or something?

158
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,134
Dr. Choi is the one who thinks
you're gonna fail. I don't.

159
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,553
I'd be a fool to bet against you.

160
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,393
You can pull this off, can't you?

161
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,736
YEONSHIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

162
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,247
Not bad, right?

163
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,085
I've never been in this new building.
It looks good.

164
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,131
The surgery will be conducted
completely in private with no observers.

165
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,507
And we've made arrangements.

166
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,010
Dr. Uyeong Ha will be the
only other person scrubbing in

167
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,344
from Yeonshin Hospital.

168
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:28,349
Dr. Ha won't actually be participating
in the operation. He's there in name only.

169
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,936
You'll be the one performing the surgery.

170
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,023
Yeonshin should do well here.
It's good business.

171
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,192
A joint project
with Boston Medical School.

172
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,740
It's full circle.
I'll be operating in this place again.

173
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,952
Didn't you want to come back?

174
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,079
Not sure.

175
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,833
Well, I'm excited. I don't know why.

176
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,004
What?

177
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,424
Why did he bring you into this whole mess?
That's the thing I'm wondering right now.

178
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,262
Well, perhaps, Dr. Choi thought
it'd be good for you

179
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,639
to throw some healthy competition
into the mix.

180
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,809
After all, everything he does
is for your benefit.

181
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,938
Wait, do you really think
you're my competition?

182
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:21,569
Yeah, well, for what it's worth,
that's what you do for me.

183
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,281
You may not know this,
but I'm kind of a big deal too.

184
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,034
Okay, so what's your plan?

185
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,497
Arterial revascularization
after the tumor is out?

186
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,542
Can't use the superficial temporal artery.

187
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,670
Ceralib-A weakened it,
so it's most likely compromised.

188
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,090
Then what?

189
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,550
That means
we'll have to use his saphenous vein.

190
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,682
So using a leg vein
for cerebral revascularization?

191
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,397
Not a bad idea. All right, let's do that.

192
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,858
Wait, what? You're not even surprised?

193
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,569
About what?
Going with that should do the trick.

194
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,488
But you should be a little surprised.

195
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,157
It's never been done before,
using the saphenous vein for this.

196
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,701
If that's what you wanna focus on,
go ahead.

197
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,454
Anyway, we can't wait a month to do this.

198
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,207
We don't have the time
to be sitting around that long.

199
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,501
Go get ready and I'll bring him here.

200
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,420
He won't even return my calls.
You won't be able to find him.

201
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:22,964
You know how stubborn he can be.

202
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,633
He'll be here. Get ready!

203
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,355
Ah. Thank you very much.

204
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,694
- What can I get you?
- Iced latte…

205
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,995
- Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, watch out!

206
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,079
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,373
Hey. Careful, careful.
Yeah, yeah. Keep going.

208
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,916
Yeah. That's it. That's it.

209
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,800
NAMYANGJU-SI, GYEONGGI-DO

210
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,887
I'm a good friend of Dr. Choi's,
so you needn't worry.

211
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,471
You can take this with you.

212
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:16,976
And please, if Seok Jeong
is ever in trouble, call my number.

213
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,396
Trust me, I can be useful.

214
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,775
Ah, you're awake.

215
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,695
Have you talked to Ms. Seok at all?

216
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,740
I still can't reach her.
I'll try after breakfast.

217
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,884
You seem pretty laid-back
for someone who's on the run.

218
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,719
Hmm.

219
00:16:56,349 --> 00:17:00,269
All I had were books
when I came to Seoul at 17.

220
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,024
I knew of this area,
though I never thought to come.

221
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,988
Right over there,
that's where my school was.

222
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,281
Pretty close, no?

223
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,743
What have I been doing?

224
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,873
I heard that the police were called to
the warehouse earlier.

225
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,711
They're quite busy, aren't they?

226
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,297
You can use this one for now.

227
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,136
- It's secure, right?
- Yes.

228
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,266
Is something wrong?

229
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,560
Dr… Dr. Choi.

230
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,979
It's going to be fine.

231
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,524
It's going to be fine.

232
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,663
Where in the hell did you go?

233
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,749
Dr. Jeong. You're out late.

234
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,794
DR. CHOI SET TO WIN ICHIDA AWARD
FOR 10TH YEAR

235
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,547
You have to find him. Can you do that?

236
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,845
You made a promise
that you'd help me, right?

237
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,221
You said you would repay me.

238
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,057
Have you gotten any sleep?

239
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,979
If you have an ounce of decency,
you'll remember this.

240
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,315
I saved your damn life.

241
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,152
It's late. You should go to bed.

242
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,113
Sanggi, prepare a room for her.

243
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,452
PHYSICAL THERAPY
INJECTION THERAPY

244
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,344
Good evening.

245
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,056
Dr. Hyeonho Han?

246
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:01,974
Who are you?

247
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,853
I'm friends with Dr. Choi.
He's told me a lot about you.

248
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,782
Dr. Choi.

249
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,617
Dr. Choi!

250
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,330
Dr. Choi.

251
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,466
Don't worry, sir.

252
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,802
Dr. Jeong doesn't know. It's okay.

253
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,466
Oh, I feel much better now.

254
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,551
Dr. Choi, just lie down.

255
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,974
Stop being so difficult.
Give up on the surgery.

256
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:10,603
Why? Did Seok say she doesn't wanna do it?

257
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,897
Of course she wants to do it.
That's not the issue.

258
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,566
That's right.

259
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,818
If you're this sick,

260
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,154
no surgeon in the world can save you.

261
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,447
Not even Dr. Jeong.

262
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,575
Do you really want to spend
all these days suffering?

263
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:30,581
All the way up to the last minute,
till the operation? Say that you don't.

264
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:36,504
I'll look after you, Doctor,
up to the end. So, please.

265
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:43,594
Volunteering for bedpan duty, Doctor?
Are you sure?

266
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:48,349
I had a mentor, you know.
I took care of him till he passed away.

267
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,061
I can manage your pain.
I'm an anesthesiologist.

268
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,105
I'll take good care of you.

269
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,358
You won't suffer, I promise.

270
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,820
That's very kind of you.

271
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,074
- You're an excellent doctor.
- It's a doctor's duty.

272
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,371
We help those in our care face
their final days with dignity and peace.

273
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:14,625
Our duty. It should be, for all doctors.

274
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:20,965
However…

275
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,049
…Dr. Han…

276
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,220
there's something that you don't get.

277
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,308
Not everyone wants peace
when they reach the end of their lives.

278
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,854
There are those
who are looking for something else.

279
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,899
Don't interfere.

280
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,361
If I'm to die, then I'll do it my own way.

281
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,788
The body of Detective Lee
from the Special Investigations Unit

282
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,375
was found in a warehouse in Yangpyeong
around 8:00 a.m. yesterday.

283
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,712
Based on the fingerprints
collected at the scene, in addition to

284
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:03,757
DNA analysis of the skin tissue
found under the victim's fingernails,

285
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,135
we are officially issuing a wanted notice.

286
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,556
It is for Deokhee Choi,
owner of the warehouse.

287
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,184
<i>Park, the nurse who was</i>
<i>murdered and buried</i>

288
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,269
<i>at an abandoned temple,</i>

289
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,314
<i>Lee, the detective who</i>
<i>disappeared while investigating the case,</i>

290
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,608
<i>and Min, a black market surgery broker.</i>

291
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,859
<i>For all three victims,</i>

292
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,571
<i>Dr. Deokhee Choi, a neurosurgeon</i>
<i>at Yeonshin University Hospital,</i>

293
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,782
<i>is a wanted suspect on charges of murder</i>
<i>and corpse concealment.</i>

294
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:32,119
<i>While Dr. Choi is still at large</i>
<i>and believed to be evading capture,</i>

295
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,039
<i>the police have declared his apprehension</i>
<i>their top priority</i>

296
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:38,250
<i>and are committing all available resources</i>
<i>to his arrest.</i>

297
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,936
Ms. Seok has been looking for Dr. Choi
day and night.

298
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,396
She hasn't even stopped
to sleep or anything.

299
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,566
I was hoping you knew where he was.
I'm worried.

300
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,069
The news, have you watched?

301
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,278
Yeah.

302
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:09,198
Don't worry about it.

303
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,785
It's safe to say Dr. Choi
won't get caught by the police.

304
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,454
He's arranged a deal of sorts.

305
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,249
He's really sick, though.
What if he's home alone and passes away?

306
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:23,087
Unless Dr. Choi changed his mind
and kicked him out, he's fine.

307
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,172
Dr. Hyeonho Han should be there right now.

308
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,342
<i>Are you sure?</i>

309
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,261
So he's definitely with Dr. Choi?

310
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,560
Yeah. She told me
not to tell anyone, though.

311
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,487
Oh, geez.

312
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:49,989
- Hey.
- Yeah.

313
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,374
Mr. Kim.

314
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,085
If I send you a phone number,
can you trace it for me?

315
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,920
<i>Whose number?</i>

316
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,257
Hyeonho Han. He's a doctor
that I need to find right away.

317
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,794
I'll do it.

318
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,349
Though it's hard to tell right now,

319
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,352
I do hold beliefs as a doctor.

320
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,064
Principles to live by.

321
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:09,610
I would tell myself,
never kill anyone in the OR.

322
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:15,032
That ruins the one place
I hoped I would remain innocent.

323
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:18,827
Like a new white gown,
just sewn, never worn.

324
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,289
I wanted to keep it that way.

325
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,255
Did you end up killing a patient too?

326
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,847
Well, I was so angry then.
And I wasn't thinking straight.

327
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,226
I was fortunate. Seok stopped me.

328
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:50,317
After that,
I was filled with all this guilt.

329
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,402
Totally humiliated.

330
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:56,907
To the extent that
I just couldn't face her.

331
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,245
So I kicked her out.

332
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:05,707
I just thought, "I can't stand seeing you,
so get out of here."

333
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,214
She was on her knees
and begging me to let her stay.

334
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,218
And I knew…
I knew what the hospital meant to her.

335
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:23,100
I was her teacher,
yet I felt she had bruised my ego.

336
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,019
So I crushed her.

337
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:28,605
If you feel guilty about
what you did to her,

338
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,524
then you shouldn't do this to her now.

339
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,608
Why?

340
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,695
She'll never get another chance
like this one.

341
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:39,157
Should the surgery fail, then what?
It could traumatize her for life.

342
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,159
You think she'll ever operate again?

343
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,496
So you're a bird pushing his own chick
off of a tree or something?

344
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,208
If that's what it takes to make her cry.

345
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:49,918
She has to cry for what?

346
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,546
Just what the hell is wrong with you?

347
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,842
You have to understand that as a surgeon,

348
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,511
Seok is at her peak right now.

349
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,431
Her confidence is through the roof.

350
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,893
She's only content
when she's in the OR, working.

351
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:11,189
Nothing in the world
is more fulfilling to her than that.

352
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:16,820
But here's the thing.

353
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:23,076
You see, for surgeons like the two of us,
there is no next level.

354
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,495
Dr. Jeong is already
a good enough surgeon.

355
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,997
She's good enough?

356
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,251
Seok is the best there is, just like me.

357
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,382
You're wrong. I'm not trying to push her
off a tree, but to help her fly higher.

358
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,844
Help her soar beyond my own limits.
Do more than I ever could.

359
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:43,472
She has to reach higher
than anyone ever has.

360
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,974
What if that's something
she doesn't actually want?

361
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:51,021
She needs to lose a patient
and break down, cry in despair.

362
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,400
Only then
can she reach her true potential.

363
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,196
She has to…

364
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,909
She has to want so desperately
to save someone and fail.

365
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,995
Feel that agony.

366
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,540
She needs to face that horrible moment,

367
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:13,877
to lose all faith in herself
and never want to hold a scalpel again.

368
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:15,420
That's when.

369
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:22,552
I know it.
I know what I did to her was wrong.

370
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,973
That's why even if she doesn't want it,

371
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,601
I need to give her everything that I can.

372
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,857
I need to.

373
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,456
Oh, geez.

374
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,876
Why the hell didn't you tell me
she gave you her card?

375
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,796
Uh, 'cause she told me
I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.

376
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,841
What a good doggy you are for her.
You never do what I tell you.

377
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,426
That's not true.

378
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,720
Idiot.

379
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,349
So I stayed off of their radar
'cause of a deal he struck?

380
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,852
Yeah, he's gonna take the blame
for all the charges.

381
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,063
Apparently, he's got something on
Inspector Yang, so they both agreed to it.

382
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,773
Those two are insane.

383
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,819
I get it, but he's going through all this
trouble so you don't go to prison.

384
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,738
Can't you just let him protect you?

385
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,949
Hey, who was the one who killed the nurse?

386
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,952
It was you.

387
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,454
So why should he be the one
to take the fall?

388
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,955
Come on, he's gonna die anyway.

389
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:33,749
So you want me to just say,
"Hey, Dr. Choi,

390
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,252
since you're gonna die anyway, thanks for
taking the rap for everything I've done"?

391
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,336
Is that what you want?

392
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,547
Who the hell does that? Huh?

393
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,094
But there's nothing you can do.
He already made it happen.

394
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,639
That's just great.

395
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,060
What the hell was he doing here anyway?

396
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:54,936
How the heck should I know?

397
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,732
She just said they met here yesterday.
That was all.

398
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,196
It's your first time here, right?

399
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,282
It's a nice day out. Really bright.

400
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,410
Are you kidding?

401
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:23,131
Look, Deokhee Choi
was your recommendation.

402
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,634
You brought him to the scenes
and paid him with tax money.

403
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,720
And you did it without knowing
he was the culprit all along!

404
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,682
So sorry, sir.

405
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:36,228
I'll catch him. No matter what it takes.

406
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,938
Are you positive about that?

407
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,899
Weren't you the one
who opposed the public wanted notice?

408
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,527
Are you even sure
you want to catch him or not?

409
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,112
I can't keep looking the other way

410
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,697
just because you happen to be
close to retirement.

411
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,910
Yang, I have a question for you.

412
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,703
If you don't have any integrity,

413
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,790
shouldn't you at least have
some sense of shame?

414
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:42,669
He is a very sick man.
Is this really necessary?

415
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,384
This is Deokhee Choi.

416
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,970
<i>Hello. My name is Doobong Kim.</i>

417
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:57,601
Yes, Dr. Han has told me all about you.
You were Seok's patient, isn't that right?

418
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,979
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Thanks to her, I'm still alive.</i>

419
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,357
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

420
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:08,653
Uh, do you want to come out
or should I come in?

421
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,245
You can relax a bit. I may be a gangster,
but I do have a few principles.

422
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,717
So, let's talk.

423
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,680
I guess Seok sent you
to bring me back, huh?

424
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,454
Why the hell do you keep calling, huh?

425
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,374
We've got nothing to say to each other.

426
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,964
So you two made a deal, huh?
You and Dr. Choi.

427
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,757
He didn't tell you about it then?

428
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,386
I thought you were in on it.

429
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,557
The only thing I know is that
he's taking the fall for all of it.

430
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,728
No, he's not just taking the fall.
He basically confessed to everything.

431
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,731
He told me he only has a month to live,

432
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,401
and he'll call me right before he dies
so I can be the one to catch him.

433
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,404
That way,
the cases won't get dropped right away.

434
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,698
Not until he dies, at least.

435
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,120
- There's no way he's gonna die.
- What are you saying?

436
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,289
He just needs surgery. He's not gonna die!

437
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,751
He's getting surgery during all this?

438
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,129
Yeah. Guess who's doing it?
Everything's ready to go.

439
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,602
Hey.

440
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,187
Don't do it, okay?

441
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,272
Don't do what?

442
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,358
Don't give him the surgery.

443
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,906
Dr. Choi and I,

444
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,159
the two of us had an understanding.

445
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,328
Just let him die.

446
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,751
That was your deal. I didn't agree to it.

447
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,045
He's not gonna die.

448
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,466
Dr. Deokhee Choi has to die

449
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,885
so I can live.

450
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,140
Detective,

451
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,185
I'm the one
who killed the nurse, all right?

452
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,817
What is wrong with you?
You really don't know shit.

453
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,531
Now what are you gonna do?

454
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,826
What if I walk down to the police station

455
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,412
and talk all about
the deal the two of you had?

456
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,340
Anyway…

457
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,094
don't you dare touch him, got me?

458
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,806
Even if you can catch him,

459
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:07,642
just stay away.

460
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,311
Are we clear?

461
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,165
That inspector guy looks really angry.

462
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,916
I really couldn't care less.

463
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,252
What's with you? I don't like this.

464
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,336
I just got a text.

465
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,630
They found Dr. Choi. Let's go.

466
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,048
I FOUND DR. CHOI DEOKHEE

467
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:52,645
She's young
and has her whole life ahead of her.

468
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:57,609
I'm dying anyway,
so why shouldn't I take the fall for her?

469
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:02,906
Seok's struggling to accept my death now…

470
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,491
…but as time goes by,

471
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,286
she'll end up appreciating
what you've done.

472
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,079
Hmm.

473
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,834
I can tell you're not gonna
change your mind. You're dead set on this.

474
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,171
Hard to argue with you.

475
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,161
Let go!

476
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,170
Shit.

477
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,344
Are you crazy?

478
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,690
Come on, I just wanna break one finger.

479
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,066
No!

480
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,360
You shouldn't have said
you were going through with the surgery.

481
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,203
- Sanggi.
- Yes?

482
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,456
Call Dr. Jeong. Tell her not to come.

483
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,208
I think Dr. Choi is right about this.

484
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,211
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

485
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,813
I can't believe that actually worked.

486
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,693
Even when you were backed into a corner
like you just were,

487
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,821
you still managed to talk your way out.

488
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,619
Are you absolutely certain
that you have to do this?

489
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:21,669
Here.

490
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,840
No. Please!

491
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,967
- Hey.
- No!

492
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,473
Ms. Seok.

493
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,183
- Hey.
- Seok.

494
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,267
Move!

495
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,902
Hey.

496
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,779
Bastard!

497
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,156
Come here.

498
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:52,492
Move, you bastard!

499
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,470
<i>Seok is me.</i>

500
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:16,432
<i>She's just like I was</i>
<i>in my miserable youth.</i>

501
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,229
I knew it the moment I saw her.

502
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,527
I knew what kind of life she'd had.
I didn't even need to ask.

503
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,197
It had to have been just like mine.

504
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,077
The two of us are the same, you see.

505
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,788
We're so similar,

506
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,208
even in our worst failings.

507
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,840
If they could find DNA in our minds,

508
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,050
she and I…

509
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,346
…we'd be family.

510
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,027
You're with Dr. Choi right now, yeah?

511
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,279
Put him on the damn phone.

512
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,332
What?

513
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,251
<i>You know Inspector Yang, right?</i>

514
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,712
- <i>Your good buddy.</i>
- You…

515
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:30,089
<i>I'm with him right now,</i>

516
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,009
<i>although he can't really</i>
<i>come to the phone.</i>

517
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,887
<i>So, now are you gonna come see me?</i>

518
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,932
Can't you see?

519
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,686
This is all because you ran away
and drove me freaking crazy!

520
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,231
Where are you?

521
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,112
Leave the gangster at home.

522
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,948
Come by yourself.

523
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:05,393
Now you've seen it for yourself.
Death by Seok's hand.

524
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,022
You're sleeping?

525
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:57,445
Are you an animal?

526
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,615
What the hell were you thinking,
killing a cop?

527
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,706
I told you I'd have the surgery, didn't I?

528
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,417
But you just had to be impatient
and ruin things.

529
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,212
If you were in my shoes,
you would've done worse.

530
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,965
I would've handled it more quietly
at least.

531
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,928
I guess you're right.

532
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:25,056
You would, 'cause you're a timid person.

533
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,100
You should have the patience to wait
when you need to.

534
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,645
Why must you be so different
from everyone else?

535
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:32,647
Geez.

536
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,607
So what you're trying to say is,

537
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,235
that you want me to sit back
and just watch you die.

538
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,113
What the hell kind of lesson
are you trying to teach me here?

539
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,784
You are so pathetic.

540
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,454
You thought I wouldn't be able to find you
if you ran?

541
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,332
Screw this stupid lesson!
I don't want any of this!

542
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,378
Wipe your face right now.

543
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,010
What are you going to do?

544
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,515
Can you take care of this by yourself?

545
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,352
Can you or not?

546
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,528
No.

547
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,572
I'm gonna need you to help me, Doctor.

548
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,496
Stop crying. You can't cry yet.

549
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,498
Save it for the OR.

550
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:18,878
Dr. Choi.

551
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,133
I said, stop it already.

552
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:27,678
I have no idea
why the hell you're doing all this!

553
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,349
I intend to keep my promise to you.

554
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,062
Don't forget what you asked for.

555
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,105
Everything I know, every skill I have.

556
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,399
Whatever I could give you,
you wanted it all.

557
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:49,283
If you can't handle all of this,
why did you even ask?

558
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,331
Well, I don't want anything else.

559
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,500
Just…

560
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,294
Just live.

561
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,172
All I need you to do is stay alive.

562
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,760
'Cause if you wind up dead,

563
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:10,930
I'll just get even worse.

564
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,974
I'll just go out there
and kill anyone I want!

565
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,518
So stop running!

566
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:20,147
What the hell am I supposed to do
if you run away?

567
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,690
What the hell do I do?

568
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,531
I'm not running away. I'm dying.

569
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,618
We all reach the final page
when it's time.

570
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,955
Now the story of Deokhee Choi
is finally ending.

571
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:43,087
There's no need to keep reading it.
There's nothing more.

572
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:46,799
Nothing more?

573
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,136
What do you mean?

574
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,555
What do you mean?

575
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,308
I…

576
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,228
I need you to watch me succeed.

577
00:49:00,563 --> 00:49:03,607
I need you to see just how good I can be
as a surgeon!

578
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,075
Do you hate me that much?

579
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,910
Huh?

580
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,956
Why…

581
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:26,589
Why would I hate you?

582
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,554
Then why are you doing all this?

583
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,268
I need to give you all I can before I die.

584
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,062
No matter how hard I try,

585
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,649
I can't think of how else to do that.

586
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:53,908
I already told you.

587
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,368
I don't want anything else.

588
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,915
You've already given me more than enough.

589
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,965
Forget it.

590
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,635
- Let's go! Come with me!
- No!

591
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,553
If you want to live, we have to go now!

592
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,598
- Listen to me for once in your life!
- Let's go!

593
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,974
You idiot!

594
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,732
If you take another step towards me…

595
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:30,444
then you can forget about the surgery!

596
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:35,324
- Dr. Choi.
- You heard what I said.

597
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,408
I won't do it.

598
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,454
If you'd rather I die here,
I'll make that happen instead.

599
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:44,917
Why?

600
00:50:45,501 --> 00:50:47,920
Why?

601
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,977
It won't be long.

602
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,647
Maybe less than a month.

603
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,234
When it's time…

604
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:15,531
I'll call you.

605
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,247
No more crying.

606
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:35,337
YEONSHIN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
FUNERAL HALL

607
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,365
RESTRICTED AREA

608
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:17,546
You're here.

609
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,300
Doctor, are you feeling okay?

610
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,052
Don't make any mistakes.

611
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,096
Stay in your lane.

612
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,265
Wanna see Dr. Choi?

613
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,643
Yeah.

614
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:19,942
After all this is over,
you can thank me then.

615
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,946
I won't be failing today.

616
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:27,783
Who do you think taught me, after all?

617
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:37,292
See you after the surgery, Doctor.

618
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:54,810
Pathetic fool.

619
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,154
Let's get started.

620
00:56:47,863 --> 00:56:48,864
Knife.

621
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,245
Watch it.

622
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:41,041
You know if it wasn't for me,
you all would've died.

623
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,795
Ronda. Good girl.

624
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,591
That hospital is pretty famous
for its neurosurgery, isn't it?

625
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,219
So why do they want Ms. Seok?

626
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,596
Well, the patient's their director,

627
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,099
and apparently
he can't trust his own doctors.

628
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,565
I guess they'll have
everything ready for us then.

629
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,497
Shall we get started?

630
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,459
We don't have a lot of time.
Should I give him a call?

631
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,921
No.

632
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,301
He's coming.
