00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,156
Hello, Dr. Jeong.

3
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,117
Yes.

4
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,160
Sure.

5
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,039
Is it possible for you to switch shifts
with Dr. Jeong today?

6
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,750
I don't really know why,
but she can't make it in to work.

7
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,419
Yes.

8
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,045
Thanks.

9
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,132
-Everything okay?
-Oh, you're in early.

10
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,217
What's wrong with Seok?

11
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,678
She called and said
she can't come in to work today.

12
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,681
-The bypass surgery is today.
-I know.

13
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,309
Could she be sick?

14
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:42,811
She sounded okay on the phone.

15
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,605
It's obvious, isn't it?

16
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,191
I bet she just ditched work
'cause she's burned out.

17
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:51,611
Honestly, can you think of another reason
why she would miss a bypass surgery?

18
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,697
-She's obsessed with surgery.
-Hey.

19
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,297
She went home.

20
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,218
She told me
she needed to pick up some winter clothes.

21
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,804
Really?

22

ONEUL OTOLARYNGOLOGIST

23
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,213
What happened to your face?

24
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,975
Seok rents this house
from a grandma she's close with.

25
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,726
It's at a cheap price apparently.

26
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,856
I just wish it was closer to the hospital.

27
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,274
Grandma?

28
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,192
-She has family?
-What?

29
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,070
Ohâ€¦

30
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,573
She's not related to her.
They're just close.

31
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,534
Just an old lady she's close to?

32
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
Yeah.

33
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,586
There was only enough for one coffee.

34
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,005
So what happened then?

35
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,215
Your face looks terrible.

36
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,383
How observant of you.

37
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:19,968
Drink up.

38
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,637
I'm fine.

39
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,890
You can have it.

40
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:27,893
Well, I'm fine too.

41
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,895
Oh, no thank you.

42
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,355
What's wrong?

43
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,531
All right, fine.

44
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,575
Uyeong.

45
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:46,411
-Yes.
-Go out and get her some meds.

46
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,707
Sure.

47
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,638
What's with all those books in the yard?

48
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,645
It's stuff I don't need anymore.

49
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,480
So I'm getting rid of it.

50
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,152
These days doctors tend to specialize
in a particular field,

51
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,696
like vascular surgery or tumor removal.

52
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,450
They'll even focus on a subtype of surgery
within that field.

53
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,369
So what?

54
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,830
I mean, some doctors also
only perform TSA procedures,

55
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,457
while others spend their whole entire day
coiling aneurysms

56
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,334
and then calling it their speciality.

57
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:38,338
I want to learn everything, do everything.

58
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,550
So I can be just like you.

59
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,761
Yes, I do it all.

60
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,431
Why'd you miss work today?

61
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,811
I would appreciate it
if you wouldn't lie to me.

62
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,189
I wasn't going to
in the first place.

63
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,951
Here's the proof.

64
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,203
It's right here.

65
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,624
-What?
-We're the same,

66
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,709
you and I.

67
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,050
We're the same how?

68
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,722
-What are you saying?
-I'm saying I can see right through you.

69
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,058
Once again, don't lie to me.

70
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,227
I'll know if you do.

71
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,482
What possible reason would I have
to lie to you?

72
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,906
Why are you really doing this, huh?

73
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,367
So I skipped out on one day of work.

74
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,412
I already told you
I slipped on ice on the way here.

75
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,171
Be right back.

76
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,514
Geez. What an asshole.

77
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,857
You son of a bitch. Get back here now.

78
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,818
You brought Dr. Choi here
to screw me over, didn't you?

79
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,989
I've always known. I've always known
you were really a psychopath deep down.

80
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,617
But I still can't believe
you're doing this to me.

81
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,829
Get back here. Hurry back
and get him out of my house right now.

82
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,748
After the pharmacy run.

83
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,957
Forget the pharmacy!

84
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,211
Just turn the damn car around already
and tell him it was closed!

85
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,590
Okay, fine. You win.

86
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,376
Who is this guy? Why is he here?

87
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,630
I've never seen him before in my life.

88
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,549
That's the truth.

89
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,938
I opened the door,
and he followed me in.

90
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,876
-Hey! Hey! Get off! Get off me!
-Stay still!

91
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,712
Get off!

92
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,797
Shut up, damn it.

93
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,258
Get off me, you bastard!

94
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,720
Let go of me!

95
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,394
Ah, you fucking bitch!

96
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,233
It was self-defense.

97
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,694
I promise you that.

98
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,947
Well, thenâ€¦

99
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,867
What are you going to do now?

100
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,164
I'll bury him

101
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,957
later tonight

102
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,210
in the woods.

103
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,805
Can you take care of it by yourself?

104
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,858
I'll call you.

105
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,401
Yeah.

106
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,381
Can you take care of it by yourself?

107
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,762
Wait a minute!

108
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:39,889
Wait a minute, wait a minute! Hold on.

109
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:43,977
What?

110
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,979
You have something to say?

111
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,483
No.

112
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,194
It's nothing.

113
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,613
Nothing.

114
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,910
Tomorrow then.

115
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,037
Nice and early.

116
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,210
Go.

117
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,967
See you later!

118
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:31,482
HYPER KNIFE

119
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:40,867
Yes.

120
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,870
Oh. We're still in Busan, sir.

121
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,082
Oh, the director and everyone else,
they all left earlier.

122
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,543
Oh, sure. Just a second.

123
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,345
Yes, Dr. Choi. Your laptop?

124
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,057
Sure. And where should I bring it?

125
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,268
One moment.

126
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,985
The body, identified as
a former nurse, was found in the mountains

127
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,322
behind an abandoned temple located
on the outskirts of Changnyeong-gun.

128
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,825
Police have announced plans to conduct
an extensive search of the area

129
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,828
around the temple in an effort
to gather additional evidence,

130
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,374
as they suspect that an organization
involved in illegal surgeries

131
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,668
murdered her to cover up their own crimes.

132
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,386
-Finding all of it is gonna take forever.
-Believe me, I know.

133
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,764
We're doing it little by little.
But we really need more hands out here.

134
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,101
You said we were just gonna
take a quick look.

135
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,394
Come on. We should go.

136
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,317
Can we please just go? Oh, shit.

137
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:01,698
Everyone move, please.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

138
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,949
-Excuse me. Please.
-Coming through!

139
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,284
Move the car over there!

140
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,124
What could you possibly need to see
right now? Can we please go?

141
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,626
- No pictures!
- Just relax, would ya?

142
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,879
Seriously.
Neither of us should be here, ya know.

143
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,590
-No, no, no. This is a crime scene, okay?
-Why not?

144
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:21,551
Criminals return
to the scene of the crime.

145
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,845
Do they not?

146
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,727
Your nostrils just flared, didn't they?
You're trying not to laugh!

147
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,563
Not true.

148
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,523
Yeah, right.

149
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,442
Have you lost your damn mind?

150
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,444
You're seriously deranged!

151
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,991
This is a totally new experience for me,

152
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,118
so it's just interesting.

153
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,497
Wow. Just look at all these people here.

154
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,041
Wait. Does that make you happy?

155
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,876
Do you feel all superior or something?

156
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,794
Like you're some big shot now?

157
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,171
That what this is about?

158
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,257
You think I'm a psychopath, huh?

159
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,926
I'm just saying it's interesting.
I know you think so too.

160
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,470
No, I really don't.

161
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,513
I don't find this interesting. It's scary!

162
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,515
You should be scared, too!

163
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,311
Everything we buried.
It's all completely burned, right?

164
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,772
You were the last one to check it,
weren't you?

165
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,661
What's Dr. Choi doing here?

166
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,806
Ah, man. Those bastards.

167
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,557
They made sure to torch everything.

168
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,937
Kim, give me some gloves.

169
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,164
Mannitol.

170
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,209
It removes excess water from the body.

171
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,419
A neurological drug?

172
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:24,507
It's prescribed to reduce eye pressure
or treat renal failure.

173
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,551
It's used in my department too.

174
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,262
For neurosurgery?

175
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,605
Mmmâ€¦

176
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,860
Oh, no. What are you thinking?

177
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,779
You stay right here.

178
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,649
Search Team 3 here.

179
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,693
We found the victim's belongings.
It's her purse.

180
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,238
-Can you confirm it's the victimâ€™s?
-We found her ID card in the wallet.

181
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,949
We'll send it over
to headquarters immediately. Over.

182
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,744
What did they find?

183
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,078
Mmm.

184
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,497
The victim's purse.

185
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,792
Yeah, Lee. Go ahead.

186
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,045
You're with Dr. Choi, right?

187
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,504
-Yeah, why?
-Um…

188
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:49,217
One of his students is waiting for him
outside. Could you please let him know?

189
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,010
Yeah, all right.

190
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,887
He must be here with my laptop.

191
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,604
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Not at all.

192
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,939
I know you're busy.

193
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,524
I had the rest of your things
sent to your house.

194
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,609
Good, thank you.

195
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,153
How long are you staying here?

196
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,156
Well, we'll see.

197
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,991
Dr. Choi!

198
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,090
Why is he being such a good boy today?

199
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,968
He usually doesn't let anyone touch him
except for his partner.

200
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,052
Do you like me?

201
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,179
'Cause I like you!

202
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,349
Your student seems
to be something of a dog expert.

203
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,727
She owns dogs. She has quite a few.

204
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,895
Makes sense.

205
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,272
What kinds of dogs?

206
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:45,815
Rottweilers.

207
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,400
Rottweilers?

208
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,859
Aren't they really aggressive?

209
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,238
They're absolute sweethearts.

210
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,575
Uyeong Ha. Hey.

211
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,160
Hey.

212
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,462
What exactly are you doing here?

213
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,757
What about you?
You shouldn't be here.

214
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,510
This is about the award, huh?

215
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,679
Because I took it from you?

216
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,057
You must be out of your mind.

217
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,393
What were you thinking
showing your face here?

218
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,812
It is, isn't it?

219
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,148
You're suddenly hanging out
with the cops now?

220
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,774
'Cause of your precious award.

221
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,776
You're pissed off.

222
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,362
Do you have any idea where the hell
you are right now?

223
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,240
There's only so much madness
I'm willing to overlook.

224
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,661
You think scaring me
into performing your surgery will work?

225
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,079
Not a chance.

226
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,290
Going around killing people,
you're pathetic!

227
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh, I'm the pathetic one?

228
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,669
Myeongjin Kim.

229
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,631
-You're a murderer too.
-How dare you say that?

230
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,841
We are nothing alike!

231
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,301
We absolutely are.

232
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm glad you had my pharmacy closed

233
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,478
because now I have all the time
in the world.

234
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,355
Do what you want.

235
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,149
You can keep trying to put the pressure
on me.

236
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,860
I'm gonna find Myeongjin Kim
no matter what it takes.

237
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,529
When I find his body,

238
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,782
I'll give you a call.

239
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,189
That's the girl who was messing with you
before, isn't it?

240
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,110
What the hell is she doing here?

241
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,861
Who knows?

242
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,864
She gets pissed off
by the mere thought of me.

243
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,742
Has she forgotten what she did to you?

244
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,457
-What is it?
-Ah, no. Nothing.

245
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,060
We are nothing alike!

246
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:32,440
Hey, do you remember Eunsim Han?

247
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,859
She was in our class.

248
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,819
Uh… Eunsim Han?

249
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,030
She was the girl
who got married in a rush.

250
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:43,492
All of us went to her wedding
even though it was really short notice.

251
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:48,080
We even did a collection so she
could have some cash as a wedding gift.

252
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,165
Remember?

253
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,794
Man, those were the days, huh?

254
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,882
Hi. How are you?

255
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,843
YONGHYEON CATHOLIC CHURCH

256
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,679
Hmmâ€¦ You've been
having heartburn, is that right?

257
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,306
- Yeah.
- I see.

258
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,476
Well, in that case, you should come
by the clinic so we can run some tests.

259
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,103
-You know where it is?
-Of course. Thank you, Doctor.

260
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,023
Why would you help him?
You've got your own problems to deal with.

261
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,525
His father is dead.
I feel bad for the guy.

262
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,111
You don't know he's dead.
I thought he ran away.

263
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,114
Well, I know he was killed by Dr. Choi.

264
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,117
That doesn't make any sense.

265
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,996
Why would Dr. Choi want to kill anyone?
Not everyone is like you.

266
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,791
All humans are evil.

267
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,375
That's just the way it is, you know.

268
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,127
Will you stop already?

269
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,172
Oh. He's here.

270
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,510
Well, best of luck helping him then.

271
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,844
I'm going to stay here.

272
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,012
And do what?

273
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,224
Hope that you snap out of this
and then come to your senses!

274
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,226
What's with you?

275
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,823
These are shots
from a psychiatric hospital in Donghae

276
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:07,201
that was shut down last month.
A police investigation has revealed

277
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,870
that a shocking 40% of the patients here
in this hospital

278
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,081
were involuntarily admitted.

279
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,876
On the days
when the government came for inspections,

280
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,921
they'd shove drugs down our throats.
We were all high on those drugs, so

281
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,841
-of course we looked like mental patients.
-Your dad was one of the patients here?

282
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:22,925
We were trapped.

283
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,135
Someone reached out
and said they saw him there.

284
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,888
-We never should've been admitted there.
-Are you sure?

285
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,557
I want to go find out.

286
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,103
Will you come with me?

287
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:45,990
Dr. Song.

288
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,576
Work been keeping you busy?

289
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,371
What does it look like to you?

290
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,379
Well,

291
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,590
when can we expect to get the results?

292
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,633
It's not like I'm just sitting around.

293
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,344
So stop being so pushy.

294
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,263
Okay.

295
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,067
Mmm.

296
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,491
So you went out for drinks last night
with Wanil, right?

297
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,453
Well, just a beer.

298
00:23:36,165 --> 00:23:39,084
ADMINISTRATOR LEE

299
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,214
-Who is it?
-It's Sojeong.

300
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,844
I've been too easy to reach lately,
so now I'm playing hard to get.

301
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,181
Young or old, women are all the same,
you know?

302
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,309
Hmm? A bit of neglect. They like that.

303
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,070
-Hello.
-Ah, Detective Lee.

304
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,405
-Wanil, you made it.
-Yeah.

305
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,950
-Have a drink.
-Oh. Thanks.

306
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,668
Wanil, ya little shit.

307
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,087
How did it go at the NFS?

308
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,713
Ah. Check this out.

309
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,008
Oh, not now, not now. Do it later.

310
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:31,971
Can I please take a look?

311
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,223
Of course you can. Please do.

312
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:35,975
Here.

313
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,786
This picture.

314
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:57,788
Ah, that.

315
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,873
It looks like some animal fur.

316
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,210
But they'll let us know for sure
once they get the lab results in.

317
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,212
Eunchae Song is the examiner?

318
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,296
Yeah.

319
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,465
You should've told her
to expedite our case.

320
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,509
I did.
But she really snapped at me.

321
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,092
DONGHAE JEIL MENTAL HOSPITAL

322
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,805
DANGER - NO ENTRY

323
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,859
See you later. Okay, thanks. Bye.

324
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,363
Hello there.

325
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,324
He's the one who called you yesterday.

326
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,492
-Ah…
-Hello.

327
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,244
I sent that email to you a while ago.

328
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,664
I have no clue when that was.
But I never heard back.

329
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,666
So I thought he was found.

330
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,668
Come on then.

331
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,437
I never threw this away,

332
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:46,814
just in case.

333
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,651
He was in Room 401 in the locked ward,

334
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,861
and his name was

335
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:54,488
Seokgu Lee.

336
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,824
Myeongjin Kim wasn't his name?

337
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,075
Mm-mmm.

338
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,244
Well, I don't know
why his name's different.

339
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,746
But what I do know is that's him.

340
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,039
It's definitely him.

341
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,250
You have any photos?

342
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,962
Why would I go around taking pictures
of patients? That'd be weird.

343
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,049
Then how do we know
this Seokgu Lee is really his dad?

344
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,176
What actual proof is there?

345
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,513
Because I told you it's him.

346
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,348
So,

347
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:23,100
um…

348
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,477
This patient named Seokgu Lee,

349
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,562
where is he now?

350
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,982
How should I know where all the patients
went after the hospital was shut down?

351
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,824
Your father has a scar on his head.

352
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,743
You didn't write that on your flyer.

353
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,787
So how would I even know that?

354
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:58,468
It looked something like this.

355
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,054
Yeah?

356
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,139
Here.

357
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,900
Can we take a look inside of the hospital?

358
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,068
ENTERING WITHOUT PERMISSION
IS A VIOLATION

359
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,365
CEASE AND DESIST ORDER

360
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:44,765
So, the reward you mentioned,

361
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,269
when will I get it?
After you find your father or what?

362
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,814
As soon as we get actual confirmation that
he was here,

363
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,775
I'll give it to you.

364
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,653
Fair enough.

365
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,840
Okay. This is it.
Let's see now. Wait a minute.

366
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,843
Hang on. Uh…

367
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,345
Which one is it again?

368
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,766
No, not this one. Uh… Maybe this one?

369
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,935
No, probably not.

370
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,397
Wait, is it?

371
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,774
Which one is it? What do we have here?

372
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,403
Are you doing all right?

373
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,742
I need the restroom. Excuse me.

374
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,123
Not this one. Ah! Here it is.

375
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,511
So this Seokgu Lee,

376
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,596
did he have a visitor or what?

377
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,682
Huh?

378
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,935
I'm asking if anyone came
to visit him or not.

379
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,273
A visitor? Someone came. I saw him once.

380
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,738
It was this gray-haired guy.

381
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,366
He showed up and took him for a stroll
in a wheelchair,

382
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,451
somewhere around here.

383
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,953
Really?

384
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,206
Hang on a minute. Just a sec.

385
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,878
Hmm.

386
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,046
Is this the guy?

387
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,298
CHOI DEOKHEE - NEUROSURGEON
DRAWS WORLD'S ATTENTION

388
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,556
Do you want me to keep watching her?

389
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,266
No, leave her alone for now.

390
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,269
If she's going to learn,
she must do it on her own.

391
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,439
She believes
the two of us are exactly alike.

392
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,941
But that's all it is. Simply a belief.

393
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,068
A misguided one.

394
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,403
But the truth is you two are alike.

395
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,405
That's what I think at least.

396
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,159
We are alike in a lot of ways. I get it.

397
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,911
However, if you look closely,

398
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,121
we're different.

399
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,178
Hmm?

400
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,971
Here it is. Seokgu Lee.

401
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:37,604
Geez.

402
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:41,191
What's with these
ridiculous prescriptions?

403
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,528
Did they really give him
all these medications at once?

404
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,323
Look, if that's what it says,
then I guess so.

405
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,077
That's great.

406
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,705
All these crazy people are gonna be
the end of us, ya know.

407
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,167
But look. Regardless,

408
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,712
we still don't know if Seokgu Lee
and Myeongjin Kim are the same individual.

409
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:05,090
- You have nothing else?
- Aw, geez.

410
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,008
Shouldn't figuring that out be your job?

411
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,594
What?

412
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,639
You two can piece together
the rest on your own.

413
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,437
My father was never here.

414
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,606
You're just messing with us, aren't you?

415
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,984
You punk,
what the fuck do you take me for?

416
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,485
You're wasting our time.

417
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,072
You little shits. I can't believe this.

418
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,200
You got a problem with me or something?
Proof, huh?

419
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,870
Yeah, is that
what you fucking want? Hmm?

420
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,580
I'll prove it to you bastards right now!

421
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,958
ADMINISTRATION
CONTENT: ADMISSION FORMS

422
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,131
Hello?

423
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,799
Hi, hey. It's me.

424
00:32:47,883 --> 00:32:48,884
Listen. Um…

425
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,720
-Where are you?
-Oh, I'm on a hike.

426
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,472
I'm having some makgeolli
before I come down. What's up?

427
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:58,018
That one time those press people came
to do a story…

428
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,938
We took a picture with the patients
in the lounge in Ward Two.

429
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,607
You remember that, don't you?

430
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:05,901
Yeah, what about it?

431
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,195
Do you still have that photo?

432
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,322
Yeah, I think so.

433
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,116
I need that picture urgently, okay?

434
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,535
You think maybe you can find it
and send it over?

435
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,537
You can take a pic of it with your phone.

436
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,873
All right, I'll send it to you
when I get home.

437
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,210
Thanks. Get a clear shot if you can.

438
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,424
When I get the photo,
check it if you want.

439
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,801
See your dad for yourself.

440
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,278
These damn brats.

441
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,365
Uh… Fucking hell.

442
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,536
WILL DR. DEOKHEE KEEP HIS CROWN?

443
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,664
I already told you. I don't know.

444
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,962
Look at the picture closer.

445
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:12,217
I don't know what you want me to do.
I can't remember, all right?

446
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,385
Ah, for fuck's sake.

447
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,435
Shit.

448
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:26,481
And so, I thought about
getting that treatment for myself.

449
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,358
But my friends said, "Don't do it.

450
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,402
It doesn't really work
and it's a waste of money."

451
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,862
That's what I thought at first.
But I did it,

452
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:35,115
-and it actually made a huge difference.
-Oh.

453
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:39,119
Well, it hurts a little. But it works
much better than the old laser treatments.

454
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,330
Oh. They were lying to keep it
for themselves while I look like this.

455
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:48,545
No, it's okay. I'll hook you up
with a really good clinic later.

456
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,796
- Wait. Really?
- Yeah.

457
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,089
Oh.

458
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,592
-Excuse me a minute.
-Sure.

459
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,977
So, Eunchae Song,
she's pretty straightforward.

460
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,146
What did she say?

461
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,481
You were right. She confirmed it.

462
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,358
Rottweiler fur no less.

463
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,695
The official report will be handed
to the police tomorrow afternoon.

464
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,905
Okay, thank you.

465
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,074
Make sure there won't be any issues later.

466
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,286
Sure, don't worry. I've got it covered.

467
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,849
I heard you filled in
for Dr. Song in the OR again today.

468
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:27,102
Yeah.

469
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,773
It was an AT/RT. I wanted to do it.

470
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,652
Uyeong is concerned about you.
He says you're addicted to stimulants.

471
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,866
Whatever he said to you,
he's wrong.

472
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,035
It's not true.

473
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,537
Of course.

474
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,372
You're not addicted to stimulants,

475
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,290
only surgery.

476
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,762
Here,

477
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,431
here

478
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:06,266
and here.

479
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,061
All of those pathwaysâ€¦

480
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:15,900
if I follow all of them
right up to the end,

481
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,152
what will I find?

482
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,284
Humanity at its essence. All that we are.

483
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,832
What if I die before I get to explore
all these different paths?

484
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,418
You will if you don't start
taking better care of yourself.

485
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:40,467
I know I should sleep more.

486
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:42,635
I already know that.

487
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,848
But things like sleeping,
things like eating,

488
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,727
they feel so trivial now and annoying.

489
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,440
Seok Jeong.

490
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,072
Promise me one thing.

491
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,577
From now on, you will eat right
and get enough sleep.

492
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,829
That's the only way
you'll make it to the end.

493
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,502
As for these, I'm taking them away.

494
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,908
The person you have reached…

495
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,701
Why isn't he answering his phone?

496
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,332
Ah, shit.

497
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,418
Just come back tomorrow, okay?

498
00:38:58,086 --> 00:39:01,256
Tomorrow morning, I'll just swing by
his place and pick up the photo.

499
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,590
Sound good?

500
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,801
You can't leave.

501
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,428
What's wrong with you?

502
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,015
You've done nothing but waste our time
all day.

503
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,226
You better settle this.

504
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:15,478
Get that damn photo for us!

505
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,814
-Ah, forget this. Move.
-No.

506
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,192
Seriously? You brain-damaged
or something, you little piece of shit?

507
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,070
You son of a bitch!

508
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,115
Hey, hey. Hey, hey!

509
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,408
Kiyoung, come on.

510
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,742
-Come on! Hey!
-Call him!

511
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,996
You should go cool off outside, huh?
Huh? Do what I say!

512
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,581
Damn it!

513
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,208
Damn it. It fucking hurts.

514
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,302
Let me see it.

515
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,433
Just forget it.

516
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,810
I don't want your fucking help.

517
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,104
I'll see a doctor.

518
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,815
Don't make me call Kiyoung back here.

519
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,485
Oh, geez.

520
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,745
Ah, shit.

521
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,113
Come on.

522
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,417
You've got some balls.

523
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,003
You're really wearing this?

524
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,423
I've tried everything
but I can't get it off.

525
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,016
Don't let Kiyoung see that ring on you.

526
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,018
He'll lose his shit
if he sees you wearing it.

527
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,107
What was that about?

528
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,442
Don't let me see what? Show me now.

529
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,320
Nothing, it's nothing.
And didn't I tell you to go outside? Huh?

530
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,906
-Let me see the ring. I wanna see it.
-Hey. Wait, wait, wait!

531
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,366
-Kiyoung. Stop! Wait!
-Let go.

532
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,077
-Hey, get off!
-Hey, let him go!

533
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,164
Hey!

534
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,710
Get back here!

535
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,212
- You fucking bastard!
- Fuck off.

536
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,131
No, no. Let me go.

537
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,342
Show me the ring!

538
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,427
You fuck!

539
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,013
No! No!

540
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,390
-Fuck you! Get off me!
-You shit!

541
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,100
My dad!

542
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,394
Where is he?

543
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,356
Tell me! Tell me, you fucking bastard!
Tell me!

544
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,318
I don't know. I don't know!

545
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,072
Let me go, you asshole!

546
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,700
You bastard!

547
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,077
No!

548
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,246
Hey! Kiyoung Kim!

549
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,331
-Fuck you!
-I said where is he!

550
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,959
- I said fuck you!
- Are you crazy?

551
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,127
- Tell me!
- You fucker!

552
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,212
-Enough. Knock it off!
-Tell me!

553
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,630
- Where is he?
- Stop it.

554
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:32,467
-I don't know. Let me go!
-Where's my dad? Tell me where he is!

555
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:41,517
What the…

556
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,376
Show me.

557
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,047
HAN JUNHUI, HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

558
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,882
NEUROSURGEON
DR. CHOI DEOKHEE

559
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,435
Why have you been going out
when you're practically dying?

560
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:15,147
Just finish your drink. Then get out.

561
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,534
What did you do to Myeongjin Kim?

562
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,827
You think I killed him, right?

563
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,372
You said it so many times,
I almost believed it.

564
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,250
You did, didn't you?

565
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,551
You are so unbelievably pathetic.

566
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,557
I want you to know something.

567
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,351
You should've just told me
the truth right away.

568
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:57,023
You should've said,
"That Myeongjin Kim is a bastard,

569
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,150
and I hate his guts.

570
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,778
So I need you to kill him."

571
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,114
And I would have said,

572
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,116
"Gladly.

573
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,830
There's no way I'd let you get blood
on your hands.

574
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,206
Absolutely not."

575
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,169
All because it's like you've always said.

576
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,920
I was pathetic even then!

577
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,099
Excuse me.

578
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,894
I have somewhere to be.

579
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,647
You were being a hypocrite,
pretending you were different from me.

580
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,441
And you were ashamed when I caught you!

581
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,110
That's why you kicked me out, isn't it?

582
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,769
Speed check detected.
Seventy kilometers ahead.

583
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,240
SPEED VIOLATION
PHOTO ENFORCED

584
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,344
-Good evening, sir.
-Please make some rice porridge.

585
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,304
-You can leave after.
-Yes, sir.

586
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,976
All right, let's go.

587
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,436
It's a beautiful day.

588
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,944
Oh.

589
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,072
What theā¦

590
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,246
Geez.

591
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,212
Oh. Thanks.

592
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,756
Oh, what?

593
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,432
You didn't answer your phone, so
I wasn't sure if you were coming or not.

594
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,310
This place is out of business.

595
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,271
Whoa. Your car…

596
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,355
I'm sorry.

597
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,108
I accidentally left my phone at home.

598
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,904
I guess we should go somewhere else then.

599
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:11,128
You told me earlier you had something
important to tell me about Inspector Yang.

600
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:12,963
- Buckle up.
- Uh…

601
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:24,433
Uh… If it's about him dating Sojeong
from the Prosecutors Office,

602
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,644
-I know.
-It's not about that.

603
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,067
What? What's this?

604
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:37,905
Actually, I have something to ask you too.

605
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,867
It's about your student I met
the other day, that woman.

606
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,662
-Seok?
-Yeah.

607
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:48,248
Remember the animal fur we found
on the victim's clothes?

608
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,335
Well, we got an email
from the NFS earlier,

609
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,712
and it turned out to be Rottweiler fur.

610
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:58,550
The victim didn't own any dogs,
so I guess it came from the killer.

611
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:03,472
But a brain surgeon who owns a Rottweiler
probably isn't very common.

612
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,765
Wouldn't you think?

613
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,560
Agreed.

614
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,480
Very rare, in fact.

615
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,157
Kiyoung.

616
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:30,541
Listen, all right?
Now pay attention to what I'm saying.
