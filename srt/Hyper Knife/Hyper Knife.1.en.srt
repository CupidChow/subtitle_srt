1
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,646
We should go.

2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:23,982
Yeah.

3
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,846
IN OPERATION

4
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:23,221
HYPER KNIFE

5
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:37,963
Knife.

6
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,934
Retractor.

7
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,516
- What the hell?
- Why?

8
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,893
-It wasn't me.
-Hey, shut it.

9
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,520
-Seriously. I swear.
-He's mine. I saw him.

10
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,063
No, I'm telling the truth.

11
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,356
Hey. Get off!

12
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,900
-Who was that?
-It was him, okay?

13
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,568
It was him.

14
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,503
Hey! Everyone out!

15
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,048
Get out.

16
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,052
I don't know. Hey. I said…

17
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,334
Is there something on my face?

18
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,295
Sorry, Doctor. I lost focus.

19
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,881
Get out.

20
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,296
Dr. Han, please wake up the patient.

21
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,132
Waking up the patient.

22
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,803
-What do you mean?
-We have to monitor him

23
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,347
to ensure we don't damage
the language center of his brain

24
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,684
while removing the tumor. That means
we have no other choice but to wake him.

25
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,561
Dr. Han, what are you doing?

26
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,354
We're waiting on you here.

27
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,555
The patient's awake.

28
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,308
Stimulator.

29
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,815
Sir. Can you hear the sound of my voice?

30
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,652
I know this feels a bit strange,
but just relax.

31
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,405
You're Doobong Kim, is that right?

32
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,115
Uh-huh.

33
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,117
That's my name.

34
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:40,413
I heard you're on the most wanted list.
What crime did you commit?

35
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,751
I've done a lot of things.

36
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,212
What kinds of things?

37
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,214
Well…

38
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,468
Very…

39
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,596
many…

40
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,476
things…

41
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,944
Okay, here it is.

42
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,738
-I found it. Let's begin.
-Right.

43
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:14,823
CUSA.

44
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,628
Okay.

45
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,631
Done.

46
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,259
Take care of the rest.
You can do it on your own.

47
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,803
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

48
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,887
Give me a hand.

49
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,685
RESTRICTED AREA

50
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,646
I'm sure you're tired.
How are you holding up, Doctor?

51
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,856
Why do you ask?

52
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,233
I-I was just wondering.

53
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,235
-Well, stop wondering.
-Right.

54
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,112
Doctor.

55
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,826
SERGEANT LEE WANIL

56
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,537
There's this guy Min.

57
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,706
He's a well-known
black-market surgery broker.

58
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,999
Black-market surgery?

59
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,335
Yes. In order to catch him,
we raided one of his facilities.

60
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,420
NEUROSURGERY CHOI DEOKHEE

61
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,297
This video was on his hard drive.

62
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,426
Brain surgery was honestly
our very first guess.

63
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,388
At the end of the day, we didn't know
what we were looking at though.

64
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,765
Can you tell us
what kind of operation this is?

65
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,392
Uh…

66
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,561
What is it?
Does something seem off?

67
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,063
No.

68
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,773
Nothing seems off.

69
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,237
Dr. Choi, you should take a look at this.

70
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,952
Here.

71
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,419
Black-market surgeries, huh?

72
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,796
And how far along is the investigation?

73
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,133
- We haven't really…
- The video, that's it?

74
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:00,428
Yes, this 50-minute video,
it's all we have at the moment.

75
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,934
What? What is it?
Is there something wrong?

76
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,810
You see,

77
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,480
it's hard to say exactly
what kind of operation it is

78
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,065
based off of this video alone.

79
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,277
What I can say is that the surgical site
is very deep in the base of the brain,

80
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,987
which is hard to execute.

81
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,990
A surgery like this is impossible
outside of a real OR.

82
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,534
Poor conditions.

83
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:27,038
Dr. Choi has technically performed
the only successful case in the country.

84
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:31,751
So you're saying
this patient very likely died as a result?

85
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,754
Yes, that's right. That is very likely.

86
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,798
All right. Just send over the file.

87
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,093
We'll take a closer look later.

88
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,928
Sure. Sounds good.

89
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,137
Ah. Here.

90
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,222
Thanks.

91
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,183
-I'll send you the file right away.
-Oh, okay.

92
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,269
We'll contact you shortly.

93
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,353
Great.

94
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,532
NEUROSURGEON DR. CHOI DEOKHEE

95
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,075
Dr. Choi.

96
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,119
About the video…

97
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,372
Those were woman's hands, weren't they?

98
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,499
Not sure.

99
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,419
Is there any chance that it's Seok?

100
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,504
It could be her.

101
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,715
What if it is her?

102
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,717
Don't you have work?

103
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,468
Yes.

104
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,803
I'll get back to it.

105
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,484
Hi, it's me.

106
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,570
Ah, Dr. Choi.

107
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,696
Listen.

108
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,073
There's someone I really need to find.

109
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,575
Who is it?

110
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,618
He goes by Min.

111
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,454
He's an illegal surgery broker.

112
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,914
Don't know his full name.

113
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,335
Okay.
So "Min, the illegal surgery broker."

114
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,671
Anything else?

115
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,840
The police are onto him.

116
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,800
Oh. Makes things easier.

117
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,136
I'll call you as soon as I find him.

118
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,305
How long would it take?

119
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,057
Uh… One week?

120
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,142
Could be too late.

121
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,103
Oh. This must be a pretty urgent matter.

122
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,315
I'll try to hurry things along, okay?

123
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,286
You're awake.

124
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,830
Yeah.

125
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:15,915
Want some water?

126
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,084
Here you go.

127
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,335
Mm-hmm.

128
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,304
What are you doing? Stop it.

129
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,473
Stay still.

130
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,350
Just looking.

131
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,107
Please don't.

132
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,360
Okay, Cranky Ass.

133
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,407
If I hadn't operated on you,
you'd have died, you little shit.

134
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,077
Show some respect.

135
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,416
You should've just let me die then.

136
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,063
Doctor.

137
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,233
He woke up only an hour ago.

138
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,320
Everything's normal
except for his pulse rate. It's a bit low.

139
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,322
Mr. Kim?

140
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,532
Can you see my fingers?

141
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,460
Are you the doctor from before?

142
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,754
Yeah, I performed your surgery.

143
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,964
Now,

144
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,925
how many fingers?

145
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,638
Please answer her, Boss.
You were talking just fine earlier.

146
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,974
How many?

147
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,231
Can you not hear me?

148
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,483
I'm grateful.

149
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,954
97, 98, 99, 100?

150
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,333
Five mill?

151
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,507
What do these asshole take me for?

152
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,261
Excuse me. Wait a minute.
Here's some bread.

153
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,930
- Cool. Thank you.
- Wow, it looks good.

154
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,014
Thank you.

155
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,816
- Hi. We have to eat.
- I'm busy.

156
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,776
Go eat with Dr. Han.

157
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,862
He said he wasn't hungry.
How's maeun-tang sound?

158
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,241
Maeun-tang?

159
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,370
At 2:00 a.m., in the mountains?

160
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,957
I said we have to eat
'cause I'm starving, okay?

161
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,503
There's bread over there.
Go eat that instead!

162
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,965
You…

163
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,558
Dr. Seok Jeong?

164
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,608
I thought it was you.

165
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,359
I was right.

166
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,616
How do you know my name?

167
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,994
I was a nurse
at Yeonshin University Hospital.

168
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,204
I was there around when you left.

169
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,791
Oh.

170
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,377
People really talked.

171
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,590
-What do you mean "they talked"?
-You know.

172
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,136
You and Dr. Choi.

173
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,281
So about the new nurse…

174
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,076
Did Dr. Han hire her?

175
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:25,081
No, the gangsters
were the ones who brought her.

176
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,041
We actually couldn't find anyone.

177
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,293
Why do you ask?

178
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,630
We've got to be careful
about who we work with.

179
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,425
She could squeal
and totally screw us over.

180
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,678
Nah, she wouldn't do that.

181
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,139
You know why?
She's hiding a lot of things too.

182
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,934
Oh?

183
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,396
Yeah. She committed malpractice
at a university hospital.

184
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,108
So she was kicked out and then
went to work at a convalescent hospital.

185
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,346
She's a terrible person.

186
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,141
What? How's she terrible?

187
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,563
At the convalescent hospital,
she gave strange meds to the elderly folks

188
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,857
who were too sick to move or speak.

189
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,567
And I heard she would beat them up.

190
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,446
Eventually, she got caught
and was kicked out of there too.

191
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,741
Oh. So she's a total bitch.

192
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,790
Have you eaten?

193
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,547
What is this?

194
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,636
It's my business card.

195
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,225
Went through my stuff, huh?

196
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,187
I run a pharmacy.

197
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,271
Oh, really?

198
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,107
Why would I lie about that?

199
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,568
Didn't you hear what happened?

200
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,196
I lost my medical license as you know.

201
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,740
Do you think I've just
been sitting on my ass?

202
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,159
I've gotta do something.

203
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:32,374
And what about Dr. Choi?
Did you two stay in touch?

204
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,219
He should've woken up by now.

205
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,014
Mr. Kim. Please wake up.
I need to change your dressing.

206
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,724
I put him down for a nap.

207
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,900
It was the only way
we could talk privately.

208
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,528
There are eyes everywhere else.

209
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,866
How much did you get paid for this?

210
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,786
I got five mill, that's it.

211
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:15,376
Does it really matter what I got?

212
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,545
Why do you wanna know?

213
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,088
Well, I thought about it.

214
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,884
And I realized that you probably got paid
a lot more than I did.

215
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,762
Why should I get paid less than you?

216
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,475
Out of the two of us,
you're the one without a license.

217
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,980
I guess I'm just saying
it feels a little unfair.

218
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,774
Don't you agree?

219
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:43,821
A doctor without a license
performing brain surgeries.

220
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,657
Outside a hospital.

221
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,286
I'm only saying this
because I worry for you, Doctor.

222
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,205
You might end up in jail.

223
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,541
Money?

224
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,003
How much? I'm busy so get it over with.

225
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,880
Three mill a month.

226
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,506
What? Too much?

227
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,551
Fine, two million then.

228
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,846
I can't go any lower than that.

229
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,598
I got to make a living too.

230
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,976
And we're partners now,
so you should give me that much at least.

231
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,563
Ah…

232
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,941
Partners?

233
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,069
How nice.

234
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:25,946
Great timing too.

235
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,740
-We were looking for a nurse.
-Oh, no.

236
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,243
I'm tired of the OR
so I won't be joining you.

237
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,002
I perform the surgery

238
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:44,131
while you refuse to set foot in the OR.

239
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,843
What exactly will you be doing then?

240
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,555
-Are we partners or not?
-I can overlook all of this.

241
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,642
I'll keep quiet for you

242
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,811
for your own safety.

243
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,325
In that case, you've got yourself a deal.

244
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,287
Safety.

245
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,166
Safety first, always.

246
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,171
Give me your bank account info.

247
00:24:58,914 --> 00:24:59,915
All right.

248
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:02,251
Here you go.

249
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,215
Wow, I didn't think you'd come
all the way here.

250
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,429
Well, it was only natural.

251
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,598
Mrs. Ra, I've heard nothing
but positive things

252
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,726
about you and your work over the years.

253
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,771
Yet, I was still surprised
when I got your call.

254
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,065
Even my wife doesn't know this number,
you know.

255
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,651
You are truly amazing.

256
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,987
Well, thank you
for all of your kind words.

257
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,698
This is Dr. Choi.

258
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,036
My name is Deokhee Choi.

259
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,466
This is what the fuss is about, huh?

260
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,761
Stupid ass cops barking up the wrong tree.

261
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,931
It's true that I had this, but still.
It has nothing to do with me, okay?

262
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,641
I just got it from the Chinese guys.

263
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,226
Chinese guys?

264
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,688
Yeah, there are people in China who are
doing these kinds of things illegally too.

265
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,858
All I know is
they sent me this video out of nowhere.

266
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,736
They said that the doctor is Korean
and they wanted me to find them.

267
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,781
So I pretended to look for a bit,
but that's it.

268
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,908
How long ago was that? Do you know?

269
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,827
- Last spring, I think.
- Hmm…

270
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,371
Can you tell us why
you only pretended to look?

271
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,749
'Cause brain operations are one thing
we don't touch.

272
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,961
Who'd be crazy enough to illegally crack
open their head for brain surgery?

273
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,090
We mostly deal with livers and kidneys
and stuff.

274
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,218
Nah, this is just too wild.

275
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,513
Mr. Min, you have the entire video,
don't you?

276
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,473
Nope, this is all I received too.

277
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,850
The Chinese guys said it was all they had.

278
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,940
Anyway. What are you gonna do
with the entire video?

279
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,818
The surgery,

280
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,904
I was wondering if it was successful.

281
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,450
The Chinese guys were dying to know
about that too.

282
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,828
But is there a reason for it, Doctor?

283
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,666
It's a difficult procedure. That's all.

284
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,252
Doesn't that go
for all brain surgeries?

285
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,506
Some parts are especially difficult.

286
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:17,094
And which ones are those?

287
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:24,226
Thank you for taking the time to meet us.

288
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,747
You said it was a difficult procedure.

289
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,917
They must've failed, then.

290
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,795
What are you going to do now?

291
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,550
Guess I should ask the person
who performed the surgery.

292
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,970
Does that mean you know who it is?

293
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,139
Of course I do.

294
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,183
How could I not? It's obvious.

295
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:09,479
Wait a second.

296
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,856
Is it someone I know?

297
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,026
Who is it then--

298
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,320
That girl?

299
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,078
Why do you think I'm asking?

300
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,164
Because I wanna see you.

301
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,207
Let me buy you a nice meal.

302
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,960
Last time,
you were the one who treated me, so…

303
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,546
No. I'm saying it's my turn.

304
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,473
I heard you and Inspector Yang grew up
in the same town?

305
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,559
Yes.

306
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:52,356
In Hapcheon, if you didn't know
Deokhee Choi, you were a northern spy.

307
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,691
He's been a genius since he was young.

308
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,110
Mmm… That's amazing.

309
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,029
Yeah. And you know what else?

310
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,324
In our little town, there was one school,
and that was it.

311
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,034
We didn't even have a bookstore.

312
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,703
But this guy gets into med school
at age 17.

313
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,330
- Hmm…
- Get this,

314
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,082
with the highest score.

315
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,000
That was long ago.

316
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,877
So what if it was?

317
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,171
It's not like I was telling a lie.

318
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,098
Oh, that's right.

319
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,809
Did you talk to Wanil Lee

320
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,561
about that illegal surgery video?

321
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,905
You said only you can
do that surgery in all of Korea.

322
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:44,366
If that's true,
you can easily help us find out

323
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,784
who this is, right?

324
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,578
Do all you can to help us out here.

325
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,164
Of course.

326
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,336
Are you all right?

327
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,381
What's wrong? Are you not well?

328
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,467
It's nothing. I'm fine.

329
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,996
We'll call someone to clean the floors
and windows later.

330
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,789
Oh, please be careful, that's expensive.

331
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,124
-Hey, be careful.
-Come on.

332
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,751
Didn't you hear what he said?

333
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,045
I also removed the catheter
this morning.

334
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,297
The swelling has gone down more or less.

335
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,009
It looks like you're ready
to be transported now.

336
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,345
You'll be able to move
around in about a week.

337
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:49,097
Dr. Han will be watching over you
until then…

338
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,516
-Easy.
-…so there's no need to worry.

339
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,977
The surgery went so well
that there won't be any issues.

340
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,146
-I'll still let you know how he's doing.
-Mm-hmm.

341
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,647
Sanggi.

342
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,399
-The bed.
-Would you like to sit up?

343
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,739
-Let me give you some privacy.
-Mmm…

344
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,672
Thank you, Doctor.

345
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,217
I owe you everything.

346
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,556
You already know what kind of person I am.

347
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,268
Please let me know if you ever need help,

348
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,188
no matter the problem.

349
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,832
Our problems,

350
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,334
only we can solve them.

351
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,933
-Keep an eye on him, okay?
-I'll contact you.

352
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,895
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir.

353
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,670
When do I get to leave?

354
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,756
After we finish up with all
the cleaning, I'll give you a ride home.

355
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,180
All righty, then.

356
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,933
I'd feel safer riding in your car anyway.

357
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:01,229
A cup of coffee sounds good right now.

358
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,245
They said it was going to rain today.

359
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,129
So you're a team of three?

360
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:29,466
That unfriendly anesthesiologist,
Dr. Jeong, and yourself.

361
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,219
How many surgeries do you do per month?

362
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:34,846
-No idea.
-Yeah, right.

363
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,765
Aren't you her manager?

364
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,892
I'm not her manager.

365
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,519
Then what exactly do you do?

366
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,696
I guess I should go ahead
and ask Dr. Jeong.

367
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,538
I drive, clean, do her laundry and tend to
whatever else Ms. Seok needs, all right?

368
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,623
Satisfied?

369
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,001
Now where the hell is this thing?

370
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,509
Hold on.

371
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,221
-Did you take my water?
-Why would I even do that?

372
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,933
You're a weird person.

373
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,115
Why do you need this cooler?

374
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,868
Hey, don't swing that around!

375
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,330
-What's in it?
-None of your business.

376
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,789
Got it?

377
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,668
Just take it to Dr. Han quickly.
He forgot it.

378
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:31,046
-Right now?
-Of course right now.

379
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,299
He says it's urgent! Now move it.

380
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,107
It'll get contaminated if you open it.
So just don't.

381
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,109
-Be right back.
-Yeah.

382
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:27,852
Yes, Doctor?

383
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,147
You shouldn't sleep in your car.

384
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,984
Somewhere in town, there's a sauna.
Go rest up there for a while.

385
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:38,071
I really wish I could, but I don't know.

386
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,740
We can't do anything right now
because of the rain.

387
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,659
We still gotta lot to burn.

388
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,495
We can burn it all in the morning
when the sun's out.

389
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,582
-You should go get some rest for now.
-I guess I'll go rest for a little.

390
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,167
Okay.

391
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,297
Oh, shit.

392
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,299
Shit.

393
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,005
Where is it?

394
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,912
MANAGER SEO

395
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,748
MS. SEOK

396
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:51,282
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven…

397
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,743
You're back already?

398
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,667
I thought I sent you away.

399
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:26,669
And here you are.

400
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,645
Where's the shovel?

401
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,023
Is it in the trunk?

402
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,412
I've got some treats!

403
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,164
How's my boy?

404
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,249
Danny!

405
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,003
Danny.

406
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,839
Ares! Here, Ares.

407
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,508
Oh, good boy!

408
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,135
You did it!

409
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,345
Aw…

410
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,765
Ronda! Ronda.

411
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,815
I was surprised.
She hasn't changed one bit.

412
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,693
Still looks like a baby.

413
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,238
Well, that's Seok for you, isn't it?

414
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,285
What about the dogs?

415
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,036
Those are actually her dogs.

416
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,413
They're Rottweilers.

417
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,875
A breed that's known
for being very fierce.

418
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,753
Sounds like they're the same as her.

419
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,048
You seem happy
to see her again after so long.

420
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,718
I do?

421
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,970
You've been smiling the whole time.

422
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:00,907
The more that I think about it,
you two have so much in common,

423
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,201
even that little bit of craziness.

424
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:08,122
I guess all geniuses are the same.

425
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,250
You are crazy. She's crazy.

426
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,922
Well,
Seok Jeong is definitely not normal.

427
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,467
Her dream is to die in the OR.

428
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,178
You feel the same way, don't you?

429
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:26,349
Well, if I had to
choose a place, it would be the OR.

430
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,393
Doesn't sound bad.

431
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,145
See? I knew it.

432
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,482
Shouldn't you meet up with her?

433
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,193
Hmm… I guess so.

434
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,127
So how'd you fall down?

435
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:57,672
A wild boar was chasing me
for no reason.

436
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,424
I fell down trying to get away.

437
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:04,053
Here's an idea. How about you come
to my farm and catch it for me?

438
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,638
Aw…

439
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,474
Hold on a sec,
you could ask Grandpa Yongsik to catch it?

440
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,018
Don't even get me
started on that old geezer.

441
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,688
- Oh?
- He's getting on my last nerve.

442
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,440
Just this morning when I saw him,
I thought…

443
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,359
…today's the day I'm gonna kill him.

444
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,488
By the way, where were you?

445
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:26,617
These last few days, I haven't seen you.
Were you out of town?

446
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:32,957
This little bitch I was dealing with,
she was asking for all this money.

447
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,875
It was my money though.

448
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,627
I didn't owe her a thing.

449
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,546
Too many lunatics on this planet, huh?

450
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,631
So then what did you do?

451
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,303
Since she was so annoying,

452
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:47,722
I strangled her to death.

453
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,182
Oh! Is that so?

454
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,143
Well done. Well done.

455
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,520
People like her certainly deserve it.

456
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,191
BAREUN PHARMACY

457
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,623
Are you all right?

458
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,209
Did that bastard say something to you?

459
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,587
No.

460
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,714
He was looking at me, that's all.

461
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:07,093
That creep is
making everyone around here uncomfortable.

462
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,053
It's getting on my nerves.

463
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,222
Did you just get off work?

464
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,473
Yeah.

465
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:14,433
Enjoy the rest of your day.

466
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,935
-See you around.
-Yeah.

467
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,694
MARI'S DINER

468
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,950
Wait, that ankle monitor guy again?

469
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,202
What a weirdo.

470
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,122
Why was he even looking at you though?

471
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,374
If I had to guess, he thinks I'm pretty.

472
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,334
Come on.

473
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:41,961
No way.

474
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,839
Anyway, he's been lurking around me
a lot more than usual.

475
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,215
It's annoying.

476
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,301
-Does that mean you're gonna kill him?
-Are you crazy?

477
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,054
-Why would you even think that?
-Well, you just said he was annoying.

478
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,434
You're talking as if you think
I'm a weirdo too. You know that?

479
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:57,768
'Cause you are one.

480
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,187
-How am I weird then, huh?
-Don't you remember?

481
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,274
You just sent me on an errand
not that long ago to kill that nurse.

482
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,526
So what? It's my fault?

483
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,987
I already told you what she said.
What would you have done, nothing?

484
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,405
Well, I wouldn't have killed her.

485
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:11,449
It was self-defense.

486
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,868
Ms. Seok.

487
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,744
It's premeditated murder to drug her,

488
00:49:15,828 --> 00:49:18,414
wait for the right moment,
and then strangle her to death.

489
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,916
You're a total psychopath,
you know.

490
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,669
You heard from Dr. Han, by the way?

491
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,588
When are we going to operate again?

492
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,757
Don't even think about operating. And also
don't kill any more people, please!

493
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,803
Since I saved one life,

494
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,430
I ended another.

495
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,515
So I did the world a favor.

496
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:40,352
Don't say anything like that ever again.

497
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:42,688
Go away.

498
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,149
Yeah?

499
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,319
Hi, are you home?

500
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,491
I hear you live in Paju these days.

501
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,242
I'll be there soon.

502
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,120
It's been a while since I've seen you.

503
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,754
So you did nothing wrong?
You refuse to leave?

504
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,672
-Yeah.
-Get her out.

505
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,592
I said out!

506
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:16,222
-Hey, let's go. Quickly.
-Get off.

507
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,015
-No, you can't…
-Get off!

508
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,433
-No!
-That's enough!

509
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,060
-This is my surgery!
-Hey, Seok!

510
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,269
-Mine!
-Seok!

511
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:24,980
-Let me finish my surgery!
-Seok!

512
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:30,027
Hey, Seok. Seok.
Sit down for a minute, okay?

513
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,405
Just sit down. Yeah? Calm down.

514
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,157
Seguk, go check on the patient.

515
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,538
Hey. Seok.

516
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,581
Ah…

517
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,292
Shit. Wait. Seok!

518
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,919
Okay. Excuse me, sorry.

519
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,424
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

520
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,969
Whoa! Hey! Seok!

521
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:56,220
Hey, what's going on?

522
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,139
- Go, go, go. Hurry!
- Hey! Jeong!

523
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,724
What the hell are you doing?

524
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,185
- Are you crazy?
- Seok Jeong!

525
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,562
Seok!

526
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,897
Seok! Hey!

527
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,910
You strangled me because
I kicked you out of the OR?

528
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,247
You're reckless and thoughtless!

529
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,041
That's your issue.

530
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,753
What?

531
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,672
Does it feel unfair?

532
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,398
Listen carefully, Seok.

533
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,692
I'll make sure

534
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:53,444
you'll never,

535
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,196
for the rest of your life,

536
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,491
set foot in an OR again…

537
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,038
even though you can't live without it.

538
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:48,494
Ms. Seok.

539
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,039
Just stay in your room.

540
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,478
I didn't come empty-handed.

541
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,476
Oh, so you came to the conference.

542
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,895
No, I watched it online.

543
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,357
You should've been there.
Everyone would've been glad to see you.

544
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:04,278
Aren't you curious to know
how your peers are doing?

545
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,196
Not at all.

546
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,074
Uyeong Ha became the department head
last year.

547
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,703
And all of the others have
become professors.

548
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,415
I guess you've gotten quite old,

549
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,126
seeing as how you're blabbering
about all sorts of crap, huh?

550
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,921
You could have become a full professor
by now too,

551
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,007
if you had just kept working under me.

552
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,468
If you have something to say,
just say it already.

553
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,471
I'm dying to know why the hell
you're showing your face here.

554
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,098
You've got some nerve, you know that?

555
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,392
You run a pharmacy.

556
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,562
How is it?

557
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,314
Why do you care?

558
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,290
I didn't know you were stalking me
like this.

559
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:00,709
Where the hell did you get this anyway?

560
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,920
You've improved
since the last time I saw you.

561
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,725
I haven't even offered you a drink,
have I?

562
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,144
I'll be back in a sec.

563
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,743
Go ahead.

564
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,593
Well, what do you think?

565
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,929
It's too sweet, isn't it?

566
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:38,473
Just a little, I guess.

567
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,440
I've been having health issues.

568
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,153
-Yeah, I've noticed.
-Brainstem glioma.

569
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,363
Luckily, I found it early.

570
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,035
Uyeong Ha could operate on you, ya know.

571
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,830
It's a tough location, which is worrying.

572
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:02,914
Right.

573
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,585
Uyeong's a coward,
so I guess that won't work.

574
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,337
Who else is there?

575
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:13,508
Boston guy.
Isn't he your biggest fan and all?

576
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:14,593
Alan Kim.

577
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,970
I can't have any post-op side effects.

578
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,638
You see,

579
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,682
these are crucial.

580
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:24,060
I have to continue operating.

581
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,067
Well, now that you're old.
Isn't it normal to have shaky hands…

582
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,612
…with or without
post-op side effects?

583
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,364
These aren't any normal hands, are they?

584
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:40,202
You're getting greedy
in your old age.

585
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,497
Enough is enough. You should retire.

586
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,167
I plan on taking two months to recover.
That's all the time I have.

587
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,836
In other words,
the surgery has to be perfect and--

588
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:52,923
Forget it.

589
00:59:53,632 --> 00:59:55,008
I'm never perfect anyway.

590
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,595
I'll get everything ready, so all you have
to do is show up and operate.

591
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,523
Are you insane?

592
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,610
Seems like
you've lost your mind for real.

593
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,362
How could I perform a surgery, huh?

594
01:00:15,904 --> 01:00:17,405
I don't even have a license.

595
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:20,492
I'll call you when we have the date.

596
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,036
You're crazy.

597
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,371
Why should I?

598
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,791
The police are looking for you.

599
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,211
You can perform
your black-market surgeries for now,

600
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,004
if you want to keep it that way.

601
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,631
You know how.

602
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:36,591
You don't have a choice.

603
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:42,222
You've always been like this.

604
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,141
All you ever wanted to do was break me.

605
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,477
So I did what you wanted!

606
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,272
And now you wanna do it all over again?

607
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:56,528
Maybe. If I have to, then I will.

608
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,699
Why don't you just cut my hands off
so I can't do anything?

609
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:02,701
Go ahead!

610
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,496
If you hate the sight of them so much,
just cut them off and go!

611
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,910
I don't even wanna call you a cab,

612
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,870
so don't ask me to.

613
