1
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,002
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,038
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:48,788
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,720
Look at those wretched people.

5
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,391
That woman is trying to seduce
a nobleman to change her fate.

6
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,629
Those scums.

7
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,837
How brazen is she to marry two husbands?

8
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:13,841
You need to be that beautiful
to have two men by your side.

9
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,193
Stop there.

10
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,663
Why isn't she bound?

11
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,565
Why not try it yourself,
if you're that good?

12
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,909
I am only here
for an investigation of a crime.

13
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:52,145
You probably do not want to bind me.

14
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:53,747
Unbelievable.

15
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,519
Under Article 419
of the Great Ming Code,

16
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,521
if restraints are used
on innocent people,

17
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,358
one is sentenced to 60 lashes.

18
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:08,495
Let's go.

19
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,935
I heard she was a runaway slave.

20
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:18,038
How dare a lowly slave
pretend to be a noblewoman?

21
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,674
Indeed, what a wicked world.

22
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,797
Execute that liar at once!

23
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,855
What is your name?

24
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,326
Ok Tae Young, the eldest daughter

25
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,462
of Ok Pil Seung,
a former envoy to Qing Dynasty,

26
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:19,233
or are you Goodeoki,
the slave of Kim Nak Soo?

27
00:03:21,468 --> 00:03:24,137
I asked for your name.

28
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,179
Goodeoki!

29
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,918
Goodeoki!

30
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,089
Goodeoki!

31
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,037
Goodeoki!

32
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,675
Where has she gone again?

33
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,210
I'm so worried.

34
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,985
Goodeoki!

35
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,291
Park, have you seen Goodeoki?

36
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,693
She is probably at the bookshop.

37
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,095
She said she would come back
after copying some manuscripts.

38
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,765
God. Where is the bookshop?

39
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,433
This is driving me crazy.

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,035
Goodeoki!

41
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:29,536
Goodeoki!

42
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:31,805
Goodeoki!

43
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,041
- Father?
- Goshh.

44
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:36,543
Why are you here so early?

45
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,544
You!

46
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,112
Are you hiding someone here?

47
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,647
No.

48
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,283
Why are you here in the morning?
Your cough will get worse.

49
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,819
No, listen to me.

50
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,588
The lady is asking for you.

51
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:50,290
The lady? She will not be up by now.

52
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,192
She wakes when the sun is shining.

53
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,161
- The matchmaker.
- The matchmaker?

54
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,162
Right. The matchmaker.

55
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:58,232
I forgot the matchmaker was coming.
What was I thinking?

56
00:04:58,232 --> 00:04:59,266
Go, then.

57
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,501
I will go now.

58
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,539
But did you get better or worse?

59
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,708
They said the medicine was good,
so I paid double.

60
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,109
That liar!

61
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,011
Off you go.

62
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,713
- Okay.
- Go.

63
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,749
Why are you back?

64
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,384
I will go right away.

65
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:19,453
But it's cold for you now.

66
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,821
You might catch a cold.

67
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:24,691
There.

68
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,460
- I am going.
- Go!

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,561
- I am going.
- Be careful.

70
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:33,233
Where did Goodeoki go?

71
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,301
Where did she run off to?

72
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,136
Did you not see her?

73
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,305
What are you all doing? Go find her!

74
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,140
Move it, hurry!

75
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,942
Go get her back!

76
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,078
Move!

77
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,583
She ran off again without permission.

78
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,984
Wait until she gets back.

79
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,120
I'll break her legs for sure this time.

80
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,457
I just regrew the hair
you pulled out last time.

81
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,227
Why would you break my legs?

82
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,631
What? You were not here earlier.

83
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:07,334
The floor was too cold,

84
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,203
so I slept in the barn on the haystack.

85
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,904
It was the best sleep ever.

86
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,683
Ouch!

87
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:24,017
You snuck out at dawn, did you?

88
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,953
I just overslept, I swear!

89
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,222
Can't you see my eyes?

90
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,957
Who are you trying to fool?

91
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,559
You have been saving money
to run away, have you not?

92
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,162
That's nonsense, my lady.

93
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,097
Why could I run away?

94
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:41,802
If you go out again,
I will break your legs for real.

95
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:42,803
Right.

96
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,006
Then you'll be Limpie, not Goodeoki.

97
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,343
Just the thought is horrifying.

98
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,913
I can't stop laughing thinking about it.

99
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,382
So, you will limp around for life,

100
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,551
working for me.

101
00:06:57,551 --> 00:07:00,254
- That sounds hilarious.
- Yes.

102
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,523
I will bring your new clothes.

103
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:03,891
Change before it is too late.

104
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,361
Hey.

105
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,445
How do you excel at it
without any training?

106
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,382
I've seen it once or twice, it's enough.

107
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,219
All done. It is perfect now.

108
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,988
If our master blames you again,

109
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,090
show him this, that will do.

110
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,992
You can avoid the punishment this time.

111
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,696
But this time,
the lady might actually get married.

112
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,398
Is there a suitable man?

113
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:48,035
You know the former governor
of Gyeonggi, right? It's his eldest son.

114
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,470
Why would such a man want our lady?

115
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,340
Is he really a stepson?

116
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,810
They say he is kind of mad.

117
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:59,112
- Do you mean he is crazy?
- Yes.

118
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,715
Then they are a perfect match.
A crazy couple.

119
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,170
I'll die cleaning this mess.

120
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:26,240
What is all this?

121
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,977
No wonder they call you crazy.

122
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:32,012
This is why they gossip.

123
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,050
Who is praising me behind my back again?

124
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,152
Did that sound like praise to you?

125
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:43,357
They say there is only a thin line
between madness and talent.

126
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,558
As an artist,

127
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,827
if my work is recognized when I'm alive,

128
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,762
that would be the greatest joy.

129
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:50,030
You are optimistic.

130
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,667
If you hate studying, why not train
in martial arts, Young Master?

131
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,104
You know I am scared of swords and bows.

132
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,239
You are probably the only man
in this country,

133
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,807
without a single callus, Young Master.

134
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,378
Hey, I care about my hands.

135
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,013
I have taken care of them like this.

136
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,714
Touch it. It is soft.

137
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,051
- This is really smooth.
- I know, right?

138
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,187
As I always tell you,

139
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:15,789
you are the eldest son,
to carry on the family name.

140
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,392
If I carry on this family,
there will be another me.

141
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,427
We have got our smart Sae Ho,
so why worry?

142
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,162
- Young Master.
- Soeddung.

143
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,533
Let me you about life.

144
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,670
There is more than one way to live.

145
00:09:30,504 --> 00:09:32,840
Reading the same books,
taking the same exams,

146
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,209
and having the same career.
Where is the fun in that?

147
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,310
Are you inside?

148
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,045
What is it?

149
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,581
- Yes, I am.
- Please come outside.

150
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:42,983
Well.

151
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:46,787
Why come to such a humble place
instead of calling me over?

152
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:50,157
Right.

153
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,559
You don't like me
going into the main house.

154
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,361
The matchmaker has visited.

155
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,929
You will be married soon.

156
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,030
To whom?

157
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,700
You will meet her at your father's
birthday feast, so prepare.

158
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,235
Me?

159
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,250
Can I attend Father's birthday feast?

160
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,919
She will be brought here.
There is no need to attend the feast.

161
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,455
But,

162
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:25,726
what kind of lady
would marry someone like me?

163
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,828
She is from a modest family,

164
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,464
but I have heard she is
talented and clever.

165
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,000
A nouveau riche.

166
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:36,136
A perfect match for us,

167
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,071
honorable but lacking in wealth.

168
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,576
Should you not, for once,
do something to help the family?

169
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:45,812
Is she beautiful?

170
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,686
Is she?

171
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,522
- I would not know.
- Why?

172
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,792
Why does no one tell me about this?

173
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:13,841
(Yellow Sea)

174
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,645
I saved for years,
but this is all I have.

175
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:24,051
How do I get more money?

176
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,922
Why do you keep doing this?

177
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,158
You should stop saving.

178
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,525
Every time you run,

179
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,594
my heart sinks.

180
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,165
Are you telling me to shut up?

181
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,201
This is a signal.

182
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,938
It means there is only one chance.

183
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,207
Come on.

184
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,310
When I signal like this,
you know what to do, right?

185
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:54,348
I'll grab our things and meet you
at the entrance of Yongdubong Peak.

186
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,749
Why do you say it out loud?

187
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,484
The point of the signal is not to talk.

188
00:11:57,484 --> 00:12:01,655
Stop with these useless ideas.
I am begging you.

189
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,423
Where would you go?

190
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,593
They are only taking me
when the lady gets married.

191
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,028
What do you think that means?

192
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,697
If your cold worsens and you collapse,

193
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,033
you will end up like Mother.

194
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,501
My goodness.

195
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,237
Whether we die here or out there,

196
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,540
if death is certain,
we might as well go all in.

197
00:12:20,174 --> 00:12:23,243
Let's run away, Father.
Even if it means risking our lives.

198
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,712
Not you.

199
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,414
You are young and healthy.

200
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,716
Why ruin your future?

201
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,185
That is why.

202
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:34,321
Do you want me to waste my life
emptying my lady's chamber pots,

203
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,224
and limp around if I lose my leg,

204
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,692
or get buried alive if I fall ill?

205
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,495
That is our life.

206
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,131
Running away will solve everything?

207
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,668
- It will solve something, at least.
- Gosh.

208
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,371
Father, I am Goodeoki.

209
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,372
You don't trust me?

210
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,843
I trust you.

211
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,579
Don't forget.

212
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,050
I will not.

213
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:28,842
Mother.

214
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,281
You are not in pain anymore, right?
Are you resting peacefully?

215
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,925
Mother!

216
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,161
Mother!

217
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,233
Please, Master.

218
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,235
Please.

219
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,405
Please make one dose of medicine
for my mother.

220
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,408
I said throw her out!
What are you doing there?

221
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,644
How could you?

222
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:07,113
Are we animals? Are we pigs and dogs?

223
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,083
Well, what is the difference
between you and an animal?

224
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:12,352
Master!

225
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,122
If you do not throw her out,
I will bury her with that.

226
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,860
Let's go. Come on, honey.

227
00:14:20,661 --> 00:14:23,697
Mother!

228
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,265
Mother!

229
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,168
Mother!

230
00:14:33,807 --> 00:14:34,942
Mother.

231
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,325
My dear.

232
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,961
My dear.

233
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,898
Why are you still clinging to life?

234
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,435
Please, do not suffer anymore.

235
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,270
Just go.

236
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:09,443
In the next life, be born a noble.

237
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:14,248
Eat fine meals, wear fine clothes,

238
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,951
and live as a human.

239
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,630
I will cook fine meals for Father.

240
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,901
I will get him good medicine,
and he will recover.

241
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,637
So please, Mother.

242
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:43,183
Help us escape. Please.

243
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:13,607
Peanuts for sale.

244
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:16,143
Peanuts for sale.

245
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,644
A bag for me.

246
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,614
Peanuts for sale.

247
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:23,784
Thank you.

248
00:16:25,252 --> 00:16:29,256
Peanuts for sale.

249
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,196
They say when that man worked

250
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,198
at Pyeongsi Bureau, he made a fortune.

251
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,234
Did I ask about that?

252
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:42,102
Hurry along.

253
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:45,072
I asked you to tell me
about that lady's family.

254
00:16:45,873 --> 00:16:47,140
I asked if she was pretty.

255
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,409
Beauty is subjective, so I do not know.

256
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,812
But her personality is awful.

257
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:55,315
I heard she was exceptionally talented
and clever, so I was curious.

258
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:58,352
They have a slave called Goodeoki.

259
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,954
She embroiders, reads, and so on.

260
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,523
She does everything for her.

261
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:03,657
Goodeoki?

262
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,126
Is Goodeoki like maggot?

263
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,361
My name means cow poop.

264
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,296
Well, I did not give you that name.

265
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,330
That is true.

266
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,169
Seriously.

267
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,171
Gosh.

268
00:17:17,771 --> 00:17:20,207
- The pollen.
- You are...

269
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,242
Come on. Get it out.

270
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,614
I am an artist after all,

271
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,149
but how can my nose be so sensitive?

272
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,118
Do you really have to go this far?

273
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:35,088
Why do you insist on watching
these street performances?

274
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:36,723
It is not what I want.

275
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,526
It is in my blood. Let's go.

276
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:42,296
What blood? It is freezing out here.

277
00:17:42,296 --> 00:17:44,431

278
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:47,701

Peanuts for sale.

284
00:18:03,951 --> 00:18:06,019
- Look, she is selling peanuts.
- What?

285
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,088
I was bored to death and she showed up.

286
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,089
Come here.

287
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,292
Let me see.

288
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:14,294
- Hey, are you Goodeoki?
- Hush!

289
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,897
The famous slave Goodeoki?

290
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:18,031
Hush!

291
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,033
Why are you saying my name?

292
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,771
You are a woman disguised as a man?

293
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,173
Who is he?

294
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,475
Who is this clueless, loudmouthed man?

295
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:30,611
This is because of the pollen.

296
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:31,912
My cousin.

297
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,348
- Nan Bong.
- Nan Bong?

298
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,382
Nan Bong.

299
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,518
Here, two puns per bag.

300
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,854
Two puns for a few peanuts?

301
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,723
It's robbery.

302
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:45,325
If you bought, roasted,

303
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,261
and shelled them, it would be cheaper.

304
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,429
But I did all the work.

305
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,398
You can't even pay me two puns?
You are like a robber.

306
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,000
How dare you talk back to me.

307
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,003
Do the work by myself?

308
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:57,971
That makes sense.

309
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,407
I told you she is smart.
No one can beat her.

310
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,408
Whatever.

311
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,011
- Soeddung.
- Yes?

312
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:07,214
This birthday feast,
let me sneak into your kitchen.

313
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,782
Your lady will be there, too.

314
00:19:08,782 --> 00:19:11,084
If you get caught again,
will you not lose all your hair?

315
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,419
Lose her hair?

316
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,488
It is fine. It grows back quickly.

317
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,323
- See? It is all grown back.
- Let me see.

318
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,457
You do have fine hair now.

319
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:20,561
Anyway, make sure to mention it, okay?

320
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,029
I could really use the money.

321
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,263
Fine. I will ask.

322
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,567
By the way,
I heard your Young Master is a "Dorai."

323
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,602
Dorai?

324
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:29,603
What does that mean?

325
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:31,687
"Do" means "run,"

326
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,067
"ra" means "hammer,"

327
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,508
and "i" means "crack."

328
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:37,377
So it means a lunatic who runs wild,

329
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,113
like his head
has been cracked open by a hammer.

330
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,251
Stop making up

331
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,119
nonsense.

332
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,988
Why are you shouting?

333
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:51,525
People say your lady is
not normal, either.

334
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:52,626
What about our lady?

335
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,663
What?

336
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,432
No! My lady!

337
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:02,035
- Where?
- My lady is there. Move.

338
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,604
- Move!
- What?

339
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,105
Move!

340
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:08,075
Are you going to stay silent?
Say something!

341
00:20:08,075 --> 00:20:10,277
Let's shout together, just once.

342
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,778
Repeat after me.

343
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,114
- Okay!
- Yeah!

344
00:20:25,526 --> 00:20:26,760
You scared me.

345
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,763
You're Nan Bong.

346
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,866
Why are you hiding?
Did you do something wrong?

347
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,102
And what is with those clothes?

348
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:39,206
Being born in this land is a sin,
if that is what you mean.

349
00:20:39,206 --> 00:20:40,674
What nonsense is that?

350
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,177
What should I do?

351
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:47,147
She does not care about books,
so why did she come here?

352
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:50,984
Right. Is it true that you do everything

353
00:20:50,984 --> 00:20:52,052
for your lady?

354
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:56,423
Why are you always so full of yourself?

355
00:21:03,397 --> 00:21:04,598
Wait.

356
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:08,669
Hey, why are you acting like a nobleman?

357
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:11,705
It is not an act. I am a noble.

358
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,341
Nonsense.

359
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:15,542
Take it off right now.

360
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,512
Take those clothes off.

361
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:23,817
I won't behave by your command.

362
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:26,453
See? You're twisting my words.

363
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,088
Are you okay?

364
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:29,256
Are you out of your mind?

365
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:37,898
Yes, I am.

366
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:40,868
Crazy.

367
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:46,106
By the way,
I heard your Young Master is a "Dorai."

368
00:21:46,106 --> 00:21:48,408
a lunatic who runs wild.

369
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:54,281
I get it.

370
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:57,684
You are not Soeddung's cousin.

371
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,120
Young Master.

372
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:01,955
Goodbye.

373
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:03,757
Where are you going?

374
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:05,492
I have committed a grave sin, sir.

375
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,594
- Please, let me go!
- Quiet.

376
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,863
You must pay for your disrespect
towards a noble.

377
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:11,064
Let's go.

378
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:12,833
Where to?

379
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,235
Are we heading to the authorities
or to my lady?

380
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,371
Sir!

381
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,741
Here.

382
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:24,878
Since the business is closed,
let's just enjoy the show.

383
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:26,246
Then I will forgive you.

384
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:33,921
Look.

385
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:37,491
"The Tale of Sim Cheong" does not sound
emotional at all.

386
00:22:38,258 --> 00:22:39,858
There are far more entertaining stories

387
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,662
than "The Tale of Sim Cheong"
and "The Tale of Heung Bu."

388
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:44,064
Why do they stick
to such predictable tales?

389
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:46,834
The level is too low,
I can hardly watch it.

390
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:50,437
I recently read a book
called "The Tale of Hong Gil Dong."

391
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:55,442
The sorrow of an illegitimate son
who cannot love his father was

392
00:22:56,243 --> 00:22:58,212
truly heart-wrenching.

393
00:22:58,212 --> 00:22:59,346
Exactly.

394
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,983
Under the same sky, we are all alike.

395
00:23:02,983 --> 00:23:05,953
Then, why is there
nobility and inferiority?

396
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:11,058
Did you read that book, too?

397
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:14,394
The book you read.

398
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,997
I probably transcribed every word of it.

399
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:24,605
You have
countless opportunities to read,

400
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:27,307
and watch the remarkable performances.

401
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,577
So, these street performances
must seem insignificant.

402
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,714
But for lowly people like us,

403
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:36,683
it does not matter
if it is performed well or not.

404
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:38,151
Why?

405
00:23:38,952 --> 00:23:40,053
Because life is

406
00:23:41,655 --> 00:23:42,856
tough.

407
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,763
For a brief moment, we forget
our struggles while watching.

408
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:52,332
A blind father,

409
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:56,537
raising Sim Cheong without a mother.

410
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:58,972
And she became a queen.

411
00:24:01,175 --> 00:24:03,610
How is that possible in reality?

412
00:24:20,294 --> 00:24:21,762
People simply want

413
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:26,667
stories where the poor and miserable
find happiness.

414
00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:30,470
They imagine the joyful days

415
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,673
that will never come to us.

416
00:24:33,774 --> 00:24:35,342
It is a form of vicarious joy.

417
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:45,919
Bringing happiness to those
who work hard every day,

418
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:51,992
and helping them forget their worries,
even just for a moment.

419
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:59,166
Is that not the true power of artists?

420
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:05,906
You have given me profound insight.

421
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:09,142
Me?

422
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:12,012
Until now, I never knew why I write,

423
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:14,014
why I paint,

424
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,250
or why I dance.

425
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,852
Suddenly, my mind is clear.

426
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:22,289
I'm glad to meet you here,
it's a gift for me.

427
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,793
Whatever it may be,

428
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,695
I am glad you are pleased.

429
00:25:30,731 --> 00:25:34,635
May I leave now?

430
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,503
When can we talk again?

431
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:37,938
I want to know more about you.

432
00:25:37,938 --> 00:25:40,641
What sets your heart ablaze?

433
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:46,146
Yes. What is your dream?

434
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:48,115
Dream?

435
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:51,885
My dream is

436
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:57,057
to grow old and die.

437
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:05,098
Not to be beaten
or to be starved to death,

438
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,635
but to age gracefully and die.

439
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:13,338
Without losing my legs,

440
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,164
or my hair.

441
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:19,446
And just,

442
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,050
to live.

443
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,689
If I am lucky,

444
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:31,925
I will live in a small house by the sea,

445
00:26:33,126 --> 00:26:35,362
hiding with my father.

446
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:45,138
Someone like me cannot have
a conversation with you, sir.

447
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:47,474
It is unthinkable for a lowly slave.

448
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,411
I have been,

449
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,115
too self-absorbed.

450
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:04,057
Here. Take this.

451
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:05,626
Why are you giving me this treasure?

452
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,395
You could not sell any peanuts
because of me.

453
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:11,398
This is too much. I cannot take it.

454
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:15,035
Then, take it as a gift.

455
00:27:15,836 --> 00:27:16,970
A gift?

456
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,138
Yes. Here.

457
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,374
Use it when you need it.

458
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:46,867
My lady.

459
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,139
Would you like to read a book
when you are bored?

460
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,507
(The Tale of Hong Gil Dong)

461
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:56,276
Are you mad? I'll never read,
even when I am bored.

462
00:27:56,276 --> 00:28:00,714
It might be awkward meeting him
for the first time at the birthday feast.

463
00:28:00,714 --> 00:28:02,482
If you run out of topics,

464
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:05,152
you could discuss books.

465
00:28:05,152 --> 00:28:07,054
Well, that does make sense.

466
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:09,790
Read it and I will listen.

467
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,960
Hey, even if I close my eyes,
I am not sleeping.

468
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,595
So, read it all the way through.

469
00:28:16,763 --> 00:28:17,764
Yes.

470
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:14,788
What sets your heart ablaze?

471
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,724
What is your dream?

472
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,080
Goodeoki.

473
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,249
Father.

474
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:15,883
Of all people, the one to stir my heart
for the first time is

475
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,985
a slave of my betrothed.

476
00:30:19,653 --> 00:30:21,488
What a cruel joke of fate.

477
00:30:23,524 --> 00:30:25,492
If I were of the same status as you,

478
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:27,628
I would have confessed
my feelings immediately.

479
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:32,064
For some reason, I cannot sleep
even as the night deepens.

480
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:09,703
See, what is this?

481
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,040
What is this?

482
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,108
It is nothing special.

483
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:17,845
Even if he is adopted,

484
00:31:17,845 --> 00:31:20,147
marrying him off
to such a ridiculous family is mean.

485
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:23,016
With severe madness,
what else can they do?

486
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:25,319
They must get rid of him,
even to such a house.

487
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,791
Here.

488
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:36,964
Try this.

489
00:31:51,144 --> 00:31:53,247
Goodeoki! Hey, she's coming.

490
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,615
Hey, she's here.

491
00:32:04,157 --> 00:32:05,158
Oh no.

492
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:07,127
Move.

493
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:13,166
It is definitely her.

494
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,415
If not for Soeddung,
I would have become Limpie.

495
00:32:33,353 --> 00:32:34,354
Huh?

496
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:46,400
Why is there a separate wing here?

497
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:50,537
Is this the Young Master's quarters?

498
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,841
He must feel quite lonely.

499
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:57,911
Once you get used to loneliness,
it dulls over time.

500
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:12,526
I know you did not come here
just to talk with me.

501
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,464
Well, my lady suspects I am here.

502
00:33:17,464 --> 00:33:20,133
So I fled the kitchen in haste.

503
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:23,370
Last time, you even disguised yourself
to sell peanuts.

504
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:27,174
Knowing full well you could lose
all your hair if you were caught,

505
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,510
you still came to earn wages.

506
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:33,347
Why do you need money so badly?

507
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:38,519
Are you truly planning
to escape to the seaside?

508
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:43,957
Tell me.

509
00:33:43,957 --> 00:33:47,094
I want to help in any way I can.

510
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:53,467
Why would you help someone like me?

511
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,235
No, I am fine.

512
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:56,770
Mother, watch your step!

513
00:34:08,582 --> 00:34:11,685
Why are you here instead of the feast?

514
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:15,222
I did not want my madness to ruin it.

515
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:17,224
Oh.

516
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,365
Have you read
"The Tale of Hong Gil Dong?"

517
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,669
Reading novels is a hobby of mine.

518
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,240
Which part of it
left the deepest impression on you?

519
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:38,846
The part where Gil Dong cannot call
his father "Father."

520
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:41,114
Why?

521
00:34:42,049 --> 00:34:44,885
Though of the same bloodline,
he is discriminated.

522
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:48,622
Under the same sky,
why is there nobility and inferiority?

523
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:50,891
I thought the same.

524
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:55,696
Yet, how could someone
with such thoughts,

525
00:34:55,696 --> 00:34:59,066
bury a lifelong servant alive
just for falling ill?

526
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:00,968
What?

527
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:05,005
I have no idea what you are saying.

528
00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:08,609
If you have heard rumors of my madness,

529
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,477
did you think I wouldn't hear rumors
about you?

530
00:35:10,477 --> 00:35:12,346
You're that dumb?

531
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:15,048
Let's talk more about rumors.

532
00:35:15,048 --> 00:35:17,117
They say you cannot do
a single thing by yourself.

533
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:20,287
From one to ten,
your servant handles it all.

534
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:23,724
Spare yourself further embarrassment
and just leave.

535
00:35:25,092 --> 00:35:26,326
The marriage proposal will be

536
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:29,630
called off.

537
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:41,808
Get up.

538
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,677
The door is this way.

539
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:48,715
Even a madman would not keep a rat
in his room.

540
00:35:48,715 --> 00:35:49,716
Where are you going?

541
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:51,985
To see if a dirty maggot is crawling
around here.

542
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:56,023
My lady.

543
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,591
You wretch.

544
00:35:57,591 --> 00:36:00,127
Were you sneaking into this place
every time you left?

545
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:01,728
What?

546
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:04,431
It is a misunderstanding. I can explain.

547
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:07,067
Is this why you called off
the engagement?

548
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:09,803
What nonsense is that?
You have got it all wrong.

549
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:11,171
My lady, it's not like that.

550
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,706
- You approached him, did you?
- Wait.

551
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:14,641
You knew about it
and did this on purpose! You maggot!

552
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:15,742
My lady, that's not true!

553
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:19,613
What is going on? Who are you?

554
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:22,049
She is my servant.

555
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,885
And the Young Master is involved
with my servant.

556
00:36:24,885 --> 00:36:26,553
No, Madam! That is not true!

557
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:27,688
It's not like that, Mother!

558
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,189
Do not call me "Mother!"

559
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,259
Come here! You filthy maggot, follow me!

560
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:34,328
My lady, this is not true.

561
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:35,863
Stop there!

562
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,298
- My lady.
- Come!

563
00:36:58,452 --> 00:36:59,486
My Lord.

564
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:03,257
My Lord, just kill me.

565
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:07,661
I will kill you
and your daughter as well.

566
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:16,770
You scoundrel!

567
00:37:18,705 --> 00:37:21,141
How dare you disgrace me

568
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:23,410
and my daughter?

569
00:37:26,046 --> 00:37:28,749
My Lord, I'll handle it.
Please allow me.

570
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:31,084
Beat her within an inch of her life,

571
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:33,353
and bury her alive.

572
00:37:33,353 --> 00:37:35,155
- Yes, sir.
- Understood?

573
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,296
Admit it! You did it on purpose!

574
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:45,832
You wanted to claim my husband
before I could, did you not?

575
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,105
Go die!

576
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,874
Go die, you wretched maggot!

577
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:55,742
Goodeoki.

578
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:01,448
Go die! You filthy maggot, just go die!

579
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,583
Go die!

580
00:38:20,334 --> 00:38:21,602
Go die!

581
00:38:23,437 --> 00:38:25,772
No, wait.

582
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,407
Killing her seems like too much.

583
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:31,311
After all, we are like family.
Is that not right?

584
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:32,579
Of course, my lady.

585
00:38:34,515 --> 00:38:36,984
Then, let's become family.

586
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:40,988
Clean her up and send her
to my father's chamber.

587
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,659
My lady.

588
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:49,396
What are you waiting for?
Clean her up and send her in.

589
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:53,033
My lady!

590
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:07,848
When I signal like this,
you know what to do, right?

591
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:11,685
I have to grab our things and meet you
at the entrance of Yongdubong Peak.

592
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:56,530
If only I had claimed you sooner,
none of this would have happened.

593
00:40:02,336 --> 00:40:04,204
Forget everything as of today.

594
00:40:04,204 --> 00:40:06,006
I will even give you a room of your own.

595
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,442
This drink is

596
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:10,644
my repayment for the food and shelter

597
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:13,947
you have provided.

598
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:15,983
Of course.

599
00:40:17,317 --> 00:40:18,719
And this is...

600
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,097
You do not have to hurry.

601
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,907
This is for my mother's revenge.

602
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:56,623
Is anyone out there?

603
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,597
Father!

604
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,099
Goodeoki, what have you done?!

605
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,472
You are going nowhere!

606
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,107
Step aside.

607
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:15,576
You wretch!

608
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,712
Take your filthy hands off me!

609
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:19,813
Filthy?

610
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:21,248
Yes, you filthy wretch.

611
00:41:21,248 --> 00:41:23,417
You maggot! You deserve to die!

612
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:26,954
Under the same sky,
no one deserves to die.

613
00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:28,589
And,

614
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,792
the one who is filthy is you.

615
00:41:44,972 --> 00:41:45,973
Goodeoki.

616
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:48,442
What is happening?

617
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:53,614
Catch that wench immediately!

618
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:55,983
What are you standing here for?
Report to the authorities!

619
00:41:55,983 --> 00:41:57,684
Come on!

620
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:00,587
Search for her!

621
00:42:00,587 --> 00:42:04,525
Spread out.

622
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,159
She could not have gone far.

623
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,015
That way.

624
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:36,223
What is going on? What have you done?

625
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,592
- Did you get our things?
- Here it is.

626
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:42,496
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

627
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,652
She is down there.

628
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,422
Over there! Catch her!

629
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:09,456
Yes!

630
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,061
Ma'am.

631
00:43:14,862 --> 00:43:17,264
I packed some potatoes, rice cakes,
and some money.

632
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,600
What are you waiting for? Go ahead.

633
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,769
Do not get caught. Go far away.

634
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,638
Never come back. Understood?

635
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:27,508
Thank you.

636
00:43:27,508 --> 00:43:28,909
- Let's go.
- Go on.

637
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,477
Hurry. Go now!

638
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:35,282
Goodbye, Mother.

639
00:43:37,618 --> 00:43:38,952
Thank you, Mother.

640
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:50,797
Please go and plead, Young Master.
Please, I beg you.

641
00:43:52,666 --> 00:43:56,203
What happened to Goodeoki?

642
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,072
Is that what matters right now?

643
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:02,943
On his father's birthday,

644
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,546
he was caught with the servant
of the family he was to marry into.

645
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:07,414
Do you need more reason to expel him?

646
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:09,716
I said I would talk to him.

647
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:12,653
He doesn't care about family's honor.

648
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:16,423
Because of
that lowly courtesan's child...

649
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:17,724
What did you say?

650
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:32,306
Was I

651
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,277
illegitimate, not adopted?

652
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,482
You are the child of a woman
I should have torn to pieces.

653
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:46,753
Raising you was
a constant source of anger for me.

654
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:49,489
I thought you showed me no affection
because I was adopted.

655
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,292
It turns out you simply hated me.

656
00:44:54,094 --> 00:44:55,762
You should have told me sooner.

657
00:44:55,762 --> 00:44:58,098
I always wondered who I took after.

658
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,801
- My mother was a courtesan.
- Seo In.

659
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:04,538
At dawn, I will leave here.

660
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:06,039
What nonsense are you spouting?

661
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:10,444
I will never forget the kindness
you have shown in raising me.

662
00:45:10,444 --> 00:45:12,646
The only way to repay that is

663
00:45:13,547 --> 00:45:15,549
to never return.

664
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:16,617
Stop!

665
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:20,487
And I will not forget
how you hold me up, Father.

666
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:29,830
Never let yourself be involved
with this family again.

667
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,298
From now on, you do not exist.

668
00:45:34,001 --> 00:45:35,035
There is no question

669
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:38,839
about that.

670
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:48,549
The magistrate has dispatched soldiers
to search every corner.

671
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:51,652
If she is caught, she will die.

672
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:53,086
Yes.

673
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:54,688
Bring bounty hunters from the market.

674
00:45:56,356 --> 00:45:58,592
I will make her life a living inferno.

675
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:07,067
Wait.

676
00:46:08,535 --> 00:46:09,536
What is this?

677
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:16,577
Your luggage shows
you are not here to send me off.

678
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,847
Once a servant, always a servant.
Is that it?

679
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,381
It is by order of the master.

680
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:23,217
And this...

681
00:46:24,051 --> 00:46:25,052
as well.

682
00:46:30,357 --> 00:46:31,859
Did he order you to watch me?

683
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:34,194
He asked me to take good care of you.

684
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:44,605
I guess my fate
is better than Hong Gil Dong's.

685
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,708
Where are you going?

686
00:46:48,709 --> 00:46:50,210
Before I leave,

687
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:53,480
I thought I might see
Goodeoki's face one last time.

688
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:56,884
You will not see her.

689
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:01,989
(Goodeoki is wanted)
You don't want me to capture her.

690
00:47:03,757 --> 00:47:04,892
That is correct.

691
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,027
But why should we spare her?

692
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:08,962
We are bounty hunters.

693
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:17,304
What are you doing?

694
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:19,072
Wait, this is our...

695
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:20,073
Let go.

696
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:26,146
You were promised a hundred nyangs
for her capture.

697
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:29,183
But if you sell it to me,
you will easily get double.

698
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:30,317
What if they still get her?

699
00:47:30,317 --> 00:47:32,820
Then you lose the money,
and they get three times the money.

700
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:41,195
We trust you.

701
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:44,198
But tell me.

702
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:52,773
Why spend so much on a lowly slave?

703
00:47:57,077 --> 00:47:59,480
She is the one who gave me freedom.

704
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,417
I wish to let her be free in turn.

705
00:48:05,252 --> 00:48:06,253
Then,

706
00:48:07,488 --> 00:48:09,990
what if we deliver this woman to you?

707
00:48:13,627 --> 00:48:16,764
Just do not pursue her.
Let her sleep tightly for once.

708
00:48:18,432 --> 00:48:19,566
Let's go.

709
00:48:21,068 --> 00:48:22,770
If fate allows it,

710
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,905
we shall meet again somewhere.

711
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,101
Father.

712
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:00,507
Father.

713
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:40,414
I must have lost my mind.

714
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,349
That was what saved all your life.

715
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:46,987
Why dwell on what is already lost?

716
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:49,123
Let us go back

717
00:49:49,123 --> 00:49:51,659
just for half a day.

718
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:54,561
The herbalists probably took it all.

719
00:49:54,561 --> 00:49:56,230
Think of it as a good deed.

720
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,232
You worked so hard to earn it.

721
00:49:58,232 --> 00:50:00,000
And now it is all gone!

722
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:04,635
From here on, we are in Chungcheong-do.

723
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:06,707
Stay strong, Father.

724
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:09,176
Another more days, we'll reach the sea.

725
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:13,047
I should have died quietly somewhere.

726
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:16,183
Then you would not have been burdened
by useless thoughts like these.

727
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:18,519
Gosh.

728
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,187
Enough.

729
00:50:20,187 --> 00:50:22,156
It is all right, Father.

730
00:50:22,156 --> 00:50:24,658
This is driving me crazy.

731
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:33,834
What is that?

732
00:50:56,657 --> 00:50:58,926
Ma'am, we are here.

733
00:50:58,926 --> 00:51:00,127
Okay.

734
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:03,097
- Do you have a room?
- Of course. Come in.

735
00:51:03,097 --> 00:51:05,266
Give us a warm room.

736
00:51:27,521 --> 00:51:28,522
Excuse me.

737
00:51:29,223 --> 00:51:31,759
Have you seen the person
who came in with me?

738
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,894
He went out late last night.

739
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:35,162
Really?

740
00:51:35,596 --> 00:51:37,298
Do you think I am lying?

741
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:39,433
No way.

742
00:51:39,433 --> 00:51:41,135
Why would he leave me?

743
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:42,636
Which way did he go?

744
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:44,538
How would I know?

745
00:51:46,674 --> 00:51:49,510
Hey.

746
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:52,212
If you and your father are planning

747
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:54,748
to skip out on your bill, just forget it.

748
00:51:54,748 --> 00:51:55,916
I am not a fool.

749
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,821
Here is something valuable.

750
00:52:01,689 --> 00:52:04,658
This should be enough
to pay for our meals and lodging.

751
00:52:05,225 --> 00:52:06,293
Thank you.

752
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:08,963
Father.

753
00:52:09,597 --> 00:52:11,432
- What?
- Father.

754
00:52:12,166 --> 00:52:13,300
Father.

755
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:15,236
Father.

756
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:20,140
Father.

757
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:43,230
No way.

758
00:52:44,365 --> 00:52:47,635
I cannot be a burden to my daughter.

759
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:54,475
My daughter is
the smartest girl in the world.

760
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:59,346
She'll find a way to survive.

761
00:53:20,134 --> 00:53:24,405
Why are you crying in front of my shop,
scaring away customers?

762
00:53:24,638 --> 00:53:26,874
What if he returns, and I am not here?

763
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:30,744
We might miss each other forever.

764
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:34,615
You are right. You are quite clever.

765
00:53:34,615 --> 00:53:37,384
Yes, I am very smart
and good at everything.

766
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,220
I am great at cooking and cleaning.

767
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:43,157
Can I stay here for a while?

768
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:50,731
You look like a runaway slave.

769
00:53:57,071 --> 00:53:58,105
Here.

770
00:53:59,173 --> 00:54:01,642
Sweep in front of the gate.

771
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:02,643
- Yes.
- Okay.

772
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:19,260
Why dismiss all the younger officials
and call me here?

773
00:54:23,163 --> 00:54:24,798
Do you know Song Byeong Geun,

774
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:27,067
the former governor of Gyeonggi-do?

775
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:32,206
Now I see. You are Hwa Ran's son.

776
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:40,080
Is she...

777
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:43,284
here as well?

778
00:54:44,952 --> 00:54:46,287
After you left,

779
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:49,223
she fell ill and passed shortly after.

780
00:55:09,543 --> 00:55:12,713
May I stay here

781
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:15,549
for a while?

782
00:55:33,701 --> 00:55:37,605
(One year later)

783
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:41,108
Look how lively it is.
See how it jiggles.

784
00:55:41,108 --> 00:55:43,310
Yes, it is nice. How much is it?

785
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,279
- Two puns.
- Okay.

786
00:55:53,621 --> 00:55:54,622
No way.

787
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,758
- Did you say two puns?
- What?

788
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:01,028
How could you trick someone like that

789
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:02,963
right in front of everyone?

790
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:05,866
You promised a live one,
but you are secretly taking a dead one.

791
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,501
What?

792
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:11,171
How dare you try to trick me!
Do I look like a fool?

793
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:13,540
Bring out the lively one

794
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:14,875
and I will let this pass.

795
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:19,580
Honestly, how will you
survive without me?

796
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,015
You are right.

797
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:25,853
That scoundrel has been
swindling me for years.

798
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:32,393
Father?

799
00:56:35,362 --> 00:56:36,363
Father.

800
00:56:40,334 --> 00:56:41,402
Father!

801
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,144
Did you mistake someone again?

802
00:56:51,712 --> 00:56:52,713
Yes.

803
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:57,685
My father must be doing well, right?

804
00:56:58,586 --> 00:56:59,653
Of course.

805
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:03,691
Let us keep going.

806
00:57:05,192 --> 00:57:06,193
Let's go.

807
00:57:07,628 --> 00:57:08,629
My goodness.

808
00:57:09,997 --> 00:57:12,366
Those scoundrels posted it again.

809
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:15,002
I am not sure if he is healthy,

810
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,607
but it seems he has not been caught yet.

811
00:57:20,608 --> 00:57:21,609
Let us move quickly.

812
00:57:23,677 --> 00:57:25,179
Come again!

813
00:57:31,051 --> 00:57:32,786
Enjoy your meal.

814
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:33,787
Wait.

815
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:36,957
Ma'am, bring a jug of rice wine.

816
00:57:36,957 --> 00:57:38,792
I will get it for you.

817
00:57:40,294 --> 00:57:41,762
Sit down.

818
00:57:41,762 --> 00:57:43,731
It seems Cheon Bok likes you.

819
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,468
We do not run that kind of place.

820
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:49,069
I see.

821
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:57,044
Sam Man, it seems
they do not get it with words.

822
00:58:02,082 --> 00:58:05,152
Officers!

823
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:06,253
Please come here.

824
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:09,023
Get inside.

825
00:58:09,456 --> 00:58:11,525
Please come here quickly.

826
00:58:12,393 --> 00:58:15,029
- That was a good meal.
- Quickly, over here!

827
00:58:16,697 --> 00:58:19,266
This way, officers.

828
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:24,171
Split up. Go this way and that way.

829
00:58:42,756 --> 00:58:44,091
Close the door.

830
00:58:44,091 --> 00:58:45,092
Quickly!

831
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,463
Even the officers did not recognize me.

832
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:52,766
But your washed face looks
just like your wanted poster.

833
00:58:52,766 --> 00:58:55,236
- Why are you angry?
- Because I am worried.

834
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:58,639
That lowly thief

835
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,507
does not know his place.

836
00:59:00,507 --> 00:59:04,178
Aunt, I really do not know
why you care about someone like me.

837
00:59:05,145 --> 00:59:06,413
From what I've heard,

838
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:10,284
there is a place

839
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:12,052
where you can buy noble status.

840
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:14,655
I will stay here and wait for Father.

841
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:17,458
It has been over a year.

842
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:20,060
Why would he come back?

843
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,230
Do you think he would believe
you would still be here?

844
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,171
Hide there!

845
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,642
I am coming.

846
00:59:39,813 --> 00:59:41,282
Who are you?

847
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:52,293
It seems that
an important guest is arriving.

848
00:59:52,293 --> 00:59:53,527
Indeed.

849
00:59:53,527 --> 00:59:56,130
The lord over there

850
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:58,899
has rented out our entire inn.

851
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,201
Where are they coming from?

852
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:03,437
They were envoys to the Qing

853
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:06,640
and now they are on their way
to their hometown in Cheongsu County.

854
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,108
Their horses are exhausted,

855
01:00:08,108 --> 01:00:10,778
so they will rest here for two days.

856
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:14,715
Welcome, My Lord. Come in.

857
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:17,818
- Good to see you.
- It must have been a tough journey.

858
01:00:26,193 --> 01:00:29,563
My, how beautiful you are.

859
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:33,968
My lady, please follow me.

860
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:38,138
Come this way.

861
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:52,720
Hello. Nice to meet you.

862
01:00:53,187 --> 01:00:54,521
I am Ok Tae Young.

863
01:01:04,265 --> 01:01:05,566
My goodness!

864
01:01:06,333 --> 01:01:07,334
Gosh.

865
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,236
Sorry. Did I startle you?

866
01:01:09,236 --> 01:01:13,040
My lady, did you come down here alone?

867
01:01:15,476 --> 01:01:17,244
By the way, what is your name?

868
01:01:17,244 --> 01:01:18,812
What should I call you?

869
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,181
Well...

870
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:24,551
"Hey" will do.

871
01:01:25,185 --> 01:01:28,122
Why would you want to know the name
of someone as insignificant as me?

872
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,958
Nobody in the world is insignificant.

873
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:36,196
Welcome.

874
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:00,621
How much for two?

875
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:02,656
Take the money for only one.

876
01:02:09,129 --> 01:02:10,431
Did you not like it?

877
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:14,902
It is not about liking it or not.

878
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:17,037
It just does not suit someone like me.

879
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,038
Goodness.

880
01:02:18,872 --> 01:02:20,574
What ill luck.

881
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:22,743
How dare you shove your filthy body
toward me!

882
01:02:23,711 --> 01:02:25,179
Sorry, sir.

883
01:02:26,647 --> 01:02:28,215
You are the one who bumped into her,

884
01:02:28,215 --> 01:02:30,684
and yet
you don't apologize but scold her.

885
01:02:30,684 --> 01:02:33,053
- You wretch!
- I am sorry, My Lord.

886
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:34,421
My lady, let us go.

887
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:36,890
Apologies, My Lord.

888
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:42,529
One must say the right thing.

889
01:02:42,529 --> 01:02:45,933
You can afford to, my lady,
but I would face consequences if I did.

890
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,534
That is why I did it for you.

891
01:02:48,102 --> 01:02:49,570
I was trying to help you.

892
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:52,306
That was not helping me.
That was pitying me.

893
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:53,774
Pity?

894
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:56,410
You are showing me kindness

895
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,345
to feel superior.

896
01:02:58,879 --> 01:03:00,614
Fine, I understand.

897
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:03,083
It is only right for me to accept that.

898
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:04,151
But you

899
01:03:04,718 --> 01:03:06,487
slip into Hanyang accent
when you're angry.

900
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:10,224
You even used sophisticated words.

901
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:23,771
I do not believe I am superior
because I have more.

902
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:27,207
I believe having more means
I have more responsibility.

903
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,912
I have got so much without effort.

904
01:03:31,912 --> 01:03:34,214
It is only right to help those

905
01:03:35,282 --> 01:03:36,650
who do not have as much.

906
01:03:42,022 --> 01:03:43,591
We seem to be of a similar age.

907
01:03:43,591 --> 01:03:45,526
I wanted to be your friend,
so I followed you.

908
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:48,162
Meeting like this feels like fate.

909
01:03:48,162 --> 01:03:50,130
I wanted us to share matching hairpins.

910
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:53,334
When I saw someone insult you,

911
01:03:53,334 --> 01:03:55,302
I wanted to stand up for you.

912
01:03:55,302 --> 01:03:57,771
It is neither pity
nor a sense of superiority.

913
01:03:58,606 --> 01:04:00,674
I hope you do not get me wrong.

914
01:04:07,414 --> 01:04:09,116
I am truly sorry

915
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:12,853
for making you feel bad.

916
01:04:21,295 --> 01:04:22,396
My name is...

917
01:04:25,132 --> 01:04:26,367
Goodeoki.

918
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,805
It is the name my master gave me...

919
01:04:34,008 --> 01:04:36,510
for me to live like a maggot.

920
01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:48,222
I am

921
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:51,725
a runaway slave from Hanyang.

922
01:04:53,594 --> 01:04:56,897
How could someone as lowly as me
be friends with someone as noble as you?

923
01:04:58,399 --> 01:04:59,733
It is unthinkable.

924
01:05:05,506 --> 01:05:08,609
Why would you being a slave

925
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:10,210
stop us from being friends?

926
01:05:23,223 --> 01:05:24,491
What is your dream?

927
01:05:26,927 --> 01:05:28,028
My dream is

928
01:05:28,896 --> 01:05:31,398
to reunite with my father

929
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:34,401
and build a small house by the sea,

930
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:36,270
and to live happily.

931
01:05:37,371 --> 01:05:39,073
That sounds wonderful.

932
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:40,808
What is your dream, my lady?

933
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:44,044
I want to be a legal advocate.

934
01:05:44,878 --> 01:05:46,113
A legal advocate?

935
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:47,648
It means helping others in court.

936
01:05:48,148 --> 01:05:49,783
Many people suffer injustices

937
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:51,485
but cannot file a lawsuit,

938
01:05:51,485 --> 01:05:53,520
because they cannot read
and understand the law.

939
01:05:54,655 --> 01:05:58,092
I want to help those people.

940
01:05:58,092 --> 01:06:00,327
But even if you are a noblewoman,

941
01:06:01,362 --> 01:06:02,830
in Joseon,

942
01:06:03,897 --> 01:06:06,433
how could a woman hold
a government position?

943
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,469
A legal advocate is not
a government position.

944
01:06:08,469 --> 01:06:10,170
Anyone who can read can do it.

945
01:06:11,372 --> 01:06:13,741
It does not matter if you are a woman.

946
01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:17,244
Really?

947
01:06:17,244 --> 01:06:19,280
I am determined to become one.

948
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:23,317
Even my pen name is "Byeon Ho."

949
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:26,987
"Byeon Ho" meaning "speech" and "help"?

950
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:28,389
You know Chinese characters?

951
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:32,192
Yes. I learned by watching others.

952
01:06:32,192 --> 01:06:34,762
You are really amazing.

953
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,130
Is there anything you cannot do?

954
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:40,901
You are so different
from the other noblewomen I know.

955
01:06:41,902 --> 01:06:44,805
You speak so kindly

956
01:06:45,906 --> 01:06:47,708
and your thoughts are so admirable.

957
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:02,957
This soup is refreshing.

958
01:07:04,692 --> 01:07:05,993
Here.

959
01:07:05,993 --> 01:07:07,428
Thank you.

960
01:07:09,363 --> 01:07:12,333
Thanks to you, I had a good rest.

961
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:15,836
We will leave
early in the morning tomorrow.

962
01:07:16,237 --> 01:07:17,304
So soon?

963
01:07:20,674 --> 01:07:21,842
My Lord.

964
01:07:23,244 --> 01:07:24,745
My Lord.

965
01:07:26,146 --> 01:07:30,184
Could I ask you to take care of her?

966
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,820
Aunt, what are you doing?

967
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,889
She is not my niece.

968
01:07:36,323 --> 01:07:39,727
She has had a hard life,
so I have been looking after her.

969
01:07:39,727 --> 01:07:42,630
She is truly a pitiful
and unfortunate girl.

970
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,298
My Lord.

971
01:07:44,298 --> 01:07:45,966
Please take care of her.

972
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:47,701
My Lord.

973
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:55,309
I left my hometown when I was young,

974
01:07:55,876 --> 01:07:58,012
so I do not know anyone back there.

975
01:07:58,879 --> 01:08:01,782
I have only exchanged letters
with my grandmother and older brother.

976
01:08:01,782 --> 01:08:03,550
I barely remember their faces.

977
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,122
I do not need a servant.

978
01:08:08,756 --> 01:08:09,790
What I need is

979
01:08:12,293 --> 01:08:13,360
a friend.

980
01:08:16,297 --> 01:08:20,434
My lady, thank you so much.

981
01:08:20,434 --> 01:08:22,469
My lady, thank you.

982
01:08:23,804 --> 01:08:25,306
Thank you.

983
01:08:30,377 --> 01:08:31,645
Goodness.

984
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:36,617
You are so lucky to be taken in
as an adopted daughter.

985
01:08:41,322 --> 01:08:42,389
My goodness.

986
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:46,827
You look just like a noblewoman yourself
in silk clothes.

987
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:49,597
What is all this?

988
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:53,033
Is it really okay for me to do this?

989
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:57,238
You are just receiving
the blessings you deserve.

990
01:08:57,238 --> 01:08:59,807
Think of it as heaven's favor, alright?

991
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:03,978
Aunt, can you live without me?

992
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:06,447
Do not worry about me.

993
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,351
I will not be taken advantage of
by the fish merchant again.

994
01:09:10,351 --> 01:09:12,319
If your father ever comes back,

995
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,788
I'll send word to you right away, okay?

996
01:09:16,357 --> 01:09:17,791
Right.

997
01:09:20,461 --> 01:09:21,462
Here.

998
01:09:26,967 --> 01:09:29,470
Have you kept this all along?

999
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:35,676
This was the only thing you had.

1000
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:36,944
How could I sell it?

1001
01:09:37,678 --> 01:09:39,146
Take it.

1002
01:09:40,547 --> 01:09:41,582
Aunt.

1003
01:09:42,349 --> 01:09:44,351
You are pretty.

1004
01:09:47,254 --> 01:09:49,156
My lady.

1005
01:09:50,557 --> 01:09:51,592
Please come in.

1006
01:09:53,227 --> 01:09:56,297
I will leave you two to talk.

1007
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,605
I knew it would suit you.

1008
01:10:05,272 --> 01:10:06,707
You look so lovely.

1009
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:10,311
Wait.

1010
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:22,723
My grandmother gave me this.
It suits you.

1011
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:32,266
What should I give you?

1012
01:10:33,534 --> 01:10:34,535
What?

1013
01:10:35,736 --> 01:10:37,972
I do not have anything,

1014
01:10:39,473 --> 01:10:41,775
so what can I do for you?

1015
01:10:43,444 --> 01:10:45,613
Do not do anything for me.

1016
01:10:46,513 --> 01:10:49,817
From now on, whatever you do,
do it for yourself.

1017
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,254
My lady.

1018
01:10:58,592 --> 01:11:00,628
This is called a "nohoe."

1019
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:02,730
It is a flower from Arabia.

1020
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:04,431
It can be used as a medicine.

1021
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:07,334
It is very resilient
just like my grandmother.

1022
01:11:08,235 --> 01:11:10,137
So this is for her,

1023
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:11,839
and the rest are for the household.

1024
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:18,545
This powder from Qing is for Mak Sim.

1025
01:11:18,545 --> 01:11:21,148
She handles all the household chores,

1026
01:11:21,148 --> 01:11:24,752
never taking care of herself,
so I always worry about her.

1027
01:11:26,053 --> 01:11:28,489
And these silk shoes and fabric are

1028
01:11:29,423 --> 01:11:30,491
for Baekyi.

1029
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:35,296
Baekyi was so pure
and beautiful when she was born,

1030
01:11:35,296 --> 01:11:36,864
so we named her Baekyi.

1031
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:44,972
Right.

1032
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:49,476
And this is a precious medicinal herb.

1033
01:11:49,476 --> 01:11:50,844
It is great for coughs.

1034
01:11:51,946 --> 01:11:54,014
I heard Dokki has been coughing lately,

1035
01:11:54,014 --> 01:11:55,716
so I went to great lengths to get it.

1036
01:11:58,285 --> 01:12:01,355
Did you prepare medicine for a servant,

1037
01:12:02,957 --> 01:12:05,059
because he was coughing?

1038
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:07,962
Yes. Why?

1039
01:12:08,329 --> 01:12:09,663
It is just

1040
01:12:10,631 --> 01:12:13,667
because I like it.

1041
01:12:16,337 --> 01:12:18,205
Is this a dream?

1042
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,741
It feels like it.

1043
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:43,664
My lady.

1044
01:12:43,664 --> 01:12:44,732
Who is there?

1045
01:13:48,963 --> 01:13:50,097
Let's go.

1046
01:13:59,139 --> 01:14:00,140
Father.

1047
01:14:10,017 --> 01:14:11,185
Tae Young.

1048
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:20,527
Father.

1049
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:22,830
My lady, you must go.

1050
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:23,897
Father.

1051
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:54,395
Aunt.

1052
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:57,531
Aunt.

1053
01:15:01,402 --> 01:15:04,605
Aunt.

1054
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:07,841
Aunt.

1055
01:15:08,442 --> 01:15:09,643
Aunt.

1056
01:15:09,643 --> 01:15:10,678
I caught you.

1057
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:21,889
My lady.

1058
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:34,668
My lady.

1059
01:15:37,304 --> 01:15:38,305
My lady.

1060
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:53,347
I will go check.

1061
01:17:17,771 --> 01:17:19,039
My lady!

1062
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:20,507
My lady!

1063
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:22,243
My lady!

1064
01:17:28,749 --> 01:17:29,750
My lady!

1065
01:17:50,337 --> 01:17:53,040
My lady, we must go.

1066
01:17:57,411 --> 01:17:58,412
My lady.

1067
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,955
You must live.

1068
01:18:09,456 --> 01:18:10,891
Live on, and you must

1069
01:18:12,259 --> 01:18:13,727
fulfill your dreams.

1070
01:18:14,161 --> 01:18:16,597
My lady, no.

1071
01:18:16,597 --> 01:18:18,866
My lady!

1072
01:19:36,043 --> 01:19:37,044
Look!

1073
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:46,854
Are you awake?

1074
01:20:05,673 --> 01:20:06,774
Grandmother?

1075
01:20:11,111 --> 01:20:12,146
My lady.

1076
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:17,551
Baekyi?

1077
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,188
Do you remember me?

1078
01:20:24,692 --> 01:20:26,894
Thank you.

1079
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:29,229
Thank you for staying alive.

1080
01:20:30,097 --> 01:20:33,334
It is such a relief that you survived.

1081
01:20:33,334 --> 01:20:34,535
Thank you.

1082
01:20:36,437 --> 01:20:37,838
That is...

1083
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:39,139
- My lady is...
- My Tae Young.

1084
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,542
You have grown so much, Tae Young.

1085
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:45,679
My Tae Young.

1086
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,983
You are Tae Young, right?

1087
01:21:07,234 --> 01:21:08,269
Yes.

1088
01:21:24,184 --> 01:21:25,414
That was

1089
01:21:26,697 --> 01:21:27,817
the first lie.

1090
01:22:15,736 --> 01:22:20,307
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1091
01:22:20,307 --> 01:22:23,077
Remember, no one is allowed

1092
01:22:23,077 --> 01:22:24,678
to go near the annex.

1093
01:22:24,678 --> 01:22:27,248
If anyone leaked
about our family affairs

1094
01:22:27,248 --> 01:22:29,283
and it reaches the ears
of those society ladies...

1095
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:31,485
But that granddaughter.

1096
01:22:31,485 --> 01:22:34,989
What if she suffered something terrible
at the hands of bandits?

1097
01:22:34,989 --> 01:22:37,258
Her audacity truly knows no bounds.

1098
01:22:37,258 --> 01:22:39,393
How dare she not even show her face!

1099
01:22:39,393 --> 01:22:41,562
It will not be an easy life.
