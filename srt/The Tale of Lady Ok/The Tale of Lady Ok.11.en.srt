00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,071
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,982
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,065
I am Seong Yun Gyeom. Glad to meet you.

5
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,936
Look. The sky looks so beautiful today.

6
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,004
I can't tell any difference.

7
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,941
You are so dull.

8
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:14,842
So take care.

9
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:15,976
Have you eaten?

10
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,980
- Be careful.
- Are you okay?

11
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,548
- Take care.
- Yes.

12
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,083
- Be careful.
- Yes.

13
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:31,225
She came to me and said...

14
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:33,961
Dear.

15
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,729
That is what she called me.

16
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:37,764
Huh?

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,035
Yes, I am your

18
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:44,905
husband.

19
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,712
Today, thanks to you,

20
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:54,848
Cheongsu County smells sweet,
like flowers.

21
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,149
It is the smell of manure.

22
00:01:57,084 --> 00:01:58,752
Even so,

23
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,221
it is nice.

24
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,524
Come. Let us walk together.

25
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,128
Yes.

26
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:08,962
We

27
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,965
have decided not to leave.

28
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:12,833
Huh?

29
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,336
Not leaving?
You are going to settle here?

30
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,605
- Yes.
- That is great.

31
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,008
Mak Sim, we won't be separated anymore.

32
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,177
I am so happy.

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,846
That is a wonderful decision, Tae Young.

34
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,781
But will it be all right?

35
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,616
Why would it not be?

36
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:32,085
In Cheongsu County,
he is already Yun Gyeom.

37
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:35,088
Still, you should remain careful.

38
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,290
Don't worry.

39
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,792
I will make sure we won't get caught.

40
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,595
Flawlessly, without a slightest error.

41
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,634
Why are you so troubled?

42
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:52,339
Can you read my thoughts
through my expression?

43
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,207
Of course.

44
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,478
Then, guess how I feel.

45
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,948
First,

46
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,052
you feel a little embarrassed
about having changed your mind.

47
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:09,389
And you worry it may
bring harm to the family.

48
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,657
Am I right?

49
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,695
You truly are a genius,
worthy of top honors.

50
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,599
Tae Young.

51
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,268
I brought Yun Gyeom here

52
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,737
not for the family's sake.

53
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,208
It was for your.

54
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:35,749
Do you know this is the first decision
you made for yourself?

55
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,287
So, don't worry about others.

56
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:44,091
Live your life now for your happiness.

57
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:04,411
(Song's Grave)

58
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:14,988
My goodness.

59
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,792
It seems she was not evicted.

60
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,394
Seems so.

61
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,665
If I were them, I'd not be able
to live with a murderer's daughter.

62
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,302
Shouldn't they make her move out
or something?

63
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:30,971
How can anyone live near her?

64
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,973
- That is true.
- Unbelievable.

65
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,786
Just leave me be.

66
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,688
I can handle it myself.

67
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,027
You return safely?

68
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:56,830
Yes.

69
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:01,835
Thanks to your care,
I was able to honor my mother well.

70
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:05,439
It was Yun Gyeom and Tae Young
who suggested it, not me.

71
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,711
Yes.

72
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,121
You don't need to try too hard.

73
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,459
You probably have no feelings
for me anyway.

74
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,061
My feelings...

75
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,832
You speak as if you know them all.

76
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,638
Even if you hate me,

77
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,974
please be a good father to the child.

78
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,779
Yes, don't worry.

79
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,583
I will try my best to be a good father.

80
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,821
You brought me back

81
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,624
because of the child, right?

82
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,931
What other reason could there be?

83
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,335
The reason you stay

84
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,239
was also solely for the child. Right?

85
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,546
Please get some rest.

86
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,566
Ignore what others say.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,970
She was acquitted,
and both you and Do Gyeom accepted her.

88
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,271
What does it matter?

89
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,640
She is strong.

90
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,609
Seven years ago,
after the Mt. Unbong incident,

91
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,844
I faced humiliation in Cheongsu County.

92
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,480
I even live apart
from Deok Hun's father.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,182
But does anyone dare slander me?

94
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,385
As long as you do your part,

95
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,221
no one can say anything against you.

96
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:06,293
Tell Mi Ryeong
to join the Mother's Association.

97
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:11,365
Won't the other women oppose to it?

98
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,734
So what? I am the Head Lady.

99
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,837
Besides, with the Chief Lady
staying secluded,

100
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,805
any gossip will not last long.

101
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,343
Thank you so much
for always taking care of us, Head Lady.

102
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:28,882
So, will you open
the legal advocate's office soon?

103
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,584
Yes.

104
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:32,986
Why do you ask?

105
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,255
Opening the office is important,

106
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,926
but at your age,
you should think of having a baby soon.

107
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,763
What are you talk about?

108
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:46,200
Truly, you are like a newlywed,
am I right?

109
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,836
My goodness.

110
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,271
I should get going.

111
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:04,952
Oh.

112
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,795
Is it finally my turn now?

113
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,265
Yes, I am always quite busy.

114
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,103
Are you checking the ledgers now?

115
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,574
I was checking them
to find fault with you,

116
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,976
but as you can see,

117
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:32,946
there is nothing faulty.

118
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,253
Without your husband,

119
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:40,921
handling the legal work
and the household

120
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:42,589
must have been overwhelming.

121
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,393
I will help you with everything
in the future.

122
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,694
So take it easy now.

123
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,397
Okay.

124
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,534
If you have any concerns,
just let me know.

125
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,036
Speaking of concerns...

126
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:01,842
Oh. I am a bit worried about the delay
in Do Gyeom's placement.

127
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,710
I hear bribery is rampant lately.

128
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,245
Could that be the cause?

129
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,414
Provincial positions favor corruption,

130
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,583
so many must be vying for them.

131
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:13,387
I'm also worried about who will
take over in Cheongsu County.

132
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,489
If someone like Do Gyeom
became an inspector

133
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,658
and cleaned them all up,
it would be great.

134
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,229
That would make a great story.

135
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,731
The title could be
"The Inspector and the Legal Advocate."

136
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,968
The inspector
and his legal advocate sister-in-law

137
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:32,172
join forces
to clean up corrupt officials.

138
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,808
Even if you cannot perform,

139
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,344
why not write a novel under a pseudonym?

140
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,581
Your work has inspired
and uplifted so many people.

141
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,016
It is a shame to stop because of me.

142
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,086
That won't do.

143
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:50,123
If people find out Chon Seung Hwi
is alive and still writing,

144
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:51,458
it will be a disaster.

145
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,593
So you should not have...

146
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,799
But it is too late to turn back now.
What can I do?

147
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,638
Won't you find this life boring?

148
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,707
Not at all.

149
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:10,377
Playing the role of a supportive
husband to a capable wife

150
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,180
is incredibly enjoyable.

151
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:18,318
Then, dear husband,
as you must rise early,

152
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,786
get some sleep now.

153
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,854
Well...

154
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,257
Are you leaving?

155
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,958
Yes. Why?

156
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,695
Nothing.

157
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,075
To welcome a new member...

158
00:10:43,177 --> 00:10:45,579
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

159
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,283
This is nice.

160
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:55,155
But why is someone
from Lord Song's household part of ours?

161
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:03,597
When you ask so directly,
I have no idea how to answer.

162
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,534
Right? I tend to be sharp
and straightforward.

163
00:11:07,534 --> 00:11:08,769
Yes, that is true.

164
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,638
He is the smartest in Cheongsu County.

165
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,441
But as for Lord Song's household,
I don't know anything.

166
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:15,742
But here is the thing.

167
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:19,146
He served the Elder Master
when he was away.

168
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,948
- That is all you need to know.
- Yes.

169
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:26,053
Then, since when did you stay
with the Elder Master?

170
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:28,155
The Elder Master lost his memory,

171
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,257
so he only remembers
the last two months.

172
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:31,483
If you knew him before that,

173
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:33,260
you'd know where he was and who he is.

174
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,063
You would have known it all, right?
Am I wrong?

175
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,399
Smart indeed.

176
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:41,401
So smart, really clever.

177
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,203
Stop beating about the bush.

178
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,105
Tell me everything.

179
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,709
Am I the only one unaware
of what is happening here?

180
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,911
What good will it do if you know?

181
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:54,081
If the elders say it is so,
just accept it.

182
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,484
I suppose so.

183
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,653
Nice to meet you!

184
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:00,921
What does it matter?

185
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,056
Come on, cheers!

186
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,092
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

187
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,463
So, how old are you this year?

188
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,599
Now that we are family,
should we sort out the ranks?

189
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,202
What ranks? He looks mid-thirties.

190
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:18,705
You seem young,
so just call me Aunt Mak Sim.

191
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,041
Aunt? No way.

192
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,312
Here, have a drink,

193
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,481
Miss.

194
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:29,917
Miss?

195
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:37,191
Then you should call me sir.

196
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,592
Sir? No way.

197
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,495
Hey, I am older than you think.
I just look young.

198
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:42,663
- Really?
- Yes.

199
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:45,499
Hey, even if you are old,
could you be older than me?

200
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:48,936
If you keep acting like that,
you will lose all your teeth.

201
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,204
Want me to fix you up?

202
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,542
Fix him up.

203
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:56,844
That is hilarious.

204
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:02,950
Be careful of the jar.

205
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,155
Mak Sim, do you find this funny?
Is it funny?

206
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:09,723
It is funny.

207
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:13,126
Hanyang folks even joke in style.

208
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:16,129
So, how old are you?

209
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,631
Why are you so curious?

210
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:19,166
Should I show my identification tag?

211
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:20,601
Show it! Show it right now!

212
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,603
Come on, no need for that!

213
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,506
Is age all you have to boast about?

214
00:13:25,506 --> 00:13:26,874
Exactly, my goodness.

215
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,009
Miss, raise your glass.

216
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:30,677
This?

217
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,547
Now, link arms like this.
Yes, that is right.

218
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:35,215
Now pull closer.

219
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,917
Pull more.

220
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:38,852
And drink up.

221
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,320
Mak Sim, what are you doing?

222
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,394
What is this?

223
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,697
This is called "love cheers," Miss.

224
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,999
Oh.

225
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,535
Love cheersLove cheers?
Is this trending in Hanyang?

226
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:56,336
Like this?

227
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,541
How does it taste?

228
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,743
- Sweet.
- Sweet?

229
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,847
♪Sweet bright moon♪

230
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,351
♪The moon Li Bai enjoyed♪

231
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,853
Have you gone mad?

232
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,421
Mak Sim, are you drunk already?

233
00:14:40,581 --> 00:14:42,883
It is me.

234
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:47,588
What are you doing here?

235
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,389
What am I doing?

236
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:52,526
Preparing to sleep, of course,
at this hour at night.

237
00:14:52,526 --> 00:14:55,796
But why sleep here
instead of in your room?

238
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:56,930
What?

239
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,402
Are you pretending not to know,
or do you truly not understand?

240
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:03,904
Understand what?

241
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:05,906
What do you mean?

242
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,610
Do I really have to explain it?

243
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,311
What?

244
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,346
Goodness.

245
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,849
Did we not agree to live
as husband and wife?

246
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:17,818
Yes.

247
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:20,654
Then, as a married couple,
we should share the same bed.

248
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,589
The same bed?

249
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,091
My goodness!

250
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,259
What is so shocking?

251
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,261
What misunderstanding do you have?

252
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:28,795
What misunderstanding?

253
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,231
I said we should live
like a married couple.

254
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,666
When did I say we should live
as a married couple?

255
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,668
Isn't that the same?

256
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:36,703
How can you be so slow to understand?

257
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:41,041
I am slow to understand?
I have never heard that before.

258
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,409
You must have heard it before.

259
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,945
But you couldn't have gotten it
since you are slow to understand.

260
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,581
We have not had an official wedding.

261
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:49,616
We are only pretending
to be a married couple.

262
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,652
How could we share a bed?

263
00:15:51,652 --> 00:15:53,453
You truly are a sly one.

264
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,156
I am not sly.

265
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:59,359
I just worry about your safety.

266
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,295
- Safety?
- Yes.

267
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,763
When I pretend to be someone else,

268
00:16:02,763 --> 00:16:04,932
I have to do it properly,
or I will get caught quickly.

269
00:16:04,932 --> 00:16:06,600
How many times have I told you this?

270
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,137
This is the only way
we can look like a real couple.

271
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:14,274
You may be slow to understand,
but you can speak smoothly.

272
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:16,910
Are you insulting or complimenting me?

273
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,146
Anyway, you must leave
before someone sees you.

274
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:21,081
Who would see me?

275
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,317
Your brother-in-law brought me here,

276
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,552
and it also means
he allowed me to sleep here.

277
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:29,022
So are you saying
my permission is unnecessary?

278
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:35,896
I give up.

279
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:37,364
Please leave.

280
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,432
Then,

281
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,034
- I will just hold your hand and sleep.
- No way.

282
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,904
That is so petty.

283
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,508
Do not change your mind later.

284
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,408
Fine.

285
00:16:50,744 --> 00:16:52,412
- Even if you regret it later...
- Fine.

286
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:55,282
Whatever.

287
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,852
Really...

288
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:13,267
I brought some food
for when you feel hungry.

289
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:23,177
I joined the Mother's Association
and will go to the Mother's Sanctuary.

290
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:27,648
I will get advice from the women
who raised children and learn a lot.

291
00:17:27,648 --> 00:17:29,483
Do you really have to do that?

292
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,121
It is for the child.

293
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,156
This is a gossip-filled town.

294
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,463
You don't want me to go out?

295
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,966
If you are hurt by the gossip,

296
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,770
it will not be good for my child.

297
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,275
Fine.

298
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:59,613
I will tell Tae Young
and stay home from now on.

299
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:01,815
Well...

300
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:18,498
Oh?

301
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,369
Is breakfast ready already?

302
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,971
I was just about to go out.

303
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,873
That is how it turned out.

304
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:29,209
Here. Have some mung bean porridge.

305
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:30,143
Mung bean porridge?

306
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:33,814
The Elder Master asked
what you liked and had it made.

307
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,816
He even tasted it himself.

308
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:38,218
- Really?
- Yes.

309
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:39,553
Shall I try it?

310
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:45,959
It is salty.

311
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,927
Right?

312
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,429
- But it is still delicious.
- Yes.

313
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,464
Right.

314
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,267
Before the harvest,
we need to check the granary again.

315
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:55,569
Can you ask the servants
to double-check the quantities?

316
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:58,172
It is already done.

317
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,007
The Elder Master did it.

318
00:19:00,007 --> 00:19:00,841
Huh?

319
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:05,679
Last night, he asked
for every servant's name and details.

320
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,481
So, Samdori?

321
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:08,549
Here.

322
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,984
Go bring all the old furniture out.

323
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:11,919
Boknyeo.

324
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,988
Boknyeo, take out all the dishes

325
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,057
and help Mak Sim organize the granary.

326
00:19:17,057 --> 00:19:18,559
Childeuki.

327
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,560
Yes, that is me.

328
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,995
Bring all the old farming tools.

329
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,564
- Kkeutdongi.
- Yes.

330
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:25,599
- Organize the records.
- Understood.

331
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:28,936
Take this as well.

332
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:31,138
Here, Bokdol. Take it with you.

333
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,673
That is not all.

334
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:37,311
From counting kitchenware
to checking granary tools,

335
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:41,815
he inspected every item

336
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:45,319
and recorded them in detail.

337
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:51,758
He said he wants you to focus
on your advocate work from now on

338
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,361
and he'd handle the housework for you.

339
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,297
How reassuring that is.

340
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,845
Stop cutting that.

341
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,581
Go fetch some cold drinking water
for everyone.

342
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,252
Here, this one.

343
00:20:18,252 --> 00:20:19,386
- Do you see the crack?
- Yes.

344
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,788
If we leave it, the grains
will absorb moisture and spoil.

345
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,056
Patch it up.

346
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,959
Also, do you see the cracks
in the beams and rafters?

347
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,728
Fix that quickly.

348
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:31,331
Elder Madam already asked
for repairmen to handle it.

349
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:33,600
From now on, report any house issues
to me, not her,

350
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,536
so we do not trouble her anymore.

351
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:36,670
Yes, Elder Master.

352
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:40,841
Tae Young, are you heading out now?

353
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:43,911
Why are you so busy
this early in the morning?

354
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:46,146
There is so much to fix.

355
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:49,416
I will check and handle everything
carefully, so don't worry.

356
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:52,786
So, will you join me on the way to work?

357
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,889
I would love to,
but I don't know much about the law.

358
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:59,159
I'm afraid I might
only be a distraction.

359
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,461
Then I will be off on my own.

360
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,396
Yes.

361
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:03,297
Wait a moment.

362
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:08,168
Are you nervous
about returning to work after so long?

363
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:09,002
Me?

364
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,473
Honestly, I get nervous every time
I go on stage as well.

365
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,810
I have my own way of calming down.

366
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,546
Give me your hands.

367
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,053
Now, repeat after me.

368
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:29,356
"I am the best. I am amazing."

369
00:21:30,424 --> 00:21:31,458
Huh?

370
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,394
- I cannot watch this.
- Where are you going?

371
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,797
Come on, repeat after me.
"I am amazing."

372
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:46,974
What are you doing? Go now.

373
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,410
Repeat. "I am amazing."

374
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,680
I am amazing.

375
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,681
Louder.

376
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:57,351
I am amazing!

377
00:21:57,351 --> 00:21:58,485
"I am the best."

378
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,024
- I am the best!
- Now louder together.

379
00:22:04,024 --> 00:22:05,993
I am amazing! I am the best!

380
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:10,564
What you say will come true.

381
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:12,065
This works better than you think.

382
00:22:13,133 --> 00:22:14,168
Thank you.

383
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:33,954
Was fasting not essential for you now?

384
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:35,789
Have you given up on staying in shape?

385
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:39,126
I'm not an artist anymore, so who cares?

386
00:22:39,493 --> 00:22:41,828
I have waited so long for this moment.

387
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,064
This tastes so sweet.

388
00:22:44,064 --> 00:22:46,934
Mak Sim, you're truly gifted in cooking.

389
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:51,805
I just learned by watching Elder Madam
over her shoulder.

390
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:54,241
That is true. Madam has had
great cooking skills

391
00:22:54,241 --> 00:22:55,943
since her days as a servant...

392
00:23:02,182 --> 00:23:04,051
You have lost it?

393
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,154
I must have gone mad.

394
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:10,090
But what was I talking about?

395
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,592
What do I do?

396
00:23:11,592 --> 00:23:16,430
Well, Miss...

397
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,899
What he meant to say just now is...

398
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,268
Yes, what was he trying to say?

399
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,171
My goodness.

400
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:25,739
Yes?

401
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:28,509
Yes?

402
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,752
Don't worry. I already knew.

403
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,720
Huh?

404
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,756
As I expected, both of you already knew.

405
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,158
Well...

406
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:52,065
Then, in this house,
only you knew all along?

407
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:53,400
Yes.

408
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,801
Shh.

409
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:56,970
I was scared to death.

410
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,740
What if I slip up and say something?

411
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,941
Just keep your mouth...

412
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:04,878
Simply think of her as our Madam.
That works for me.

413
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:07,915
I have learned another lesson, Miss.

414
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,283
Yes, I will do the same.

415
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:12,586
Exactly. If we get caught,
it is over for all of us.

416
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:13,620
Yes.

417
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:17,324
But thanks to you, Mak Sim,

418
00:24:17,758 --> 00:24:19,493
Tae Young must have been less lonely.

419
00:24:20,327 --> 00:24:22,262
How could I have been any help?

420
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:25,399
After enduring such a long, lonely time,

421
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:28,101
to see a day as wonderful as this,

422
00:24:28,101 --> 00:24:30,801
I am truly,

423
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,802
truly happy now.

424
00:24:33,674 --> 00:24:34,675
Now if only...

425
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:38,879
you two would consummate,
I would have no more wishes.

426
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,287
Well, water.

427
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:49,990
Bring me some water!

428
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,127
I am telling you,
last night he was completely rejected.

429
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,597
It must be because she is worried
about having a child.

430
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:59,600
That is why she refused to marry.

431
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,736
It is because of her background.

432
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:07,140
In a world where people adopt heirs,
what is she worrying about?

433
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,842
- Exactly.
- My goodness.

434
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,847
Miss, is there a long pole
in this house?

435
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:17,251
Every household has one.
Why do you need it?

436
00:25:17,251 --> 00:25:19,887
- What are you whispering about?
- You startled me.

437
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:22,189
Why do you sneak up like that,
acting all sly?

438
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,624
I just got here.

439
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:26,493
What is it? Tell me.

440
00:25:26,493 --> 00:25:28,529
You don't need to know.

441
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,463
Why not?

442
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,231
Lack of awareness?

443
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:32,599
Why shouldn't I know?

444
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,735
Why can't I know?

445
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,703
Come on...

446
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,505
Go inside.

447
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,575
Did you request a correction
at the government office last time?

448
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:43,143
Still not resolved?

449
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:44,077
No.

450
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:48,415
The corrupt Magistrate kept delaying it
until he got caught and died.

451
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,318
What should I do now, Madam?

452
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,420
I have no farmland left.

453
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,556
The head officer and the Yuhyangso

454
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,891
keep demanding taxes from me.

455
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:00,394
My young ones
have been starving for days.

456
00:26:01,094 --> 00:26:02,763
We are all going to die.

457
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,231
Madam.

458
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:08,468
Take this and share it
with your children.

459
00:26:08,468 --> 00:26:11,505
I will resolve the farmland issue
as quickly as I can. Please wait.

460
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,241
Thank you so much, Madam.

461
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:16,777
Truly, thank you!

462
00:26:19,613 --> 00:26:22,182
Hey, I have something for you.

463
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:23,250
Oh?

464
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,820
Thank you, Mak Sim.

465
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,024
Good thing no one took this.

466
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,293
What is this?

467
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:36,091
The Elder Master said
since you talk a lot,

468
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:37,564
your throat must hurt.

469
00:26:37,564 --> 00:26:39,433
So he prepared some bellflower tea
for you.

470
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,802
I see.

471
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:42,736
And also,

472
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,706
he asked me to give you this.

473
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:52,446
(Forgive me for my clumsiness
last night, Tae Young.)

474
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:57,651
(Why does my heart
always run ahead of yours)

475
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,753
(like a child urging you to come?)

476
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:01,688
(I am truly ashamed.)

477
00:27:02,823 --> 00:27:06,994
(From now on, I will never rush you,
so don't worry.)

478
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:09,963
(However, if you call for me,)

479
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:12,132
(I will run to you barefoot
without hesitation.)

480
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:21,108
What did he say that made you laugh?

481
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:25,345
He said he'd run barefoot.

482
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:26,647
Huh?

483
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,849
No matter how urgent,

484
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:32,786
how could a nobleman discard manners
and run barefoot?

485
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,122
Right?

486
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:38,740
He is hilarious.

487
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,167
It is hot here.

488
00:28:01,381 --> 00:28:03,450
What brings you here?

489
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,618
Oh.

490
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,855
I came to read poems to the child.

491
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:13,093
Leave it here. I will read it.

492
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:15,996
I wanted the child to hear
the father's voice.

493
00:28:16,496 --> 00:28:19,299
If you read it instead,
what is the point?

494
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:24,238
If I am uncomfortable,
the child will feel it too.

495
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:25,839
Bear with it for a little while.

496
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,275
I will leave as soon as
I finish reading.

497
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,214
Why is this room so hot?

498
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:38,285
You being cold could harm the child,

499
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:40,687
so I had the fire kept up.

500
00:28:40,687 --> 00:28:42,122
Endure it for the child's sake.

501
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:48,028
To you, I am merely

502
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:50,264
the mother of this child, right?

503
00:28:55,536 --> 00:28:57,104
Yes, that is true.

504
00:28:58,539 --> 00:28:59,473
Then

505
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,410
I must abandon manners
and remove my clothes in your presence.

506
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,617
Wait...

507
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,296
Are you finished now?

508
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,933
Why wait outside instead of coming in?

509
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,602
I didn't want to disturb you.

510
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,972
Not to disturb you, I will leave now.

511
00:29:33,307 --> 00:29:35,542
Anything wrong?

512
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:38,078
Nothing. I just wanted to walk with you.

513
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:42,015
On my way here,
I found such a beautiful starlit path.

514
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:45,686
Shall we go?

515
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:52,092
I will request taxes be charged
to the one who bought the farmland

516
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:55,963
and ask the Yuhyangso
to process refunds promptly.

517
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:59,867
They have probably already taxed
the buyer, as well.

518
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:03,203
This must be boring for you.

519
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:04,938
Not at all.

520
00:30:04,938 --> 00:30:07,908
Hearing about your day makes me feel
like I was right there with you.

521
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,046
Oh. About the petition
for the Yuhyangso,

522
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:15,649
you can give it to me,
and I will deliver it.

523
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:17,985
As for Lee, whose children are starving,

524
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,354
and Kim from Daepung County,
who was taxed twice,

525
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:21,788
we are lending them some grain, right?

526
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:24,992
Did you check the loan records too?

527
00:30:24,992 --> 00:30:28,862
I thought you only helped the oppressed

528
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:32,499
who lacked knowledge of the law.

529
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,835
I had no idea you were involved
in charity work as well.

530
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,938
Everything will be paid off.

531
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:40,474
And from those who can pay,

532
00:30:40,474 --> 00:30:43,177
I charge a sufficient fee,
so don't worry.

533
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:51,485
I thought I knew you well,

534
00:30:51,485 --> 00:30:55,722
but the more I learn,
the more I admire you.

535
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,724
It is not admirable.

536
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:01,528
Having struggled myself,

537
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:05,399
I simply understand
the struggles of others.

538
00:31:11,572 --> 00:31:14,842
What do you mean the ceiling
in Yun Gyeom's room collapsed?

539
00:31:14,842 --> 00:31:17,945
- Huh?
- It was fine before.

540
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:20,547
Now it looks like someone poked it
with a long pole.

541
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:22,316
Why are you looking at me?

542
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:23,550
I don't know anything.

543
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:26,253
Anyway, it needs to be fixed quickly.

544
00:31:26,253 --> 00:31:27,721
Take your time fixing it.

545
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,823
- What are you saying?
- Nothing.

546
00:31:31,592 --> 00:31:33,493
But where will I sleep tonight?

547
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:37,731
Sleep in the study.
It is the largest room.

548
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,336
Why are you all glaring at me like that?

549
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:45,772
Sleep in my room.
I will stay with Mi Ryeong.

550
00:31:45,772 --> 00:31:48,909
Will you?

551
00:31:49,142 --> 00:31:50,477
My goodness.

552
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:54,648
Who knows when the younger couple
will share the room?

553
00:31:55,516 --> 00:31:57,384
Indeed.

554
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:58,318
Is that so?

555
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,419
I guess.

556
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,121
Then what should we do?

557
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:04,825
I find this truly odd.

558
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:07,761
You two are married.
Why not share a room?

559
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:08,695
Isn't that right?

560
00:32:08,695 --> 00:32:10,531
Exactly.

561
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:12,266
- Indeed.
- Yes.

562
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:15,169
Anyone would think
you two were a fake couple.

563
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,008
Why?

564
00:32:21,008 --> 00:32:23,010
Why do you speak like that?

565
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,878
Who are you calling fake?

566
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:27,314
Why are you upset? What did I do?

567
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:29,283
Enough, both of you. Go to bed now.

568
00:32:29,283 --> 00:32:30,417
Am I wrong?

569
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,186
- Watch your mouth.
- Be careful.

570
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:35,489
What do you mean?
Sharing a room is what they should do.

571
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:38,659
Let us go inside.

572
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,093
- No.
- Well...

573
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:57,544
Come to think of it, it has been
a long time since we lay together.

574
00:32:59,012 --> 00:33:00,747
It was back at Mt. Unbong.

575
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,984
That must have been
over seven years ago.

576
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:08,088
I never imagined we'd be lying here
as a married couple.

577
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:10,490
Neither did I.

578
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:18,298
Speaking of Mt. Unbong,
I have been curious about something.

579
00:33:21,001 --> 00:33:22,569
At that time,

580
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:26,640
when we fell into the water...

581
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,114
did we kiss back then?

582
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:43,924
I had almost lost my life then.

583
00:33:43,924 --> 00:33:46,026
How could you call that a kiss?

584
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,228
No, I just wondered

585
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,731
if we were ever to kiss,

586
00:33:50,731 --> 00:33:52,866
would it be the first time or second?

587
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,034
It would be the first.

588
00:33:57,604 --> 00:33:58,805
Understood.

589
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:01,074
Stop pouting and lie down to sleep.

590
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,176
You must be tired.

591
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:19,459
Will you keep rustling around?

592
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,729
I am sorry.
I am nocturnal, so I cannot sleep.

593
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,799
Would you like a book I used to read
when I couldn't sleep?

594
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:29,102
Over there.

595
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:34,007
(By Chon Seung Hwi)

596
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,715
Isn't this my book?

597
00:34:41,715 --> 00:34:43,784
Was my book so boring

598
00:34:43,784 --> 00:34:45,953
that you used it to help you sleep?

599
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,589
How could that be?

600
00:34:49,556 --> 00:34:51,458
Why is this so worn out?

601
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:53,827
How many times have you read this?

602
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:56,964
I have severe insomnia.

603
00:34:58,665 --> 00:35:01,268
Reading your book calms my mind,

604
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,003
so I read it over and over again.

605
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,141
Your books have been my companions
through many sleepless nights.

606
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,752
Father.

607
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,855
Die!

608
00:35:21,855 --> 00:35:22,923
Die!

609
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:25,225
Die! Just die now!

610
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:30,130
Die, you wretched maggot!

611
00:35:44,444 --> 00:35:46,213
Tae Young, are you okay?

612
00:35:51,618 --> 00:35:56,356
What kind of dream brought you
such sorrowful tears?

613
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:01,995
Lady So Hye...

614
00:36:05,732 --> 00:36:07,734
and my father.

615
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:17,144
He must have passed, right?

616
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:26,119
Does this happen often?

617
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:29,256
Yes.

618
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:33,327
And each time, you read my book
to pass the sleepless hours?

619
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:37,231
Yes.

620
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:44,938
Then...

621
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,010
shall I become your storyteller again,

622
00:36:51,311 --> 00:36:53,347
like back at Mt. Unbong?

623
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,084
Will you read to me?

624
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:00,954
Come on, lie down

625
00:37:00,954 --> 00:37:02,789
before I change my mind.

626
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,434
In a hall where the crowd,

627
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:17,704
bewitched by joy, had lost themselves,

628
00:37:19,473 --> 00:37:23,143
stood a young lord,

629
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:25,145
disguised and watching intently.

630
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,516
In the midst of a dull arranged marriage

631
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:32,619
and a tiresome performance,

632
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:37,391
a peanut merchant in a bamboo hat
approached unexpectedly.

633
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:39,893
The peanut merchant spoke roughly,

634
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,362
but the pretty features revealed

635
00:37:42,362 --> 00:37:43,997
she was a woman.

636
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:48,335
That day, snow fell from the sky,

637
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:52,472
and the young lord fell for the woman.

638
00:37:54,641 --> 00:37:58,712
Of all people, the one to stir my heart
for the first time

639
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,848
is a servant of my betrothed.

640
00:38:02,015 --> 00:38:03,884
What a cruel joke of fate.

641
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,920
If I were of the same status as you,

642
00:38:07,688 --> 00:38:09,957
I would have confessed
my feelings immediately.

643
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,061
For some reason,

644
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:19,867
I cannot sleep
even as the night deepens.

645
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:56,270
I have wished for you
to sleep soundly just once,

646
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:09,349
but how can life be so hard for you?

647
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,716
I am the one who poked a hole
in the ceiling with a long pole.

648
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,727
Hey, when you went to Hanyang,

649
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:56,029
did you hear anything about Lady So Hye?

650
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:56,930
Huh?

651
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,834
Goodeoki's father
was not caught or anything, right?

652
00:40:01,935 --> 00:40:03,604
No, he was not caught.

653
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:06,106
And I heard
Lady So Hye is getting married.

654
00:40:06,106 --> 00:40:07,007
Huh?

655
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:09,109
Do you mean she is still not married?

656
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:10,277
How could she marry?

657
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:13,080
Her betrothed was taken
by Goodeoki, a servant.

658
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,482
She got drenched in filth
from head to toe.

659
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,984
They call her "Dung So Hye."

660
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:33,967
My Lady, come and check this out.

661
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:36,261
This is another gift
from Minister of Taxation

662
00:40:36,262 --> 00:40:38,038
for your wedding.

663
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:40,507
Do you looking for death?

664
00:40:40,507 --> 00:40:42,676
Knowing that I am being sold
as a concubine,

665
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,178
you call this a wedding?

666
00:40:44,178 --> 00:40:45,846
My goodness.

667
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:49,383
Minister of Taxation is sending
such treasures. What a generous man.

668
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,285
Does this please you?

669
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,321
Selling your house and your daughter
to beg for a position?

670
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:56,757
You think your father should not enjoy

671
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:58,025
some comfort due to his daughter?

672
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,160
How could you

673
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,864
send your only daughter
to be a concubine to an old man?

674
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:05,832
Old man? Watch your words!

675
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:09,102
He is the Minister of Taxation,
Lord Bak Jun Gi, the right-hand man

676
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:12,773
of the Chief Minister,
who practically holds Joseon in his grasp.

677
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,142
This is all because
of that maggot, Goodeoki.

678
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,910
If I find her...

679
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,212
Enough.

680
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:21,181
Do you know how much of my money
you have wasted trying to find her?

681
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:24,284
We have searched all over Joseon,
and she has not turned up.

682
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:25,853
She must be dead by now.

683
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:30,224
Of course, she must have died already.

684
00:41:31,058 --> 00:41:33,861
If you had not helped her escape...

685
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:36,530
I told you we did not.
There you go again.

686
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,464
Shut up!

687
00:41:38,232 --> 00:41:40,000
Is being a cripple not enough?

688
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,369
Should I cut out your tongue
and brand you too?

689
00:41:44,037 --> 00:41:46,940
Now go and serve
Minister of Taxation well.

690
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,275
Forget about the past.

691
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,579
I want to forget as well.

692
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:54,715
But every time I open my eyes,

693
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:57,885
the scar on your face reminds me of her.

694
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:59,086
And when I close my eyes,

695
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:02,089
that wench who clung to
the young master Seo In haunts my dreams.

696
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,629
Tae Young, open your mouth.

697
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:10,497
Like this?

698
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:11,532
Ta-da!

699
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:15,869
Chew it thoroughly
even if it tastes bitter.

700
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:17,504
What is this?

701
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:21,041
It is a sleep elixir,
said to be excellent for insomnia.

702
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:27,080
Until the roof is repaired,
I will be your storyteller.

703
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,315
So sleep tight.

704
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:29,383
That is unnecessary.

705
00:42:29,383 --> 00:42:31,785
You must be tired.
You don't have to do this anymore.

706
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:35,589
No, I'm not tired at all,

707
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:39,259
but in exchange for my storytelling,

708
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:41,628
could you tutor me?

709
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:43,730
Tutor you?

710
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:46,300
Yes. I am thinking
of taking the state exam.

711
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:49,503
Why would you want
to take the state exam?

712
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:51,872
Well,

713
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,741
earlier today, at the Yuhyangso...

714
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,077
78, 79...

715
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:58,912
Finally.

716
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,450
These are the petitions regarding taxes,

717
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,652
delayed due to the Magistrate's vacancy.

718
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:08,188
I have sorted them by urgency,

719
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:09,823
so please process them quickly.

720
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:12,326
Quickly? What do you mean quickly?

721
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:14,595
The Special Inspector fell ill,

722
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,296
leaving administrative work in chaos.

723
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:18,332
Can't you see how overburdened I am?

724
00:43:19,967 --> 00:43:21,635
I can see that. Indeed.

725
00:43:21,635 --> 00:43:24,771
Unpaid grain loans are piling up,
and officials are complaining.

726
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:27,708
The people keep filing petitions
about payment issues.

727
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:30,244
And now the legal advocate's office.

728
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:31,678
I am truly overwhelmed...

729
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:36,884
Why has that cursed Magistrate
not taken office yet?

730
00:43:37,317 --> 00:43:42,517
Instead of complaining, you should seek
ways to stabilize tax management.

731
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:45,244
- Seek ways?
- For example,

732
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:46,688
appoint me as Special Inspector.

733
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:48,021
I could help you manage the workload.

734
00:43:48,022 --> 00:43:48,808
Are you serious?

735
00:43:49,133 --> 00:43:52,804
How can someone without a rank
become a Special Inspector?

736
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:57,475
But you hold
no official position, either, right?

737
00:44:00,545 --> 00:44:02,347
But I am a scholar.

738
00:44:03,114 --> 00:44:05,750
I passed the state exam,
fair and square.

739
00:44:07,452 --> 00:44:11,556
Besides, Cheongsu County has
a monument from the palace

740
00:44:11,556 --> 00:44:14,292
and even produced a top scholar.

741
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,560
You are not qualified.

742
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,228
The monument was given
thanks to my wife,

743
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:19,130
and the top scholar
is my younger brother.

744
00:44:20,465 --> 00:44:25,670
So, are you saying you would like
to benefit from your wife and brother?

745
00:44:27,071 --> 00:44:28,172
Well...

746
00:44:34,245 --> 00:44:36,204
The local gentry can even
become the Special Inspector,

747
00:44:36,205 --> 00:44:37,382
so it is ridiculous.

748
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:38,950
This is absurd!

749
00:44:39,484 --> 00:44:40,485
I agree.

750
00:44:40,485 --> 00:44:42,420
He got his chief position by luck.

751
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,788
This is unbearable.

752
00:44:43,788 --> 00:44:46,791
I should confront him now
about this nonsense.

753
00:44:46,791 --> 00:44:47,759
Dont'.

754
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:50,895
You would only embarrass me further.

755
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:56,200
So, you truly intend
to take the special exam?

756
00:44:57,201 --> 00:44:58,169
Yes.

757
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:02,640
I will pass the scholar's exam.

758
00:45:05,243 --> 00:45:11,049
But you have never been interested
in academic pursuits.

759
00:45:11,049 --> 00:45:13,017
That is true.

760
00:45:14,752 --> 00:45:16,454
To study is to reflect

761
00:45:16,454 --> 00:45:19,390
and strive for self-improvement.

762
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,059
Recite it first, Yun Gyeom.

763
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:24,896
Don't we need to accurately assess

764
00:45:24,896 --> 00:45:26,764
your level?

765
00:45:27,198 --> 00:45:28,166
Fine.

766
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:32,971
To study is to reflect...

767
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:36,040
The reason for studying is...

768
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:41,479
to strive...

769
00:45:41,479 --> 00:45:44,649
What was it again?

770
00:45:46,351 --> 00:45:48,152
If you cannot recite the basics,
there is no hope.

771
00:45:48,152 --> 00:45:50,421
It just has been a long time,
so I forgot.

772
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:52,490
I may not have mastered

773
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:54,425
all texts,

774
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:56,995
but I have finished
"The Analects of Confucius."

775
00:45:56,995 --> 00:45:59,397
The exam is near. It is impossible.

776
00:45:59,397 --> 00:46:00,898
Don't waste effort on a whim.

777
00:46:00,898 --> 00:46:04,035
I overcame my fear of blades
to learn martial arts.

778
00:46:04,035 --> 00:46:06,437
I will show you that I mean what I say.

779
00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:09,807
Then will you come to the academy?

780
00:46:09,807 --> 00:46:10,975
I will help you.

781
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:12,143
Oh...

782
00:46:12,143 --> 00:46:13,044
No.

783
00:46:14,379 --> 00:46:15,880
I will help you.

784
00:46:17,015 --> 00:46:18,516
That would be excellent.

785
00:46:19,951 --> 00:46:23,254
Yun Gyeom, think it through carefully.

786
00:46:23,254 --> 00:46:26,190
If Yun Gyeom wants it, I must help him.

787
00:46:28,259 --> 00:46:29,327
Fine.

788
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:34,399
Tae Young helped Do Gyeom
become a top scholar.

789
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:38,569
I am sure she will be a teacher
worthy of the best.

790
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:41,205
Can you handle it?

791
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:43,408
What is there to handle...

792
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:47,378
You must trust me completely.

793
00:46:49,614 --> 00:46:52,216
Yes, I trust you.

794
00:46:56,754 --> 00:46:58,256
(Daily Schedule)

795
00:46:58,256 --> 00:47:00,158
Reading, copying, discussion

796
00:47:00,158 --> 00:47:02,660
and reviewing past test answers. Yes.

797
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,228
You can do this.

798
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,704
Why has he suddenly decided
to take the state exam?

799
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:16,274
How admirable.

800
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:19,844
It will be great if he takes this tonic
and becomes a top scholar.

801
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:22,013
But that will be hard.

802
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:22,947
Yes?

803
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:27,151
When he was
Young Master Song in Hanyang,

804
00:47:27,485 --> 00:47:31,289
his father repeatedly
urged him to study,

805
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:32,590
but he never listened.

806
00:47:33,591 --> 00:47:37,462
I am amazed he even learned to read.

807
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:39,330
Really.

808
00:47:41,766 --> 00:47:43,167
To be honest...

809
00:47:43,534 --> 00:47:45,336
They are all just fooling around.

810
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:53,278
Why do they always leave me out
of their secrets?

811
00:47:53,278 --> 00:47:57,015
Since that rascal Man Seok arrived,
I have had no peace.

812
00:47:57,015 --> 00:47:58,616
I'm so pissed off.

813
00:48:00,618 --> 00:48:01,519
What is this?

814
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:06,157
Who dropped this?

815
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,726
What does it say?

816
00:48:09,994 --> 00:48:13,197
Soe, ddung.

817
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,366
Soeddung?

818
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:17,735
Soeddung? Is it cow dung or horse dung?

819
00:48:18,102 --> 00:48:19,103
My goodness.

820
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,843
Look at those fools.

821
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:35,219
Drink up.

822
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:36,354
Wonderful.

823
00:48:37,555 --> 00:48:38,856
It is bitter.

824
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:44,162
Starting tomorrow, you must start studying
before the rooster crows.

825
00:48:44,162 --> 00:48:44,996
Huh?

826
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:47,198
Then work hard, Master.

827
00:48:50,902 --> 00:48:53,171
If you study during the hours
when the heavens open,

828
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,572
you will absorb knowledge better.

829
00:48:54,572 --> 00:48:56,708
Absorb knowledge.

830
00:48:58,443 --> 00:48:59,277
(Reading in the bathroom)

831
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:00,511
Bathroom...

832
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:02,747
Do I even have a fixed schedule
for bathroom visits?

833
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:05,216
The state exam lasts all day,

834
00:49:05,216 --> 00:49:07,518
so training your body in advance
helps with endurance.

835
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,823
It seems my brother was forced
to become a top scholar.

836
00:49:12,156 --> 00:49:15,059
With so little time left
until the special exam, time is pressing.

837
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:16,394
You must sleep less

838
00:49:16,394 --> 00:49:18,529
and study more than others to succeed.

839
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:22,467
You must refrain from going out
and focus entirely on your study for now.

840
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:23,334
Understood?

841
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:24,902
Yes.

842
00:49:24,902 --> 00:49:27,739
If you lack confidence, give up now.

843
00:49:28,172 --> 00:49:31,843
No, confidence is the only thing I have.

844
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,013
Then start preparing for the mock exam
by reviewing the basics.

845
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,749
Study the "Prime Learning"
and "Garye" thoroughly.

846
00:49:37,749 --> 00:49:38,616
Understood.

847
00:49:38,616 --> 00:49:41,619
I will check your progress daily
when I return.

848
00:49:42,453 --> 00:49:43,288
Yes.

849
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:49,861
Did you deliver the tonic properly?

850
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,929
Yes.

851
00:49:50,929 --> 00:49:52,430
What is this?

852
00:49:53,398 --> 00:49:55,600
What kind of plant looks this strong?

853
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,702
This is aloe.

854
00:49:57,702 --> 00:49:59,737
It is my first time seeing fresh aloe.

855
00:49:59,737 --> 00:50:03,441
This was originally imported
as powder from Qing.

856
00:50:03,441 --> 00:50:06,077
It is a rare medicinal herb
used only in big clinics or the palace.

857
00:50:06,077 --> 00:50:07,478
- Really?
- Yes.

858
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:09,714
- Is it unavailable in Joseon?
- That is right.

859
00:50:09,714 --> 00:50:13,318
We use it for eating, applying
to the skin, and all sorts of things.

860
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:16,888
So that is why your skin is so radiant.

861
00:50:18,356 --> 00:50:21,059
- It is dazzling.
- You.

862
00:50:22,393 --> 00:50:25,897
Anyway, aloe rots if it gets

863
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,432
too much water.

864
00:50:27,432 --> 00:50:29,567
But because
of Cheongsu County's dry weather,

865
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,269
it thrives.

866
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,171
That is not why it grows so well.

867
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:36,808
It is because of the cow dung
we use as fertilizer.

868
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:38,943
Or is it Soeddung?

869
00:50:42,447 --> 00:50:44,616
What do you think, Man Seok?

870
00:50:44,616 --> 00:50:47,819
Is it cow dung
or Soeddung for fertilizer?

871
00:50:48,653 --> 00:50:50,521
Why are you suddenly talking about dung?

872
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:54,926
Man Seok, I want you to handle
spreading dung in the aloe field.

873
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,494
Could you take care of that?

874
00:51:00,832 --> 00:51:02,066
Did you peak at my tag?

875
00:51:02,066 --> 00:51:04,002
Don't talk to me like that.

876
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:06,070
You are ten years younger than me.

877
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:07,438
Are you?

878
00:51:07,438 --> 00:51:10,208
What would I peak?
You dropped it yourself!

879
00:51:17,448 --> 00:51:18,549
Where are you going, Cow Dung?

880
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:20,952
You should not leave
when an elder is speaking, Cow Dung.

881
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:21,986
It is Soeddung!

882
00:51:21,986 --> 00:51:23,288
Fine, Soeddung.

883
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:28,126
His name is Soeddung.

884
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:33,264
What is wrong with that?
Servants all have names like that.

885
00:51:33,698 --> 00:51:36,868
Mocking someone for their flaws?

886
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:40,505
How petty of you.

887
00:51:46,544 --> 00:51:48,846
This feels like dung.

888
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:55,386
How long will you stay like this?

889
00:51:55,653 --> 00:51:59,057
You must be glad not to see me,
so what brings you here?

890
00:52:02,427 --> 00:52:05,496
This is a remedy to restore vitality.
Please take it.

891
00:52:07,498 --> 00:52:09,267
Giving the disease and then the cure?

892
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:11,402
What did I do?

893
00:52:12,537 --> 00:52:14,973
This is all because of you.

894
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:18,076
I gave testimony to become
Head Lady of the Mother's Association.

895
00:52:18,076 --> 00:52:20,979
You requested it in return
for your testimony, and I agreed.

896
00:52:20,979 --> 00:52:22,747
I didn't suggest it first.

897
00:52:22,747 --> 00:52:24,349
Either way.

898
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:28,519
I am terrified he will find me
and kill me. I cannot move an inch.

899
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,654
So what?

900
00:52:29,654 --> 00:52:33,224
With the special exam near,
how can you neglect your Woongyi?

901
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:34,525
Neglect him?

902
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:38,329
He is studying hard
with top scholar Seong at the academy.

903
00:52:38,997 --> 00:52:40,965
He didn't go there even once.

904
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:43,234
What?

905
00:52:44,802 --> 00:52:46,471
This little brat!

906
00:52:50,942 --> 00:52:51,876
What did you say?

907
00:52:52,944 --> 00:52:55,246
Are you saying Woongyi

908
00:52:55,246 --> 00:52:57,682
has been going to a courtesan house
instead of the academy?

909
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:02,387
I will drag that brat here
and teach him a lesson.

910
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,756
This is all your fault.

911
00:53:06,624 --> 00:53:07,477
What?

912
00:53:08,017 --> 00:53:12,130
How is it my fault that Woongyi
went to a courtesan house?

913
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,766
He inherited your lack of brains,
which leads to failure.

914
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:16,634
That is why he drowns his sorrows
in drink.

915
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:18,136
Why am I the dumb one?

916
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:22,040
I passed the state exam

917
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,242
after only five years.

918
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:27,312
Yes, really impressive.

919
00:53:27,312 --> 00:53:28,980
You never even held a rank.

920
00:53:29,614 --> 00:53:32,784
Can you watch your words for once?

921
00:53:32,784 --> 00:53:35,720
My son-in-law passed the greater exam
and became an investigator.

922
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,356
Young Master Seong, who was his peer,
became a top scholar.

923
00:53:38,723 --> 00:53:41,659
What will become of Woongyi?

924
00:53:41,659 --> 00:53:43,461
What do you mean?

925
00:53:43,828 --> 00:53:46,798
Just drag him back and make him study.

926
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:51,269
Let us hire a proxy test taker.

927
00:53:52,904 --> 00:53:54,339
Have you lost your mind?

928
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:56,007
Or

929
00:53:56,007 --> 00:54:00,578
how about purchasing a Magistrate's
position in another district?

930
00:54:00,578 --> 00:54:02,313
If you became a Magistrate elsewhere,

931
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:04,182
we could leave Cheongsu County.

932
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:06,951
Why would I leave?

933
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:09,554
I am the Chief
of Cheongsu County's Yuhyangso.

934
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:14,058
I am scared.

935
00:54:14,058 --> 00:54:17,161
That one-eyed man might come to kill me.

936
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:20,898
I am truly terrified.

937
00:54:23,001 --> 00:54:24,369
Goodness.

938
00:54:27,005 --> 00:54:31,943
I was going to keep this to myself
since I dislike you meddling around.

939
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,212
Keep what?

940
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:37,248
Rest assured.

941
00:54:38,082 --> 00:54:40,618
That overseer you fear is dead.

942
00:54:41,753 --> 00:54:42,887
Really?

943
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:44,789
Why?

944
00:54:45,256 --> 00:54:47,025
Did he suddenly get struck by lightning?

945
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:48,993
According to a provincial officer,

946
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,030
he was eliminated by someone higher up.

947
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,164
Higher up?

948
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:54,966
Who would that be?

949
00:54:56,734 --> 00:54:58,469
How would I know that?

950
00:55:06,878 --> 00:55:09,347
Your father truly
has a devoted daughter.

951
00:55:13,284 --> 00:55:18,122
Thanks to you, your father will get
the position he desires.

952
00:55:18,723 --> 00:55:21,192
How could that be because of me?

953
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,128
I am merely an added bonus.

954
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:27,599
In exchange for the position,

955
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,002
taking all the properties
in prime locations in Hanyang

956
00:55:31,002 --> 00:55:32,937
is your ultimate goal.

957
00:55:37,242 --> 00:55:38,743
Pour me a drink.

958
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:52,323
The reason I agreed to be your concubine

959
00:55:52,757 --> 00:55:54,125
is not because I'm a devoted daughter,

960
00:55:54,926 --> 00:55:57,495
but because you are a powerful man.

961
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:04,369
Will you give me a wedding gift?

962
00:56:05,403 --> 00:56:07,472
If there is something
you want, just speak.

963
00:56:13,811 --> 00:56:15,480
Help me find someone.

964
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:35,500
It has been so long since I went home
before dark last time.

965
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,003
Mi Ryeong is unwell, and I need
to check on my husband's studies.

966
00:56:39,003 --> 00:56:40,004
Okay.

967
00:56:42,206 --> 00:56:44,175
Who are they?

968
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:46,210
I have never seen them before.

969
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:49,847
Could you find out who they are
and what they are doing, Kkeutdongi?

970
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:50,882
Understood.

971
00:57:05,196 --> 00:57:06,064
Yun Gyeom.

972
00:57:07,365 --> 00:57:10,168
Why are you home at this hour?

973
00:57:10,868 --> 00:57:12,637
Well,

974
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:19,010
I heard Mi Ryeong is unwell,
so I came here out of concern.

975
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:23,581
Then you should go to see her.
Why come here?

976
00:57:29,354 --> 00:57:30,555
Goodness.

977
00:57:58,182 --> 00:57:59,751
Where could he have gone?

978
00:58:02,754 --> 00:58:05,623
Mi Ryeong, have you seen Yun Gyeom?

979
00:58:05,823 --> 00:58:08,493
I told him not to go out,
but he is not home.

980
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:12,664
I saw him leaving
with Do Gyeom a moment ago.

981
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,400
Oh.

982
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,770
Why are you so worried?

983
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:24,943
Why else? Because you care.

984
00:58:25,743 --> 00:58:26,945
Because I care?

985
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:30,014
As you care, you get angry,
and as you care, you resent her.

986
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:31,449
Isn't that right?

987
00:58:31,849 --> 00:58:33,351
I care, but I resent her.

988
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:35,753
I want to see her, but I do not.

989
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:39,324
When I see her, I am happy,
but I am also upset.

990
00:58:40,291 --> 00:58:41,993
It is driving me crazy.

991
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,763
When I write or create stories,

992
00:58:46,197 --> 00:58:49,467
the most beloved man by women

993
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:52,937
is always the one who shows
his true feelings.

994
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:59,010
No matter how capable or attractive
a character I create is,

995
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,679
if he does not have a heart,
he is never popular.

996
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,289
How are you so skilled?

997
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,626
Before marriage, when times were hard,

998
00:59:14,626 --> 00:59:17,128
I supported my foster father
with sewing work.

999
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:18,963
I see.

1000
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,334
These are so adorable.

1001
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:26,871
You should have a child as well.

1002
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:32,310
You would surely be a wonderful
and warmhearted mother.

1003
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:39,918
What does it feel like to have a child?

1004
00:59:44,088 --> 00:59:45,957
It feels like it connects

1005
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:50,094
my husband and me.

1006
00:59:51,396 --> 00:59:53,965
I always felt lonely and struggled,

1007
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,533
but now that we are together,

1008
00:59:55,867 --> 00:59:57,869
I feel so happy and secure.

1009
00:59:59,704 --> 01:00:00,738
I see.

1010
01:00:03,174 --> 01:00:06,477
To have someone to fully love
and be loved by

1011
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,280
must be truly joyful.

1012
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,985
It must be joyful,

1013
01:00:17,355 --> 01:00:18,790
but also frightening.

1014
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:26,364
What are you afraid of?

1015
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:30,602
That even knowing my heart,
she might push me away.

1016
01:00:31,703 --> 01:00:33,738
Yes, that is what I fear.

1017
01:00:34,205 --> 01:00:35,206
Right.

1018
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,875
It would hurt to be rejected,

1019
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,712
but you must try
until you win her heart.

1020
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:44,215
When you love someone,
that is what you are supposed to do.

1021
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:48,987
I abandoned my family and honor
to come here,

1022
01:00:50,054 --> 01:00:53,224
and now I am memorizing
"Prime Learning" at this age

1023
01:00:53,224 --> 01:00:55,460
just to be someone worthy of Tae Young.

1024
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,564
Speaking of Tae Young,

1025
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:02,467
she has never shown weakness.

1026
01:01:02,467 --> 01:01:04,636
Not then, and not now, either

1027
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,405
She has always been strong and wise.

1028
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:11,743
I feel so sad
and affectionate about that.

1029
01:01:12,744 --> 01:01:15,413
Thinking about how she lived
to appear that way

1030
01:01:15,847 --> 01:01:18,917
trying so hard on her own

1031
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:22,954
breaks my heart.

1032
01:01:25,023 --> 01:01:30,228
I just want to
ease her burdens a little.

1033
01:01:32,497 --> 01:01:33,898
So what if she pushes me away?

1034
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:37,602
I like her, and I am fine with it.

1035
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,573
No matter how I am treated,

1036
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,808
I just...

1037
01:01:45,276 --> 01:01:46,844
want to be with her.

1038
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,783
Here.

1039
01:01:59,724 --> 01:02:00,725
Ma'am.

1040
01:02:04,362 --> 01:02:05,830
Why is he so late?

1041
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:08,666
Indeed, they are
much later than expected.

1042
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,302
Mak Sim, should I go out to find them?

1043
01:02:20,378 --> 01:02:24,449
They must not be here looking
for Chon Seung Hwi or Song Seo In.

1044
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,150
Everyone thinks they are dead.

1045
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,485
Their funerals were held.

1046
01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:31,189
If they were after the director,
soldiers would come,

1047
01:02:31,189 --> 01:02:32,357
not slave hunters.

1048
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,791
What if they are slave hunters?

1049
01:02:34,259 --> 01:02:36,361
What if Lady So Hye is searching for me?

1050
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:38,529
What if she sees me
and my husband together?

1051
01:02:38,529 --> 01:02:39,931
No, that cannot happen.

1052
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:46,137
- Kkeutdongi.
- Everyone is out here.

1053
01:02:46,738 --> 01:02:50,108
Madam, they are slave hunters
from Hanyang.

1054
01:02:50,108 --> 01:02:51,576
Did you ask who they are after?

1055
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:53,044
They are so menacing.

1056
01:02:53,044 --> 01:02:55,146
When I tried to talk,
they almost beat me to death.

1057
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:56,214
So I could not ask.

1058
01:02:57,782 --> 01:02:59,784
Where could Yun Gyeom have gone?

1059
01:02:59,784 --> 01:03:02,053
He is here. I brought him back.

1060
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:04,422
Was everyone waiting?

1061
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:06,724
We were so worried.

1062
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,562
Mi Ryeong.

1063
01:03:13,231 --> 01:03:15,333
Let us talk.

1064
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:20,572
Yes, you two should talk.

1065
01:03:20,572 --> 01:03:22,373
I think you two need a conversation.

1066
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,510
Mak Sim, come here for a moment.

1067
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:29,180
Why? What is it?

1068
01:03:31,249 --> 01:03:32,584
Come in, Yun Gyeom.

1069
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:38,957
So scary.

1070
01:03:43,895 --> 01:03:45,496
Why is it so tense?

1071
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,298
It is catastrophic.

1072
01:03:55,306 --> 01:03:57,108
Why tell me to come here?

1073
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:58,509
Do you like Man Seok?

1074
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:01,246
What kind of nonsense is that?

1075
01:04:01,246 --> 01:04:02,347
Am I not right?

1076
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:04,415
Didn't you say you would leave with him?

1077
01:04:04,415 --> 01:04:05,516
Also,

1078
01:04:05,516 --> 01:04:08,119
you are not thinking of me anymore,
not even the slightest bit.

1079
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:11,656
You treated me like I was nothing
after Man Seok arrived.

1080
01:04:11,656 --> 01:04:14,192
Do you think you have the right
to say such things to me?

1081
01:04:14,192 --> 01:04:16,661
Who are you to talk to me like that?

1082
01:04:17,128 --> 01:04:18,496
Is that so?

1083
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:21,432
Fine, let us have
an honest conversation now.

1084
01:04:21,432 --> 01:04:22,467
Fine.

1085
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:24,269
What am I to you?

1086
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,504
What exactly is our relationship?

1087
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,307
Are you really asking
because you don't know?

1088
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:33,278
Don't you know what we mean
to each other?

1089
01:04:33,278 --> 01:04:35,213
Are you mocking me?

1090
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:38,683
This is why I neither explain myself
nor ask for forgiveness.

1091
01:04:38,683 --> 01:04:40,018
No matter what I say,

1092
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,687
you will interpret it as you wish.

1093
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:51,029
Did you ever like me?

1094
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:56,434
Did you ever love me?

1095
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:04,642
Well...

1096
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:08,880
I will make up for today's wasted time
twice over tomorrow.

1097
01:05:09,547 --> 01:05:11,950
If anything I wrote was lacking,

1098
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,652
I will copy it a hundred more times.

1099
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,124
I only kept Do Gyeom company
since he seemed troubled.

1100
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:22,293
I didn't drink a drop of alcohol.

1101
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,362
Was I gone too long?

1102
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:29,100
So please let it go, okay?

1103
01:05:32,604 --> 01:05:35,506
Did anything happen at the office?

1104
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:38,376
Or is it

1105
01:05:40,245 --> 01:05:43,915
because work is tough enough
and you are exhausted from my studies?

1106
01:05:43,915 --> 01:05:44,849
Yes.

1107
01:05:45,783 --> 01:05:46,884
It is exhausting.

1108
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:50,755
See? I knew it would be hard.

1109
01:05:50,755 --> 01:05:54,192
Don't worry about it anymore.
I will manage alone from now on.

1110
01:05:54,192 --> 01:05:57,662
The more you do this,
the more it weighs on my heart.

1111
01:05:59,397 --> 01:06:00,999
I am afraid of becoming weak.

1112
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,600
I dislike having someone to rely on.

1113
01:06:06,704 --> 01:06:08,907
Being with you makes me nervous.

1114
01:06:08,907 --> 01:06:11,643
I was better off when you were not here.

1115
01:06:11,643 --> 01:06:13,378
I was better on my own.

1116
01:06:33,064 --> 01:06:34,065
I...

1117
01:06:49,414 --> 01:06:52,417
Kkeutdongi, have you seen Yun Gyeom?
He just left.

1118
01:06:52,417 --> 01:06:54,419
He stormed out just now.

1119
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,830
Oh, no.

1120
01:07:10,602 --> 01:07:12,937
Yun Gyeom.

1121
01:07:19,877 --> 01:07:20,812
Yun Gyeom.

1122
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:28,653
Yun Gyeom.

1123
01:07:30,655 --> 01:07:32,390
Yun Gyeom!

1124
01:07:50,174 --> 01:07:51,175
Tae Young!

1125
01:07:51,976 --> 01:07:52,911
Tae Young!

1126
01:07:53,177 --> 01:07:55,046
Tae Young, how did you...

1127
01:07:55,046 --> 01:07:56,481
Who are you? Go away!

1128
01:07:56,481 --> 01:07:58,516
- Wait...
- Go away!

1129
01:07:58,516 --> 01:08:00,118
You may go.

1130
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:03,388
- They are people I called.
- What?

1131
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:06,391
I called them to find your father.

1132
01:08:10,595 --> 01:08:13,197
They cross borders

1133
01:08:13,197 --> 01:08:14,565
and enter plague villages.

1134
01:08:14,565 --> 01:08:16,935
They are famous for finding people.
That is why I called them.

1135
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:22,540
I thought you might finally sleep
soundly once your father is found.

1136
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:29,414
My goodness.

1137
01:08:29,881 --> 01:08:33,818
It is just that I had a set time
with them.

1138
01:08:34,686 --> 01:08:37,855
That is why I left in a rush
without explaining. I am sorry.

1139
01:08:43,361 --> 01:08:46,230
Were you worried?
Did you think I was kidnapped?

1140
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:49,534
No.

1141
01:08:51,035 --> 01:08:52,370
I thought you left.

1142
01:09:01,379 --> 01:09:02,981
Because of what I said,

1143
01:09:03,982 --> 01:09:06,050
I thought you got angry and left.

1144
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:14,859
Where would I even go?

1145
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:17,295
Be as mean as you want.
I will still never leave.

1146
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,768
I don't know why I am like this.

1147
01:09:25,803 --> 01:09:28,373
I've never received such love before.

1148
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,408
I've never felt such happiness.

1149
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,778
These good days don't feel real.

1150
01:09:33,778 --> 01:09:36,547
I fear they will go wrong and vanish.

1151
01:09:37,248 --> 01:09:38,950
I am scared it is all just a dream.

1152
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:42,153
I am so scared.

1153
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:48,927
So am I.

1154
01:09:52,864 --> 01:09:56,067
I am also anxious

1155
01:09:56,701 --> 01:09:59,504
and scared.

1156
01:10:02,507 --> 01:10:03,708
So,

1157
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:08,313
let us not fight,
and live happily together.

1158
01:10:08,947 --> 01:10:13,685
Don't keep telling me to leave
when I have nowhere to go.

1159
01:10:16,621 --> 01:10:17,822
Don't leave.

1160
01:10:23,494 --> 01:10:25,663
Stay by my side, dear.

1161
01:11:35,733 --> 01:11:40,305
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1162
01:11:40,805 --> 01:11:43,908
The special exam is near.
It will be impossible for him to make it.

1163
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:45,443
Elder Master.

1164
01:11:45,443 --> 01:11:47,045
Top scholar.

1165
01:11:47,045 --> 01:11:50,648
Then we are no longer pretending,
we are truly husband and wife.

1166
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:54,619
I want to forget what I saw.

1167
01:11:55,153 --> 01:11:57,956
I cannot bear to face you, Do Gyeom.

1168
01:11:57,956 --> 01:11:59,324
So I leave this letter.

1169
01:11:59,324 --> 01:12:01,626
Don't suffer because of me anymore.

1170
01:12:01,626 --> 01:12:04,729
Are the rumors
about buying a position with money true?

1171
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:06,831
The new Magistrate is not doing his job.

1172
01:12:06,831 --> 01:12:10,234
I was only following
the Magistrate's orders.

1173
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:11,135
The Magistrate?

1174
01:12:11,769 --> 01:12:12,804
Go!

1175
01:12:12,804 --> 01:12:14,439
Where is Madam?

1176
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:16,908
She went out saying
she was investigating.
