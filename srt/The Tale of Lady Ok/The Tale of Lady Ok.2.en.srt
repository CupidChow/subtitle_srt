00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,002
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,038
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,049
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:57,457
Great. Thank god.

5
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,527
Thank you for staying alive.

6
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,332
You survived. That's a relief.

7
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:06,466
Thank god.

8
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,537
Well...

9
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,240
- My lady.
- My Tae Young.

10
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,576
You have grown up.

11
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,413
My Tae Young.

12
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,016
You are Tae Young, right?

13
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,363
Yes.

14
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,772
That was the first lie.

15
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,885
The inflammation has reached deep
into your body.

16
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,220
If it is not cooled down,
it could get serious.

17
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,357
Dokki went all the way
to the ice storage in Songju County

18
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:06,126
- to get this for you.
- But...

19
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,429
Still, it is such a relief
that you are awake now.

20
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:13,233
After the funeral,
you had been in a coma.

21
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,571
I was so afraid
that we might lose you too.

22
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:22,609
Can you please tell me
how I ended up here?

23
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,279
My gosh. What happened to you?

24
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,614
Why are you speaking to me formally?

25
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:32,653
My lady, it is me, Baekyi.
I am your servant.

26
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,490
How did I get here?

27
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,326
I was at the inn.

28
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,728
When the military officers arrived,

29
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,731
everyone was already dead.

30
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,900
Only you were barely breathing.

31
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:51,104
One of the officers
recognized your ring.

32
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,781
Young Master must be very happy
to hear you are alive.

33
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:06,787
He said once she's feeling better,
he will take her to the mourning hut.

34
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:10,224
Then it will be the first time they meet

35
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,759
since they were separated as children.

36
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,530
He has been doing it all alone.

37
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,665
So your presence will be
a great support to him.

38
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,171
Indeed. It seems the heavens
have helped us.

39
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,574
At least Tae Young is safe and sound.

40
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,015
Does the county office still not know
who was behind this?

41
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,483
No.

42
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:39,820
Although the governor has
stepped in to track them down...

43
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,359
Tae Young.

44
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,195
Why are you out of bed?

45
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,564
You should not be walking around yet.

46
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,201
We need to talk privately.

47
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,708
What is the matter, Tae Young?

48
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,146
No, Madam.

49
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,081
I am not Tae Young.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,252
What are you talking about?

51
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,623
I am just a servant
who worked at the inn

52
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:19,726
where she stayed.

53
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,830
What?

54
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,100
So what happened to Tae Young?

55
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,904
Lady Tae Young saved

56
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,842
a lowly woman like me, but she...

57
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,082
I should have been the one to die.

58
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:44,318
Please end me, Madam.

59
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,454
How could the heavens be so cruel?

60
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,058
Then

61
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:56,363
why were you dressed in silk
and wearing my ring?

62
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,366
Lady Tae Young put it on me herself.

63
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,968
What?

64
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:05,772
She and His Lord heard
about my unfortunate circumstances

65
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,242
and took me in as an adopted daughter.

66
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,377
They even dressed me in silk.

67
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,013
That cannot be.

68
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,949
You may not believe it,
but it is the truth.

69
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,586
Then why did you not run away?

70
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:23,891
If I run away
without revealing the truth to you,

71
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,529
you would have continued to worry
and search for her.

72
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,405
I will gladly accept the punishment
for impersonating Lady Tae Young.

73
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,841
But please allow me to see
the county magistrate, Madam.

74
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:44,511
I know who the culprits were.

75
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,756
Tell him exactly what you have told me.

76
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,258
Yes.

77
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,062
Apart from the three paths
visible in front of the inn,

78
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,866
behind the inn, there is a narrow trail
near the barn.

79
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,669
Herb gatherers often go there.

80
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:10,504
Let's go.

81
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,274
Walk on that trail
for about fifteen minutes

82
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:18,245
and pass an old shrine,
you will see a cave.

83
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,980
Well done, Sam Man.

84
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,282
You did all the work again, Cheon Bok.

85
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,051
This is why we respect you, brother.

86
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,255
That is where the bandits are staying.

87
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,958
How do you know?

88
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:35,462
While staying there,
she heard it from a servant.

89
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:40,834
Can you draw a sketch?

90
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,135
Pardon?

91
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,073
I remember their faces.

92
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,309
If you capture them, I'll identify them.

93
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:57,150
We can't capture them now,

94
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,687
but you truly have
a smart granddaughter.

95
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,999
(Wanted: Goodeoki, Runaway Slave)

96
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:31,318
Until the bandits are caught,
keep pretending to be Tae Young.

97
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,487
What?

98
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,323
As Lady Tae Young?

99
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,192
If you claim to be a runaway slave,

100
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,927
who would ever believe you?

101
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:42,829
You will need someone to support you.

102
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,032
So I will reveal this
only to Mak Sim in the kitchen.

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,601
Hide yourself.

104
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,908
Don't show your face.

105
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,611
If anyone discovers this,

106
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:01,949
the whole family will be ruined.

107
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,184
My lady.

108
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,921
I am going in.

109
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,123
Oh my.

110
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,559
My goodness.

111
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:51,498
My lady, why are you sleeping here
instead of in the warm room?

112
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:54,668
I have a restless sleeping habit.

113
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,537
Bring another basin of water.

114
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,839
Yes. My goodness.

115
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,078
Goodness!

116
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,182
My lady, give this to me.

117
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,389
You heard from Madam, right?
I am not Lady Tae Young.

118
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,858
If I am told to serve you
as Lady Tae Young, then you are.

119
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,229
Here, drink this.

120
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,066
Anyway,

121
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,435
if the ladies at the Mother's Sanctuary
hear about this,

122
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:30,437
it will be the end for all of us.

123
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:34,208
So, please try to stay
within this separate yard.

124
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,209
Understood?

125
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,145
Yes.

126
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,245
- Why is this not allowed?
- It is simply not.

127
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:13,080
- Absolutely not!
- What?

128
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:16,683
Remember that no one is allowed
to set foot in this annex

129
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,020
without my permission.

130
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,121
Why not?

131
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,625
Also, tell those servants from
other households not to enter our house.

132
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,926
Yes.

133
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:28,061
So we just need to make sure
he keeps his mouth shut.

134
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:30,364
I didn't do anything!
Why do you always pick on me?

135
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,466
You're the biggest gossip here!

136
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,268
What else is a mouth for?

137
00:10:34,268 --> 00:10:38,405
You! If our household affairs
ever reach the ears of outsiders

138
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,607
and the Mother's Sanctuary knows,

139
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:44,778
it will be the end for all of us.
Do you understand?

140
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,214
- Kkeutdongi is doomed.
- I said no.

141
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,484
You are driving me crazy.

142
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,019
I said no!

143
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,587
Goodness.

144
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,455
What is this Mother's Sanctuary like

145
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,792
for her to say that?

146
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:03,463
I was worried Ok Pil Seung
would interfere with everything

147
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:06,166
after being appointed
as the head of the Academy.

148
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,335
So we are lucky that this happened.

149
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,838
It is a pity that
he passed away, though.

150
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:12,806
Their son, Chan Young.

151
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,909
He cannot take the state examination
because of the grave keeping.

152
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:20,047
So we have one less competitor
for our young masters.

153
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,853
I heard their daughter has awakened
but refuses visits.

154
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:28,188
We should all
send letters of condolences.

155
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,690
Yes.

156
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,460
What are these women babbling about?

157
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,231
Mother, where are you? Mother!

158
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:39,266
- Yes.
- Here you are.

159
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,434
Mother.

160
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:44,471
The ladies of the Yuhyangso
sent a letter.

161
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:48,008
Good grief, such nerve they have.

162
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:51,445
They are told not to come.
Why send this?

163
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,281
I did not send that letter.
Why are you yelling at me?

164
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:57,251
They demanded a reply by tomorrow.
What should we do?

165
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:00,354
This makes no sense. I do not get this.

166
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:02,389
I count repeatedly, just this number.

167
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,892
But why is the butcher's count
and ours so different?

168
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,160
- Okay, let's try again.
- Yes.

169
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,904
It's two taels and three coins
for one catty.

170
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:09,530
Two taels and three coins.

171
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,398
- And this is 18 catties.
- 18 catties.

172
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,399
How much is it?

173
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,569
Are you asking me or yourself?

174
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:19,039
You're confusing me. Stop talking to me.

175
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,040
Try again!

176
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,011
Did I not tell you to learn some math?

177
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,846
Yes, she did, right?

178
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,181
Is it my fault now?

179
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:28,382
Yes!

180
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:30,450
Why not ask Lady Tae Young for help?

181
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,686
Both for this letter and the count.

182
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:34,154
Why didn't I think of that?

183
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,990
Let us go to Lady Tae Young right now.
I need to greet her.

184
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,458
No, you cannot!

185
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:41,328
Why not?

186
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,396
Lady Tae Young needs...

187
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,667
rest.

188
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,269
If she rests any longer,
she might turn into a living corpse.

189
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,606
It is not urgent, so leave her be.

190
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,208
Do not bother her.

191
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,742
Why are you so protective?

192
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,845
Is she only your lady?

193
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:59,546
Is she only your lady?

194
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,315
Are you even my mother?

195
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,852
My lady.

196
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,991
How is Grandmother doing?

197
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,894
Now that you are awake,
she is probably relieved,

198
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,629
so she has been sleeping all day.

199
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,799
Is there anything I can help with?

200
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,667
- A letter arrived.
- Hey!

201
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,536
Why did you bring that here?

202
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:23,637
Why not?

203
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,939
They want a reply by tomorrow morning.

204
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:26,940
Give it.

205
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,210
Why not let Lady Tae Young handle it?

206
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,545
My lady, here it is.

207
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,581
You should not take it.

208
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,919
Say you have sore eyes.

209
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,422
What did you just say?

210
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,561
Say you cannot see clearly.

211
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:51,064
My lady, could you help us
with calculations too?

212
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,434
- It's a mess in the servants' quarters.
- Get out.

213
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,937
This is a letter from the chief lady

214
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,173
of the Yuhyangso Mother's Sanctuary.

215
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,910
Do you know how to read?

216
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,714
Mother, of course, our lady can read.

217
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:09,850
Bring what you have to calculate, too.

218
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:11,818
I can handle it.

219
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:13,787
Thank you so much, my lady.

220
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,456
Dokki will be pleased.

221
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,164
Baekyi is so diligent,
just like her mother.

222
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,099
My feet can also do the job.

223
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:27,701
Shut your mouth.

224
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,236
Excuse me.

225
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:33,707
My lady, why are you here?

226
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,110
I heard they needed a reply
by tomorrow morning.

227
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,012
Go back to your room.

228
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,114
My lady, can you recognize me?

229
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:44,551
Why would she need to know who you are?

230
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,552
Hey.

231
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,223
- Are you not Dokki?
- Yes, I am, my lady.

232
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,325
It has been ages since we met.

233
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:53,894
How does she know him?

234
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,395
You said hi, so you should go now.

235
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,764
Why are you being like that?
Let us greet each other.

236
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:00,400
My lady, hello. I am Kkeutdongi.

237
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:02,903
Yes. Kkeutdongi.

238
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:06,139
My lady, you should go back and rest.

239
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,608
Come here for a while.

240
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,877
We just want to talk.
Why sending her away?

241
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,411
- Seriously.
- Let go of me.

242
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,014
Why are you all acting like children?

243
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:15,048
Why your mother...

244
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,953
What was that?

245
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:27,494
In Qing, even noble ladies cook.

246
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,931
Ah, in Qing.

247
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:34,368
Yes. That makes sense.

248
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:38,071
Then it would be great if she delivered
the meal to the Young Master.

249
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:40,741
Yes. My lady, you have not met
the young master yet, have you?

250
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,176
The Young Master?

251
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,511
Your elder brother.

252
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,015
My brother.

253
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:50,551
Your brother is Young Master Chan Young.

254
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,254
Do you not remember
Young Master Chan Young?

255
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,456
You remember me,

256
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,058
but you don't remember the Young Master?

257
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,561
Memory loss.

258
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:02,029
Partial memory loss.

259
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,732
Memory loss.

260
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,368
Yes. That is possible.

261
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,205
Then you should meet the Young Master.

262
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:12,773
That might help recover the memory.

263
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:14,208
Absolutely not!

264
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,043
Come on. Why are you
acting like this again?

265
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,945
Do you have some kind of "no" disease?

266
00:16:17,945 --> 00:16:19,479
Do not worry too much.

267
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,721
- I will go with Lady Tae Young.
- Yes.

268
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,523
- Yes, you should.
- Take care.

269
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,602
I heard you are visiting Chan Young.

270
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,271
Yes, Grandmother.

271
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:46,240
She reads books with him.

272
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,575
They do embroidery
and keep each other company.

273
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:53,280
Reading books and doing embroidery?

274
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,749
Please, eat.

275
00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:00,287
Lady Tae Young even sent a reply
to the ladies

276
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,955
of the Mother's Sanctuary.

277
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,991
She put them in their place.

278
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:06,226
It felt so good.

279
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,963
What is her talking about?

280
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:13,333
The Young Master asked for books,

281
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,802
so Lady Tae Young and I went
to the market the other day.

282
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,512
They are the ladies
of the Mother's Sanctuary.

283
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,348
They'll want to talk to you, but if they
find out about the memory loss,

284
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,817
they'll definitely spread weird rumors.

285
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:35,522
But why do they speak so ill about us?

286
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:38,825
Because in Cheongsu County,

287
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,328
the Yuhyangso is above
the government office.

288
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,829
However, our lord was coming

289
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:45,899
to the Academy to deal with them.

290
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,168
So they were in despair.

291
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,871
But then, he met an unfortunate fate.

292
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:52,306
They must be pleased.

293
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:55,342
The old man seems too weak
to even hold a brush.

294
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:58,979
Who knows?
We might see a series of funerals.

295
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,248
Am I the only one
who hasn't sent a letter of condolence?

296
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,016
It is such a hassle.

297
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,519
By the way, about that
household's granddaughter.

298
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,822
Could she have been harmed
by those bandits?

299
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:10,357
She might be.

300
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,826
It is unlikely
the bandits left her alone.

301
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,061
She can't get married now.

302
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:16,363
What bad luck. Let's sprinkle some salt.

303
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,401
These despicable women.

304
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,270
But that night,

305
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,173
Lady of the Special Inspector sent
a letter of consolation.

306
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,277
Lady Tae Young thought
it was her chance, so she replied to it.

307
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:36,216
She actually responded with a poem.

308
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,551
A poem?

309
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:38,552
Read it.

310
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:42,823
Joy increases when shared

311
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,992
while sorrow divides...

312
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,995
What character is this?

313
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:49,863
Let me see that.

314
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,033
Joy increases when shared

315
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:55,936
and sorrow halves when divided.

316
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,804
When the butcher hears a pig's cry,

317
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,540
he takes delight in it.

318
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:04,478
There are those who find joy

319
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,647
in the misery of others.

320
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,586
Only a pure heart will be protected

321
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,521
for even the gods forsake the wicked.

322
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,258
In times of hardship, true sincerity is

323
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,093
a source of comfort.

324
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:24,331
Only a pure heart will be protected

325
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,668
for even the gods forsake the wicked.

326
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:29,970
Although harsh words were spoken,

327
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:34,208
this one carried a sincerity
I had not seen before.

328
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,043
It was truly a comfort.

329
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,880
So she means my letter was fine, right?

330
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,682
And she is criticizing the earlier ones.

331
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,383
She must have known

332
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:45,953
we would all read this together.

333
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,455
Then is she calling us

334
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:51,325
butchers delighting in a pig's cry?

335
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:56,129
Goodness, how dare her do this.

336
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:58,198
How dare she!

337
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,167
She cannot get away with this.

338
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,770
Will you give her a reply?

339
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:34,268
You should see their faces.

340
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:54,888
Stop!

341
00:20:54,888 --> 00:20:58,158
Why torment innocent people like this?

342
00:20:58,158 --> 00:21:00,594
We are only traders
buying and selling goods.

343
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,062
Do not confess, no matter what.

344
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,265
There is no evidence against us.

345
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,368
No one knows what we did

346
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,804
and we killed them all.

347
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,317
They did not all get killed.

348
00:21:29,756 --> 00:21:34,061
They are Sam Man and Cheon Bok.

349
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:39,233
I saw them shoot flaming arrows
and set fire,

350
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,468
cut people down, and steal goods.

351
00:21:43,604 --> 00:21:45,205
I witnessed everything clearly.

352
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:46,907
Darn it.

353
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:49,743
Punish them with 100 lashes!

354
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,478
It was not me!

355
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:00,053
I swear, not me!

356
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,397
Who are you?

357
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,776
You are the servant from the inn.

358
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,111
Why are you here?

359
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,112
Silence!

360
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,716
What you stole

361
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,486
was not just wealth.

362
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:36,023
You stole precious dreams.

363
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,294
The persons you killed

364
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:44,698
would have helped many.

365
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:46,533
Therefore,

366
00:22:48,402 --> 00:22:49,870
even after death,

367
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,207
you shall never reach heaven.

368
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,048
That darn girl.

369
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:23,203
What is this?

370
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:28,775
This is face powder from Qing.

371
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:32,379
You managed the household affairs
so diligently

372
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,848
and could not take care of yourself.

373
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:36,850
My lady.

374
00:23:42,356 --> 00:23:45,559
These silk shoes
and fabrics are for Baekyi.

375
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,261
My goodness.

376
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:50,297
This is too much for someone like me.

377
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:51,598
Thank you.

378
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,502
My goodness.

379
00:23:56,837 --> 00:24:00,874
This is a precious herb
that is great for cough.

380
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:04,077
My cough has long gone,
and yet you give me this.

381
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:08,482
Thank you.

382
00:24:24,665 --> 00:24:27,301
This is nohoe.

383
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:30,704
It is a medicinal plant from Arabia.

384
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:32,673
It can also be used as a remedy.

385
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,777
It is very resilient,
just like you, Grandmother.

386
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:46,820
I see.

387
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:49,656
Thank you.

388
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:52,459
Tae Young.

389
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,614
Stay healthy, Madam.

390
00:25:15,315 --> 00:25:18,886
Thank you for everything.

391
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:21,655
Where do you intend to go?

392
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,661
Grandmother, no, Madam.

393
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:33,300
What is your name?

394
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:37,704
My name is...

395
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:41,074
Goodeoki.

396
00:25:44,244 --> 00:25:45,345
Your name is

397
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,447
Ok Tae Young.

398
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:50,350
Yes?

399
00:25:51,151 --> 00:25:55,455
From now on,
you will live as Ok Tae Young.

400
00:25:58,025 --> 00:26:00,761
Madam, what do you mean?

401
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,331
No, that cannot be.

402
00:26:04,331 --> 00:26:06,500
How can someone as lowly as me
become a lady?

403
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,537
You have lived in her place,
so you must pay for that sin.

404
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:25,085
Tae Young's wish was to take you in.

405
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:29,289
We must honor that wish, right?

406
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,340
It will not be an easy life.

407
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:50,544
You will spend your days under a veil.

408
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,021
From head to toe,
you will become Tae Young.

409
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:04,124
Let no one discover the truth.

410
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,171
(Two years later)

411
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:04,284
The new magistrate is here

412
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:07,187
but skipped the ceremony and greetings.

413
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:09,523
He does not seem to fear Yuhyangso.

414
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:12,292
Even preparing
a grand feast is not enough.

415
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,294
He has recently lost his wife.

416
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:17,030
Without a hostess, it cannot be helped.

417
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,300
I heard he is upright and frugal,

418
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,169
so we might face some trouble.

419
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,205
But most of the officials are
under our control anyway.

420
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,874
What power could he have?

421
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,576
Why would such an upright magistrate

422
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:31,512
be assigned to Cheongsu County?

423
00:28:31,512 --> 00:28:33,447
Could someone have sent a report?

424
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:34,948
Who would that be?

425
00:28:34,948 --> 00:28:37,484
The young lady from the Ok family?

426
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:41,455
Judging by her boldness in insulting us,
it could be her.

427
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:45,459
Her arrogance is beyond the skies.

428
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:47,828
She does not even show her face.

429
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:51,298
The mourning period is over.
Why is she still hiding in the annex?

430
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:54,968
Even when she does step out,
she is fully veiled.

431
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:57,204
We cannot see her face.

432
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,706
Perhaps something
terrible happened to her.

433
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:03,343
Maybe she has a severe scar on her face.

434
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:08,582
Or she could be so unattractive
that she cannot show herself.

435
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:11,685
Unattractive.

436
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:30,871
My lady.

437
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:38,946
My goodness.

438
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,415
How could you be so beautiful?

439
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:45,118
Are the belongings all packed?

440
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:53,794
Even with little care, nohoe thrives.

441
00:29:53,794 --> 00:29:55,262
What a resilient plant.

442
00:29:56,763 --> 00:30:00,734
I hope it endures this winter, too.

443
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:04,538
Do not worry. Nohoe is strong.

444
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,574
I will bring it inside to keep it warm.

445
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:10,444
And you.

446
00:30:10,444 --> 00:30:13,847
Why do you sleep on the cold floor
when there is a warm room?

447
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:16,683
My dear grandmother.

448
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:19,653
In Hanyang, you will be bored
because you cannot see me.

449
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:23,156
I told you I have a warm body.

450
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,492
I just find it more comfortable.

451
00:30:28,695 --> 00:30:31,965
Your appearance has improved greatly.

452
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,668
But inside, are you still Goodeoki?

453
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,704
What do you mean, improved greatly?

454
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:40,340
I was a perfect lady from the start.

455
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,017
That is enough.

456
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:52,886
You are over-practicing.
Save your energy.

457
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:55,422
Why are you still grinding?
It should have been done already.

458
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:58,025
If the lord sees this tomorrow...

459
00:30:58,025 --> 00:31:02,162
Do it higher.
As high as everyone can see it.

460
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:05,165
Mi Ok, your movements need to be bigger.
You shine with big movements.

461
00:31:05,165 --> 00:31:07,000
Make them big.

462
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,736
Uncle, if this looks bad, we are doomed.

463
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,638
Take it and follow the instructions.

464
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,874
Soon Ok, make your voice sound prettier.

465
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:16,677
There is no excitement at all.

466
00:31:16,677 --> 00:31:17,678
Do it again.

467
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,218
Where is that man now?

468
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:27,054
Are you sure you will be alright alone?

469
00:31:27,621 --> 00:31:28,889
I am not alone.

470
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,924
I have all these people to care for me.

471
00:31:30,924 --> 00:31:34,561
Do not worry, Madam. I am here.

472
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,663
I am here too.

473
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:40,000
We will serve her well,
so please go and return safely.

474
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,001
Take care.

475
00:31:42,936 --> 00:31:45,372
Are you sure you will not join me
to see Chan Young?

476
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:48,442
I will only distract him.

477
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:49,877
He always wants to play with me.

478
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:51,445
Also,

479
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:54,815
I cannot go to Hanyang.

480
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:56,750
The sketches are still there.

481
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,919
No one will recognize you.

482
00:31:58,919 --> 00:31:59,953
No way.

483
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,091
Take care.

484
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,159
- Yes, take care.
- Yes, Madam.

485
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:10,797
- Travel safely.
- Safe journey.

486
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:12,733
- Be careful.
- Watch out for bandits.

487
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,860
(Wanted: Goodeoki, Runaway Slave)

488
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,652
Not again.

489
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:08,989
Are you planning to collect every poster
of Goodeoki in Joseon?

490
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:10,190
How did you know?

491
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:12,926
Do you think gathering them all
will make Goodeoki appear?

492
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:17,130
It is my ritual
to confirm Goodeoki's survival.

493
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,000
It is like a hobby. Collecting stamps
from every government office.

494
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:23,203
But Soeddung, why are you here?

495
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:24,271
Come on.

496
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:27,574
You are not Cheon Seo In,
but Cheon Seung Hwi.

497
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,243
And I am not Soeddung, but who?

498
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:30,611
- Man Seok.
- Man Seok.

499
00:33:30,611 --> 00:33:32,746
Man Seok, who dreams of being wealthy.

500
00:33:32,746 --> 00:33:35,048
- I keep forgetting that.
- Update your memory.

501
00:33:35,048 --> 00:33:36,350
He is Cheon Seung Hwi.

502
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,584
Mystery mode starts.

503
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:39,953
Go.

504
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:42,256
Right!

505
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:43,490
Calm down.

506
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,692
Tomorrow is the one-day performance.

507
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,295
You can catch a glimpse today,
but see it all tomorrow.

508
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:52,866
What? Hold on.

509
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:53,967
Really?

510
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:55,769
Cheon Seung Hwi the storyteller

511
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:58,972
is truly coming to our village.

512
00:33:58,972 --> 00:33:59,973
My goodness.

513
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:02,576
Cheon Seung Hwi.

514
00:34:02,576 --> 00:34:04,244
I cannot believe this is happening.

515
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:05,312
Wait.

516
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:11,585
Stop this nonsense.

517
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:13,453
What if Madam sees you?

518
00:34:14,555 --> 00:34:16,690
- I thought it would suit you.
- What?

519
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:21,962
My goodness.

520
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:30,838
(Cheon Seung Hwi,
the Celestial Storyteller)

521
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:35,742
No, you need to cut
the ends of these greens

522
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:36,910
because this part is bitter.

523
00:34:37,811 --> 00:34:38,812
Well.

524
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:42,449
No!

525
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:45,686
If you cut that much, what will we eat?

526
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:47,120
Just a little.

527
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:49,790
Why are you still so clumsy?

528
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,892
You forget everything I teach you.

529
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:53,026
Goodness.

530
00:34:54,461 --> 00:34:56,563
Are you venting frustration?

531
00:34:56,563 --> 00:34:58,432
But I am Lady Tae Young.

532
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,168
No. This is because Baekyi, that fool.

533
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:04,204
She went out early in the morning,
but she is not back yet.

534
00:35:04,204 --> 00:35:05,472
She went to the market.

535
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,407
I sent her to get some books.

536
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:09,076
My lady!

537
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,447
Cheon Seung Hwi is coming!

538
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,349
Who? Cheon what?

539
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,517
A great storyteller.

540
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:19,052
Cheon Seung Hwi,
the Celestial Storyteller!

541
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:21,421
Performance in Cheongsu County,
for one day only tomorrow!

542
00:35:23,357 --> 00:35:25,125
What is the point
of teaching her to read?

543
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,327
She only reads silly romance novels.

544
00:35:27,327 --> 00:35:29,863
You should learn to read too, Mother.

545
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:33,867
People need to enjoy literature.

546
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:35,469
Literature, my foot.

547
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:38,305
Do you think you are noble
just because you wear silk shoes?

548
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,375
You're what you are.

549
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:44,044
Don't reach for
what is beyond your grasp, understand?

550
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:45,812
No, I do not.

551
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:46,980
Goodness.

552
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:56,557
These precious silk shoes
are from my lady.

553
00:35:56,557 --> 00:35:58,325
I can't wear them often.

554
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,394
I will get you new ones
when they wear out.

555
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:04,665
No need.

556
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,834
Let us go see Cheon Seung Hwi, my lady.

557
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,403
Do you fancy that storyteller,
by any chance?

558
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:10,504
Shall I arrange a marriage?

559
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,606
Goodness! What are you saying?

560
00:36:12,606 --> 00:36:15,776
I will never marry.
I will live with you forever!

561
00:36:15,776 --> 00:36:17,945
I will not marry either.
I will live with you forever.

562
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:18,946
Perfect.

563
00:36:18,946 --> 00:36:20,981
Why not?

564
00:36:20,981 --> 00:36:24,751
My lady, the mourning period is over,
and your memory has returned.

565
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:28,355
And you are so beautiful.
So why would you not get married?

566
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,657
If you really do not want to marry,

567
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:32,426
let us go see Cheon Seung Hwi.

568
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:34,228
Is he really that impressive?

569
00:36:34,228 --> 00:36:37,431
He is not just a storyteller.

570
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:41,268
He writes his stories himself

571
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:43,704
and expresses them with dance and music.

572
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,639
Really?

573
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:50,310
And he wears a subtle veil
that slightly reveals his face.

574
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:54,348
He looks amazingly handsome
under that veil.

575
00:36:54,348 --> 00:36:57,384
His popularity is through the roof.
People adore him.

576
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:58,986
I see.

577
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:00,354
Is that all?

578
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:03,056
Do you not want to see him?

579
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,057
No, I do not.

580
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:10,063
There is something exciting.

581
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:13,367
My lady, this book has a story
about a Gat Ornament.

582
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,702
- A Gat Ornament?
- Yes.

583
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:18,906
The one you always keep in your pocket.

584
00:37:20,174 --> 00:37:22,709
The protagonist is a nobleman

585
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,546
who falls in love

586
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,581
with a woman selling peanuts.

587
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:29,416
He gave her one of his Gat Ornament

588
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:31,885
as a token of his affection.

589
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:37,057
But it turns out that she was

590
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:42,729
the servant of the noblewoman
who he was to marry!

591
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:45,032
That is absurd.

592
00:37:45,032 --> 00:37:47,301
That is exactly why it is a novel.

593
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:50,237
How could a servant be involved
with a nobleman?

594
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,739
Even imagining it feels nice.

595
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:56,810
No! I should not even imagine it.

596
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,579
I'm what I am.

597
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:01,715
There is such a funny part in the novel.

598
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:03,851
When the lady enters the room,

599
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:06,353
the servant panics and hides behind...

600
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:07,454
A folding screen?

601
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:11,225
Yes. How did you know?

602
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,296
It says here, behind the folding screen.

603
00:38:17,731 --> 00:38:19,132
Yes. This is the part.

604
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:24,738
"If I were of your status,"

605
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:27,107
"I would have confessed
my feelings at once."

606
00:38:27,107 --> 00:38:29,142
If I were of your status,

607
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:31,278
I would have confessed
my feelings at once.

608
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:35,782
Tonight, for some reason, I can't sleep.

609
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:40,821
How does Cheon Seung Hwi know?

610
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:44,725
Anyway, the nobleman searched
for the runaway slave

611
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:47,160
through the coastal regions.

612
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,228
Really?

613
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:49,830
Yes.

614
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:53,433
Is it not touching?

615
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:03,977
Over here. My lady.

616
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:05,379
Hold on.

617
00:39:29,169 --> 00:39:30,504
Cheon Seung Hwi.

618
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,610

I want to know more about you.

My dream is the sea.

647
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:41,828
My dream is

648
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:45,132
the sea.

649
00:42:57,644 --> 00:42:59,046
Are those waves?

650
00:43:00,047 --> 00:43:01,582
Look at that.

651
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,517
It is the sea.

652
00:43:55,836 --> 00:43:56,837
You are

653
00:43:57,538 --> 00:44:02,009
the ray of light that pulled me out
of deep despair

654
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:03,277
and darkness.

655
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:06,680
And this is

656
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:11,251
my heart, directed at you.

657
00:44:12,819 --> 00:44:13,921
It is longing.

658
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,793
- Goodeoki.
- What?

659
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:28,328
Let us give him a round of applause.

660
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,131
Cheon Seung Hwi!

661
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:39,973
My lady.

662
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:42,876
My lady.

663
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:44,711
Are you okay, my lady?

664
00:45:46,513 --> 00:45:47,714
What?

665
00:45:47,714 --> 00:45:49,816
Yes, I am fine.

666
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:56,890
My lady, do you by any chance know
Cheon Seung Hwi?

667
00:46:00,294 --> 00:46:01,361
No.

668
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,832
He just looks like someone
I used to know.

669
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,339
It was definitely Goodeoki.

670
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:15,342
You saw her, too, right?
We made eye contact!

671
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:17,444
If it was Goodeoki,
she would not have run away.

672
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:18,745
No, but...

673
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:20,714
I need to go. I have to go check.

674
00:46:20,714 --> 00:46:22,382
Do you even know where that lady lives?

675
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:25,752
Right, I don't know.

676
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,923
I just do not understand.

677
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:33,994
Honestly, you two were not that close.
That is how I see it.

678
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:34,995
Hey!

679
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:37,164
You know nothing.

680
00:46:37,164 --> 00:46:39,166
Have you loved someone?
You haven't even dated!

681
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,768
What has love got to do with it?
You ruined the show yourself.

682
00:46:41,768 --> 00:46:43,737
I finished it to the end.

683
00:46:43,737 --> 00:46:45,472
- There was no flow.
- What do you know?

684
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:46,807
Excuse me.

685
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:51,712
I have a few questions to ask.

686
00:46:54,615 --> 00:46:58,252
Did you say Ok Tae Young?

687
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:00,153
That's a name I have never heard before.

688
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,724
But are you saying your lady seems
to know this man?

689
00:47:03,724 --> 00:47:05,225
I could feel it for sure.

690
00:47:05,225 --> 00:47:06,627
I have never seen

691
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:09,329
our lady make such an expression before.

692
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,532
Never mind expressions or instincts.

693
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:13,867
Your lady has run away.

694
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,002
Are you from here?

695
00:47:15,402 --> 00:47:16,403
No.

696
00:47:16,737 --> 00:47:17,938
Fine.

697
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:20,174
Well, that is how ladies behave.

698
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:22,643
Our lady is very reserved.

699
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:25,279
So, as I was saying

700
00:47:25,279 --> 00:47:27,381
someone who looks like me was in Qing,

701
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:29,249
- and the person I am looking for...
- Hey!

702
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:31,618
Let us not complicate things.

703
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:33,954
Tell me.

704
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:37,124
Did you give her a Gat Ornament?

705
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,195
Like that one.

706
00:47:50,704 --> 00:47:52,005
My lady.

707
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:55,375
Bad news.

708
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,044
What is it, Kkeutdongi?

709
00:47:57,044 --> 00:48:00,414
Baekyi plans to run away
with a man tonight!

710
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:01,415
What?

711
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:03,183
She wants to bid you farewell

712
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:04,818
and asks you to come see her.

713
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:18,565
Hey, wait.

714
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,568
Are you really planning
to elope with this man?

715
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:25,172
What nonsense. He is not my type at all.

716
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:26,974
Why do you have to hurt my feelings?

717
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:28,876
Go.

718
00:48:28,876 --> 00:48:32,279
If you start blabbering nonsense,

719
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:33,814
I will deal with you myself.

720
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:36,717
Fine. Two coins,
including what happened last time.

721
00:48:36,717 --> 00:48:38,352
- Got it.
- Now open it.

722
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:41,722
That way.

723
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:52,499
Kkeutdongi.

724
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:16,390
It is really you.

725
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,045
Have you been well?

726
00:49:38,545 --> 00:49:40,914
What is going on? Where is Baekyi?

727
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:42,583
What?

728
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:47,120
Since you never leave the house,
I had to get creative.

729
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,390
Did you perhaps tell Baekyi who I am?

730
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:51,692
What?

731
00:49:51,692 --> 00:49:53,293
No, I did not.

732
00:49:53,293 --> 00:49:54,461
Are you sure?

733
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:55,462
Probably.

734
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,668
I did not even know
you were living like this.

735
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,770
I was just wandering around,
looking for you.

736
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,472
Why?

737
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,409
- What?
- Why on earth were you looking for me?

738
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:12,513
I do not understand at all.

739
00:50:14,481 --> 00:50:16,617
You would know if you read the book

740
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,119
that at first sight,

741
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:22,789
I fell in love with you.

742
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:25,959
Young Master, are you a sudogeo?

743
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:27,694
Sudogeo?

744
00:50:27,895 --> 00:50:31,198
"Su" as in "person," "do" as in "covet,"
"geo" as in "take possession."

745
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:34,668
It refers to someone who covets
and wants to possess another.

746
00:50:34,668 --> 00:50:36,703
So, are you saying

747
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:39,239
you think I am some kind of weirdo?

748
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:40,541
We only met twice.

749
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,976
And it was not even meetings,
but encounters.

750
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:44,578
How could the depth of feelings

751
00:50:44,578 --> 00:50:47,047
be proportional to the number
of meetings or time spent?

752
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:48,682
Even a single meeting can lead

753
00:50:48,682 --> 00:50:50,851
to unforgettable love.

754
00:50:50,851 --> 00:50:52,319
You are truly selfish.

755
00:50:53,086 --> 00:50:55,222
Knowing I had to flee and live in hiding

756
00:50:55,222 --> 00:50:57,291
you wrote about my story in a book

757
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,959
and even performed while looking for me.

758
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:01,228
Did you not consider
that this could put me in danger?

759
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:02,896
Are you angry with me now?

760
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:04,331
I am managing to keep it calm.

761
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:08,035
What is going on?

762
00:51:08,635 --> 00:51:11,338
It looks like they are fighting.

763
00:51:12,806 --> 00:51:14,208
It seems like it.

764
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,242
Three years.

765
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:17,678
For three years, my heart ached for you
as if it were a day,

766
00:51:17,678 --> 00:51:19,780
yet you remain as cold as ice.

767
00:51:21,014 --> 00:51:22,115
I get angrier now.

768
00:51:22,115 --> 00:51:24,952
Then why did you wear this Gat Ornament?

769
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:27,554
Why did you always keep it with you,
never letting it go?

770
00:51:28,388 --> 00:51:29,890
Receiving the Gat Ornament was

771
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:34,595
the only memory I wanted to keep

772
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:38,031
from my days
living as the servant Goodeoki.

773
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:44,404
I do not think
that feeling was longing for you.

774
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:47,074
Besides, back then, you were
in a marriage discussion with my lady.

775
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:48,408
How could I ever dare

776
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:51,245
to have feelings for you?

777
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,117
Then I guess

778
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:03,257
you never wondered about me.

779
00:52:06,293 --> 00:52:09,396
Nor were you glad to see me again.

780
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:12,332
I was glad.

781
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,204
I was amazed by your great artistry.

782
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,907
Seeing you as a brilliant storyteller

783
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:21,808
who helps people forget their sorrows

784
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:24,611
made me happy

785
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,114
and proud.

786
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:29,550
Goodeoki.

787
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,785
You must not call me that anymore.

788
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:35,022
Now that we both know we are doing well,

789
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,958
it is better if we never meet again.

790
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:41,295
Goo...

791
00:52:55,609 --> 00:52:56,844
Hey, Goodeoki.

792
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:00,080
Soeddung!

793
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,882
Goodeoki, you...

794
00:53:01,882 --> 00:53:03,650
I can barely recognize you.

795
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:05,786
Soeddung.

796
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:09,723
Do you happen to know anything
about my father?

797
00:53:09,723 --> 00:53:11,158
Is he not with you?

798
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:14,061
We got separated while escaping.

799
00:53:15,162 --> 00:53:17,998
But honestly,
I had no idea it was like this for you.

800
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:19,266
Do not get me wrong.

801
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:21,368
My young master gave up
everything he owned

802
00:53:21,368 --> 00:53:24,104
to the bounty hunters,
begging them not to catch you.

803
00:53:26,907 --> 00:53:28,542
But do not worry too much.

804
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:30,777
Thanks to that,
we are doing well financially.

805
00:53:32,379 --> 00:53:33,447
I will be off, Soeddung.

806
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:35,415
Call me Man Seok now.

807
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:37,684
I am no longer Soeddung. I am Man Seok.

808
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:41,021
Take care, Man Seok.
Take good care of the master.

809
00:53:41,021 --> 00:53:42,489
Got it.

810
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:43,657
Goodbye.

811
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:46,460
Hey.

812
00:53:47,928 --> 00:53:50,330
She smiles for Man Seok.

813
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:51,865
How unfair.

814
00:54:00,774 --> 00:54:05,412
I could not hear a word
of what you were talking about.

815
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:08,448
Why did you do that?

816
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:17,391
I truly thought
Cheon Seung Hwi might be your lover.

817
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:20,661
It was the first time
I saw your face so flushed.

818
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:23,030
It was quite surprising.

819
00:54:25,132 --> 00:54:26,667
I see.

820
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:30,537
Whenever I look at you, my heart aches.

821
00:54:31,205 --> 00:54:34,141
My lady is so beautiful

822
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,410
but only terrible rumors spread
in the village.

823
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,047
You refuse to get married,

824
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:42,015
never leave the house,

825
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:44,251
and do not have a single friend.

826
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:48,188
Who says I do not have friends?

827
00:54:54,127 --> 00:54:55,596
Baekyi, I have you.

828
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:03,103
I just thought

829
00:55:05,005 --> 00:55:07,774
you seemed so lonely and pitiful.

830
00:55:08,542 --> 00:55:10,944
Regardless of that man's status

831
00:55:10,944 --> 00:55:13,480
if he truly was your beloved,

832
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,583
I wished you would elope with him.

833
00:55:16,583 --> 00:55:21,555
I just wanted my lady to be happy,
no matter what.

834
00:55:23,724 --> 00:55:24,725
Baekyi.

835
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:26,960
I am not lonely.

836
00:55:27,961 --> 00:55:29,530
I am truly happy.

837
00:55:32,466 --> 00:55:34,701
I have endured so much hardship.

838
00:55:36,937 --> 00:55:38,438
Hardship?

839
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:41,542
But not anymore.

840
00:55:42,543 --> 00:55:46,914
So, if I desire more, I'll be punished.

841
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,518
This is enough.

842
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:55,556
Just seeing him once is

843
00:55:58,358 --> 00:55:59,760
truly enough.

844
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:23,417
Are you okay?

845
00:56:25,285 --> 00:56:26,687
Do I look okay?

846
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:43,604
If you laugh again,
I will kill you. I swear.

847
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:53,614
Go tell the innkeeper
we will stay a few more days.

848
00:56:53,614 --> 00:56:54,781
But we already packed!

849
00:56:54,781 --> 00:56:56,283
No. I am leaving tomorrow morning.

850
00:56:56,283 --> 00:56:58,485
- How can we leave like this?
- Yes, we can.

851
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:00,254
Really? Just leave like this?

852
00:57:00,254 --> 00:57:02,289
Do not do anything else anymore.

853
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:03,724
If you do, it'll just be pathetic.

854
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:04,825
Unbelievable.

855
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:10,397
Then fine, just one more day.

856
00:57:10,397 --> 00:57:11,532
What?

857
00:57:12,232 --> 00:57:13,333
One day.

858
00:57:13,967 --> 00:57:15,435
Fine.

859
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:16,970
What could happen in one day?

860
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:18,906
But you know

861
00:57:18,906 --> 00:57:21,542
if her identity is revealed,
that would be really bad.

862
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:32,019
Indeed, to better focus on studying,
Hanyang is ideal.

863
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:36,890
By the way, are you planning
to move to Hanyang with your son?

864
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,091
That is the plan.

865
00:57:38,091 --> 00:57:41,695
Then, shall we hold a farewell party?

866
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:44,198
I was thinking about that as well.

867
00:57:44,198 --> 00:57:45,766
Let us host it at my house.

868
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:49,803
Is Baek Do Gwang is going to Hanyang?

869
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:50,838
Yes.

870
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:54,575
But Baek Do Gwang has no interest
in studying.

871
00:57:54,575 --> 00:57:56,276
He will struggle even in Hanyang.

872
00:57:56,276 --> 00:58:00,347
But you know, sometimes he roams around
near our house.

873
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:05,052
Maybe he has feelings for our lady?

874
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:06,320
Do you know anything?

875
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,722
I will not say a word
without anything in return.

876
00:58:08,722 --> 00:58:10,390
Do not talk nonsense.

877
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,894
Anyway, that household
can finally breathe.

878
00:58:13,894 --> 00:58:15,329
Indeed.

879
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:19,299
That madam is notorious
for her temper in Cheongsu County.

880
00:58:19,299 --> 00:58:22,569
Have you seen
the scar on Dol Seok's face?

881
00:58:23,203 --> 00:58:25,472
It gives me the chills.

882
00:58:25,472 --> 00:58:28,609
By the way, where is Baekyi?
I need to collect my money.

883
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:31,545
Probably at the annex.
She cannot live without her lady.

884
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:48,095
So now you understand what I meant

885
00:58:48,762 --> 00:58:50,230
about loneliness dulling over time.

886
00:58:51,231 --> 00:58:52,599
How did you get here?

887
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,134
I climbed over the wall.

888
00:58:54,401 --> 00:58:56,069
Why are you doing this?

889
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:57,437
You should not be here.

890
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:00,007
This is disappointing.

891
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:02,309
I hid you when you came to the annex

892
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:03,610
but you want to cast me out.

893
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:05,112
Please go back.

894
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,781
No.

895
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:11,185
You are coming with me today.

896
00:59:11,185 --> 00:59:13,520
- I cannot do that.
- Yes, you can.

897
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:17,191
- Goodeoki.
- Young Master.

898
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:19,860
Hey, are you Goodeoki from Hanyang?

899
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,428
Are you threatening me now?

900
00:59:21,428 --> 00:59:24,264
You have become prettier, Goodeoki.

901
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:26,433
Goodeoki!

902
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:27,467
Stop!

903
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:30,604
Where exactly do you want to take me?

904
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:37,344
I have a horse ready over the wall.
Let us go.

905
00:59:37,344 --> 00:59:39,746
The wall?
Do you mean I should climb over it?

906
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:41,215
- Yes.
- Wait.

907
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:42,216
Let's go.

908
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,751
Here.

909
00:59:52,392 --> 00:59:54,094
I have not lost my skills.

910
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,231
What are you doing?

911
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:59,132
Someone might see. Hurry.

912
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:01,535
Right.

913
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:08,242
Wait.

914
01:00:10,677 --> 01:00:11,745
Do you need a hand?

915
01:00:12,379 --> 01:00:13,380
No.

916
01:00:43,577 --> 01:00:45,312
There is no one here,

917
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,714
so don't worry.

918
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:51,752
The sea.

919
01:00:54,688 --> 01:00:56,089
This is my first time seeing it.

920
01:00:57,324 --> 01:00:59,226
I found this place
while searching for you.

921
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,061
What do you think?

922
01:01:01,461 --> 01:01:03,964
Would it not be perfect
to have a house back there?

923
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:07,234
Once we find your father,

924
01:01:07,234 --> 01:01:09,636
I thought it would be nice to live here.

925
01:01:11,705 --> 01:01:12,739
Goodeoki.

926
01:01:15,275 --> 01:01:17,444
- We caught so many.
- You must be hungry.

927
01:01:19,546 --> 01:01:21,882
The view I had only imagined is

928
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:26,286
exactly the same as this.

929
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:39,233
How did you end up being a storyteller?

930
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,769
You finally have something to ask me.

931
01:01:44,137 --> 01:01:46,473
Can you just answer my question?

932
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:50,177
The night you ran away,

933
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:54,314
I discovered who I truly was.

934
01:01:54,581 --> 01:01:57,050
I used to think
I was just an adopted child,

935
01:01:57,951 --> 01:01:59,653
but I was the son of a courtesan.

936
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,723
I left home and went to Songdo

937
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:04,224
where I heard my mother was.

938
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:06,527
Did you meet her?

939
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:15,068
Don't look at me that way.

940
01:02:15,736 --> 01:02:18,472
Those days I spent there were

941
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:21,141
the happiest I could imagine.

942
01:02:25,512 --> 01:02:28,081
I wrote and read stories just for fun

943
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:29,516
and people really enjoyed them.

944
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:36,490
Since I became a storyteller,

945
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:38,225
I decided to do it properly.

946
01:02:38,225 --> 01:02:39,226
Are you okay?

947
01:02:39,226 --> 01:02:41,695
I thought that if I became famous,

948
01:02:41,695 --> 01:02:43,797
you might come to find me.

949
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:49,603
So I worked on becoming
an extraordinary storyteller

950
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:52,105
as Song Seo In.

951
01:03:13,026 --> 01:03:16,797
But why do you hide your face?

952
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,637
My father came looking for me.

953
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:25,906
Father.

954
01:03:28,942 --> 01:03:30,611
Father?

955
01:03:30,611 --> 01:03:32,112
You disgusting wretch!

956
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:35,616
How dare you shame our family with this?

957
01:03:36,216 --> 01:03:38,685
If I hear your name once more,

958
01:03:38,685 --> 01:03:41,822
I will not let you live.

959
01:03:46,293 --> 01:03:47,394
So

960
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:50,130
I changed my name

961
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:53,400
and began to hide my face.

962
01:03:55,702 --> 01:03:56,870
But it is fine.

963
01:03:57,204 --> 01:03:59,206
I live freely now.

964
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,111
I write, dance,
and sing as much as I want.

965
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:06,947
I live as if I am truly alive.

966
01:04:10,017 --> 01:04:11,518
You seem happy.

967
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:16,056
But why do you live

968
01:04:16,056 --> 01:04:20,060
as if you are confined
to the annex as I used to?

969
01:04:22,596 --> 01:04:26,066
What other life could I possibly have?

970
01:04:26,867 --> 01:04:28,702
If I leave that household,

971
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:31,939
I am still a runaway slave.

972
01:04:36,076 --> 01:04:37,311
Come with me.

973
01:04:39,646 --> 01:04:41,181
I will protect you.

974
01:04:42,883 --> 01:04:45,352
I travel all across Joseon

975
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:47,654
so I can help you find your father.

976
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:52,326
Then, we can return here
and live together.

977
01:04:57,264 --> 01:05:00,400
Is this not the dream you spoke of?

978
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:09,009
If

979
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,547
we were of the same status,

980
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:16,183
we could marry without trouble

981
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:18,986
and live under the same roof.

982
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:22,256
I would nag

983
01:05:23,156 --> 01:05:25,893
and you would laze around.

984
01:05:27,361 --> 01:05:29,263
The thought of it is

985
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:33,667
both sweet and sorrowful.

986
01:05:37,971 --> 01:05:39,940
It is an unattainable dream.

987
01:05:45,145 --> 01:05:46,146
I want

988
01:05:48,715 --> 01:05:50,551
you to live as yourself.

989
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:54,421
Living forever in hiding under a veil is

990
01:05:56,156 --> 01:05:57,491
not like you.

991
01:06:01,662 --> 01:06:03,630
I will leave tomorrow.

992
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,098
I will wait at the inn.

993
01:06:37,764 --> 01:06:38,866
What is going on?

994
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,335
What is it?

995
01:06:41,802 --> 01:06:43,904
Baekyi...

996
01:06:51,345 --> 01:06:52,546
My lady.

997
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:02,990
Baekyi.

998
01:07:05,259 --> 01:07:06,560
Why is Baekyi

999
01:07:08,095 --> 01:07:09,429
like that?

1000
01:07:23,477 --> 01:07:25,646
What's wrong, Baekyi?

1001
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,081
Tell me.

1002
01:07:30,217 --> 01:07:31,485
Baekyi.

1003
01:07:31,485 --> 01:07:32,886
What happened?

1004
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,522
Tell me what happened!

1005
01:07:35,522 --> 01:07:39,326
She was gone since morning,
and I thought nothing of it.

1006
01:07:39,326 --> 01:07:41,862
But Mak Sim said she was worried,

1007
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:43,630
so I went looking for her.

1008
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:45,299
Baekyi.

1009
01:07:48,836 --> 01:07:51,405
What is going on?

1010
01:07:53,307 --> 01:07:55,642
Why would Baekyi do this?

1011
01:07:55,642 --> 01:07:57,845
The coroner says she took her own life.

1012
01:07:57,845 --> 01:07:59,479
That cannot be true.

1013
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:00,914
Baekyi would never do that!

1014
01:08:00,914 --> 01:08:03,650
Exactly. We all feel the same.

1015
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,119
The coroner said she hanged herself,

1016
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:08,255
but why is the back of her head
cracked open, then?

1017
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:10,958
This was clearly someone else's doing!

1018
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,826
Who? Why?

1019
01:08:12,826 --> 01:08:14,027
Baek Do Gwang!

1020
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:16,730
- Kkeutdongi!
- Why? I am right.

1021
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:18,999
That guy was always
lurking near our house

1022
01:08:18,999 --> 01:08:22,936
and trying to persuade Baekyi
to go to Hanyang with him.

1023
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:25,839
Did you know that, too?

1024
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:28,141
And if I did,

1025
01:08:29,176 --> 01:08:31,578
what could we have done?

1026
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,516
After all, how many times
have we seen this happen?

1027
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:40,320
- My lady, where are you going?
- What are you planning, my lady?

1028
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,456
To the government office.

1029
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:45,225
I will tell them everything
and have him arrested!

1030
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:48,729
Even if you speak up,
nothing will change, my lady.

1031
01:08:49,563 --> 01:08:52,966
If the coroner rules it suicide,
it's a done deal.

1032
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:55,936
Are we just supposed to ignore
Baekyi's death?

1033
01:08:55,936 --> 01:08:57,204
Let her die in vain?

1034
01:08:57,204 --> 01:08:59,540
Inequity is our fate, my lady.

1035
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,075
Our lives are no better than pigs.

1036
01:09:02,075 --> 01:09:03,577
That is just how it is.

1037
01:09:05,946 --> 01:09:09,116
Are we animals? Are we pigs?

1038
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:12,052
Hey, what is the difference
between you and a pig?

1039
01:09:12,052 --> 01:09:13,320
Let us go.

1040
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,621
Mother!

1041
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:17,224
Go die! You filthy maggot.

1042
01:09:17,224 --> 01:09:18,959
Just go die!

1043
01:09:22,596 --> 01:09:24,364
Where are you going, my lady?

1044
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:27,267
Baekyi is

1045
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:30,404
not a pig.

1046
01:09:31,538 --> 01:09:32,639
Baekyi is

1047
01:09:40,881 --> 01:09:42,716
my only friend.

1048
01:09:44,218 --> 01:09:45,519
You cannot go!

1049
01:09:47,888 --> 01:09:48,956
Move.

1050
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:51,358
Mak Sim, please move. Move aside!

1051
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:53,160
Get a hold of yourself!

1052
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:56,330
Have you forgotten who you are?

1053
01:09:57,497 --> 01:09:59,366
We kept calling you "my lady",

1054
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:01,802
so you really think
you are Lady Ok Tae Young.

1055
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:06,273
If you step up and people recognize you,

1056
01:10:06,273 --> 01:10:08,775
if they find out who you really are

1057
01:10:08,775 --> 01:10:11,879
killing you would be the easiest thing.

1058
01:10:14,147 --> 01:10:17,417
Instead, run away with that man.

1059
01:10:20,254 --> 01:10:23,423
That is what Baekyi would have wanted.

1060
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:29,563
She only ever wanted your happiness.

1061
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:35,068
Remember this.

1062
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:38,605
You are not the real Lady Ok Tae Young.

1063
01:11:18,045 --> 01:11:21,048
What should I give you?

1064
01:11:22,482 --> 01:11:24,785
I do not have anything

1065
01:11:26,119 --> 01:11:28,355
so what can I do for you?

1066
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:30,958
Do not do anything for me.

1067
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:35,329
From now on, whatever you do,
do it for yourself.

1068
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:40,127
You did not come to leave

1069
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:43,297
with me.

1070
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:49,970
Take this.

1071
01:12:55,409 --> 01:12:57,644
You said it was the one thing

1072
01:12:57,644 --> 01:12:59,680
you wanted to remember as Goodeoki.

1073
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:02,683
And now you want to erase me.

1074
01:13:04,718 --> 01:13:05,953
You too

1075
01:13:08,255 --> 01:13:09,656
should forget me.

1076
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:14,127
Goodeoki you cherished,

1077
01:13:15,128 --> 01:13:18,065
the Goodeoki who dreamed
of living by the sea with her father,

1078
01:13:21,168 --> 01:13:22,302
died two years ago

1079
01:13:24,671 --> 01:13:26,874
in a fire at the inn.

1080
01:13:30,978 --> 01:13:32,713
The life I received in place of the lady

1081
01:13:35,382 --> 01:13:37,351
cannot be lived by Goodeoki.

1082
01:13:38,352 --> 01:13:39,419
Therefore,

1083
01:13:42,556 --> 01:13:44,324
the dream I must fulfill is

1084
01:13:46,927 --> 01:13:48,395
not my own

1085
01:13:51,298 --> 01:13:52,933
but my lady's.

1086
01:14:03,277 --> 01:14:04,278
I see.

1087
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:15,289
Now

1088
01:14:17,357 --> 01:14:18,559
you are truly yourself.

1089
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:42,916
My lady.

1090
01:14:43,717 --> 01:14:45,385
You were right.

1091
01:14:45,385 --> 01:14:48,322
The coroner from the upper village says
it cannot be suicide.

1092
01:14:48,889 --> 01:14:50,557
My lady.

1093
01:14:50,557 --> 01:14:53,760
But Mak Sim has been missing
for a while now.

1094
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,765
Could it be she plans to follow Baekyi?

1095
01:14:58,765 --> 01:15:00,200
No, Mak Sim.

1096
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,336
- Mak Sim!
- Mak Sim!

1097
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:10,377
I hope it suited your taste.

1098
01:15:10,377 --> 01:15:11,578
It was delicious.

1099
01:15:11,578 --> 01:15:14,081
- Let go of me.
- No.

1100
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:15,582
- No!
- No!

1101
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:19,286
I cannot live like this. It is unfair!

1102
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:20,587
What is this commotion?

1103
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:24,558
Baek Do Gwang, get out!

1104
01:15:24,558 --> 01:15:26,793
Come out here right now!

1105
01:15:26,793 --> 01:15:28,529
- What nonsense is this?
- Baek Do Gwang?

1106
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:30,864
Have you lost your mind?

1107
01:15:30,864 --> 01:15:33,467
Yes, I have lost my mind!

1108
01:15:34,134 --> 01:15:37,171
If I am going to die anyway,
what would stop me?

1109
01:15:37,171 --> 01:15:39,173
What is this?

1110
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:43,110
Look at yourselves. Look at this mess.

1111
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,945
Can you call this a life?

1112
01:15:46,713 --> 01:15:49,950
Bring your young master out here
right now.

1113
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:53,353
- Call out Baek Do Gwang!
- Please, stop!

1114
01:15:53,353 --> 01:15:56,089
That woman has lost her mind.

1115
01:15:56,089 --> 01:15:57,324
What nonsense is this?

1116
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:01,528
I have not lost my mind.

1117
01:16:01,995 --> 01:16:03,163
- No!
- Let go!

1118
01:16:03,163 --> 01:16:04,331
Listen.

1119
01:16:04,331 --> 01:16:06,400
Madam, you know better than anyone.

1120
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,803
Your son followed my daughter around,
obsessed with her.

1121
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:14,608
You knew he kept begging her
to go to Hanyang with him.

1122
01:16:29,656 --> 01:16:32,192
How dare you accuse my son!

1123
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:35,395
Your son is precious?

1124
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:40,534
My daughter is precious too!

1125
01:16:43,203 --> 01:16:47,241
Just like you, I gave birth to my child,

1126
01:16:47,241 --> 01:16:51,278
nursed her, and raised her with love.

1127
01:16:51,678 --> 01:16:54,047
Yet the life you forced on her was

1128
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:56,950
that of a slave, lower than a pig.

1129
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:59,653
So she tried to change her fate
by putting moves on a nobleman.

1130
01:16:59,653 --> 01:17:01,388
When things went south,
she ended herself.

1131
01:17:01,388 --> 01:17:03,357
Let us see

1132
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:06,026
if that is true or not.

1133
01:17:07,194 --> 01:17:11,131
Call Baek Do Gwang.

1134
01:17:12,332 --> 01:17:14,501
This is why the lower class
must be tightly controlled.

1135
01:17:14,501 --> 01:17:17,171
Indeed. They were treated too nicely.

1136
01:17:17,171 --> 01:17:19,773
How dare they insult nobles in this way!

1137
01:17:19,773 --> 01:17:21,542
This is unbelievable.

1138
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:23,677
Baekyi.

1139
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:28,248
This girl must be punished.

1140
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:31,585
Prepare a mat for a beating now!

1141
01:17:31,585 --> 01:17:32,653
Yes.

1142
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:36,023
Stop!

1143
01:17:53,473 --> 01:17:57,244
Why are you trying to beat her?

1144
01:18:00,113 --> 01:18:02,216
She must be Lord Ok's daughter.

1145
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,518
I see.

1146
01:18:05,719 --> 01:18:08,689
Even if your family has fallen,

1147
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:11,825
you should have kept
your servants in line.

1148
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:17,497
You should have managed your son better.

1149
01:18:18,632 --> 01:18:19,700
What?

1150
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,301
How dare she say such a thing.

1151
01:18:21,301 --> 01:18:24,171
My lady, please stop.

1152
01:18:24,171 --> 01:18:25,172
I will protect

1153
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:29,243
those I must protect.

1154
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:34,181
What are you waiting for?
Tie her up right now!

1155
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:36,083
Stop!

1156
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:41,955
I told you not to touch her.

1157
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:50,163
Listen here, Magistrate.

1158
01:18:50,163 --> 01:18:53,500
They have disgraced my family
and insulted my son.

1159
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:56,537
A beating is not enough.

1160
01:18:56,803 --> 01:18:58,405
Madam.

1161
01:18:58,405 --> 01:19:01,708
You must prove
that you did not kill Baekyi.

1162
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:05,112
What grounds do you have
to make such accusations?

1163
01:19:05,112 --> 01:19:06,146
Do you have evidence?

1164
01:19:06,146 --> 01:19:09,550
They murdered the slave Baekyi

1165
01:19:10,017 --> 01:19:11,518
and staged it as a suicide.

1166
01:19:13,987 --> 01:19:14,988
Murder?

1167
01:19:14,988 --> 01:19:17,925
The coroner
from the upper village proved

1168
01:19:17,925 --> 01:19:21,929
the body inspection was falsified.

1169
01:19:24,464 --> 01:19:25,465
So?

1170
01:19:25,866 --> 01:19:28,068
Who do you accuse
fabricated the evidence?

1171
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:29,321
I report the Baek family

1172
01:19:30,671 --> 01:19:32,339
for the crime of murdering

1173
01:19:34,374 --> 01:19:35,542
slave Baekyi.

1174
01:19:35,542 --> 01:19:36,743
Are you insane?

1175
01:19:36,743 --> 01:19:38,879
What nonsense is this?

1176
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,915
Magistrate, are you just
going to stand there?

1177
01:19:42,883 --> 01:19:47,688
A reinvestigation will be conducted
at the government office.

1178
01:19:47,688 --> 01:19:49,022
So please come with us.

1179
01:19:50,057 --> 01:19:52,059
Is this some kind of joke?

1180
01:19:52,593 --> 01:19:54,394
If you refuse to come,

1181
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:58,498
arrest the entire Baek family.

1182
01:19:58,498 --> 01:19:59,499
Yes, sir.

1183
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,438
Let go of me!
What do you think you are doing?

1184
01:20:04,805 --> 01:20:07,174
- Madam!
- Madam!

1185
01:20:08,642 --> 01:20:10,143
My goodness.

1186
01:20:13,447 --> 01:20:16,416
I am truly grateful to you
for agreeing to reopen the case.

1187
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:21,121
It is only what I must do
as the magistrate.

1188
01:20:23,624 --> 01:20:24,625
By the way,

1189
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:30,230
what is your name, young lady?

1190
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:40,807
I am...

1191
01:20:43,443 --> 01:20:44,645
My name is

1192
01:20:47,447 --> 01:20:48,749
Ok Tae Young.

1193
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:44,505
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1194
01:21:44,505 --> 01:21:46,874
Why did you have to make trouble?

1195
01:21:46,874 --> 01:21:50,244
I will never forgive those
who hurt Baekyi.

1196
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:53,180
Guilty or not, we must win this time.

1197
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,682
Do you not realize
you lack witnesses and evidence?

1198
01:21:55,682 --> 01:21:58,385
It is not that there is no evidence,
but that it was destroyed.

1199
01:21:58,385 --> 01:21:59,386
Drag them out!

1200
01:21:59,386 --> 01:22:01,154
Only by punishing
the Special Inspector Baek,

1201
01:22:01,154 --> 01:22:02,623
will Cheongsu County be restored.

1202
01:22:02,623 --> 01:22:05,025
Why not be a Legal Advocate yourself?

1203
01:22:05,025 --> 01:22:07,995
Under Article 347
of the Great Ming Code,

1204
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:10,130
the crime of insulting a noble is

1205
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:12,399
punishable by ten lashes.
