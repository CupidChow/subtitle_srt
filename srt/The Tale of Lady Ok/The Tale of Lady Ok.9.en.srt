1
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,071
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,982
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,592
If you stop now,
I will forgive your disrespect.

5
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,064
How dare you threaten the Magistrate!

6
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,935
Drag her to the government office now.

7
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:09,870
Let go of me.

8
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,737
Let go.

9
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,843
No!

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:16,977
Let go.

11
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,082
What do we do?

12
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,186
What do we do now?

13
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,550
- Madam!
- Let go.

14
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:05,025
Release her now.

15
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,326
Do not treat her this way!

16
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,395
- Madam!
- Mi Ryeong, don't worry. Stay inside.

17
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,297
Stop this.

18
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,165
Kkeutdongi, tell the Inspector General.

19
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,401
Take me instead. Just take me.

20
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:16,870
- Mak Sim, are you okay?
- Madam.

21
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,439
- Let go.
- Madam.

22
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,541
Mak Sim.

23
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,441
Let go.

24
00:02:26,947 --> 00:02:28,282
What do we do?

25
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:56,510
Why are you committing this atrocity?

26
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,947
How can the Magistrate of a village

27
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,015
behave like a thug?

28
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,720
Well,

29
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:13,060
how dare you defy
the Magistrate's order in public?

30
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,864
Is a Magistrate's order
equal to a royal decree?

31
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,968
Does Joseon Law include
an offense for offending a Magistrate?

32
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,303
What did you say?

33
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,539
Destroying others' property, arson,

34
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,674
and unlawfully detaining
an innocent person.

35
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,943
Abusing public power like that
without cause is punishable

36
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:31,645
under the law.

37
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,549
I am punishing those who disrupt ethics

38
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,918
to restore discipline
in Cheongsu County.

39
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,587
By the law,

40
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,789
you have committed
an offense against morality.

41
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,592
Against morality?

42
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:47,794
You haven't fulfilled
your duties as a spouse.

43
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,963
Not for a single moment

44
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,967
have I abandoned my duties.

45
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,337
If you keep doing this,

46
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,074
I will have no choice but to detain you.

47
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,145
Show me the examination record
of the corpse.

48
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,318
How dare you request
an official document?

49
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,819
The records

50
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,657
should naturally be provided
to the family.

51
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,197
You said there was an autopsy.

52
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,935
Was that a lie?

53
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:41,181
You should watch what you say.

54
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,819
To gain a virtuous arch
by making me a widow,

55
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,322
so

56
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,725
you resorted to murder, didn't you?

57
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,030
Lock her up now.

58
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,741
They dragged a respected noble lady
like an animal in broad daylight.

59
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,910
They even set fire
to the legal advocate's office.

60
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,678
Will you let this slide?

61
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,480
I missed quite a scene.

62
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:16,550
You must go to
the Magistrate and protest.

63
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,319
The Magistrate must not be allowed
to rule over the noble class.

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,822
Don't you know the Yuhyangso
must oversee an unfit Magistrate?

65
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,524
At the last meeting,

66
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:26,493
we agreed to side with the Magistrate.

67
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,095
What did you say?

68
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,163
Ignoring her husband's body

69
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,400
and refusing his funeral
and mourning is disgraceful.

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,435
Indeed.

71
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,140
If you don't find a solution soon,

72
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,776
I will announce to all

73
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,913
that Lady Song colluded with you
to hire kidnappers.

74
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,184
Go ahead and try!

75
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,286
Madam.

76
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:55,589
You could not, so you told me
to copy the Inner Education.

77
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,057
Is that not correct?

78
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,282
How unfortunate that you cannot
even sit comfortably.

79
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,819
Tend to the body outside
and complete three years of mourning.

80
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,456
Then vow to remain chaste
and never step outside again.

81
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:31,825
Only then will you be freed.

82
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,261
If so,

83
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,866
you should hope that I die in prison.

84
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,834
Perhaps that would be good too.

85
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:44,438
A wife who could not accept
her husband's death and was driven mad,

86
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,773
wailing in prison to death.

87
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,443
That'd be perfect
to receive a virtuous arch.

88
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:53,447
I suspected Lady Song did not act alone.

89
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,184
Now I know for sure

90
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,987
that you were also in it.

91
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,357
I don't understand what you are saying.

92
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:05,359
Judging by your reckless behaviors,

93
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:09,263
you must also have powerful backing
behind you.

94
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,769
No matter what you speak,
no one will aid you.

95
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,605
Do not worry about me.

96
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,878
Worry about your safety instead.

97
00:07:31,385 --> 00:07:33,453
Don't let anyone meet her.

98
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,056
Don't even give her
a single sip of water.

99
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,524
Yes, sir.

100
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,362
Let's see how long you last.

101
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:52,172
Why is the Magistrate so determined

102
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,175
to ruin our Madam?

103
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,226
- Kkeutdongi.
- Madam.

104
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,728
How did it go?
Did you meet the inspector?

105
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,563
He went to Hanyang.

106
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:19,333
I heard they captured
all the kidnappers.

107
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,702
The investigation and inspections
are over as well.

108
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,771
Then didn't you meet
the Provincial governor?

109
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:26,073
I have tried.

110
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,142
The guards stopped me,
and I could not do anything.

111
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,211
Huh? Did they beat you?

112
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,114
I am going out.

113
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,550
Where are you going now?

114
00:08:47,761 --> 00:08:49,429
How...

115
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:51,532
Mi Ryeong.

116
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:53,400
It is your mother.

117
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,478
You are my Mi Ryeong, right?

118
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,282
You are so pretty.

119
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,419
What is this? Are they...

120
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:13,921
Mother and daughter?

121
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:15,589
Mi Ryeong.

122
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,025
Your brother passed away.

123
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,094
Our Do Gwang

124
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,999
could not endure his exile
and killed himself.

125
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,104
With nowhere to go,
I went to your father's house

126
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,207
and heard you married into this family.

127
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:35,075
I was so shocked.

128
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,113
Let's go inside and catch up.

129
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,584
Leaving your mother who has come
after a long time standing like this

130
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,319
is improper, right?

131
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,835
After such a long journey,
I am starving. Bring me a snack.

132
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:11,144
Goodness, are you okay?

133
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,947
My head is spinning so much.
I don't know where to start now.

134
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,719
Should I just rip her apart?

135
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,721
Should I throw her out?

136
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,623
Calm down.

137
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,392
Even so, she is the mother
of the Young Madam.

138
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,227
She must be here for revenge.

139
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,929
Right? Am I wrong?

140
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,464
We need to tell her.

141
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:33,534
We must tell the Elder Madam
that they are mother and daughter.

142
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,307
It seems the servants know nothing.

143
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,912
Ok Tae Young must have hidden
and covered all your wrongdoings.

144
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,715
She also kept your wrongdoings secret.

145
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,419
Shameless girl.

146
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,754
Were you happy to betray your mother

147
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,123
and sleep comfortably
in this house alone?

148
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,392
You are worse than a beast.

149
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,427
Was the kidnapping incident not enough?

150
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,064
Closing the legal advocate's office
and imprisoning Tae Young.

151
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,500
Was that your doing, Mother?

152
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:13,240
You deliberately approached
and married into this family

153
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,375
to spy on everything
and report it to me.

154
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,011
You placed a cursed doll yourself

155
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,414
and helped make Ok Tae Young a widow.

156
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,716
And now you dare call her
your sister-in-law

157
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,286
acting like you are siblings.
That is truly absurd.

158
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:28,689
Didn't you deceive me, Mother?

159
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,559
You said Tae Young framed my brother
for false charges.

160
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,395
How dare you raise your voice
against your mother!

161
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:36,997
Did you

162
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:43,770
ever think of me
as your child for a single moment?

163
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:49,576
You only came to use me
for your revenge, is that not so?

164
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:53,247
Are you now planning to sever
all ties of kinship?

165
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,024
Did you overhear everything?

166
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,335
They say bad ties are still ties.

167
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,572
Who would have thought
I would become your master?

168
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,777
This house belongs to Tae Young.

169
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:26,113
Finish your meal and return
to Uichang County.

170
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,482
How can you treat your mother
so heartlessly?

171
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:30,217
You staying here

172
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,453
but casting me out to that freezing place.
What will people think?

173
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,823
Once the sun rises...

174
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,659
Madam.

175
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,162
I will send her out with me.

176
00:12:42,162 --> 00:12:43,096
Out?

177
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,265
What will become of this house
if we leave?

178
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,270
I understand how you feel, Madam.

179
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:54,374
A beloved child that I raised
with all the care

180
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,479
has been gone for seven years already.

181
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:03,717
Every day I see her in my mind

182
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:06,687
calling me "Mother."

183
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,023
And the person responsible
for my child's death.

184
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,527
I also want to rip them apart.
I understand you.

185
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,063
So?

186
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,732
But,

187
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:24,505
even if we do that,
our children will not return.

188
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:29,042
How dare you compare
your lowly daughter to my child!

189
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,079
- Stop it!
- It is okay. Let her vent.

190
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,348
Let her anger run its course.

191
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:36,583
You wretch!

192
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,121
Are you okay?

193
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,425
Goodness, why are you so hot?

194
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:49,062
How can someone so frail
manage this family?

195
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,832
Do not worry. Rest well.

196
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,668
I will handle the household affairs.

197
00:13:57,471 --> 00:13:59,673
From today on,
I will use the master bedroom.

198
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:40,314
Do you think I am afraid of you?

199
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,684
I am Goodeoki.

200
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,298
My goodness.

201
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,166
Serve breakfast again.

202
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,769
How dare you serve spoiled food!

203
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,405
You, clear this now
and serve breakfast again.

204
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:42,009
You, clean the main hall
and polish every single lattice.

205
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:48,182
You, take out all the dishes
from the kitchen and wash them

206
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:50,517
and wash and dry all the bedding
in the house.

207
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:53,820
Yes.

208
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,256
My goodness, all of that?

209
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:58,525
Of course,
since a new family member has joined.

210
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,295
I cannot use things that are dirty.

211
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,566
Also, pull out all the weeds
in the backyard.

212
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,436
The aloe too?

213
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,671
Please don't.

214
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,876
Or shall I pull out
your eyeballs instead?

215
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:20,347
No, I will do it.
I will pull the aloe all out.

216
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:22,816
If anyone defies my orders again,

217
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:27,020
I will brand their faces.

218
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,171
Goodness.

219
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:52,012
I sent for the physician,
so they should be here soon.

220
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:56,083
I brought porridge. Please have a bite.

221
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,018
Oh my.

222
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:02,956
At least take one bite.

223
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,634
Could it be that you are pregnant or...

224
00:17:13,634 --> 00:17:14,434
Shh!

225
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,138
Don't tell others.

226
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:22,943
Yes.

227
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:10,424
The color is beautiful,
and the craftsmanship is intricate.

228
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:15,996
Why are you giving me
such a precious gift?

229
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:19,466
It is to repay you
for all the help you have given me.

230
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:23,203
Congratulations, by the way.

231
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:26,907
We may not have earned the virtuous arch,
but you achieved your goal.

232
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:29,643
The virtuous arch will come,
so just wait.

233
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,347
Do you have another plan for that?

234
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:37,351
Surviving imprisonment
is not an easy feat for a woman.

235
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,988
When she passes,
we will have a plausible reason.

236
00:18:40,988 --> 00:18:42,623
Then we will receive the virtuous arch.

237
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,827
But tell me.

238
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:51,365
Did you instigate the Magistrate
just like you did with me?

239
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,035
It is better for you to know less.

240
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:58,639
Knowing too much
can be dangerous to you.

241
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:03,877
(Cheongsu County)

242
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,016
I told you, no food deliveries
for the legal advocate.

243
00:19:09,016 --> 00:19:10,851
This is not food for her.

244
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,153
We brought it for you.

245
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,222
Anyway, we cannot allow visits.

246
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,356
Now leave.

247
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,925
Please, just try some.

248
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:22,663
If visits and food deliveries are banned,
could you deliver this to her?

249
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,865
Please.

250
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,736
I should not be doing this...

251
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:00,801
My lady.

252
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:08,909
My lady...

253
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,815
You must live.

254
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,351
Live on, and you must

255
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,120
fulfill your dreams.

256
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,330
Yes.

257
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,135
I will survive and fulfill my dreams.

258
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:01,628
Young Master Baek's mother came home.

259
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:36,230
I will recover my husband's body

260
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:40,734
and hold his funeral
and observe mourning.

261
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:47,407
After days without food,
are things becoming clearer?

262
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:50,511
Indeed.

263
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,281
Will you let me go?

264
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,421
If you leave,

265
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,691
you must keep everything
that happened here

266
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,094
a secret.

267
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:10,831
There is no doubt about it.

268
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,001
A widow,

269
00:22:15,335 --> 00:22:17,304
no matter how unfairly treated,

270
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,508
must never speak a word.

271
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:10,958
Go and recover your husband's body
and conduct the funeral rites.

272
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:41,622
At last,

273
00:23:42,523 --> 00:23:46,660
your disgrace of violating morals
will be covered.

274
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,365
It should have been done earlier.

275
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:54,034
How could you not shed a single tear

276
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:57,137
when your husband died? Unbelievable.

277
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,575
From now on, widow Ok Tae Young

278
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:05,479
will observe three years of mourning
and stay within the ancestral hall.

279
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:08,682
She is forbidden from leaving the house.

280
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:10,350
And in Cheongsu County,

281
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:13,187
there will be no more legal advocates.

282
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:49,189
One more bow, and she is finally
confirmed as a widow.

283
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:50,824
I never thought she would comply.

284
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:53,994
Even the mighty Ok Tae Young fear death.

285
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:06,073
Why are you not bowing?

286
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,449
Must we force you to kneel?

287
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:18,352
Guards! Make her kneel!

288
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:19,419
Yes, sir.

289
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:24,057
Who exactly do you think
you are bowing to?

290
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,130
Elder Master.

291
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,367
Elder Master.

292
00:25:35,969 --> 00:25:37,037
Elder Master.

293
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:40,607
Mak Sim, I kept my promise.

294
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,042
Why did you take so long?

295
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,879
Wait, he is alive and well?

296
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:48,949
Then what exactly is going on here?

297
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,450
Then who was that corpse...

298
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,526
Tae Young.

299
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,396
I am back.

300
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,804
Oh my, Madam!

301
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:11,805
Let us go.

302
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:13,273
Let us leave.

303
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,109
Step aside.

304
00:26:21,281 --> 00:26:24,651
Father, my brother is back.

305
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:38,031
(Memorial Tablet of Seong Gyu Jin)

306
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,907
Elder Master lost his memory?

307
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:51,979
It seems he suffered a severe head injury
from a ship accident.

308
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:53,714
What a tragedy.

309
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,985
That is why
he couldn't even find his way home.

310
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,624
Would surprising him
bring back his memory?

311
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:05,626
You can try.

312
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,829
What? Is that it?

313
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:09,796
What?

314
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:12,266
Usually, when I say something like this,

315
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:15,002
you would babble twice or more as much

316
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:17,204
and end with something foolish
that deserves a punch.

317
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,007
Why have you changed?

318
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:23,377
What do you mean?

319
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:27,047
I traveled far, so I am just tired.

320
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:31,118
Is that so?

321
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:33,520
You have worked so hard.

322
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,489
Thank you for your efforts.

323
00:27:35,489 --> 00:27:37,724
Why are you acting so strange?

324
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,227
This is nice. Do it a bit more.

325
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:41,228
What?

326
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,047
Does anything come to your mind?

327
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,349
No.

328
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:05,752
I remember nothing.

329
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:09,756
Where does your memory begin?

330
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,225
About two months ago.

331
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,495
I woke up lying on the shore of Qing.

332
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:19,399
It seemed I was washed ashore
from a merchant shipwreck.

333
00:28:23,737 --> 00:28:25,038
The ship I saw

334
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,208
must have been headed to Qing.

335
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,878
I had no identification tag
and knew no one.

336
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,280
But I could speak the Joseon language,

337
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,215
so I thought I must return to Joseon.

338
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,117
I did odd jobs to earn ship fare...

339
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:38,852
And that is when I found him.

340
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:42,956
Yun Gyeom!

341
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,494
I see.

342
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:50,731
You seem very angry with me.

343
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,332
Judging by your coldness.

344
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:56,069
Didn't I tell you on the way here?

345
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:58,639
It might be a blessing
you don't remember anything.

346
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,644
Seven years passed,
and even I cannot believe it.

347
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:08,048
Tae Young, now that he is back,
please let go of your resentment.

348
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:12,853
If he had not lost his memory,

349
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:15,622
he would not have returned.

350
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,092
If he regains his memory,

351
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:22,496
he will surely leave again.

352
00:29:30,003 --> 00:29:32,873
How dare they conduct a fake funeral
when I was not even there!

353
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:35,943
At dawn tomorrow, I will report
that Magistrate.

354
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,644
Despite the humiliation,

355
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:40,848
there is a reason I submitted to them.

356
00:29:41,548 --> 00:29:44,151
Do you have a plan for that?

357
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:45,686
Please host a banquet.

358
00:29:45,686 --> 00:29:48,388
Invite the local gentry
and the Magistrate as well.

359
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:49,723
Yes.

360
00:29:49,723 --> 00:29:53,961
Were you informed your mother-in-law
visited while you were away?

361
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,996
The servants mentioned it.

362
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:57,464
I was planning to see her soon.

363
00:29:57,464 --> 00:29:58,866
Please rest for now.

364
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,134
I will bring her to you.

365
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,988
You must be disappointed
that I survived and returned.

366
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:23,991
And now my husband is here too.

367
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:25,859
It seems your plans
to make me a widow failed.

368
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:30,264
Do you have another plan?

369
00:30:30,264 --> 00:30:31,965
Don't talk this way, Tae Young.

370
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:35,536
I just hired kidnappers, nothing more.

371
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,038
While I was away,

372
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:40,908
you used the master bedroom,
stole my belongings,

373
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:43,710
mistreated the servants,

374
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,580
and even prepared my funeral.

375
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:50,250
Mi Ryeong was
the only elder in the house,

376
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,952
so I was helping her.

377
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:53,687
You yourself told me

378
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,557
to live the rest of my life
for Mi Ryeong.

379
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:00,460
It is late tonight.

380
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,263
After the banquet tomorrow,
return to Uichang County.

381
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:06,934
If your in-law lives in that shabby place
without proper furnishings,

382
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:09,837
it would reflect poorly on you,
so for now...

383
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:14,708
I will prepare a more suitable place
for you to stay.

384
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,778
Do not trouble yourself, Tae Young.

385
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,013
I will tell my husband everything now

386
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:22,316
and leave with her.

387
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:23,383
How foolish.

388
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,153
Your husband
will be hurt if you do that.

389
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:30,290
That is right, Mi Ryeong.
It is better to remain silent.

390
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,495
Explain our bad ties to Do Gyeom well.

391
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:39,967
Bringing up revenge, grudges,
or kidnapping

392
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:43,604
would only lead to your ruin.

393
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:45,706
Yes.

394
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,474
I will explain it properly.

395
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:50,344
But keep those who know of it quiet.

396
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,914
Spend tonight in Do Gyeom's room.

397
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:56,683
Since you have searched thoroughly,

398
00:31:58,218 --> 00:31:59,419
you should know where it is.

399
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:03,857
Get some rest.

400
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:01,081
Have you already met your mother-in-law?

401
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,586
Yes.

402
00:33:08,555 --> 00:33:09,523
What did she say?

403
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:18,665
She thanked me deeply for cherishing
and loving a wife

404
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:22,369
who grew up pitifully
without a mother's love.

405
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,006
Do Gyeom, I have something to tell you.

406
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:27,441
I will say it, Mi Ryeong.

407
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:29,710
What is...

408
00:33:30,978 --> 00:33:32,145
Mi Ryeong is...

409
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:35,782
expecting a child.

410
00:33:36,817 --> 00:33:37,751
What?

411
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:40,120
Mi Ryeong.

412
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:44,925
This is truly a precious lineage
of the Seong family.

413
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:45,859
Yes.

414
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,793
Tae Young.

415
00:33:46,793 --> 00:33:49,997
Until her condition stabilizes,
only you should know.

416
00:33:49,997 --> 00:33:51,231
Yes, of course.

417
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:55,469
I feel truly sorry for leaving
during such a time.

418
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,109
Kkeutdongi, you need to go to Hanyang.

419
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,645
Hanyang? Without preparing
for the banquet?

420
00:34:04,645 --> 00:34:06,380
There is something urgent
I must confirm.

421
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,476
You must be tired.

422
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:40,747
Why are you not sleeping?

423
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:43,984
I read about your past seven years.

424
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:47,821
You found that, did you?

425
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,557
You observed three years of mourning
for my father.

426
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:53,927
You helped Do Gyeom pass the state exam
and marry.

427
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:57,798
You managed all the affairs
of this house alone.

428
00:34:57,798 --> 00:34:59,633
Thinking of those seven years,

429
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:05,506
saying sorry seems inadequate
and insufficient.

430
00:35:08,542 --> 00:35:12,946
If you are having trouble sleeping,
would you like a drink?

431
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,717
Did I drink often in the past?

432
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:17,951
Yes.

433
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:20,387
Though you never became drunk.

434
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:23,156
Are you really not having even one?

435
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,526
- I do not like alcohol.
- You should give up.

436
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:28,328
Director gets tipsy
after just one drink.

437
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:33,066
I will ask to fetch the drink
you used to enjoy.

438
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:34,101
There is no need.

439
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,537
The banquet is tomorrow, is it not?

440
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:40,174
We should rest now to greet guests
early in the morning.

441
00:35:40,474 --> 00:35:42,576
You should rest as well.

442
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:51,084
Oh my, I cannot believe this.

443
00:35:51,485 --> 00:35:52,920
Hold on.

444
00:35:53,754 --> 00:35:54,755
My goodness.

445
00:35:54,755 --> 00:35:57,691
How can the same task be so enjoyable?

446
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:01,261
Exactly. It feels like
heaven and hell alternately.

447
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:04,364
Once the banquet is over, she will leave.
I feel so relieved.

448
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,233
A weight is lifted.

449
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:30,624
Actually, I have
never really cut anything with this.

450
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,109
- Tae Young.
- You are here.

451
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:52,379
Yun Gyeom's martial arts skills
are still exceptional.

452
00:36:53,113 --> 00:36:54,248
Indeed.

453
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:57,150
It seems strange
you claim memory loss with such skills.

454
00:36:57,451 --> 00:37:00,721
I must have trained so much
that my body remembers.

455
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:04,157
Now, let us prepare
to welcome the guests.

456
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:05,292
- Yes.
- Yes.

457
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:14,835
Here.

458
00:37:15,702 --> 00:37:17,638
- Mak Sim, let me take that.
- It is fine.

459
00:37:17,638 --> 00:37:19,306
Take a little break.

460
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:22,042
Set it down here.

461
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,045
You are strong.

462
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,748
You have gone through trouble.

463
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,551
Where exactly have you been?

464
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:32,286
Now that you are back, all is well.

465
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,657
The madams from the Mother's Sanctuary
are here.

466
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:39,726
- I will bring them in.
- Yes.

467
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,878
Thank you for making the journey here.

468
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:01,248
How did you prepare
such a grand banquet?

469
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:03,851
It is nothing extravagant.

470
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:05,185
Please come this way.

471
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,701
Welcome.

472
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,373
Bring in your mother-in-law.

473
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:29,076
It is a banquet. The entire family
should enjoy it together.

474
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:30,043
Yes.

475
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:33,413
You must not overexert yourself
in your condition.

476
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,281
Yes.

477
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:37,084
When did you prepare
for such a grand event?

478
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,124
Please have a seat.

479
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:56,503
It seems the son-in-law knows nothing.

480
00:38:58,705 --> 00:38:59,940
This is my mother-in-law.

481
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:04,611
She once lived here, so I assume
she may be familiar to you.

482
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:07,514
Please take good care
of my mother-in-law.

483
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,123
It is truly a pleasure
to see you all again.

484
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:20,327
As you know,
our families have had bad ties, but

485
00:39:20,327 --> 00:39:21,795
what can we do?

486
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:26,166
Heaven has brought those two together,
and we must accept it.

487
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,234
Indeed.

488
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:30,671
I hope you can all set aside old grudges
and live peacefully.

489
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:34,408
Yes, I plan to treat my son-in-law
as my own son.

490
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:37,477
She said she would soon arrange
a proper residence nearby for me.

491
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:38,645
So please come visit.

492
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,885
That ring is truly exquisite and lovely.

493
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,454
I must be mad to wear it here.

494
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,895
The Magistrate is here.

495
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:59,499
- How could he come to such an event?
- My goodness, Magistrate!

496
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:01,134
Oh, you are here.

497
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:04,438
Thank you for making the effort to come.

498
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:05,405
Now, please...

499
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,443
Come.

500
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,813
Start by apologizing
to Madam Tae Young first.

501
00:40:12,813 --> 00:40:14,715
You should kneel if necessary.

502
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,354
Truly...

503
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,957
I have committed a grave offense, Madam.

504
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:28,996
I believed the body was your husband.

505
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:32,499
There was a handkerchief
with his name embroidered on it

506
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,736
right by the corpse.
Who would not have thought so?

507
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:38,238
Even so,

508
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:40,841
imprisoning her was unacceptable.

509
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:42,743
No, Chief.

510
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,978
I can understand.

511
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,483
Such magnanimity, like the ocean.

512
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:54,288
That is right.

513
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,293
But how is your health now?

514
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:01,028
As you can see,

515
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:07,134
I am now a cripple.

516
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:12,105
Well...

517
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:17,678
I was jesting.

518
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,485
My goodness, she is playful.

519
00:41:27,387 --> 00:41:31,158
Why bring up past events
on such a joyful day?

520
00:41:31,158 --> 00:41:33,760
Let us forget it all
and enjoy ourselves.

521
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,962
Please enjoy it.

522
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:39,299
Yes. Let us go inside.

523
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:40,601
Goodness.

524
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:44,805
Now that her husband is alive,

525
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:47,274
look how wide her smile is.

526
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:51,278
Indeed, it seems a woman needs a man
by her side.

527
00:41:51,278 --> 00:41:53,480
I thought she would get furious
at what they did to her.

528
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,516
But look at her smile.

529
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:00,153
But

530
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,525
what did you do with that body?

531
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,560
That body.

532
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:09,730
I do not know who it was,
but it was truly tragic.

533
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,933
So I buried it in a sunny spot.

534
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:14,968
Is that okay?

535
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:18,071
Of course. You did well.

536
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:20,641
Now, let us all have a drink.

537
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:32,686
Please reexamine the body.

538
00:42:33,187 --> 00:42:35,422
It is a murder case linked
to the virtuous arch incident.

539
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:38,992
Even the Inspector General said
that the kidnappers were only the pawns.

540
00:42:38,992 --> 00:42:42,563
Now that the plan has failed,
they will surely meet with accomplices.

541
00:42:43,297 --> 00:42:45,566
I will ensure
the Magistrate lowers his guard.

542
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:46,900
Please follow him closely.

543
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,178
Please excuse me.

544
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:09,189
You said Seong Yun Gyeom
would never return alive!

545
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:12,693
That is why you should have killed
Ok Tae Young in prison.

546
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,094
Now even I am in trouble!

547
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:15,195
Enough.

548
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:17,531
I acted based on your words,
and now look at this.

549
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:18,665
How will you take responsibility?

550
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:20,434
What responsibility?

551
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:22,803
You can just let it pass quietly.

552
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:28,275
I signed to give the virtuous arch
in exchange for bribes.

553
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,911
If the virtuous arch is not granted,
I am the only one at a double loss!

554
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:36,183
That is your problem to resolve.

555
00:43:38,051 --> 00:43:39,319
Are you planning to kill me?

556
00:43:57,437 --> 00:44:01,508
Now that everyone is gathered,
should you not say something?

557
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:02,743
Hold on.

558
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,811
Now, everyone.

559
00:44:04,811 --> 00:44:06,780
Stop for a moment.

560
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,483
Let us pause and hear a word
from Seong Yun Gyeom

561
00:44:09,483 --> 00:44:12,819
who has returned after seven years.
He has something to say to all of you.

562
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:17,524
How have you all been?

563
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:21,795
Due to an unfortunate accident,
I have lost my memory.

564
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:24,364
I cannot recall your faces,
and I feel deeply sorry.

565
00:44:24,698 --> 00:44:28,435
Everyone here was either my friend
or neighbor, I presume.

566
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:32,072
Do I look exactly like how you remember?

567
00:44:32,072 --> 00:44:33,707
That is true.

568
00:44:33,707 --> 00:44:36,310
- Yes, exactly the same.
- Unchanged.

569
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:39,913
Unintentionally, I failed in my duties
as a husband

570
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:42,216
and did not attend my father's funeral.

571
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:44,952
I became an unfilial son,
and I am deeply ashamed.

572
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:47,721
But what can you do,
having lost your memory?

573
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:52,893
Now, endeavor to produce heirs
to honor your father's name.

574
00:44:52,893 --> 00:44:54,628
Do you not agree, everyone?

575
00:44:54,628 --> 00:44:55,896
- Certainly.
- Of course.

576
00:44:57,297 --> 00:44:59,666
For seven years, my wife

577
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:02,202
filled my absence.

578
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,705
She upheld the duties
of the family matron.

579
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,274
As a legal advocate,

580
00:45:07,274 --> 00:45:09,643
I heard she contributed greatly
to Cheongsu County.

581
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:11,645
However,

582
00:45:13,347 --> 00:45:16,250
when she suffered unjust imprisonment

583
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,319
and nearly held my funeral
with the wrong body,

584
00:45:20,854 --> 00:45:23,357
everyone turned a blind eye.

585
00:45:23,357 --> 00:45:25,392
That is shocking.

586
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:30,030
Such eloquence, flowing like a river.

587
00:45:30,864 --> 00:45:34,635
Now that I, the eldest son
Seong Yun Gyeom, have returned,

588
00:45:35,302 --> 00:45:38,972
I intend to uncover and punish those

589
00:45:38,972 --> 00:45:41,475
who wronged my family

590
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:43,610
one by one, without exception.

591
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:46,580
Wait, hold on.

592
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:48,749
But

593
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,988
in respect of
my forgiving wife's wishes,

594
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:57,291
I will let go of my anger today

595
00:45:57,291 --> 00:46:01,328
and use this banquet as a new beginning
for peaceful relations.

596
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:05,899
Yes, that is how it should be.

597
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:07,267
My friend, you must start well.

598
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:08,435
Let us enjoy the banquet.

599
00:46:10,737 --> 00:46:13,106
I cannot tell you how reassured I feel.

600
00:46:13,407 --> 00:46:16,109
But where has he been all this time?

601
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:18,779
How has his voice become so strong?

602
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:21,548
This drink is absolutely delightful.

603
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:27,221
Will you prepare the chamber?

604
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:46,240
Why are you so excited?

605
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:50,310
I am not the one who will be
in the chamber, but why am I so thrilled?

606
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:55,883
Given your age,
conceiving soon would be ideal.

607
00:46:56,917 --> 00:46:59,820
If you and the Young Madam
raise children together,

608
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,988
it will be twice as joyful.

609
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:04,424
Take care of Mi Ryeong.

610
00:47:04,424 --> 00:47:06,593
She is in early pregnancy,
so be attentive.

611
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:08,395
Yes, I will.

612
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:14,735
Why? Are you nervous
since it has been a while?

613
00:47:14,735 --> 00:47:15,669
What?

614
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,338
Well, perhaps a little.

615
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,175
It has been seven years,
so it is understandable.

616
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:23,977
My goodness, I meant to bring
an instruction manual, but...

617
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:28,448
Wait, let me teach you myself.

618
00:47:28,448 --> 00:47:30,117
Teach me what? No need!

619
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:31,218
Just hold on.

620
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:37,057
This paper is your husband's body.

621
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:42,462
And this brush is your lips, yes?

622
00:47:42,663 --> 00:47:43,564
What?

623
00:47:43,564 --> 00:47:46,733
Your lips paint over his body like this.

624
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:51,371
Just brush and paint.

625
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,339
Look.

626
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:55,075
Like this.

627
00:47:58,045 --> 00:47:59,246
Draw an orchid.

628
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:03,884
Write letters too.

629
00:48:06,486 --> 00:48:09,523
Just swirl it around, see?

630
00:48:09,523 --> 00:48:10,624
Look closely.

631
00:48:10,624 --> 00:48:14,361
Up and down.

632
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:16,363
Up and down.

633
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:20,634
Three to the left, three to the right.

634
00:48:20,634 --> 00:48:21,668
Now is the moment.

635
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,273
Now is the moment.

636
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:28,175
Goodness! Master.

637
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:29,910
- Master, I am sorry.
- What is this...

638
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:32,312
Master.

639
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:33,847
Well,

640
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:38,852
Dokki suggested I come over.

641
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,288
Please have a seat.

642
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:52,833
You have worked hard today.

643
00:48:54,535 --> 00:48:56,837
You have also worked hard.

644
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:02,109
I have always thought
you were quite shrewd, Tae Young.

645
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:10,184
Please pour me a drink as well.

646
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:20,327
By the way,

647
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:24,565
why don't you address me?

648
00:49:25,432 --> 00:49:26,366
What?

649
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:30,804
You have never called me your husband.
Not even once, it seems.

650
00:49:41,448 --> 00:49:42,549
Because

651
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:44,852
you are not my husband.

652
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,156
Huh?

653
00:50:04,938 --> 00:50:07,241
I just...

654
00:50:14,748 --> 00:50:17,784
Hold on a little. Wait.

655
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:26,560
Why is this even...

656
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:37,704
I was planning to ask anyway.

657
00:50:39,406 --> 00:50:41,275
What exactly does this mean?

658
00:50:42,142 --> 00:50:45,579
It is on my body,
but I do not know what it is.

659
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,447
I cannot tell you.

660
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,853
Then...

661
00:50:53,854 --> 00:50:57,591
What did you mean when you said
I am not your husband?

662
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,864
A husband who has lost his memory
is not truly my husband.

663
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:05,032
Regain your memory.

664
00:51:05,566 --> 00:51:08,435
The secret of the branding must
be remembered by yourself.

665
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:12,005
Wait.

666
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:38,699
I will find a suitable place
for you soon.

667
00:51:39,867 --> 00:51:42,002
I have something to give you.

668
00:51:42,669 --> 00:51:43,604
What is it?

669
00:51:45,072 --> 00:51:47,674
Now that your elder brother is back,

670
00:51:47,674 --> 00:51:51,945
Tae Young and Mi Ryeong
should also produce heirs.

671
00:51:52,546 --> 00:51:54,681
Yes.

672
00:51:57,084 --> 00:51:59,920
This is a miraculous medicine for men.

673
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:04,691
Mix it in wine and share it
intimately with your brother.

674
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,828
Thank you, Mother.

675
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:11,565
Keep it secret to avoid bad luck.

676
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,670
Ok Tae Young's husband came back alive?

677
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,604
All of a sudden?

678
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:20,240
I did not expect it, either.

679
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,244
Did you not order her to be removed
to get the virtuous arch?

680
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:28,148
How can you erase a noblewoman
at a government office?

681
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,884
This is turning into a headache.

682
00:52:30,884 --> 00:52:32,753
She will not stay silent.

683
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:34,154
Don't worry.

684
00:52:34,688 --> 00:52:36,823
She seemed to have forgotten everything
because her husband returned.

685
00:52:37,357 --> 00:52:39,860
But what brings you here?

686
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:43,463
Well...

687
00:52:43,997 --> 00:52:49,269
Could I have the document I signed
returned to me?

688
00:52:52,806 --> 00:52:54,675
What are you saying?

689
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:58,512
If the virtuous arch is not granted,
how can I deliver the bribes?

690
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:01,715
The investigation brought
unwanted attention.

691
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:05,185
Do you realize
how much trouble you caused

692
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,120
for the lord?

693
00:53:09,456 --> 00:53:12,593
My life is at risk as well.

694
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:13,794
Yes.

695
00:53:14,728 --> 00:53:17,197
Be grateful you are still alive.

696
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:20,567
Understood.

697
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:25,439
(Black Merchant Guild)

698
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:35,115
Overseer?

699
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:37,751
The overseer
from the Silk Merchant Guild

700
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:41,121
involved in the gold mine case and
the child trafficking scandal 7 years ago?

701
00:53:41,121 --> 00:53:45,158
Could it be that he established
a labor office to provide abductors?

702
00:53:45,158 --> 00:53:46,994
The Magistrate mentioned a document

703
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:50,230
promising bribes in exchange
for the virtuous arch.

704
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,766
The overseer cannot possibly
be the mastermind.

705
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:54,635
There seems to be
a higher power involved.

706
00:53:55,302 --> 00:53:58,505
I have even been ordered to cease
investigating the virtuous arch case.

707
00:53:58,972 --> 00:54:02,442
Thus, I plan to track down the overseer
to uncover the mastermind.

708
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:03,977
Yes.

709
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,813
I heard you suffered under Oh Dal Seong.

710
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:10,584
You have ample grounds for action.
Will you truly let this pass?

711
00:54:10,584 --> 00:54:12,853
The day for justice will come.

712
00:54:13,687 --> 00:54:16,123
If I act out of anger now,

713
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:17,925
it may reveal your movements.

714
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:21,094
You being so supportive is reassuring.

715
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,763
You are too kind, Inspector General.

716
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:26,200
It is fortunate that Magistrate Seong's
eldest son has returned.

717
00:54:26,633 --> 00:54:30,737
I wish to meet him,
but he likely does not remember me.

718
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,343
We will properly greet both of you
once he regains his memory.

719
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,492
Make sure the oiled ones are hung out

720
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:53,894
- to dry.
- Yes.

721
00:54:53,894 --> 00:54:55,929
Sort the intact books
and store them separately.

722
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:56,763
Yes.

723
00:54:58,832 --> 00:54:59,800
Tae Young.

724
00:55:02,002 --> 00:55:04,238
You are unwell. You should not be out.

725
00:55:04,438 --> 00:55:06,874
Why are you here, Do Gyeom?

726
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:08,008
What?

727
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:10,244
We will handle this here.
Go to Mi Ryeong.

728
00:55:10,544 --> 00:55:13,313
Neglecting her during pregnancy
can leave a lasting impression.

729
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,581
Understood.

730
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:18,986
Then I will excuse myself
to leave you two alone.

731
00:55:26,894 --> 00:55:28,529
Well...

732
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:31,158
How is the office restoration
coming along?

733
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:33,293
I apologize for not helping.

734
00:56:33,994 --> 00:56:37,197
Do not trouble yourself.
Focus only on your prenatal care.

735
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:41,001
They say a mother's ten months of care

736
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,636
surpasses a teacher's ten years
of teaching.

737
00:56:42,636 --> 00:56:44,805
Where did you hear such a saying?

738
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:46,807
It is from the Guide to Prenatal Care.

739
00:56:47,007 --> 00:56:48,775
Any more wise sayings?

740
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:53,247
Spouses should treat each other
with daily respect.

741
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:56,283
Do not let greed
take root in your hearts.

742
00:56:56,583 --> 00:56:59,920
Ensure no harmful energy attaches
to your body.

743
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:02,923
And most importantly,

744
00:57:03,657 --> 00:57:07,094
forget about the office restoration
and simply rest.

745
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:08,529
Did you make that up?

746
00:57:09,263 --> 00:57:10,664
Well, perhaps.

747
00:57:13,834 --> 00:57:15,602
By the way, how are you feeling?

748
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:19,506
I think I just felt a movement.

749
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,276
That cannot be.

750
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:24,545
It is too early to feel quickening.

751
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:25,612
No.

752
00:57:26,313 --> 00:57:28,215
See, it really moved.

753
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:30,817
What a clever child to recognize

754
00:57:30,817 --> 00:57:32,619
its father already.

755
00:57:39,426 --> 00:57:40,360
Why?

756
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,198
There has been a strange scent
in the room for days.

757
00:57:45,032 --> 00:57:45,999
Right.

758
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:55,576
This.

759
00:57:56,677 --> 00:57:58,278
I will remove it now.

760
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:02,216
What is it?

761
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:04,785
Is it liquor from Qing?

762
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:06,954
This was given by Mother.

763
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:08,822
What?

764
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:11,425
She gave it when I sent her last time.

765
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:17,164
I put it in liquor
but I completely forgot about it.

766
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:19,233
I must drink it with my brother today
and get rid of it.

767
00:58:19,233 --> 00:58:20,234
Give it here.

768
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:23,871
I will prepare a drinking table
for you both.

769
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:26,039
No, it is fine. You said it smelled bad.

770
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,508
It is okay.

771
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,009
Give it here.

772
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:16,156
Take a break and have some snacks.

773
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:18,592
Let us start with our Elder Master.

774
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:21,094
We will eat once we finish this task.

775
00:59:21,094 --> 00:59:22,629
Very well.

776
00:59:22,629 --> 00:59:26,099
I fixed your new headband
and placed it in your room.

777
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:27,401
It should fit comfortably now.

778
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,570
- Thank you.
- Sure.

779
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,939
Then, Madam.

780
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:34,842
Why the headband?

781
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:37,578
Why are you whispering?

782
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:41,615
He said it got too small.

783
00:59:41,982 --> 00:59:44,818
But it is not just the headband.

784
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:47,087
The sleeves and pants seem shorter, too.

785
00:59:48,655 --> 00:59:50,824
Is it that he grew taller

786
00:59:50,824 --> 00:59:54,528
or did the fabric shrink
over seven years?

787
00:59:54,962 --> 00:59:58,532
Wait, does it shrink or stretch?

788
00:59:58,532 --> 01:00:00,033
Does it shrink? Madam?

789
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:02,102
I was not finished talking.

790
01:00:21,722 --> 01:00:23,957
Why did you ask to meet here?

791
01:00:25,692 --> 01:00:28,462
Do you remember this place?

792
01:00:32,032 --> 01:00:36,303
No, but it feels nostalgic and warm.

793
01:00:36,537 --> 01:00:39,139
Did we often visit here together?

794
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:40,140
No.

795
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,209
We have never been here together.

796
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:45,045
Then why bring me here?

797
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,818
This place holds memories
with my beloved.

798
01:00:53,854 --> 01:00:54,821
Beloved?

799
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:57,424
I had someone before our marriage.

800
01:00:58,725 --> 01:01:00,761
He had gentle hands,

801
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:02,329
graceful dancing skills,

802
01:01:04,064 --> 01:01:07,668
and was an artist
who comforted many people.

803
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:10,737
And

804
01:01:11,672 --> 01:01:14,107
he sneezed from pine pollen.

805
01:01:14,608 --> 01:01:15,442
Pardon?

806
01:01:29,923 --> 01:01:32,125
My goodness.

807
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:35,229
When did you figure it out?
It was when I hummed, right?

808
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:38,365
It slipped it out, so I knew it.

809
01:01:38,565 --> 01:01:40,100
It was not the hum.

810
01:01:42,402 --> 01:01:43,370
Then what?

811
01:01:45,606 --> 01:01:46,640
Your eyes.

812
01:01:48,509 --> 01:01:50,611
Only you look at me like that,

813
01:01:50,611 --> 01:01:52,279
Director.

814
01:01:55,949 --> 01:01:59,887
Love and sneezing cannot be hidden.

815
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:00,921
Do you find this amusing?

816
01:02:01,421 --> 01:02:03,657
- What?
- Memory loss?

817
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:05,893
You treat this like a joke?

818
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:09,229
I am sorry.

819
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,832
What about your Qing performance?

820
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:14,434
Do not worry about it,
I have postponed it.

821
01:02:14,434 --> 01:02:17,070
How could you deceive
even the Young Master?

822
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,606
As soon as he saw me,
he called me brother.

823
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:24,511
I heard his story
and it seemed you were struggling a lot.

824
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,013
Things would have gone terribly wrong
without me.

825
01:02:26,013 --> 01:02:29,516
Then you should have told me
immediately upon arrival.

826
01:02:29,516 --> 01:02:30,984
How could you fool us this far

827
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:33,287
and act so cunningly?

828
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:34,454
It hurts.

829
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:36,156
My wound has not healed. It hurts a lot.

830
01:02:36,156 --> 01:02:38,792
But how could you drink alcohol
in such a state?

831
01:02:38,792 --> 01:02:39,760
Right.

832
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:43,597
I took the miraculous
Immortal Elixir, you see.

833
01:02:43,597 --> 01:02:45,299
It made me immune to drunkenness.

834
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:48,135
What about the martial arts?
That must have been impossible to fake.

835
01:02:48,735 --> 01:02:51,572
I always regretted being unable
to help you

836
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:53,006
at Mt. Unbong.

837
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:55,809
To be able to protect you
if it happens again,

838
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,244
I practiced really hard.

839
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:02,950
Please forgive me.
I already said I am sorry.

840
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,085
Do you not understand
how dangerous this is?

841
01:03:05,686 --> 01:03:09,056
Do you realize what will happen
if your deceit is discovered?

842
01:03:09,056 --> 01:03:10,457
I said I am sorry.

843
01:03:10,457 --> 01:03:12,292
- Just go back.
- What?

844
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:14,761
Hurry back and prepare
for your performance.

845
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:18,232
You should not neglect practice
for such an important performance.

846
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,367
Okay, then.

847
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:24,004
Let me just repair
the office before leaving.

848
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:38,018
Kkeutdongi!

849
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:41,088
How are you back already?

850
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:44,358
Well, that is...

851
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:47,227
On my way to Lord Song's residence,

852
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:50,097
I met someone who told me

853
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:52,566
about their young master's whereabouts.

854
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,502
I know. He is not there, is he?

855
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:58,038
It is best if you hear directly.

856
01:04:09,183 --> 01:04:10,417
Why are you here?

857
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,685
Why did you send someone?

858
01:04:11,685 --> 01:04:12,519
Why do you think?

859
01:04:12,986 --> 01:04:14,788
- Was he caught?
- Of course, he was.

860
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:16,490
I knew this would happen.

861
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:18,659
How did you think
you could get away with it?

862
01:04:20,827 --> 01:04:22,396
You have to play along.

863
01:04:23,096 --> 01:04:24,198
What are you saying?

864
01:04:24,731 --> 01:04:25,933
The director passed away.

865
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:27,601
What are you talking about?

866
01:04:27,601 --> 01:04:29,603
Chon Seung Hwi is no more.

867
01:04:30,204 --> 01:04:33,540
The Director passed away
on the ship to Qing.

868
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,575
Man Seok.

869
01:04:34,575 --> 01:04:36,777
The royal order for Qing

870
01:04:36,777 --> 01:04:40,714
could not be changed, delayed,
or disobeyed.

871
01:04:41,315 --> 01:04:43,984
He knew there was no way back.

872
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:47,654
Yet, he sacrificed everything
to protect you.

873
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:50,357
He killed himself for you.

874
01:05:16,316 --> 01:05:20,888
I will return as Ok Tae Young
and live diligently.

875
01:05:20,888 --> 01:05:25,325
So you must become
the greatest storyteller

876
01:05:25,325 --> 01:05:26,960
to honor Joseon.

877
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:33,000
Until now, I never knew why I write,

878
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,935
why I paint,

879
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:37,271
or why I dance.

880
01:05:39,106 --> 01:05:40,474
Take it as a gift.

881
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:45,312
I want you to live as yourself.

882
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:48,882
Goodeoki.

883
01:05:48,882 --> 01:05:51,652
- You've become much prettier, Goodeoki.
- Stop!

884
01:05:52,352 --> 01:05:54,521
Just pretend for a moment
that Goodeoki has come back to life.

885
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:58,559
Fine. I will consider this
as meeting you in a dream.

886
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:02,029
With extraordinary insight,
I analyze criminal behavior

887
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:05,732
and obtain critical evidence
with eloquent speech.

888
01:06:05,732 --> 01:06:08,902
I am an investigator
for the Hanseong police.

889
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:12,372
But that investigator cannot read
a map properly.

890
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:16,009
When I was searching for Goodeoki,

891
01:06:16,009 --> 01:06:17,744
I came up with the name Yoon Jo.

892
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:21,715
I wanted to give you a new name
instead of the sorrowful name, Goodeoki,

893
01:06:22,783 --> 01:06:24,384
if we met again.

894
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:31,525
Why write a book
that would never see the world?

895
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:37,264
I feared forgetting everything
when I got old.

896
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:40,033
I wanted to cherish
and hold on to memories.

897
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:42,169
It was something just for me.

898
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:58,352
Even knowing how dangerous it is,

899
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:01,555
even knowing being caught means death,

900
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,125
he said he did not care,
as long as he could protect you.

901
01:07:07,594 --> 01:07:09,429
So do not turn him away.

902
01:07:10,898 --> 01:07:11,932
Now, he is...

903
01:07:13,133 --> 01:07:14,635
truly your husband.

904
01:08:00,447 --> 01:08:05,018
(The Tale of Lady Ok)

905
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:07,688
Stop restoring
the legal advocate office.

906
01:08:07,688 --> 01:08:10,023
As soon as things are settled,
I will leave Cheongsu County.

907
01:08:10,023 --> 01:08:10,958
What?

908
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:13,193
If I am gone, there will be no risk.

909
01:08:13,193 --> 01:08:14,828
If I leave, the problem is solved.

910
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:19,032
The Young Madam is said
to have killed her mother.

911
01:08:19,533 --> 01:08:22,803
She testified to hating her mother
enough to kill her,

912
01:08:22,803 --> 01:08:23,937
so the motive for murder is sufficient.

913
01:08:24,471 --> 01:08:25,772
It all should have been mine.

914
01:08:25,772 --> 01:08:27,608
Everything should have been mine.

915
01:08:27,608 --> 01:08:30,978
I will serve you forever, Mother.

916
01:08:33,514 --> 01:08:34,715
Confess it all to me.

917
01:08:35,015 --> 01:08:36,817
So did you kill your mother?

918
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:38,118
How?
