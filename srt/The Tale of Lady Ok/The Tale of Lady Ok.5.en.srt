00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:08,840
My goodness!

8
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:11,840
And your name, young lady?

9
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,980
- It is Ye Ju. - Ye Ju.

10
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,709
Ye Ju. Very well.

11
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,450
Do not fall ill and dream of Seung Hwi.

12
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,090
We shall continue after a break.

13
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:29,989
Why are there military officers?

14
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,958
They plan to watch any gathering...

15
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,569
of over five people.

16
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,329
What is there to guard?

17
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,239
Why do you look so rotten?

18
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,209
Did the dream of riches keep you awake?

19
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,180
My heart ached with the thought of returning it.

20
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,980
Why would you return it?

21
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,780
Is my public reading off?

22
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:51,879
You will hope so once you hear what I have to say.

23
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,260
Something happened to Goo Deoki?

24
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,059
- Well, such is life. - Yes.

25
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,329
Oh, well.

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,500
Eat and drink all you want.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,370
Thank you.

28
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:11,800
I guess the magistrate had a chronic illness.

29
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,110
I cannot believe he passed so suddenly.

30
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,379
At our age, we should be careful of dying young.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,310
Perhaps I should not say we are still young.

32
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,579
If the magistrate were alive,

33
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,649
you would have lost this spacious mansion.

34
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,819
That would have broken your heart.

35
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,060
Do you not think so?

36
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,759
If only he had not cared about that legal advocate,

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,399
he would not have ended up dead.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,769
I heard that bandits killed her family...

39
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,198
including her father and all their servants.

40
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,638
That is true.

41
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,839
- That happened. - No. Do not do it.

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,968
A woman with rotten luck and a tough destiny...

43
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,310
is bound to bring harm to those around her.

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,810
The day I was caught hiding in your room.

45
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,909
I should have died then.

46
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,680
Or...

47
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,389
I should have been killed by the bandits at the inn.

48
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,460
I dared to survive when my mistress did not,

49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,229
and this is the punishment.

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,479
I was born with rotten luck.

51
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,310
That is why everyone leaves me.

52
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,120
The lady at the inn.

53
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:12,219
Lady Tae Young, Baek Yi.

54
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:16,589
And my father-in-law, they are all dead.

55
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,600
I do not know where my father is or if he is alive.

56
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,740
And my husband...

57
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,449
You too...

58
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,449
should stay away from me.

59
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,089
I deserve to die.

60
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,189
I am a dirty maggot.

61
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,509
You said Goo Deoki was dead.

62
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,639
You said you would live as Lady Tae Young.

63
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,910
You went back to being...

64
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,449
the woman hiding under the headpiece skirt.

65
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,019
Why are you still just pretending to be Lady Tae Young?

66
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,888
What?

67
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:18,389
If you were truly Ok Tae Young, would you stand here and cry?

68
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,828
Do not live...

69
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,600
as Goo Deoki who fears being exposed.

70
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,129
Be the real Ok Tae Young.

71
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:32,800
You must reveal the truth.

72
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,810
Reveal it...

73
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:37,740
and get revenge.

74
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,500
Have some more.

75
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,539
You said you starved for three days.

76
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,569
Did you manage to eat?

77
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,670
How come you...

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,379
You look uglier.

79
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:16,079
Yes, smile.

80
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,149
It is good to see you smile.

81
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,279
Did you really...

82
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
travel for three days just to cheer me up?

83
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,919
Did you think I had come over to ask you...

84
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,589
to elope with me again?

85
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,730
Yes.

86
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,029
Man Seok did tell me to do just that.

87
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:37,028
Instead of talking nonsense,

88
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,638
bring her back with you.

89
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,138
How can I do that?

90
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:42,869
She is a married woman. Should I kidnap her or something?

91
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,809
Her father-in-law is dead, and her husband vanished.

92
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,879
Hey!

93
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,349
Where are you going when it is time? Get over here.

94
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,350
- This is an important discussion! - Yes!

95
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,619
Get going. She has no one to protect her.

96
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,148
What if she were to get caught...

97
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,519
while acting like a noble?

98
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,060
Yes. You are right.

99
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,529
Hey! Chon Seung Hwi!

100
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,659
I am off. Take care of things here for me.

101
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,499
- Do not worry. - Where are you going?

102
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,969
- Where is that fool going? - He has urgent business.

103
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,099
- Darn you. - Go get her!

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,170
Bring her back!

105
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,069
You must fight for love!

106
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:16,569
Get the girl!

107
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,250
If it is too much,

108
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,649
running away is an option.

109
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,449
You told me to reveal the truth and get revenge.

110
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,388
That was barely 30 minutes ago.

111
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,389
However amazing you are as a legal advocate,

112
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,459
it will not be easy to overturn the King's command.

113
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,629
So you are allowed to be selfish for once.

114
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,300
With your husband gone,

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,410
you do not need to shoulder the family's burden.

116
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,078
I will stay at the inn I was at before for a while.

117
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,250
Tae Young, are you in your room?

118
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,029
Do Gyeom.

119
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,259
Why...

120
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,569
What are you carrying?

121
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,399
I heard a distant relative of mine lived in Hamgyeong Province.

122
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,899
I plan to go to him.

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,909
Why on earth... Why would you do that?

124
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,180
Let me leave.

125
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:27,509
I do not wish to be a burden to you.

126
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,750
What do you mean by that?

127
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,480
My father is dead,

128
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,919
and my brother is gone too.

129
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,690
We are as good as strangers.

130
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,359
I do not dare stay and be a nuisance to you.

131
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,460
We are not strangers.

132
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,830
You are now the only family I have left.

133
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,799
You are all I have left as well.

134
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,970
I do not wish to leave either.

135
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,009
You cannot go. I will not let you.

136
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,279
I will only cry today,

137
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,779
and then I will not cry again.

138
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,220
I will do my best...

139
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:08,190
to restore our family again.

140
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,590
As will I.

141
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,929
As the Seong Clan's daughter-in-law, I will restore Father's honor...

142
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,159
and preserve our household.

143
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,230
Governor, I have something to tell you.

144
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,399
What is it?

145
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,309
Please search Mount Unbong.

146
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,869
Why Mount Unbong?

147
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,139
The children Myeongju Guild sold will be somewhere in the mountain.

148
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,178
My father-in-law meant to search...

149
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,648
Then the new magistrate can take over from him.

150
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,720
They are children.

151
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,690
No one knows what could happen to them.

152
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,350
You must leave, my lord.

153
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,190
I have other more important duties.

154
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,759
Then what about treason?

155
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,799
Is treason a pressing enough topic I may bring to your attention?

156
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,298
Why did you report it...

157
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:32,898
as treason so quickly?

158
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:33,940
Why did you...

159
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,570
conclude there was treason...

160
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,580
when there was no proof to support that?

161
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:44,178
Did you not see the notice...

162
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,679
that gatherings are considered treason?

163
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,388
Also, the hidden room...

164
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,949
was full of traces that treason was plotted there.

165
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,259
It was not treason.

166
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,758
They only helped pitiable children, so please investigate again.

167
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,729
Is there proof? Or do you have a witness?

168
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,599
What were you doing in that place?

169
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,168
Did Cheongsu County's Chief Lee inform you of the location?

170
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:06,200
No.

171
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,610
I received a report from Mining Inspector Bak Jun Gi.

172
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,070
Welcome, my lord. Please, head inside.

173
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,709
You seem to host a party every other day.

174
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,610
Visitors will wear down your threshold.

175
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:50,079
But then, you got this mansion for free.

176
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,179
I would want to show it off as much as I could.

177
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,519
Close friend Lord Bak Jun Gi will visit.

178
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,889
It is only right to host him.

179
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,690
I know. You have a very close connection.

180
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,590
He saved your skin.

181
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,970
Wait. You.

182
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,039
This wench.

183
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,979
She is the mother of the witch who died...

184
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,779
trying to seduce Special Inspector Baek's son.

185
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,179
Do you not know she was the reason Yu Hyang So was humiliated?

186
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,149
That wench was the reason Baek's family was wiped out.

187
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,788
The guests will arrive soon. Let us head inside.

188
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:33,759
Ok Tae Young will be biding her time to hit back.

189
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,789
She could collude with this woman to do something dreadful.

190
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,000
Not at all.

191
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,559
I will live as quiet as the dead, so please...

192
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,439
Lady Kim. What if she were to poison your food?

193
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,038
Goodness, no. I would never do such a thing.

194
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,439
We should sell her as soon as...

195
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,779
the Pungchon-ri slave market opens.

196
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,878
No, my lady! Please let me stay here.

197
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,778
That is the only way I can hear of Lady Ok.

198
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,149
Please, my lady.

199
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,949
Did you hear that?

200
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,388
I am sure she will collude with Ok Tae Young.

201
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:06,719
Me, collude? I would never do that.

202
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,558
My lady.

203
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,629
Oh, dear.

204
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,029
What should we do?

205
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,969
What is the matter?

206
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,399
Well, Mak Sim...

207
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,240
- Is that so? - Yes.

208
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,580
- Deok Hun. - Yes.

209
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:30,210
You have a great father.

210
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:31,620
Are you aware of that?

211
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,219
I am.

212
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,189
He drove out the traitors and kept Cheongsu County safe.

213
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,489
I am very proud of him.

214
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,659
You should be.

215
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,629
Be sure to visit me when you come to Hanyang.

216
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:45,929
I promise to offer you all my support.

217
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,199
Your father and I are sworn brothers.

218
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,769
That makes me your uncle, does it not?

219
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,679
Take me home, fools.

220
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,149
- Goodbye. - Stay safe.

221
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,789
Respect him as you would an uncle.

222
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,230
Yes, Father.

223
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,439
Why are you here this late?

224
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,739
How dare you even be here?

225
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,809
I heard...

226
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,210
you will sell Mak Sim.

227
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,850
What of it?

228
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,679
Please, my lord. I would have you...

229
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,949
send Mak Sim to be with me.

230
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,359
How much will you pay for her?

231
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,158
I will give you however much you ask.

232
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,789
A servant is worth ten yang.

233
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,429
On top of that,

234
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,570
how about you give me your house, land, and assets?

235
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:00,869
What? Did you not proudly say your servant...

236
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,639
was worth much more than that?

237
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,120
Or how about you kneel, seeing that you did not last time?

238
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,620
Go on inside, my lord.

239
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,288
Take your wife inside.

240
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,590
- Yes, Mother. - Let us go.

241
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,559
What are you doing?

242
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,190
Get back up this instant.

243
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,299
Tell her to stand before our servants see.

244
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,429
Please, my lord.

245
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,769
If you send Mak Sim to me, I promise to one day...

246
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,409
help you, Chief Lee.

247
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I give you my word.

248
00:15:36,241 --> 00:15:38,340
You arrogant wench!

249
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,610
Did you hear her? She said she would help me.

250
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,519
Please, my lord. I beg of you.

251
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,849
You would be nothing...

252
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,019
if you had not married the magistrate's son.

253
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:55,129
How dare the likes of you...

254
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,629
even say you could help me when you are incapable of doing so?

255
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,669
I have nothing to return to you, so leave at once.

256
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,600
Darn her.

257
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,779
Come inside.

258
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,570
I should have kept an eye on you.

259
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:46,340
Darn me. Stupid me.

260
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,450
On Baek Yi's death anniversary,

261
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,250
pour her some wine where I scattered her ashes.

262
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,389
Once I am sold,

263
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,389
I doubt I will be able to return.

264
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,289
What am I to do from now on?

265
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,500
How will I manage without you?

266
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,359
Once you are well enough to do so,

267
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,268
be sure to do what you can to look out for Lady Ok.

268
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,339
Will you?

269
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,410
Tell her I was sold to a great house so she does not worry about me.

270
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,980
Do not cry and do not drink too much.

271
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,779
And do not think of me.

272
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:30,489
Mak Sim. Run away with me.

273
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,690
Let us find a place where no one else lives.

274
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:35,960
Do you want to be on the run forever?

275
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,098
Then take me with you. I want to be sold as well.

276
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,999
There is no guarantee we will go to the same house.

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,029
Is there not?

278
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,798
What am I to do, then?

279
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,439
- Poor me... - Listen.

280
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,278
- Lady Ok is outside. - How did she find out?

281
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,379
What rotten fool told her?

282
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,108
I do not know, but she came here...

283
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,508
and begged on her knees to our scummy lord.

284
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,778
Oh, no. What should we do?

285
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,119
This is killing me.

286
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:03,990
Oh, dear.

287
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,410
Were you here all night long?

288
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:31,380
Please, my lady.

289
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,049
What if we say no?

290
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,190
Then I will go with her.

291
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,920
I must somehow...

292
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,359
get her back.

293
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,069
She is...

294
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,569
my treasured mother figure.

295
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,539
I cannot bear to lose...

296
00:19:02,109 --> 00:19:03,450
more people who are close to me.

297
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,259
Mak Sim.

298
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,329
I was going to come to you.

299
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,069
What are you doing here so early?

300
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,769
"Come to me?"

301
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,609
Thank you so much, my lady.

302
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:37,849
Take her.

303
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,750
Serve your lady well.

304
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,289
Do you mean that?

305
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,690
Mak Sim.

306
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,160
I thought I would never see you again.

307
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,329
My gosh...

308
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,700
Thank you so much.

309
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,609
I will repay you for the favor.

310
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,180
Mak Sim. Are you all right?

311
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Yes.

312
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,750
Let us go.

313
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:18,819
Come.

314
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:20,890
My lady...

315
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,259
My poor lady...

316
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,268
I told you to sell her,

317
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:33,940
and you returned her?

318
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,569
I did as you said.

319
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,679
- What? - I got worried...

320
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,210
that she would harm me if I kept her here.

321
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:43,549
Well, sure.

322
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,920
You can afford to return one servant.

323
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,650
Considering how much you took.

324
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,460
What do you mean "take?"

325
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,500
His Majesty the King awarded us with these things.

326
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:02,099
Yes, sure. I am sure that is what he did.

327
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,799
Why do you...

328
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,869
always sneer at me?

329
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,880
If you have something to say, be direct.

330
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:15,150
I do not have anything to say.

331
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:19,880
I am just wondering if you were always this clueless.

332
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,930
Do you think you could find someone to escort me...

333
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:36,769
to Mount Unbong?

334
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,799
Will you go...

335
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,368
to save the children in the mountain?

336
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,210
Once he is aware there are children,

337
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,579
the provincial governor might help.

338
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,349
I cannot dissuade you once you make up your mind.

339
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:53,920
I will ask around and find some tall men.

340
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,650
I am so glad you are here.

341
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,960
I was reluctant to leave my brother-in-law alone.

342
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,400
I said I would wait, and she never sent word.

343
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,109
My goodness.

344
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,380
- Hey. - Why are you back only now?

345
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,818
Where were you all this while?

346
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:31,890
What do you mean where was I? Who are you?

347
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:33,818
Why did you kick me?

348
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,489
That did not hurt enough to warrant a fuss, Brother.

349
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,529
Bro...

350
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:41,930
I am not your brother.

351
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,700
This is no time for jokes.

352
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,039
I said I was not your brother. I do not know who you are.

353
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,969
Then take it off.

354
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,379
My gosh. I told you I was not your brother.

355
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,979
You dare tell me to show my face, you little scoundrel?

356
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,650
Here you go.

357
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,490
You look like him from the back,

358
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,759
and you sound similar too.

359
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:08,960
Are you truly not my brother?

360
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,190
If I truly were your brother,

361
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,900
is there a reason I would insist I am not?

362
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:16,500
What were you doing outside this house?

363
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:20,039
I was just passing by.

364
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,039
Do you own all the surrounding land?

365
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:25,640
How could you kick a stranger so hard without checking?

366
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,940
I apologize.

367
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,009
I was that angry with my brother.

368
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,420
Do not do that again.

369
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,140
Goodness.

370
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,069
He is a spunky and smart young man.

371
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,179
- What? - Why would you hit me again?

372
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
Why say "again" when I only hit you once?

373
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,549
What happened to you? Were you in a fight?

374
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,190
Are you all right?

375
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,189
How would they have fared, seeing how badly beaten I am?

376
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,889
I bet they got away without a scratch.

377
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,430
You are right. I got beaten to a pulp toward the end.

378
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:18,399
I told you not to get too greedy.

379
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,298
If people complain, give them a refund.

380
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:21,769
Do you think I did not?

381
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,169
I pushed down my greed and sorrow and gave everyone a refund,

382
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,399
but they screamed...

383
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,338
that I bring you back and make you perform.

384
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:30,608
They kept the rest of the group as hostage and only let me go...

385
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,979
so I could bring you back.

386
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,410
That is dreadful.

387
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,548
Why am I so darn popular?

388
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:38,680
Yes, sure, whatever. We must return.

389
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,578
Did you talk things out with Goo Deoki?

390
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,990
Will she pack up and come along?

391
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,259
Why? What is it? She will not come?

392
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,829
She has a young brother-in-law.

393
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,329
- What? - His father is dead,

394
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,028
his older brother left home,

395
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,969
and now he is living with Goo Deoki at her old home.

396
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,209
How could I bring Goo Deoki and leave him there alone?

397
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,410
- Yes or no? - He has no other relatives?

398
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,890
I thought you could not come to the academy...

399
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,690
because you had to mourn for three years.

400
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:23,559
We will mourn when my brother returns.

401
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,759
Did you wish I would not return?

402
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,200
I wished you would.

403
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:29,730
If you are here,

404
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,940
I can blame you for taking first place.

405
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,170
If you do not attend the academy,

406
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,140
my mother will demand that I come first in my class.

407
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,480
That is good to hear.

408
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,180
I am staying with my sister-in-law nearby.

409
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,150
I will come every day and study hard.

410
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:46,119
I feel so sorry for you.

411
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,650
Your father did nothing wrong, and you still lost your house.

412
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,960
That is what being a magistrate is like.

413
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,089
He failed to capture the ringleader, so he was held responsible.

414
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,429
No. They blamed Devoted Hearts House...

415
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,059
to blind your father.

416
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,700
There were no traitors.

417
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,039
- What? - I heard that...

418
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,799
Chief Lee seemed to be hiding something.

419
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,470
What does it matter?

420
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,309
We just have to frame him.

421
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,778
That is right.

422
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,379
We duped the magistrate,

423
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,950
so he will not suspect us.

424
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,348
- My goodness. - Who is there?

425
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:19,480
It is me.

426
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,690
What did you just say?

427
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,690
What?

428
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,630
I did not say anything.

429
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,490
Hey.

430
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,930
Tell me again.

431
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,499
Chief Lee hid what?

432
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,170
No. What exactly did Woong say?

433
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,739
"They blamed Devoted Hearts House..."

434
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,240
"to blind your father."

435
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,140
"There were no traitors." That is what he said.

436
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,609
"To blind him?"

437
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,990
Mak Sim made some delicious chive jeon.

438
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,348
Eat some as you read.

439
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:58,690
I will go out for a while, all right?

440
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:09,170
Are you all right?

441
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,299
My lady.

442
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,039
Did you give the magistrate a good sending off?

443
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,680
I think my hunch was right.

444
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,250
- Pardon? - Chief Lee...

445
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,319
tried to dupe my father-in-law.

446
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,449
That is why he prevented the search of Mount Unbong...

447
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,319
to find the Myeongju Guild children.

448
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,059
I do not know what Chief Lee tried to hide,

449
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,828
The one who struck down Hae Gang...

450
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:37,089
for bearing the stigma of traitors...

451
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,459
was none other than Chief Lee.

452
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,130
He did not get rid of the traitors...

453
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,640
but the evidence that they were not traitors.

454
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:54,338
What do you mean "take?"

455
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,848
His Majesty the King awarded us with these things.

456
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:58,920
I am just wondering if you were always this clueless.

457
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,359
So you finally figured it out.

458
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,859
Have you been digging gold?

459
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:14,660
After all, have you become Bak Jun Gi's dog?

460
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,029
And you had to borrow money from our in-laws?

461
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,038
I did all this, so Deok Hun could have a good connection...

462
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,869
Stop using Deok Hun as an excuse!

463
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,210
Deok Hun...

464
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,778
could have found his own path.

465
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,380
What is there to be done now?

466
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,450
You can just look away and indulge yourself in luxury.

467
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,618
- Why cause a stir? - My lord.

468
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:38,689
The magistrate whom you considered troublesome is now dead!

469
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,019
What is there to worry about?

470
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,660
Are you telling me that...

471
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,430
you framed the magistrate to get rid of him?

472
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,369
Even if that is the case,

473
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:02,410
there is no way to prove it. So fear not.

474
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,680
I personally killed the musician from the Devoted Hearts House...

475
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,849
who would have served as proof.

476
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,329
Why are you so furious?

477
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,470
It has already been done.

478
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,940
How can you possibly finance and support such a plan?

479
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:29,368
Do you not know what would happen if this were to be exposed?

480
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:30,439
Why would it be exposed?

481
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,838
Everything will be well as long as you stay quiet.

482
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,209
Withdraw from the mine at once.

483
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,579
I shall report this to the Royal Court.

484
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,450
That is all I will say to you.

485
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,950
If you do so,

486
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,088
you will harm not only both of our families...

487
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,619
but also our children.

488
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,018
Would you feel satisfied only after getting in the way...

489
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,329
of my son-in-law's success?

490
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,130
My goodness.

491
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,700
Truly, it was wise to have our children marry one another.

492
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,499
Please turn a blind eye...

493
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,038
for you have not known until now.

494
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,608
That is why you could sleep...

495
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:08,079
so soundly in the house of the deceased magistrate.

496
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,980
Without knowing the truth,

497
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,318
you returned the servant to Ok Tae Young...

498
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,619
out of the goodness of your heart.

499
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:21,019
That was truly a sight so laughable to behold.

500
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:54,619
Where did she go? What?

501
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,298
Was that your sad attempt of tailing me?

502
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,568
I was not tailing you. I was accompanying you.

503
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,599
Does it seem I need someone to accompany me?

504
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,769
How is it that you do not seem to care about me at all?

505
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,179
As you know, I have a lot on my plate.

506
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,308
Where are you going?

507
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:17,149
Hold on a moment. Then let me ask you something.

508
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,319
Ask away. I am quite busy.

509
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,749
I heard that the musician from the Devoted Hearts House...

510
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,519
who plotted treason was different from regular men.

511
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,220
Is that what you wish to know?

512
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,429
I am curious about the relationship...

513
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,789
between the musician and your husband.

514
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,730
How come your husband bore the letter, a symbol of treason,

515
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,740
just like the musician?

516
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,240
You cannot say that to anyone.

517
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,809
Which part?

518
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:48,380
The part where he bears the same letter?

519
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,210
Or he is different from regular men.

520
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,160
We made a vow to keep each other's secret...

521
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,660
and then wed.

522
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,730
Exactly.

523
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:06,058
Why did you tell him your secret that you were a servant?

524
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,269
Then did you want me to marry him while harboring a secret?

525
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,999
A marriage vow is a sacred oath to the deities.

526
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,598
What if I were to get punished for not being honest?

527
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,240
Would you take responsibility for that?

528
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,068
Why would you be punished? He ought to be punished.

529
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,209
He abandoned you just to save his own skin.

530
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,339
My husband...

531
00:32:22,009 --> 00:32:24,650
left because he had children to protect and look after.

532
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,649
Your husband ought to be protecting you, not those children.

533
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:30,189
Are you not even upset that you are not his priority?

534
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,589
Should I get upset then? Should I cry?

535
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,759
Did you not come here to support me, so I would not cry?

536
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,758
Yes, I did. But...

537
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:41,499
Besides, what business do you have...

538
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,529
regarding whom I choose to marry?

539
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:45,339
Of course, that is my business!

540
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,009
No one wishes for your happiness more than I do.

541
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,910
I shall leave now.

542
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,578
I have a plan to execute.

543
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:56,250
What plan? I can help you.

544
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:59,048
- It is dangerous. - That is why I want to help you.

545
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:01,249
I am the only one who can help you right now.

546
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,319
Do you not know that burdens feel lighter when shared?

547
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,819
Stop being so stubborn and ask me to help you.

548
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,930
I am already indebted to you for helping my husband before.

549
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,500
Please stop risking...

550
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,000
your life for my sake.

551
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,670
But...

552
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,880
Good grief, Chief Lee.

553
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,578
Your wife left a suicide note and disappeared?

554
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:31,279
My goodness. She must have been very upset.

555
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,549
What does it say in her letter?

556
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,318
She wishes not to harm her children,

557
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:36,949
so she will bear the crime we committed...

558
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,149
and kill herself.

559
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:42,789
Oh, my. What should we do? Good grief.

560
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:44,858
I will hire someone to find her discreetly.

561
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,659
What if my son-in-law were to find out?

562
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,000
- I cannot let that happen. - Right.

563
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,069
I will start a rumor.

564
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,308
That she fell in love with another man from the village...

565
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:59,379
and ran away from home.

566
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,909
What? That is too embarrassing!

567
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,848
It must be! So her son feels utterly ashamed...

568
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:08,119
that he does not look for his mother.

569
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,219
Hurry.

570
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,230
- Make it quick. - I will.

571
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,230
My gosh.

572
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,638
Was that Kkeut Dong who just climbed over the wall?

573
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,269
I thought we would not get caught, but I suppose we did.

574
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,009
Do you not know that we are not allowed to go outside?

575
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:33,509
I must tell the lady... No, I must tell the lord.

576
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,479
Oh, wait. Things already seem uneasy in the house.

577
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,149
Do not stir up unnecessary trouble.

578
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,718
What if you speak up and end up getting a beating...

579
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,679
for failing to keep him in line?

580
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:44,319
Well, you do have a point.

581
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,859
Well, you know that Kkeut Dong is...

582
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,159
at a youthful age where he is full of stamina and passion.

583
00:34:49,329 --> 00:34:52,129
The girl he vowed to marry is waiting at the waterwheel,

584
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,730
ready to charm him like this. Could you say no to that?

585
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,269
- At the waterwheel? - Yes.

586
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:00,669
So we should go and drink the horny goat weed liquor.

587
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,868
Yes? Put the broom down.

588
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:02,940
Yes.

589
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,738
You know about the horny goat weed liquor, right?

590
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:07,908
When a man in his 80s had a sip of the liquor,

591
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:10,349
he ended up with a powerful stream, if you know what I mean.

592
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:26,828
You are all here.

593
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:28,868
- Kkeut Dong. Here. - Yes?

594
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:30,400
It is the map of Mount Unbong.

595
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,599
I drew it when I used to dig herbs there.

596
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,599
Gosh, this is such a valuable map.

597
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,908
This will be a huge help. Thank you so much.

598
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,408
My gosh, do not thank me. I should be thanking your mistress.

599
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:43,209
Thanks to her,

600
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,980
I could reclaim the farmland Deogheung Temple took from me.

601
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,349
Yes, thank you.

602
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,479
Right. What about you?

603
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,189
Were you able to talk to your brother, the watchman?

604
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,589
He will be checking the mountaintop. If he sees anything unusual,

605
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,359
he will light up a fire.

606
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,459
My gosh, I appreciate that.

607
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,259
Everyone, they might get wind of this.

608
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,460
So do not tell a soul about this.

609
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:02,969
Scatter now!

610
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:10,440
Kkeut Dong just came by.

611
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,239
The talk went well.

612
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,949
I am so grateful to everyone.

613
00:36:17,449 --> 00:36:20,279
But is it safe for Kkeut Dong to be out this late at night?

614
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,118
Chief Lee's family is agitated regarding his wife's disappearance.

615
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,789
So I suppose it is easier to go in and out.

616
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,189
Please look after Do Gyeom.

617
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,158
We already gathered those men.

618
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:30,129
Why do you insist on going there alone?

619
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,460
If we go around in a group, we will be spotted more easily.

620
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,670
If the village seems empty, they will start suspecting.

621
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,098
I will come down immediately after I find the proof.

622
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,099
Do not worry so much.

623
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,570
Are you sure you can do all this alone?

624
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,369
I am not doing this alone.

625
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,070
Pardon?

626
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,289
What is it?

627
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,289
You look just like my husband, dressed like that.

628
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,159
What do you mean?

629
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,800
Look closely. I am more handsome than your husband.

630
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,369
You are right. You are nothing like him.

631
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,699
You look like a man, dressed in that outfit.

632
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,170
I am glad to hear that.

633
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,638
Come to think of it, you were also disguised as a man...

634
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:55,610
when we first met.

635
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,909
You wore a straw hat and sold peanuts...

636
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,679
while making an enormous profit.

637
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,750
And you were an idler who did not know any better.

638
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,519
Yes, I was.

639
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,659
Gosh, I just realized that we share many memories together.

640
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,800
That day, I gave you my gat ornament.

641
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,730
And we exchanged affection for one another.

642
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:19,900
I did no such thing.

643
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,969
Do not distort the memory.

644
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,109
Do not be so heartless.

645
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,209
I was happy to see you again,

646
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,308
so I was simply groping my way back to our old days.

647
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:28,039
You are groping what?

648
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,979
Groping... You know what I mean. Why...

649
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,780
Could you take a step back? I am a married woman.

650
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,150
I implore you...

651
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,590
not to misinterpret my innocent desire to help you.

652
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,260
To be honest,

653
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,788
I do not expect you to be a big help.

654
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:45,828
You just wait and see.

655
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:47,158
Once we go back down from this mountain,

656
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,460
you will thank me.

657
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:50,730
You are aware of what we have to do, correct?

658
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,610
Chief Lee of Yu Hyang So from Cheongsu County...

659
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,049
framed the Devoted Hearts Association...

660
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,149
as a group of traitors...

661
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,919
to conceal what he had been doing on Mount Unbong...

662
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,919
and took everything from your family.

663
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,949
So...

664
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,590
I am here to find out...

665
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:13,859
why he did such a thing, what he is hiding in the mountain,

666
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,158
and how he is managing to do so.

667
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,590
Then I also plan to rescue the children.

668
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,988
Afterward, I will find proof...

669
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,500
that the Devoted Hearts Association is innocent.

670
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,429
In the end, I am going to restore the honor of your family.

671
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,199
What?

672
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,869
What do you think? I sounded like an inspector, right?

673
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,909
I have been writing crime investigation novels lately.

674
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,840
This is called method acting.

675
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:38,178
Method acting?

676
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:39,618
Yes. The first syllable means goblins,

677
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:41,349
the second, to summon, and the third, skill.

678
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,049
It means to pretend to be others...

679
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,420
by summoning many skills like goblins.

680
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,460
- You made it up, did you not? - Yes.

681
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,960
I can also make up words, you know.

682
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:54,400
Method?

683
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:04,840
The magistrate left proof...

684
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,409
in a small temple at the foot of Mount Unbong.

685
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,440
This should be your number one priority now.

686
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,039
My lord, his hand...

687
00:40:51,989 --> 00:40:54,389
He had bled too much.

688
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,559
I do not know when he will wake up.

689
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,500
Oh, merciful Buddha.

690
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,178
The monk will take care of Hae Gang.

691
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:17,610
We should go up now. We must look for the children.

692
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,849
Young Master.

693
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,219
Do you know how to use the sword?

694
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,150
This?

695
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:28,420
I once danced with my sword for my show.

696
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,639
What do you think?

697
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,780
I asked you a question.

698
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,210
Cool, right?

699
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,619
Go ahead and strike it.

700
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,289
My goodness. I can easily cut it.

701
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,309
Actually, I have never cut anything with this sword.

702
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,940
Could you take your position again?

703
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:20,539
All right.

704
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,650
Fix your foot.

705
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,518
As you take a step forward,

706
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:28,079
use the energy from your lower abdomen.

707
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,718
Think of it as pushing energy to the tip of the sword.

708
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,019
You must strike it in one swing.

709
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,590
Try again.

710
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,829
Push the energy...

711
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,969
It worked.

712
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,940
If we run into a soldier, that is what you must do.

713
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,380
You want me to do this to people?

714
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,210
I thought we were just searching the mountain.

715
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,420
If we get unlucky, the soldiers might spot us.

716
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,789
Even if we did, it would only be a couple of soldiers, correct?

717
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,699
We will execute the task swiftly and precisely.

718
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,000
Understood?

719
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,198
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

720
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,099
To your places! One, two.

721
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:21,670
Let us go.

722
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,979
Kids, hurry up.

723
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,719
How many times must I tell you? Make haste.

724
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,219
Hey, you fool! Do you know how valuable this is?

725
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,530
You useless kid. Get up now.

726
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,259
I know it has been a while since you came by,

727
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,769
but my wife is not home.

728
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,269
I apologize for the modest refreshments.

729
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,570
I heard about your wife.

730
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:57,969
What brings you here?

731
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,340
I had some questions.

732
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,309
They did not cross my mind then as it was quite hectic.

733
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,349
Lord Bak Jun Gi is not from Cheongsu County.

734
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,649
How did he know that...

735
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,219
the Devoted Hearts Association was plotting treason?

736
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,819
And how did you know all this...

737
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,929
and come to the Devoted Hearts House at the right time?

738
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,230
I do not know how he found out,

739
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,070
but I only went there as he sent me a message.

740
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,300
I heard that Lord Bak Jun Gi...

741
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,170
was close friends with the Minister of Defense.

742
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,780
Yes. I did hear that too.

743
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,409
But why do you ask?

744
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:49,260
Anyway, you have a great house.

745
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,699
I can see Mount Unbong at a glance...

746
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,099
from the main hall.

747
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:09,980
Considering how he mentioned Mount Unbong,

748
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,019
he may have sensed something and could have been probing.

749
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:17,518
I did have a feeling that a man as sharp as him...

750
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:18,989
would not let it pass quietly.

751
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,388
What if he were to mobilize his soldiers...

752
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:23,360
and search Mount Unbong?

753
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,828
I am backing you up,

754
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:26,529
and the Minister of Defense is backing me up.

755
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:28,000
Why are you so afraid?

756
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:31,929
These things you consider obstacles? Get rid of them.

757
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:33,440
I will take responsibility for it.

758
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,070
But as things are unsettling here,

759
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:37,309
I ought to send a message to the mountain.

760
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:40,409
Being careful cannot hurt. Indeed.

761
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,079
My gosh.

762
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,150
Is it warm? I did start a fire for the room.

763
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:51,250
I told you I would do it.

764
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,788
But you do not know how.

765
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,558
I am sorry that I do not know how.

766
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,589
I will learn if you teach me.

767
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,629
I am a fast learner, am I not?

768
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,690
Forget it.

769
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,099
Was this not a mountain without bandits as it is desolate?

770
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,739
But there are several deserted houses.

771
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,669
Judging by a few more of them nearby,

772
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,868
people must have lived at the mountain entrance.

773
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,638
Entrance? We have come more than halfway up the mountain.

774
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:16,079
Do you know how tough it was?

775
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:23,949
This is the last one.

776
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:27,489
Starting tomorrow, we must find food ourselves.

777
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,420
Really?

778
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:31,289
That sounds fun.

779
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,399
Let us worry about tomorrow when the day comes.

780
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,300
Here. Take the bigger piece.

781
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:45,409
It is delicious.

782
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,780
But why is it sweet, salty, and well-seasoned?

783
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:53,679
Is it not because you just touched your toes?

784
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,789
I see. So that is why it is seasoned well.

785
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,420
Let me touch yours too.

786
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,219
I eat my food bland.

787
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,670
From tomorrow on, the mountain will become steep and rocky.

788
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:18,739
After this mountain peak, there will be numerous more.

789
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,739
We do not know when we will run into armed soldiers.

790
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,280
What is it that you want to say?

791
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,289
Accompanying me this far has helped me greatly.

792
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:32,489
Once the day breaks,

793
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,959
it is best if you leave the mountain.

794
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,019
No way.

795
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:38,229
Did you not see my sword dance skills?

796
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,259
They might really kill you, Young Master.

797
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,800
Do not frighten me.

798
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,230
Can you not tell I am enjoying this moment as much as possible?

799
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:49,199
You simply ate a rice ball in a deserted house.

800
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:51,639
What was so amusing about that?

801
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,409
What about you? Do you believe what you ate was a rice ball...

802
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,250
and where we are is a deserted house?

803
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,389
Sorry?

804
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:08,260
This is a cozy inn.

805
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,860
A place where people visiting the mountain rest for a while.

806
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,499
If we come into the inn together, the owner will say,

807
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,070
"My gosh, welcome."

808
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:22,869
"Are you a couple? Then one room will do."

809
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,308
"There is no choice, even if you are not one."

810
00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:27,980
"After all, we only have one room."

811
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:29,340
That is what she will say.

812
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,719
Then, the owner will catch a big hen...

813
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,619
for us to eat.

814
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:42,219
I will probably take the biggest drumstick,

815
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:45,460
blow it to cool it down, and give it to you.

816
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,029
Hungry, we dig in without realizing we have food...

817
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,900
- on our faces. - It is all right.

818
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,969
Open up. That is it.

819
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,340
Have more.

820
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:57,809
Try it.

821
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,809
What do you think?

822
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,349
Do you still think what you just ate is a rice ball?

823
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,349
You are a great storyteller, Young Master.

824
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,359
Even in such a situation, you make me laugh...

825
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,119
and forget about my troubles.

826
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,960
Right? Was it not funny?

827
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,929
Now do not tell me to go down the mountain.

828
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,928
Fine.

829
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:25,269
So? Shall I continue with the story?

830
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,840
I will be your exclusive professional storyteller today.

831
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,210
All right.

832
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:36,379
The clock ticks, and night falls.

833
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,110
The number of inn customers dies down.

834
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,979
With that, you and I...

835
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,619
will spend the night alone.

836
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:53,159
You will step into the room and say,

837
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:56,329
"I am married."

838
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:58,769
Taking a pillow, you split the room...

839
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:02,900
"Cross this line, and I will report you to the magistrate's office."

840
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:05,209
- That is what you will say. - And you will say,

841
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:09,179
"Come now. A person could cross the pillow as they sleep."

842
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,610
No?

843
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,610
You cannot.

844
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,590
Not bad.

845
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,329
We fall asleep, bickering with the pillow in the middle.

846
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,760
But of all things, the floor heating firewood blows out at night.

847
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,170
Cold in the middle of the night,

848
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:35,099
you stick close to me without a choice...

849
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,210
and fall back to sleep.

850
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,789
That...

851
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,829
is the life I want with you.

852
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,400
Life is nothing grand.

853
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:11,039
I will share simple foods with you,

854
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,480
laugh together over lousy jokes,

855
00:51:14,309 --> 00:51:17,579
cover your head with my hands when it rains,

856
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,679
and make you laugh...

857
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,519
when you look upset.

858
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:31,489
Without trying too hard and being fierce,

859
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,900
we can become happy.

860
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:44,840
When we go down this mountain...

861
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,639
You should sleep, Young Master.

862
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,480
Fortunately, there are...

863
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,750
two rooms in this deserted house.

864
00:52:58,650 --> 00:52:59,848
Pull out!

865
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:01,079
- Let us go. - Pull out.

866
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,249
Get moving!

867
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,049
- Hurry. - Get in there!

868
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,888
- Get in! - Come on!

869
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:09,059
- Can you not hurry? - Hurry. Move your feet! Get inside!

870
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,428
Did we pack everything important?

871
00:53:11,429 --> 00:53:12,729
- Yes. - Let us leave.

872
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,859
- Sir! Help us! - If we all move out,

873
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,669
- Sir! - who will care for the children?

874
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,969
- Sir, help us! - Taking them will only be a hassle.

875
00:53:19,469 --> 00:53:21,839
We can find new ones when we need them again.

876
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,940
The lucky ones will stay alive.

877
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:25,670
No, wait.

878
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,340
Are the dead ones luckier?

879
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,089
- Pull out! - Let us go!

880
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,489
- Let us go! - Let us go!

881
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,988
Help us, sir!

882
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:43,829
Sir! Help us!

883
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,869
Good grief.

884
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:06,050
The assistant officer with excellent martial arts skills...

885
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,519
has no talent for climbing mountains.

886
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,119
I cannot go up anymore. I am done.

887
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:13,489
(Mount Unbong)

888
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,719
By the way,

889
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,460
how are you this good at climbing mountains?

890
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:20,329
I have climbed countless mountains looking for my father.

891
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,730
And there is nothing I cannot do.

892
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,039
Getting to know your annoying side as I accompany you is truly nice.

893
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:34,579
But why did they bring the children to this dangerous mountain?

894
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,579
- I do not know. - Please think about it.

895
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,780
The path branches out. I cannot decide which path to take.

896
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,578
Please, dear assistant officer...

897
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,750
with a keen insight into analyzing criminal behavior.

898
00:54:46,289 --> 00:54:47,289
Let me think.

899
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:51,730
Since there are children, they would have slept and had meals.

900
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,959
For food, they would have traveled back and forth.

901
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,670
Let me see.

902
00:54:57,469 --> 00:55:00,070
- It is that way. - Stop making random guesses.

903
00:55:01,099 --> 00:55:02,499
What random guesses?

904
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,069
When lost in the mountains,

905
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:05,639
it is said to follow the Plantago asiatica.

906
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,940
Plantago asiatica grows in frequented paths.

907
00:55:09,809 --> 00:55:13,110
Reproducing along the paths people take,

908
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,179
it does not die so easily.

909
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,550
Look over there.

910
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,110
What is it?

911
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,309
Have you fallen in love with me?

912
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,150
I just thought...

913
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:51,219
even the most foolish person has its use.

914
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,550
Stop looking at me with such perverted eyes.

915
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:58,889
I am acting right now.

916
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:02,960
I am currently an assistant officer helping a woman in crisis.

917
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,829
Impersonating a public official...

918
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,559
can get you up to three years of imprisonment...

919
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,300
under Article 383 of the Criminal Act.

920
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,969
I am not impersonating a public official.

921
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:14,169
This is called a novelistic excusal.

922
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,239
It is new to you, yes?

923
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,940
The woman was originally a slave.

924
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,280
After many twists and turns, she became a noble.

925
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:29,618
That woman married a man with a dangerous secret...

926
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:32,218
who has the same face...

927
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:35,420
as the assistant officer slash her first love and lover.

928
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,289
First love? And lover? Who said so?

929
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:41,800
Let me ask since we are on the topic.

930
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,969
Why did you marry him of all people?

931
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:47,769
Why did you marry a man who looks exactly like me?

932
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,239
It was just a coincidence.

933
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,809
Why did you ask me to come along?

934
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:57,980
Did you not turn me down? Why did you ask for my help again?

935
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:02,349
Did you not secretly want to spend time with me?

936
00:58:04,219 --> 00:58:05,250
I did.

937
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,158
I still think...

938
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,630
your feelings towards me are simply regrets.

939
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,459
Spending time with me like this...

940
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,429
It might help me stop liking you?

941
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,699
What a foolish thought.

942
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,610
You have become more special to me.

943
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,579
Yes, I was a total fool.

944
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,308
Just wait and see.

945
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:35,119
You will thank me once we get down this mountain.

946
00:58:58,010 --> 00:58:59,139
Darn it.

947
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,150
What is it?

948
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,190
It is an edible fruit.

949
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,329
Why are you whispering?

950
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,070
Our voices may attract wild animals.

951
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:27,570
And we must be careful on a beaten track.

952
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,079
Is it bitter?

953
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:40,750
It is sour.

954
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,260
It is unripe.

955
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,030
You should still eat it to quench your thirst.

956
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:04,039
Not being able to light up a fire makes the stars visible.

957
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:08,340
You are right.

958
01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:11,480
For some reason,

959
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,119
I will not fall asleep well tonight.

960
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,949
Young Master. It is time for us to go.

961
01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:01,559
What is it?

962
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,489
What is wrong?

963
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,988
There are bottlebrushes everywhere.

964
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:05,989
"Bottlebrushes?"

965
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,598
Are they not common?

966
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:11,130
Bottlebrushes have the ability to store gold.

967
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:14,199
It is used as an index for gold profitability.

968
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,409
I received a report from Mining Inspector Bak Jun Gi.

969
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:19,940
Do you know...

970
01:02:21,179 --> 01:02:22,610
what a mining inspector does?

971
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,049
A mining inspector...

972
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:26,780
inspects special products of regions and outcrop, no?

973
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:29,420
Hold on. Outcrop?

974
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,320
Mineral?

975
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:34,089
Does that mean there is gold here?

976
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,018
That is why children were necessary to dig outcrops.

977
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:38,760
Small bodies were needed.

978
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,158
We came to the right spot.

979
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:42,800
There must be children here. We must hurry.

980
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:46,730
Where are you going in such a hurry?

981
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,440
There is nothing down this path.

982
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:51,309
We were only passing by. Please move aside.

983
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,808
You look familiar.

984
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:54,539
Were you not working for the magistrate?

985
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:57,550
Since it has come to this, we cannot move aside.

986
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,779
Then we will take the other path.

987
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:01,849
Let us go.

988
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,449
What are you hiding?

989
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:08,090
Are you digging up gold?

990
01:03:13,429 --> 01:03:14,500
Wait.

991
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:16,559
No.

992
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,089
- Hold on. - What is it? We must go!

993
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,428
We should not just run away. Let us use our heads.

994
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,230
Go hide. I will distract them. Come now.

995
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:52,769
Wait. Stop.

996
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,210
We have caught you.

997
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,420
- There are too many. - We should still fight them.

998
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:16,789
We cannot die like this.

999
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,329
Even so,

1000
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,699
this way has a higher possibility.

1001
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:25,530
- What possibility? - Going down...

1002
01:04:26,469 --> 01:04:27,969
this mountain alive.

1003
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,489
Goo Deoki.

1004
01:06:08,739 --> 01:06:09,739
Goo Deoki.

1005
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:11,909
Hey.

1006
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:14,780
Goo Deoki?

1007
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:21,179
Goo Deoki! No, Goo Deoki.

1008
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,449
Open your eyes, Goo Deoki.

1009
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:39,070
Goo Deoki. Wake up!

1010
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,909
Please, Goo Deoki.

1011
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,619
Let us go. Come now.

1012
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,739
Young Master?

1013
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:23,510
Are you all right?

1014
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,178
I thought there was nothing you could not do.

1015
01:07:28,179 --> 01:07:30,619
But why can you not swim?

1016
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:34,389
I did not know I could not swim.

1017
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,920
Stop saying I am of no help.

1018
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:38,159
I...

1019
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:40,090
saved you, all right?

1020
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,429
You did not save me.

1021
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:47,739
You almost killed me.

1022
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:52,739
Are you cold?

1023
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:56,038
Because of those men, we could not go to the mud hut.

1024
01:07:56,039 --> 01:07:58,150
Nor could I light a fire. I am sorry.

1025
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,780
You look cold as well.

1026
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:05,619
You are burning up with a fever.

1027
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:07,250
Why do you have...

1028
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,789
such soft hands?

1029
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,829
You must truly be sick...

1030
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,800
to say such things.

1031
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,149
There...

1032
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,149
must be wild animals.

1033
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,850
Head down alone, Young Master.

1034
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:44,429
At this rate, our body temperatures will drop,

1035
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:46,130
and we will both die.

1036
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:50,760
Dying on the same day and at the same time as you are...

1037
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:53,069
is a blessing.

1038
01:08:57,569 --> 01:08:59,439
I was greedy.

1039
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,810
I thought I could pull it off.

1040
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,649
Do not say such words. I...

1041
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,319
I should have stopped you. I am sorry.

1042
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:23,760
You stopped me more than enough.

1043
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:28,369
You even suggested giving up and leaving.

1044
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,609
If only I had hesitantly agreed...

1045
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,850
and done that.

1046
01:09:55,300 --> 01:09:57,398
Goo Deoki. Wake up.

1047
01:09:57,399 --> 01:09:59,528
It is all over. All right?

1048
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,038
You did everything.

1049
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:04,510
All that is left to do is locate the children and the gold mine,

1050
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:06,109
and report to the provincial governor.

1051
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,279
Can you do that for me?

1052
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:14,520
I need some rest.

1053
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:21,789
No. No, you cannot, Goo Deoki.

1054
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,039
No, Goo Deoki!

1055
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:42,609
Wake up, Goo Deoki!

1056
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,149
Goo Deoki!

1057
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,649
Go ahead and wait for me.

1058
01:11:22,979 --> 01:11:24,520
I will soon follow you.

1059
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:35,460
I have nothing to lose now.

1060
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:37,329
Hence,

1061
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:40,600
let us enjoy my last sword dance.

1062
01:12:38,359 --> 01:12:42,859
(The Tale of Lady Ok)

1063
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,430
Setting up a trap was a good idea.

1064
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,069
Die!

1065
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:51,169
The provincial governor will question himself. What do we do now?

1066
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:53,039
A testimony is not needed.

1067
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:54,979
There are...

1068
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,909
enough witnesses.

1069
01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:02,519
I hope you do not use the law you know well as a weapon.

1070
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,589
How can a little money pay for the misery of being...

1071
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,619
separated from their parents and sold off by force,

1072
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,089
enduring the whips, hunger,

1073
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,319
and fear of getting stuck in rocks to death...

1074
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:12,629
at the top of the mountain?

1075
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,260
No matter how bright you are,

1076
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,399
you cannot dig up that incident.
