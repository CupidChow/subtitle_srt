(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, KOCCA)

6
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:57,500
I was greedy.

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,670
I thought I could pull it off.

8
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,299
If only I had hesitantly agreed...

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,670
and done that.

10
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,340
Go ahead and wait for me.

11
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,409
I will soon follow you.

12
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,129
Are you all right, my lady?

13
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,200
It is me, my lady. Dol Seok.

14
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,170
Dol Seok!

15
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,239
Why are you here?

16
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,408
Thanks to my lady, I was able to run away.

17
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,280
Then, I met the mountain people and settled down.

18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,879
I see.

19
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,689
I am glad to see you are doing well.

20
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,459
But...

21
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,189
how did I end up here?

22
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,500
One of the people saw armed men around here a few days ago.

23
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,829
As we were all runaways, we stood guard.

24
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,770
Upon hearing someone had fallen into the water,

25
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,030
we got worried and set out.

26
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,539
Over there. Goodness.

27
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:14,169
I...

28
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,509
have nothing to lose now.

29
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,610
Hence, let us enjoy my last sword dance.

30
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,719
Are you going to dance right now?

31
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,349
He will do a sword dance.

32
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,990
It will be a great sight.

33
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:31,259
What?

34
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,229
And? Who are you people?

35
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:35,990
Are you a bandit?

36
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,599
There are no bandits in this mountain.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,060
- Is that person all right? - Do not come any closer!

38
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,669
- My lady! - "My lady?"

39
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,840
Lady Tae Young!

40
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,169
You would have been in great danger had we been a minute late.

41
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,210
It is a relief we were able to meet you.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,879
I heard from the lord why you two were on this mountain.

43
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,349
But where is he right now?

44
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,919
Did he go down?

45
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,960
It is such...

46
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,090
a low performance that it is unbearable.

47
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,360
To people lowly like me,

48
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,699
being slightly good or bad...

49
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,639
is not important.

50
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,939
And this right here.

51
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,779
- It is my... - Me.

52
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,378
- longing for you. - Please give it to me.

53
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,009
- This is my feelings... - Me.

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,719
For you.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,568
- Good job. - How touching.

56
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:48,669
I loved it.

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,939
You must be so happy, my child.

58
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,539
Firstly, it is not this peak.

59
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,179
We have searched to the top.

60
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,719
It is the peak with the cliff.

61
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,849
I told you I saw soldiers.

62
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,689
Then, we shall set off to that peak.

63
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,159
I will be leaving now. Take care.

64
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,460
We would like to join, my lady.

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,629
No, it is all right.

66
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,059
You may fall into danger.

67
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,360
Did you not save our Dol Seok?

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,569
Then we must help you too.

69
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,929
- That is right. - Yes.

70
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,470
If that is indeed the place, we can simply run away. Am I wrong?

71
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,410
It is shameless of me to ask, but we are in your care.

72
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,739
If we come back alive,

73
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,649
you must tell us what happened to Chun Hyang.

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
- With pleasure. - And...

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,220
it would be an honor to see the sword dance too.

76
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,730
I will leave first and wait for you. Follow me when you are ready.

77
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,600
- I look forward to it. - You...

78
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,449
Rest while you have some of this.

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,250
I will go and have a look first.

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,089
Good grief.

81
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,459
By the way, were you being honest?

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,599
- About what? - That you should have...

83
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,730
hesitantly agreed and left together when I suggested it.

84
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:03,839
I said that?

85
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,139
I looked around,

86
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,810
but not a single soul was to be found.

87
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,079
They must have known we were searching and ran away.

88
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,939
The men were indeed digging up gold.

89
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,250
Yes.

90
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,979
Little did we know this was happening on this side of the peak.

91
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,679
How do we find out who was behind it...

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,019
if the mine is empty?

93
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,220
It seems they even took the children.

94
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:58,319
Hold on.

95
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,800
We are starving.

96
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,128
- Please give us some water. - The children are in here.

97
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,370
- Hurry. - Come now.

98
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,250
Here.

99
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,689
You must be Choon Sam, yes?

100
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,629
Do you remember the faces of the men who brought you here?

101
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,199
Good. Let us go now.

102
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,779
Where do you think you are going?

103
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,078
I heard you jumped off the cliff.

104
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,649
But I guess you managed to stay alive.

105
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,019
Setting up a trap was a good idea.

106
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,089
My men.

107
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,459
Who was it?

108
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,300
Who ordered you to buy the children to dig up gold in secret?

109
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,670
Do you think that was all?

110
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,899
He ordered me to get rid of you too.

111
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,839
Was it Chief Lee?

112
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,740
Think about that while you are locked up.

113
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,208
There must be no bloodshed.

114
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,910
Lock them up and set them on fire.

115
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
Yes, sir.

116
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,360
Kill him.

117
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,230
Go.

118
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,269
Step back.

119
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:04,850
No. Good grief.

120
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:51,330
It was fun.

121
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,799
Die!

122
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:08,250
- Get them! - Stop them!

123
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,278
- Local Military Administrator. - My apologies for being late.

124
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,519
Arrest all of them!

125
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,789
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

126
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:58,559
Are you all right?

127
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,970
You are a lot better than I thought, Young Master.

128
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,570
You are bleeding here. Do not say anything.

129
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,399
Give me a minute.

130
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:09,440
Here.

131
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,320
It is all set. Hold this part.

132
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,039
How did you get here?

133
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,138
Do not tell me you broke out of prison.

134
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,239
The provincial governor released us in secret.

135
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,808
The provincial governor did?

136
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:48,049
Yes. He needed to repay your kindness.

137
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,979
But how did you find us so fast in such a big mountain?

138
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,619
I heard about the beacon from your family at home.

139
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,789
Fortunately, on our way up here...

140
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,269
Can we finally vindicate...

141
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,070
my father?

142
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,139
- How are you here? - This is where...

143
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,570
the mine Chief Lee hid.

144
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:27,480
How could you do such a thing? Just how?

145
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:30,879
How could you drive...

146
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,149
the innocent as traitors simply to live in clover?

147
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,389
Because of this, my father...

148
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,919
My family...

149
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,629
I am sorry.

150
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,370
Did you know about it?

151
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,700
Is that why...

152
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,470
you returned Mak Sim out of guilt?

153
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,950
No, I did not.

154
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,850
I had no idea.

155
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,450
Leave me to die.

156
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,120
I cannot cause harm to my son.

157
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:12,819
I cannot give a testimony.

158
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,730
A testimony is not needed.

159
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,330
There are...

160
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,259
enough witnesses.

161
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,480
These children were bought...

162
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,950
by Chief Lee to dig up gold.

163
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,289
So...

164
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,990
do not die.

165
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,320
Live,

166
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,590
and pay for your sins to these children.

167
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:06,779
What do you mean Ji Haeng Soo was arrested by the government office?

168
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,008
I just heard the news.

169
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,178
The provincial governor will question himself. What do we do now?

170
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,250
What are you waiting for? You must send a letter to Lord Bak Jun Gi.

171
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,590
That man must be gotten rid of at once.

172
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,360
Deok Hun...

173
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,028
What in the world did you do?

174
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,870
What are you talking about, Deok Hun?

175
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,970
We did not do anything.

176
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,309
We swear.

177
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,320
What is it? Did you see a ghost or something?

178
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,989
My lady...

179
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,288
How could you do such an atrocious thing?

180
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,119
Deok Hun. Listen to my story.

181
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
He is right.

182
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:55,730
It is not the time for this. We should put our heads together.

183
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,460
We cannot go down altogether.

184
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,059
Am I not right, my lady?

185
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,169
Shut it.

186
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:07,070
My lady. We do not have time for this right now.

187
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,679
What are you writing?

188
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,980
I am recording...

189
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:49,808
the outstanding assistant officer's tale about...

190
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,418
him saving a drowning lady...

191
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,120
and rescuing children by fighting soldiers.

192
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,419
Will Hae Gang testify?

193
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,130
She will run away as soon as she recovers.

194
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:06,558
How will you clear of the false charges?

195
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,328
The children can only testify that Chief Lee...

196
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,798
made them dig up gold.

197
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,240
We will have to arrest Chief Lee and torture him to come clean.

198
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,769
He defamed Father's reputation,

199
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,779
took away everything from our family,

200
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,539
and even tried to kill me.

201
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,519
There are several charges that can sentence him to death.

202
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,650
Eventually, this novel will conclude...

203
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,660
with the legal advocate's revenge.

204
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,460
I am still proud of you for achieving your goal.

205
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,000
Without the people's help,

206
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,869
I could not have succeeded.

207
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,039
Yes. The kindness you have shown...

208
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,240
was repaid with kindness.

209
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,750
You gained the map of the mountains and streams, met Dol Seok,

210
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,910
the provincial governor sent over the local military administrator,

211
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,179
and the beacon lit up just in time.

212
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,890
It was all the good deeds you have done. No?

213
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,960
You, Goo Deoki,

214
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:08,390
have a warm heart...

215
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,059
that moves people.

216
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,299
Are you...

217
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,539
telling me to forgive him?

218
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,710
I cannot do that.

219
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,338
Do not hope for that.

220
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:26,210
No. I simply hope...

221
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,880
you do not use the law...

222
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,950
you know well as a weapon.

223
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:39,420
Your purpose is to recover your family's reputation.

224
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,390
Just keep that in mind.

225
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,319
My lord.

226
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,250
Halt.

227
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,190
My lord. We are in big trouble.

228
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,430
What is it this late in the night?

229
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,059
Ji Haeng Soo has been arrested by the provincial governor.

230
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,470
And?

231
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,369
Are we not in trouble if he speaks of the truth?

232
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,700
Please have someone...

233
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:30,640
I have no clue what you are talking about.

234
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:34,779
My lord?

235
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,380
You promised to take care of the aftermath.

236
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:46,589
Spout such nonsense elsewhere, and I will dispose of you first.

237
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,990
Bear in mind.

238
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,200
Take him home.

239
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,000
Father...

240
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,390
Are you...

241
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,960
turning yourself in?

242
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Do not tell me you are going to the provincial governor to report me.

243
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:40,910
How can you turn yourself in?

244
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,710
I told you to pay for your sins.

245
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,189
We are returning the mine...

246
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,920
and all the gold that was dug up.

247
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,889
The children were paid enough money...

248
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,990
"Enough money?"

249
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:55,630
How can a little money pay for the misery of being...

250
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:58,759
separated from their parents and sold off by force,

251
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,659
enduring the whips, hunger,

252
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,900
and fear of getting stuck in rocks to death...

253
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,569
at the top of the mountain?

254
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,799
What more must I do to pay for my crimes?

255
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:09,640
Returning and coughing up everything.

256
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,578
Paying them money. That's more than enough.

257
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,940
That is not your only crime.

258
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,750
What about what you did to hide that disgusting greed?

259
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:20,049
What about accusing the innocent as traitors...

260
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,049
and what you did to my father?

261
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:26,789
I do not know any of those.

262
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,589
Nor does Ji Haeng Soo.

263
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:31,599
No matter how bright you are,

264
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,769
you cannot dig up that incident.

265
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,170
I will not turn myself in.

266
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,670
- My lord. - What?

267
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,939
What I did was nothing wrong!

268
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,940
Yes.

269
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,109
That is how shameless you should be.

270
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,480
Do not beg for mercy. Only then...

271
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,519
will I not feel guilty...

272
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,920
even if you shed tears of blood...

273
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,089
or are torn into pieces.

274
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,299
I will make sure...

275
00:22:06,329 --> 00:22:08,529
to relieve my father's resentment and false charges...

276
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,099
and have you suffer much more than we have.

277
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,769
I almost...

278
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,750
forgave you.

279
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,069
- Mother! - Have you gone mad?

280
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,539
Get up!

281
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:51,380
Get up, Mother.

282
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,349
What is going on?

283
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,160
Next is a civil document from Cheongsu County,

284
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,730
which has yet to have a new magistrate.

285
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:13,829
First is a civil letter from Do Gyeom of the Seong Family.

286
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,508
I am requesting the reputation of my father Seong Gyu Jin,

287
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:30,150
the former magistrate of Cheongsu County,

288
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,349
stripped of his public post and family fortune for remaining...

289
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,349
a spectator of treason, be restored.

290
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,160
Is there a basis for this request?

291
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,789
We have a witness.

292
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,809
There is no way to prove it. So fear not.

293
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,480
I personally killed the musician from the Devoted Hearts House...

294
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,319
who would have served as proof.

295
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,819
I am Hae Gang of the Yun Family.

296
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,329
Contrary to how I may look,

297
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,660
I am a man.

298
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:21,730
How is that a man?

299
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,599
He looks just like a woman.

300
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,039
In this world, there are those who look different to others.

301
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,809
But even the parents who gave birth consider us a disgrace...

302
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,710
and either kill or abandon us.

303
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:38,179
I vowed to forever protect...

304
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,179
pitiful children like myself who have no one to protect them...

305
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,220
and engraved "Heart" on my shoulder.

306
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,390
I am by no means a traitor.

307
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,490
If you were not a traitor, why was there military training?

308
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:56,529
That is because people always walk all over us.

309
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,740
Thoughtlessly beating us, harassing us,

310
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,710
and killing us.

311
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,880
We were learning to protect ourselves from it all.

312
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:08,480
It was not a military training.

313
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,179
You should have told me the truth...

314
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,088
when I went to the Devoted Hearts House.

315
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:17,720
Why did you not back then? Why only appear before me now?

316
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,559
I was...

317
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,759
stabbed by a person who wished for me to die as a traitor.

318
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,339
Who was it? Who was the one who stabbed you to hide the truth?

319
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,250
I do not remember.

320
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:01,230
How can you prove what you have said is the truth?

321
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,729
I got injured while waiting...

322
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,369
for the Royal Court's order regarding my life.

323
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,339
I would either be exiled or beheaded...

324
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,009
depending on the order.

325
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:13,639
Had I run away as soon as I got better,

326
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,480
I would have saved my life.

327
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,210
However,

328
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:20,720
I could not abandon the one who treated me as a human being.

329
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,018
And had I run away like this,

330
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:24,819
I would have lived in hiding as a false traitor.

331
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,858
By standing here with my life on the line,

332
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,589
I will prove the truth.

333
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,259
Is there more you would like to say?

334
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
No.

335
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,798
Is that it? Why is that all he is saying?

336
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,538
They will not wield their weapon.

337
00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:42,970
Let us wait and see.

338
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,538
On the basis of Hae Gang of the Yun Family,

339
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:46,940
the case will be reinvestigated.

340
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,980
If it is judged that the former magistrate did not neglect his duty,

341
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,420
the King will receive a written report for reconsideration.

342
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,019
Return and wait.

343
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,559
Next.

344
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,730
Moving on is a civil letter from the chief...

345
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:09,369
of Cheongsu County's Yu Hyang So, Chung Il of the Lee Family.

346
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:20,279
You are here to confess?

347
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,079
Yes.

348
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,619
You must report every single crime you have committed.

349
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,990
Despite finding...

350
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:32,160
outcrops in Mount Unbong by chance,

351
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,789
I did not report it to the Royal Court.

352
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:38,190
Instead, I built a mine to dig up the gold.

353
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,430
The Myeongju Guild head,

354
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,829
arrested and questioned for digging up gold,

355
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:43,930
must have been ordered by him.

356
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,000
As I am confessing my sins voluntarily,

357
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:48,740
please take it into consideration.

358
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,608
Even though the King enforced a prohibition,

359
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:54,980
you built a mine, fabricated the slave sale document,

360
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,680
and forced children to labor.

361
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,549
How dare you think such crimes can be forgiven?

362
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,818
Provincial Governor, I am aware that my father committed a crime.

363
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:05,519
But I heard that even for a grave crime,

364
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,629
one may receive a reduced sentence if they sincerely repent.

365
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,490
I know that you confessed only to seek a reduced sentence!

366
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,539
I suspect that someone else has discovered the outcrop.

367
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,640
But if you wish to face the punishment by yourself,

368
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,680
I shall grant you your wish.

369
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:28,140
Please spare me!

370
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,379
Please I beg you to set aside your anger...

371
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,119
and follow the law to decide his punishment.

372
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,420
The law?

373
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,190
Fine. I shall do so.

374
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:38,689
Judicial Officer, read through the law right away...

375
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,519
and bring forth every crime committed by him.

376
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,869
I, Legal Advocate Ok Tae Young,

377
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,299
ask to defend Chief Lee of Cheongsu County.

378
00:28:58,809 --> 00:28:59,809
Why?

379
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,150
Do you truly intend to defend him as his legal advocate?

380
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,549
Yes.

381
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,618
You did not report to me even when you knew...

382
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:10,390
that he framed the former magistrate.

383
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,690
Now, you want to defend him?

384
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,190
I ask that you allow it.

385
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,838
I will allow Legal Advocate Ok Tae Young...

386
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,869
to defend him.

387
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,278
The crime of establishing a mine despite the royal prohibition...

388
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,750
and stealing public assets...

389
00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:44,250
is equivalent to embezzling the state's property.

390
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,889
Following the precedent of royal decrees,

391
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,358
it is only fitting to brand his entire body,

392
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,359
execute him by beheading,

393
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,299
and display his head as a warning to all.

394
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,129
Yes, that is only right.

395
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,169
Moreover,

396
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,369
the act of forging documents to force children into labor...

397
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,368
falls under criminal abduction and enticement...

398
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:02,869
according to Article 298 of the Penal Code.

399
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,609
This, too, is a grave offense that warrants 100 lashes.

400
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,409
- That is true. - What are you doing? Stop it.

401
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,009
Be quiet!

402
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,849
However, Article 25 of the General Laws states...

403
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,589
that when two offenses are exposed at once,

404
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,920
punishment shall be administered based on only one of the offenses.

405
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,589
Article 24 of the General Laws states...

406
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,799
that if one confesses to their crimes, they shall be...

407
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:31,200
exempt from punishment.

408
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,880
No matter what the law dictates,

409
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:42,879
are you aware that based on the gravity of the matter,

410
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,410
I hold the authority to impose punishment?

411
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:45,849
Provincial Governor, but hear me out.

412
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,849
Due to the rampant illegal mining throughout the provinces,

413
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,219
the royal treasury has been depleted...

414
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,258
and a royal decree of prohibition has been enacted.

415
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:53,720
But enforcing this decree is a challenge.

416
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:55,160
In such times,

417
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:57,389
if you were to impose a severe punishment...

418
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,700
on Chief Lee who has turned himself in,

419
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,358
no one would repent on their crimes...

420
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,170
and try to hide the mines out of fear.

421
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,299
- That is true. - Yes, indeed.

422
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,470
On top of that, Chief Lee has already returned the mine.

423
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,139
His family also collected and returned...

424
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,640
all the gold that was gathered at the mine.

425
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,410
They also paid the children who were forced to work.

426
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,549
As the ancient saying goes,

427
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,220
"The virtue of valuing life touches the hearts of many people."

428
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,890
If you bend the law with mercy and graciously bestow a pardon,

429
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,059
those who have been blinded by greed...

430
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:33,098
and followed the path of evil deeds will repent for their actions.

431
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,099
This approach...

432
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,170
will make our state prosperous...

433
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,740
and bring riches to our people.

434
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,979
- You deserve to be punished! - This serves you right!

435
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,279
You little...

436
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,119
I hope you die on the way, you jerks!

437
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:31,318
You deserve to be punished by the skies!

438
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,789
You deserve to be stoned!

439
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,429
- You jerks! Die! - Look!

440
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,900
- Keep moving! - Darn it.

441
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,589
My late father's honor has been restored.

442
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:06,089
Why the long face?

443
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:08,460
I just do not understand.

444
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,929
Why did she have to defend a man like that as a legal advocate?

445
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,029
He was only dismissed as the Chief.

446
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,669
That is too light of a sentence!

447
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,140
You did not get back any of your father's assets.

448
00:33:19,869 --> 00:33:22,469
What could we do? A dismissal was the only punishment he received.

449
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,038
Right.

450
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,680
She should have reported all of his dirty crimes.

451
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,150
Do not be upset.

452
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,680
I promise to buy us a better house.

453
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,450
Really?

454
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,619
Is that a promise?

455
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,429
- My lord. You cannot do this. - My lord, please stop.

456
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,429
- My lord! No! Please stop. - Ok Tae Young.

457
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,460
My lord!

458
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,079
What is this about?

459
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,680
Ok Tae Young. You...

460
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,849
Why did you help me?

461
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,488
How dare you?

462
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:14,820
Is your pride hurt because you had to receive help...

463
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,690
from someone you looked down on?

464
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,059
Yes.

465
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,300
How dare you be so brazen...

466
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,969
to insult, pity,

467
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:30,809
and then forgive me?

468
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,309
Forgive you?

469
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,809
Who said I have forgiven you?

470
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,579
What?

471
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,250
You silenced Hae Gang,

472
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,389
framed them to be traitors,

473
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,090
stole everything from my family by disgracing my father-in-law,

474
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,429
and tried to kill me when I tried to find out the truth.

475
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,170
I did not forgive you.

476
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,170
I just...

477
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,468
did not report those crimes.

478
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:07,980
So why did you not report those crimes?

479
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,948
How dare you have such audacity to be a hypocrite to my face?

480
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:11,980
Mak Sim...

481
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,079
was returned to me.

482
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,788
I made a promise that...

483
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:21,559
I would help you and return the favor one day...

484
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,960
if you returned her to me.

485
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:30,130
Goodness. But I am just a servant.

486
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:34,369
Then not reporting my crimes...

487
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,368
would have been enough to return the favor.

488
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,409
Why did you defend me?

489
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:44,449
Why did you save me?

490
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,320
Why did you defend me...

491
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:50,650
as a legal advocate?

492
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
That...

493
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,929
was not my intention.

494
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:03,769
It was my father-in-law's.

495
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,300
What?

496
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:13,480
Your desire to help the weak is not misguided.

497
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,780
But the law does not exist solely for the sake of the weak.

498
00:36:18,449 --> 00:36:22,420
In the eyes of the law, everyone must be equal...

499
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,619
even for those who are deemed guilty.

500
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,690
Even for my enemies?

501
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:33,199
That is right. Knowing that...

502
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,030
will make you a true legal advocate.

503
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,139
Yes, Father.

504
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,340
Regardless of status or rank in this world,

505
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,039
I will defend everyone equally...

506
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:46,639
no matter who they are in accordance with the law.

507
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,050
Yes.

508
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,619
Always keep that in mind.

509
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:04,889
My father-in-law...

510
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,329
would not have wanted me to take revenge.

511
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:13,070
He would have wanted me to defend even my enemy...

512
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,710
who tried to kill me,

513
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,139
so my enemy was protected...

514
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,349
under the law.

515
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,949
So please leave.

516
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,889
I will return your family's assets...

517
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,360
and servants.

518
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:50,170
That should be enough...

519
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,539
to pay you for defending me as my legal advocate.

520
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,429
He returned the house? Who said he could do that?

521
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,769
How could we possibly live in that house?

522
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,369
Then he should have sold it.

523
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:26,409
That way, we could have retrieved the fund we invested in the mine.

524
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:29,848
Mother! Please stop.

525
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,449
Right. Please, that is enough.

526
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,019
If you continue, our daughter might get deserted.

527
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:37,820
Why would she get deserted?

528
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:38,989
Deok Hun.

529
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,289
What have we done so wrong that we deserve to be treated this way?

530
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:43,760
You spread the vicious rumor about my mother.

531
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:47,460
Please have some shame!

532
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,769
(The late Seong Gyu Jin)

533
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:35,309
My lady, you are a remarkable woman.

534
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,019
My lord, please rest in peace now.

535
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:14,118
Kkeut Dong, you sweep the yard.

536
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,119
- Yes. - Take care of that.

537
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,419
- Come here. - My gosh.

538
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,389
Let us move that. That over there.

539
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,119
Hurry up. Make haste now. Could you hold that?

540
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,328
- Come on. Come quickly. - I am coming.

541
00:40:24,329 --> 00:40:26,559
I cannot imagine everything you had to do to achieve this.

542
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,030
I am...

543
00:40:29,869 --> 00:40:32,969
ashamed that I could not be of any help to you.

544
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,099
Please do not say such a thing.

545
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,610
We are a family.

546
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:41,440
I will make sure I win first place in the state exam,

547
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,849
so I can make you proud.

548
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,150
I am already proud of you, Do Gyeom.

549
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,690
From now on, I will live for you.

550
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,789
You are my older sister, a friend,

551
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,789
and a mother. You are my everything.

552
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
My goodness.

553
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,900
Thankfully, Hae Gang has been released.

554
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:38,130
He left safely in one piece.

555
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,538
He said he would go to where my husband is...

556
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:43,440
and give him the news.

557
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,510
Then your husband will return soon.

558
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:51,179
Yes.

559
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,349
Good grief.

560
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,320
He is still a coward who always takes the easy way.

561
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:03,059
Anyway, I am so proud of you for getting everything back.

562
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,159
I have you to thank.

563
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,000
I truly thank you.

564
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:09,469
See?

565
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,539
I did say you would be thanking me once we came down, did I not?

566
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,369
You have...

567
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:22,210
this power of making people happy.

568
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,050
Seeing you perform in the mountains for the people...

569
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,920
was truly wonderful.

570
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
And...

571
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,829
having the chance to see your performance one last time...

572
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,300
brought me great joy.

573
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:48,139
Did you bring it?

574
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,510
If you take this, will this help your finances significantly?

575
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,010
Yes.

576
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,150
I will sell this and buy delicious food with it.

577
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,949
Is it absolutely necessary to take it from me?

578
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,090
I must take it. It is an article left behind by Goo Deoki.

579
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,230
She was a woman I loved deeply...

580
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:19,230
for she helped me live as myself.

581
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:28,239
From now on,

582
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,210
I will not seek out for you, my lady.

583
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,719
Then...

584
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,320
I wish you happiness, my dear legal advocate.

585
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,400
Could you relay a message...

586
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,199
to the assistant officer?

587
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,639
The assistant officer...

588
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,980
was indeed the woman's first love.

589
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:16,059
At first,

590
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,559
she looked away as their classes and circumstances did not align.

591
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:24,969
Afterward,

592
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,309
she turned him down as there was something she had to do.

593
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,840
But she always kept the gift from him,

594
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:38,210
treasured him,

595
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,449
and yearned to be with him.

596
00:44:47,289 --> 00:44:48,489
Please tell him this message.

597
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:12,780
That is the perfect ending.

598
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,369
(7 years later)

599
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:22,619
Good work.

600
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,189
Legal Advocate Jang,

601
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,388
could you handle the annulment of the adoption...

602
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,059
- for Junior Official Oh Jong Geun? - Sure.

603
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,968
Yuk Dong's newly bought cow at the Persimmon Tree House...

604
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:38,098
gave birth to twin calves?

605
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:42,039
Yes, but the man who sold the cow demanded payment for both calves.

606
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,969
We must look into the date they were born.

607
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:46,908
I cannot do that today.

608
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:49,139
Why not? Do you have other plans?

609
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,550
That must be him.

610
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,218
Cheongsu County's Master Seong Do Gyeom...

611
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,889
placed first in the state exam!

612
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,558
- Young Master! - Young Master!

613
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:04,659
I knew he would come first.

614
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:06,329
- Hurry, my lady. - Goodness.

615
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,229
We are over here.

616
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:10,469
My lady. Come and join us.

617
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,538
My gosh.

618
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,840
- My goodness. - Young Master.

619
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,440
Young Master!

620
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,739
(Seong Do Gyeom, First Place)

621
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,820
Young Master!

622
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:35,860
Welcome, Do Gyeom.

623
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,828
Oh, my gosh.

624
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:40,900
Oh, dear. What an embarrassing sight that is.

625
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,869
- I missed you. - People are watching.

626
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,598
They must watch.

627
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:49,269
I came first in the state exam thanks to your guidance.

628
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,638
My goodness.

629
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,579
Why make such a fuss about helping her brother-in-law of all people?

630
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,379
This is a joyful occasion for our county,

631
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,649
and he studied at our academy, so that is even better.

632
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,149
Do you not think what they are doing is vulgar and embarrassing?

633
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:05,718
- Young Master. - Young Master.

634
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:06,760
Young Master.

635
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,090
Goodness.

636
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:15,699
Let me see.

637
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,139
This is the finest brush stand made with bamboo weaved together.

638
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:21,840
It is for you, Tae Young.

639
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:23,840
Thank you, Do Gyeom.

640
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,408
Yes. My lady should get her gifts first.

641
00:48:26,409 --> 00:48:28,940
The rest is ours, then. Since even sewage flows downward.

642
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,448
This is a jade bookmark.

643
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:34,649
I cannot read, so I have no use for that.

644
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,489
This is also for Tae Young.

645
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,050
It is beautiful.

646
00:48:38,389 --> 00:48:39,888
Half of that will be for her.

647
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:42,558
- Yes, I am sure. - This is also for you, Tae Young.

648
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,629
The work of a master landscape artist.

649
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,859
Thank you.

650
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,999
- I guess everything here is hers. - I guess so.

651
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,869
Oh, right. Yes.

652
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,638
A hair ornament with azure stones.

653
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:57,038
- What? - Azure stones?

654
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:59,678
- I have no wife. - It is for me.

655
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,280
This is yours also.

656
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:02,678
Is it really?

657
00:49:02,679 --> 00:49:04,809
- Yes. - It is so pretty.

658
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,250
Is it not pretty? What do you think?

659
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:10,649
- Everything is for you. - Everything is for you.

660
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,718
It was stupid of us to get our hopes up.

661
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:13,719
Where are you going?

662
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:17,788
Go to the carts that are behind the wall.

663
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:19,960
- By the wall? - Carts?

664
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,530
My goodness. Look at all this!

665
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,029
- My word! - Goodness.

666
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,199
- What is all this? - My gosh.

667
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,070
What is in here?

668
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:35,380
You could get married now.

669
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:40,380
My lord.

670
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,449
I plan to rush your brother's marriage.

671
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:47,419
However, is it right to make such an important decision...

672
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,960
all on my own?

673
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:54,099
Father's seventh death anniversary is next month.

674
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,199
When will you send me a word?

675
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,369
When will you return?

676
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:02,969
I trust you are well...

677
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,739
as I carry out my duties here.

678
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,510
From your wife.

679
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:19,149
To thank our academy for the support and guidance,

680
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,518
Master Seong agreed to share some tips with the students.

681
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,829
- Good. - That is great.

682
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,030
Master Woong must definitely attend.

683
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,969
The study tips will benefit him the most.

684
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:35,369
Do you not find it strange?

685
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:38,408
- Find what strange? - Men and women must stay apart.

686
00:50:38,409 --> 00:50:40,908
How could a married woman hug her brother-in-law?

687
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:43,250
She practically raised the boy. She deserves a hug.

688
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,949
I was envious.

689
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,280
What I mean is,

690
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,089
whoever were to marry Master Do Gyeom will suffer...

691
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,690
under a tyrannical sister-in-law.

692
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:56,118
You have a point. She supported him through years of study.

693
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:57,529
Exactly.

694
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,428
Who would let their precious girl marry into that family?

695
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:01,929
Am I wrong?

696
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:06,639
Master Seong will marry.

697
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:08,698
The matchmaker will accept letters...

698
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,638
with the ladies' date and time of birth.

699
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:12,138
We are not interested.

700
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,578
No one would wish to become in-laws with them.

701
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:16,110
Am I wrong?

702
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,849
I suddenly feel the urge to relieve myself.

703
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,050
I forgot I had an urgent errand.

704
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,690
Excuse me. I am busy as well.

705
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:26,960
What...

706
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:32,260
My gosh.

707
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:50,480
I apologize.

708
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:52,250
Wait.

709
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,150
My lady.

710
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:58,118
I see you did not hear my apology. I am sorry.

711
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:00,190
No, it is not about that. Wait.

712
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,359
I apologized twice already. Why did you stop me again?

713
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,828
There is a misunderstanding.

714
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:07,328
I do not want an apology.

715
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:09,929
I am not interested in anything else.

716
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,369
- Goodbye. - I was still talking.

717
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,099
- Wait, my lady. - Do not touch me.

718
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,868
Criminal Law Article 355 says...

719
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:21,380
one who forcefully detains another will be flogged 80 times.

720
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,979
How do you know that?

721
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,780
I have no reason to explain that to you.

722
00:52:29,019 --> 00:52:30,320
Do not follow me.

723
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:33,389
But...

724
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,260
Next.

725
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:50,968
I am Cha Mi Ryung from Euichang County.

726
00:52:50,969 --> 00:52:52,010
Very well.

727
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:59,379
A neighbor called Jin Tae suffers from a skin condition,

728
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,618
and he was let go from the inn he worked at overnight?

729
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:05,650
Not only was he let go when the illness is not contagious,

730
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,788
but he did not get the pay he was already owed.

731
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:11,530
Are you sure the condition is not contagious?

732
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,889
Yes.

733
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,399
Here is a physician's note saying he was quarantined...

734
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,630
for 15 days after symptoms showed and it did not spread to others.

735
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,399
May I check this for myself?

736
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,539
Of course.

737
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:27,639
A legal advocate must check the facts.

738
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,919
Do something.

739
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,920
It is itchy.

740
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,689
- But you must not scratch. - Oh, dear.

741
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,019
- Is it bad? - I cannot stand it.

742
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:44,630
You should not scratch.

743
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,699
- But it is so itchy. - Here.

744
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,699
Everyone with a rash is here.

745
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,800
Yes. I think they are being quarantined.

746
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:56,808
They do not seem rich themselves, but they are caring.

747
00:53:56,809 --> 00:54:00,380
It is not easy for a noble to work so closely with lowborn folk.

748
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,038
Yes.

749
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:05,848
There are people like you scattered all over.

750
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:08,018
Will you take a look at my child?

751
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:10,719
- When did this rash start? - I do not know.

752
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,488
This young lady is the niece of the academy professor.

753
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:19,658
She likes calligraphy, literature, and art.

754
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:21,359
She is an all-rounded lady.

755
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,299
Then she can hold a conversation with Young Master.

756
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,739
Do you not think she might be boring?

757
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:29,039
I hate boring people.

758
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,009
This young lady is Officer Shin's second daughter.

759
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:35,178
No wonder.

760
00:54:35,179 --> 00:54:38,449
I have a feeling she was a sickly child.

761
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:43,118
This young lady is Overseer Choi's third daughter.

762
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,419
They say the third daughter of a large family...

763
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,718
- is fated to live an easy life. - Yes.

764
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,029
A life is best when it is eventful.

765
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,130
You will not cooperate?

766
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,499
I should get the cane back out.

767
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,229
I do not care. Pick any woman who is like you, Tae Young.

768
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:00,170
You will never find another woman like her.

769
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,038
- Is that a compliment? - Of course it is.

770
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,868
Or I will not marry.

771
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:05,909
I will live with you forever.

772
00:55:07,539 --> 00:55:08,809
Are you in?

773
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:12,179
Who are you?

774
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:16,550
Why are you here?

775
00:55:17,489 --> 00:55:19,889
Why are you here?

776
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,959
You asked me to bring Jin Tae's contract.

777
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,098
I brought it myself as the courier office was closed.

778
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:31,929
That is fine.

779
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:33,269
So...

780
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,300
How do you know each other?

781
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,610
Well...

782
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,710
Here.

783
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:45,880
My goodness. How do you have this?

784
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,979
You dropped it the other day.

785
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,949
I kept it on me in case we met again.

786
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,159
Did you keep following me that day to return this?

787
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,789
Was that so?

788
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:00,960
Yes.

789
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:02,829
Thank you very much.

790
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:04,369
This is a relief.

791
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:17,909
Tae Young.

792
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:20,320
How far are we going?

793
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,449
You said you wanted to walk with me.

794
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,750
Yes, I enjoy our walks.

795
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:29,320
But what could be this heavy?

796
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,329
They are medicines for skin ailments and extra aloe.

797
00:56:32,929 --> 00:56:34,428
Aloe is cooling,

798
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:35,929
and it promotes healing.

799
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,428
Who is all this aloe for?

800
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,570
We are here. That is the house.

801
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,380
Where is she going when it is dark?

802
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,820
I wonder.

803
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:15,599
She is entering that house.

804
00:57:19,639 --> 00:57:21,809
Do not cry, darling.

805
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,078
Your mother must eat...

806
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,380
so she can suckle you.

807
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,349
Thank you so very much.

808
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:33,989
I see more bruises.

809
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,090
Did he hit you again?

810
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:39,159
You keep me going. Thank you.

811
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,299
I am sorry for taking so long...

812
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,900
when I knew you were starving.

813
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:45,670
I will bring some seaweed tomorrow.

814
00:57:48,099 --> 00:57:50,670
Oh, you are such a good boy.

815
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:52,940
You sleep so sweetly.

816
00:58:00,219 --> 00:58:01,280
Hey.

817
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,090
Where are you, wife?

818
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:09,059
What are you doing back here?

819
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,559
Why do you hit your wife?

820
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:14,000
Because she deserves a beating!

821
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,559
Does she?

822
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:18,599
Then...

823
00:58:19,699 --> 00:58:22,399
- how about you get beat? - Put that down!

824
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,368
If anyone deserves a beating,

825
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,669
you are the one who should be beaten to a pulp!

826
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,739
Darn you.

827
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,150
Are you all right?

828
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,348
Young Master.

829
00:58:35,349 --> 00:58:38,190
Why are you so reckless. What if you got hurt?

830
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:54,440
The aloe you brought last time was of great help.

831
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,809
I am glad to know it helped.

832
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:02,110
The suit you lodged against the inn was delayed...

833
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:05,178
as we are very busy.

834
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:07,050
I am not here to put pressure on you.

835
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:10,690
You seemed to be busy, so I went to the inn...

836
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:13,489
and said I had hired a legal advocate to sue them.

837
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,730
They gave me the back pay that Jin Tae was owed.

838
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,730
You are so very brave.

839
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,269
Whatever the case, that is a great relief.

840
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,070
Which is why, Madam Advocate...

841
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:34,280
If you are short-staffed, could I assist you?

842
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,480
I wish to help others like you.

843
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,650
I am a fast learner, and I am healthy and strong.

844
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:46,619
I will do anything.

845
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:50,360
Then...

846
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:53,030
will you learn the trade?

847
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:01,699
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

848
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,069
- Thank you. - How much do you get?

849
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,340
How much is it?

850
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,480
Good work.

851
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:10,380
Thank you.

852
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,809
You too.

853
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,079
Thank you.

854
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,948
Oh, my gosh.

855
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:16,989
Here.

856
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:19,750
- Father. - Come on.

857
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:27,599
Thank you all for your help.

858
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,599
You know what will happen...

859
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,900
if word gets out, right?

860
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:56,920
A noblewoman should not sit like that.

861
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,189
Why not?

862
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,099
I would like to be myself when it is just us.

863
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,500
What if someone were to come in and see?

864
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,399
This is great.

865
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,238
How is this kind of life great?

866
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:12,469
It is. There is not much to life.

867
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,610
We eat things like this...

868
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,050
Life is nothing grand.

869
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,420
I will share simple foods with you,

870
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,219
laugh together over lousy jokes,

871
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:29,320
cover your head with my hands when it rains,

872
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:34,199
and make you laugh when you look upset.

873
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:36,630
Without trying too hard and being fierce,

874
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:39,099
we can become happy.

875
01:01:43,239 --> 01:01:44,239
What is it?

876
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,010
Why did you stop talking?

877
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,610
Well,

878
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,679
a few drinks brought up some memories.

879
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,380
Silly me.

880
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,690
How do you like Mi Ryeong?

881
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,518
The more I get to know her, the more I like her.

882
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,059
So what if you like her?

883
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:08,059
Master Do Gyeom only cares for you.

884
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,630
I think he is interested as well.

885
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:11,929
Is he?

886
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,839
Shall I get the matchmaker to get her date of birth?

887
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,070
Yes, do that.

888
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,749
You supported him through his studies,

889
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,049
and will now marry him too.

890
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,279
What kind of daughter-in-law does all that...

891
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,480
when her husband is gone?

892
01:02:28,849 --> 01:02:30,448
Not that again.

893
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:33,019
Do you know what the women say?

894
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,960
"Her husband left her long ago for another woman."

895
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,859
"She sews each night,"

896
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,089
"and when she misses him,"

897
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,928
"she takes the long sewing needle and stabs her thigh."

898
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,069
"She must miss the scent of a man."

899
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,969
"She should let herself get abducted before she is too old."

900
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:07,920
Hello.

901
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:09,889
- Kkeut Dong. - Yes?

902
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,789
Did you send food to Dol Seok's mountain hideout?

903
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:14,500
Not yet this month.

904
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:17,299
He said they have some left and that we can take our time.

905
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,329
I see.

906
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:22,968
I have some free time today. Shall I organize the papers?

907
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:24,340
There is nothing left to organize.

908
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:27,940
Lady Mi Ryeong took care of that already.

909
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:30,909
Did you do that?

910
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,550
The records were organized only by date,

911
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:34,819
so I categorized them...

912
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:37,079
by case topic as well so you can find them easily.

913
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:40,590
How do you take care of things I did not even ask of you?

914
01:03:41,789 --> 01:03:44,460
You can speak casually with me.

915
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:46,289
Then...

916
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,400
shall I do that?

917
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:51,500
Why is it so quiet today?

918
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,070
Do Gyeom.

919
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,269
I found these on the way.

920
01:03:57,909 --> 01:04:00,579
It has been a long time since I was given flowers.

921
01:04:01,809 --> 01:04:04,309
I have some free time. Shall we go on a walk?

922
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,079
Yes, I would like that.

923
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:08,949
You should come too.

924
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:25,230
I must drop by somewhere. Take your time.

925
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:26,670
We will.

926
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:34,510
I apologize.

927
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:36,710
I got in the way.

928
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,980
Not at all. You did not disturb us.

929
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,780
Is the work manageable?

930
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:44,949
Yes. I am working hard and learning.

931
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:50,260
Then one day, I will be like Madam Advocate, right?

932
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,900
You are back, Madam.

933
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,500
Chon Seung Hwi's new book is not out yet.

934
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:04,308
Why has he not written in two years?

935
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:05,940
He must have made enough money.

936
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,139
I heard he stopped performing too.

937
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,678
("The Officer and the Woman")

938
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,079
"The Officer and the Woman?"

939
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:14,949
Put that down.

940
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:17,518
This is not your style at all.

941
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:18,649
How so?

942
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,690
It is too...

943
01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:21,559
raunchy.

944
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,960
It is a bit too much.

945
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:26,260
Though that is why it sells well.

946
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:31,530
Did he really not write because I told him not to?

947
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,768
Watch out!

948
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:41,480
- Oh, dear. - What is happening?

949
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:44,610
Careful!

950
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:48,980
Are you all right?

951
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,090
Yes.

952
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:54,789
Sorry.

953
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:59,289
I am sorry.

954
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,789
Excuse me.

955
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:26,619
Who are you?

956
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:31,530
My goodness. Man Seok.

957
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:35,659
- Are you all right? - Would you be after that?

958
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:37,469
You have not changed.

959
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,739
Are you doing well?

960
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,800
He was jailed? What for?

961
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,739
Well, what happened was...

962
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:53,379
He barged in with a sickle when someone else was performing...

963
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,749
and caused a fuss, screaming he would kill everyone.

964
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,618
- What? - They offered to let him off...

965
01:06:59,619 --> 01:07:01,719
if he apologized and paid for damages.

966
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:03,960
- But what? - But...

967
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:08,129
I will never apologize or pay for damages.

968
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:09,529
I would rather die.

969
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,969
Or I will...

970
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,170
kill you!

971
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:17,368
The charges are assault, Intimidation, and attempted murder.

972
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:19,538
He might be put away for the rest of his life.

973
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:21,239
I really did not want to come here.

974
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,210
He will threaten to kill me too if he were to hear I came to you.

975
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:27,050
I just...

976
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:32,289
You cannot come right away because you are married. I get that.

977
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,289
But...

978
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,260
you need not worry.

979
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,090
He is married.

980
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,729
Not just married,

981
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:45,400
but he has a son who looks just like him.

982
01:07:47,969 --> 01:07:49,070
I see.

983
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:50,969
That is great news.

984
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:53,639
Yes, it is.

985
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,239
He no longer has feelings for you,

986
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,308
so will you please come and help?

987
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,109
For old time's sake.

988
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,049
He helped you many times.

989
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:03,819
He gave you a gat ornament...

990
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:06,089
and paid slave hunters to leave you alone.

991
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:09,519
Keep things businesslike and just be his legal advocate.

992
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:13,259
You need not answer right now.

993
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:15,959
Take some time to think about it long and hard.

994
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,529
You can reach me at the inn.

995
01:08:18,699 --> 01:08:20,599
Please help, Madam Advocate.

996
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,300
Please. Save us.

997
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:25,810
You will go to Icheon?

998
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,439
Yes.

999
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,779
An old friend of mine needs a legal advocate.

1000
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,619
You never accept a case from outside Chungcheong Province.

1001
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:38,319
Not just that,

1002
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,289
but you did not accompany me to Hanyang for my state exam.

1003
01:08:41,489 --> 01:08:45,829
You only see your grandmother and brother when they visit you,

1004
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:47,829
and you will go to that busy place?

1005
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,529
Seven years ago... Actually, no.

1006
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:55,569
For a long time before that,

1007
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,539
this friend helped me a great deal.

1008
01:09:00,739 --> 01:09:04,210
I met this person seven years ago.

1009
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:07,979
It is the man who looks a lot like my brother, right?

1010
01:09:10,949 --> 01:09:12,090
Yes.

1011
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,859
Will you tell me your story when you come back?

1012
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:28,399
Can I really go?

1013
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,170
Yes. But you must promise to return.

1014
01:09:33,909 --> 01:09:34,909
I promise.

1015
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,948
Hey, it is fine.

1016
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:44,550
This place is far away from Hanyang.

1017
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:47,488
Madam. You can relax.

1018
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:48,819
I must be careful.

1019
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:51,259
Lady So Hye came all the way to Cheongsu County.

1020
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,788
No one will recognize you.

1021
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,800
You do not look like Goo Deoki now.

1022
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,000
Darn you.

1023
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,630
Anyway,

1024
01:09:58,829 --> 01:10:00,270
about your husband.

1025
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:02,239
What happened to him?

1026
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,369
- He really did not know. - He did not.

1027
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:08,408
After parting ways with you like that last time,

1028
01:10:08,409 --> 01:10:11,549
Master Chon mourned for three years saying Goo Deoki was dead.

1029
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,149
He even refused to pee in Cheongsu County's direction.

1030
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:16,350
Then do not tell him.

1031
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,118
I am here as his legal advocate.

1032
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:20,488
I understand. So tell me what happened.

1033
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:21,960
Where is your husband?

1034
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,100
Your master.

1035
01:10:32,199 --> 01:10:33,929
Are you sure he is in prison?

1036
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:36,340
Yes. He has no intention of leaving.

1037
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:41,739
My lord.

1038
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:43,310
What?

1039
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:46,979
My lord!

1040
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:27,050
My lord.

1041
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,359
My lord.

1042
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:35,359
My lord!

1043
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,368
- You cannot go. - My lord.

1044
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:41,898
- I will pay to enter. - Where will you go?

1045
01:11:41,899 --> 01:11:43,538
I will pay the fare.

1046
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:45,170
- My lord. - How much is it?

1047
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,680
My lord!

1048
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:50,979
My lord.

1049
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:21,579
My lord.

1050
01:12:22,739 --> 01:12:24,109
My lord!

1051
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,960
My lord!

1052
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,399
My lord.

1053
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:53,430
(The Tale of Lady Ok)

1054
01:13:54,369 --> 01:13:57,868
He said he wished your husband would not return.

1055
01:13:57,869 --> 01:14:01,009
He thinks only of you. He yearns only for you.

1056
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:03,979
He talks as if you are by his side.

1057
01:14:04,279 --> 01:14:07,310
Pretend Goo Deoki is alive and came back for a while.

1058
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,890
Very well. I will pretend...

1059
01:14:12,289 --> 01:14:14,489
we met in a dream.

1060
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:17,829
Do not go back. Stay here with us.

1061
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:22,300
I promise to get back at Ok Tae Young...

1062
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,229
who did this to us.

1063
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,699
They found Master Seong Yun Gyeom's body.
