00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,138
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,982
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,398
My dear wife Tae Young,
whom I miss and love.

5
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,535
I am still alive, eating well,

6
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,671
sleeping well, and healthy.

7
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:15,609
Even the jailers fall for my charm
and treat me nicely.

8
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:20,347
The wound from the arrow
I took for Man Seok

9
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,715
is healing as well.

10
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,918
But the wound from losing Man Seok

11
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,856
will never heal.

12
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,126
Though he was small in size,

13
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,830
his absence left us enormous sorrow.

14
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,569
Our Man Seok

15
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,205
should be running around.

16
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,040
What is he doing there?

17
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,610
You tried so hard to stop me,

18
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,112
but I led you to your death.

19
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:54,915
This is all my fault.

20
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,050
I am so sorry, Man Seok.

21
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,857
Now that I think of it,
I've never been apart from Man Seok.

22
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,927
By the time you receive this letter,

23
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,696
he'll have returned to Cheongsu County.

24
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,467
The reason Man Seok saved money

25
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:16,436
was to buy us a house by the sea.

26
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:21,074
In return, he wanted us
to name our son after him.

27
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,343
How ambitious.

28
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,214
So, Tae Young, we must have a daughter.

29
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,248
Promise me you will.

30
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,488
How have you been, Tae Young?

31
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,092
Don't worry about me, Yun Gyeom.

32
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:43,030
If you know I worry, you will worry too,

33
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,631
so I won't worry about you.

34
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,670
So, please don't worry about me.

35
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,673
Even if given another chance,

36
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,741
I will still go back to meet you.

37
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,146
You are the greatest gift of my life.

38
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,915
Every single day with you

39
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,918
remains a precious memory to me.

40
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:10,457
Now, I'm going to write my final story.

41
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,960
Did you bring my notebook?

42
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,731
You should be grateful
that I gave you paper for your letter.

43
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,334
Do you know how expensive
that ornament is?

44
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,370
I gave you something so expensive.

45
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,240
How could you only give me this?

46
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:32,946
I will share a secret
about the story's ending.

47
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,982
This is not a tale

48
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,518
about a sorrowful woman
mourning her husband.

49
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,589
This is a tale of a noble legal advocate

50
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,527
who was born a servant
but resilient like aloe

51
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,663
and stayed strong and helped others.

52
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,367
I believe this tale's end

53
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,869
will be filled with how you will do.

54
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,905
From your husband.

55
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,648
How can you still cheer for me

56
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,419
even until the very end?

57
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,200
(From your husband)

58
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:34,041
Strange disease? What do you mean?

59
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,811
Madam reported you, and the officials
are coming to take you away.

60
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:40,180
They say you must go
to the quarantine village.

61
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,215
Shh.

62
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:43,183
I am not infected.

63
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:49,456
Why...

64
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,926
Please look after my father.

65
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,595
Are you out of your mind?

66
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,898
You are pregnant.
What if something happens to you?

67
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:01,468
I have been incredibly lucky so far.

68
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,404
I want to trust that one last time.

69
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,040
What?

70
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,611
Besides, I am dying to know
what Bak Jun Gi is hiding.

71
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,181
And my husband's book...

72
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,451
I must finish it properly.

73
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:46,046
Please give it back.

74
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:48,815
Help me please.

75
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,551
Wait, just a moment.

76
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,838
Legal Advocate Madam,

77
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:47,007
are you afflicted
with the strange disease too?

78
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:51,378
Why are you both here?

79
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,920
There is something I must hear.

80
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:05,492
He cannot speak.

81
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,937
Devoted Hearts Association
has been active in Anbyon.

82
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,773
We took in not just children
who left their home,

83
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,042
but also runaway slaves and wanderers.

84
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,510
We sheltered and taught them.

85
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,880
We believed that to create a world
where all are respected,

86
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,549
education must come first.

87
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:32,286
If that were the case,
he should've at least sent words.

88
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:33,620
If we get caught,

89
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,856
he said it'd endanger the safe house

90
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,759
and bring disgrace to the family.

91
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,394
Even so,

92
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,797
ignoring me is one thing,

93
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,766
but when he met his brother in Qing,

94
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,735
he should've explained himself.

95
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:52,573
The Leader was not in his right mind
at the time.

96
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:56,143
While we were out briefly,

97
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,212
everyone was killed.

98
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,882
Someone made a false report again,

99
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:04,218
so Devoted Hearts Association
was once again labeled as rebels.

100
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,887
Learning the enemy was heading to Qing,

101
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,324
the Leader crossed the border
and determined to eliminate them.

102
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,593
However, he failed

103
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:14,828
and lost his voice.

104
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,874
For years now,
he has suffered from a heart disease.

105
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:32,212
He wishes to spend his remaining days
caring for the sick.

106
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,898
I think I need to go
find my real brother.

107
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,501
When I get to Hanyang,
I will submit my resignation.

108
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,103
Even if he returns,

109
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,039
you know nothing will change.

110
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,874
Yun Gyeom asked you

111
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,111
to care for Tae Young with that mind.

112
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,980
When I met my brother in Qing,

113
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,318
I should've dragged him back
by the collar.

114
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,289
If I had, innocent Yun Gyeom
would not be like this now,

115
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,560
and Man Seok would still be alive.

116
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:31,138
Sitting like this makes me
miss him more.

117
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,907
You are right.

118
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,178
We sat here, and he even taught us
how to do love cheers.

119
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,014
Now, link arms like this.

120
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,817
That is right. Now pull closer.

121
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,985
What is this?

122
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:48,021
It is called "love cheers," Miss.

123
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,828
If I had known,
I'd have treated him better.

124
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,164
Because of Man Seok,

125
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,166
I gained the courage
to confess love to Sweetheart.

126
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,704
It was so much fun back then.

127
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,073
We released fireflies together.

128
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,812
I even became a slave hunter
with Man Seok.

129
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,318
Seriously, with Man Seok,

130
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:21,722
I even went to Bongraegol
to catch Physician Heo Soon.

131
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,824
Heo Soon...

132
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:28,829
Looking back,
there were so many fun times.

133
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,734
I miss our Man Seok.

134
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,072
He said he'd come back.

135
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,844
He promised to meet again alive.

136
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:52,152
He said my cooking was the best
in the world.

137
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,788
Man Seok.

138
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,195
Eat up and rest in peace.

139
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,608
Let me see here.

140
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,651
This is so delicious.

141
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,787
How do you cook like this, Miss?

142
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,457
Dokki.

143
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:35,362
You should know you married
such a talented cook all thanks to me.

144
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,199
Kkeutdongi, are you crying?

145
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,535
If you cry, you'll end up all droopy,

146
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,971
and you won't be able to get married.

147
00:11:57,918 --> 00:12:00,888
If you all stay like this,
how can I leave in peace?

148
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,190
Just for today.

149
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,592
Mourn just for today.

150
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,564
And starting tomorrow,
for our Master and Madam,

151
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,600
let us live diligently again, okay?

152
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:19,306
Thank you for accepting me as a family.

153
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:22,709
I will take my leave now.

154
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:30,684
I had such a fun life.

155
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,446
My aloe

156
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,549
produced some tiny sprouts.

157
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,517
Mine too.

158
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,320
It seems they sprout quickly.
It will multiply soon.

159
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,623
They handed out
such a precious thing for free.

160
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,625
I never imagined I'd feel this way.

161
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,961
But honestly, I feel bad.

162
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:17,531
At first, I was shocked
and thought they were disgraceful.

163
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:18,866
To be honest,

164
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:23,070
I was jealous of the deep affection
from the fake husband.

165
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,673
Do you think Special Inspector Seong

166
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:29,109
really killed the real Seong Yun Gyeom?

167
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,777
- No way.
- Right?

168
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:33,580
He doesn't seem like someone
capable of killing.

169
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,916
Should we file a petition?

170
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,453
But will they reduce the sentence for that
when he has disobeyed a royal decree?

171
00:13:39,453 --> 00:13:40,988
Then, what about Legal Advocate Ok?

172
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,656
Or should we call her Goodeoki?

173
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,026
Regardless, she made great contributions
and even established a monument here.

174
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,562
Can she at least
be freed from servitude?

175
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:51,732
Thanks to those contributions,
even as a runaway slave guilty of treason,

176
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,433
she avoided execution.

177
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:55,802
- About the scar on Kim Nak Soo's face?
- Yes.

178
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,305
Did that make it treason?

179
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,608
Honestly, such a man deserves to die.

180
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,744
If it were me, I'd have killed him.

181
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,520
Hearing the opinions
of our Mothers Sanctuary ladies,

182
00:14:13,754 --> 00:14:17,558
I'll make a proposal as the Chair Lady.

183
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,092
Yes.

184
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,762
Could Special Inspector Seong
really have killed someone?

185
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:24,998
If not, he should've firmly denied it.

186
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,401
Why confess to something false
when there wasn't even evidence?

187
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:30,237
Perhaps he did it
to shorten Tae Young's imprisonment.

188
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,274
So typical of Special Inspector Seong.

189
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,476
How can such a romantic man

190
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,712
exist in the world?

191
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,815
But weren't you surprised?

192
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,419
I was truly shocked to hear

193
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,120
Legal Advocate Ok was a runaway slave.

194
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,091
No matter what Tae Young's status is,

195
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,893
she is my one and only sister-in-law.

196
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:56,129
Yes. If it wasn't for Tae Young,

197
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,432
you would have been falsely accused
of killing your own mother and...

198
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,135
I apologize.

199
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:04,371
But you spoke the truth.

200
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,807
Thank you for understanding.

201
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:10,010
I deeply apologize
for burdening Cheongsu County, Chief.

202
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,178
Burden?

203
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:13,714
Special Inspector Seong
and Legal Advocate Ok

204
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:16,416
were treasures of Cheongsu County.

205
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,118
Without them,

206
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,721
we would've starved long ago.

207
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,156
While Goodeoki acted as Ok Tae Young

208
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,859
and Song Seo In as Seong Yun Gyeom,

209
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,128
who exactly did they harm?

210
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,865
I don't remember Seong Yun Gyeom
from seven years ago.

211
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,836
To me, the returned Seong Yun Gyeom

212
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,838
is the real one.

213
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:42,609
Thank you for saying so.

214
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,313
As the Chair Lady
of the Mother's Association,

215
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:49,750
I discussed this with our ladies.

216
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,352
This is the money for selling aloe.

217
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,723
How about using this to offer to buy
Legal Advocate Ok from the concubine?

218
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,127
We have tried multiple times
but were all refused.

219
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,930
As expected.

220
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,699
May that wretched concubine
be struck by lightning.

221
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,144
Why do you hesitate to pour?

222
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,081
I said pour.

223
00:16:23,584 --> 00:16:25,185
The one who caused his death

224
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,221
was none other

225
00:16:28,522 --> 00:16:30,123
than your husband, Lord Bak Jun Gi.

226
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:34,361
You were just a hostage.

227
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,064
When Kim Nak Soo was captured,

228
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:40,267
you were held as leverage so he couldn't
reveal Bak Jun Gi was behind all of it.

229
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:51,812
Was I a hostage?

230
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,816
What are you saying?

231
00:16:55,816 --> 00:16:57,751
Is that why my father was beaten
to death in silence,

232
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,254
unable to confess it was your doing?

233
00:17:01,722 --> 00:17:04,091
- So what?
- Now it makes sense.

234
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:06,059
How you operate.

235
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,965
You exploit weaknesses
to order vile deeds.

236
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,401
And when caught,

237
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:17,171
you cut ties with threats
to reveal the weakness

238
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,940
and create distractions
with what is in your hand.

239
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,675
Am I right?

240
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,979
You couldn't have figured it out.
Did Goodeoki tell you that?

241
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,284
Goodeoki caught the strange disease,
so I sent her to the quarantine village.

242
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,854
She cannot possibly be infected.

243
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:42,796
To rush her own demise. What a pity.

244
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,186
It would be a lie
to say I bore no resentment.

245
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,155
However, I too,

246
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:46,493
failed to wait for you

247
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:50,631
and abandoned my responsibilities
as a wife.

248
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,701
So please don't feel sorry.

249
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:57,704
I won't feel sorry, either.

250
00:18:58,572 --> 00:18:59,573
Because

251
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,211
that is what I owe
to the one I truly love.

252
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,248
He took your place as my husband

253
00:19:12,553 --> 00:19:14,755
and the punishment for you.

254
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,673
If you are wondering
about my humble appearance,

255
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,508
yes,

256
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,145
my secret was discovered,

257
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:42,583
so I am a servant again.

258
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:10,544
Quickly.

259
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,550
Get inside.

260
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,454
So you heard what I said,

261
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:23,590
wanted to look for
what Bak Jun Gi is hiding,

262
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:27,828
and you risked your life to come here
even if you were not even infected?

263
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:32,165
It was the only way
to escape that house.

264
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:36,203
Indeed, this is just like you.

265
00:20:36,203 --> 00:20:38,138
What do you think Bak Jun Gi
is trying to hide

266
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,974
by distracting the Royal Tribunal?

267
00:20:45,012 --> 00:20:46,246
Look over there.

268
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,983
They are letting people in

269
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,119
without checking symptoms.

270
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:55,022
I entered easily as well.

271
00:20:56,056 --> 00:20:57,457
Maybe it is to inflate patient numbers

272
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,426
and get more rations?

273
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:02,729
No food or medicine
has come for a long time.

274
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:04,298
So you are saying

275
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:07,334
the supplies sent here
are being embezzled?

276
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:11,438
The Grain Bureau and Health Office
are both under Bak Jun Gi's control.

277
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,576
Thanks to the chaos your case caused,

278
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:19,112
the Chief Minister's storerooms
must be overflowing.

279
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,349
So it was all about money.

280
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,051
How ridiculous.

281
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:32,226
Do Gyeom?

282
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:36,697
Do Gyeom.

283
00:21:59,286 --> 00:22:02,990
Forgive this unworthy younger brother
who failed to protect you.

284
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:06,193
But I swear to risk my life

285
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,462
to protect Tae Young.

286
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:27,948
- Why are you here?
- Tae Young.

287
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:30,884
What is going on?
Do you have the strange disease?

288
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:32,419
No, I do not.

289
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:34,755
I heard you were here, so I came.

290
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:36,423
How are you doing?

291
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,492
Are you out of your mind?

292
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,061
Go back now. What about Mi Ryeong?

293
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,864
If I tell her, she will surely praise me
for coming here.

294
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,832
I am no longer your sister-in-law.

295
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:47,601
I am just someone else's servant.

296
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,304
How can you speak so coldly?

297
00:22:50,604 --> 00:22:53,707
Anyway, you'll always
be my sister-in-law

298
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:55,209
and mother.

299
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:01,114
Over there.

300
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:16,129
Do Gyeom.

301
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,571
Why are you here?

302
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,139
What gives you the right?

303
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:28,609
Do Gyeom, stop this. He is your brother.

304
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,810
He is not my brother.

305
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,112
Answer me. Why are you here?

306
00:23:34,014 --> 00:23:36,683
He cannot speak.

307
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,488
Why can't he speak?

308
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:42,990
Why?

309
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,860
No words can justify
your actions anyway.

310
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:49,029
Do Gyeom.

311
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:56,036
Because of you,
an innocent man will be executed.

312
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:57,604
Because of you,

313
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:01,175
my brother is going to die.

314
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:26,800
I know you recognized me.

315
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,538
I suppose my time has come,

316
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:35,008
since I gained a chance to apologize.

317
00:24:41,215 --> 00:24:43,450
I won't apologize for my comfort.

318
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:45,953
Don't forgive me.

319
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,595
Thank you for staying alive.

320
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,598
Thank you for covering my sins.

321
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,702
You don't need to care for me anymore.

322
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,837
I should not be expecting that.

323
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:11,845
Thank you.

324
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:15,649
I truly thank you.

325
00:25:38,305 --> 00:25:40,307
Your life may be in danger.

326
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:47,314
That is right,
so I think I should go alone.

327
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:49,783
What nonsense is that?

328
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,387
Like the Young Madam said,
we could end up dead.

329
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,890
I have no dear wife or kids,

330
00:25:57,424 --> 00:25:58,825
but you are newly married.

331
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:03,897
Well, Sweetheart, I...

332
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:04,898
You should go.

333
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,803
Even if it means dying, you have to go.

334
00:26:09,803 --> 00:26:11,371
You have to do something.

335
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,140
You trust me, right?

336
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,475
I will return with Kkeutdongi,

337
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:16,376
so don't worry.

338
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,544
Yes.

339
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:20,280
I know how much you care.

340
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:22,716
Tae Young and Yun Gyeom will know too.

341
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,018
So I wish no one would go.

342
00:26:26,053 --> 00:26:27,354
It is too dangerous.

343
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:29,056
Well,

344
00:26:30,157 --> 00:26:32,326
before I met Madam,

345
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:34,528
I thought I was nothing.

346
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:38,599
But she taught me how to read,

347
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,834
told me to memorize laws,

348
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,070
so even as a lowly servant,

349
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:45,539
I started to feel human.

350
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:50,744
Even if what we do changes nothing,

351
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,647
we must try.

352
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,684
Madam never gave up
and always did something.

353
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,154
That is what I learned

354
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:04,124
from watching her.

355
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:15,169
With all of you joining me,
I feel reassured on this journey.

356
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:19,406
I am glad you haven't left yet.

357
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,441
The Magistrate is not here,
so if I leave as well,

358
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:24,411
you must take care of Cheongsu County.

359
00:27:24,878 --> 00:27:26,847
The government office staff
pooled this together.

360
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,949
It is not much,
but use it for your travels.

361
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:31,318
Thank you.

362
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,589
Now, let us go.

363
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:51,205
Why are you here?

364
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:54,474
There is nothing you can solve here.

365
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:55,909
You should do something outside.

366
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:00,080
Are you hurt?

367
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:05,686
I sprained my arm.

368
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:11,925
This is licorice root medicine,
good for pain relief.

369
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,331
Take half a dose at a...

370
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:22,870
No, you should take only half at once,
not the whole one.

371
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,171
My goodness.

372
00:28:24,838 --> 00:28:28,008
Next time, take half a dose only.

373
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:29,843
Understood.

374
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:40,954
Here,

375
00:28:41,822 --> 00:28:43,524
brew this for me as well.

376
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,094
- Heo Soon?
- Yes.

377
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:51,732
Why are you here, Legal Advocate Madam?

378
00:28:52,165 --> 00:28:53,967
Is the disease spreading
in your county as well?

379
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,736
No.

380
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,405
But why are you here, Heo Soon?

381
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,374
There were too few
volunteers, so I came.

382
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,577
I thought I'd at least
not starve here, but I was wrong.

383
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,946
It seems I made a mistake.

384
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:09,149
I heard food and medicine supplies
are running out.

385
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,318
- Is that true?
- Yes.

386
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:13,086
These are herbs I foraged
from the mountains.

387
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,989
Even the food is brought in
by wandering migrants.

388
00:29:16,723 --> 00:29:18,525
Are they expecting us
to starve to death?

389
00:29:19,193 --> 00:29:20,928
Luckily, it is not contagious, at least.

390
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,532
Not contagious?

391
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:30,370
One of the medical ladies touched
the infected blood and was quarantined,

392
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,040
but even after days,
she showed no symptoms.

393
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:36,076
If it doesn't spread through contact,

394
00:29:36,076 --> 00:29:39,780
could it spread through
droplets or other means?

395
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,749
If it spread through breathing,
everyone here would have been infected.

396
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:45,252
I found it strange too.

397
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:47,087
New patients keep arriving,

398
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:49,022
but there are no new cases here.

399
00:29:49,022 --> 00:29:51,391
The symptoms resemble eruptive typhus,

400
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:54,394
but Sohwalhyeolsan, Igongsan,
and Jungjungtang

401
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:55,529
don't work.

402
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:59,299
Could it spread when infected areas
directly touch each other?

403
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:02,135
I have not tested that yet.

404
00:30:10,744 --> 00:30:12,546
What are you doing?

405
00:30:12,546 --> 00:30:13,447
Yun Gyeom.

406
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:21,288
I heard that Bak Jun Gi

407
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:23,056
reported the Seong family case.

408
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:25,759
My father said
Bak Jun Gi did it on purpose

409
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,262
to divert Royal Tribunal's attention.

410
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:31,031
I wondered why he
initially withheld key evidences

411
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:34,668
when he had them all along.

412
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,571
Perhaps to prolong the investigation?

413
00:30:37,571 --> 00:30:39,907
Was it to stop the investigation of him?

414
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:48,815
It seems we have been misled.

415
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:50,150
Why do you say that, My Lord?

416
00:30:50,951 --> 00:30:53,420
What he was blocking
was not an investigation.

417
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:54,688
What?

418
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,123
What we overlooked

419
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,259
was the strange disease.

420
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,869
Are you feeling any discomfort?

421
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:57,284
He has no fever, and no blood spots
or rashes are visible.

422
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,653
If it is not contagious,

423
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:01,855
then where did they catch the disease?

424
00:32:02,723 --> 00:32:04,057
During consultations,

425
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,760
I noticed one thing common
among the patients.

426
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,430
Before the outbreak, they all had
underlying conditions of some sort.

427
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,400
I had knee joint issues too.
When the pain worsened,

428
00:32:14,368 --> 00:32:17,704
I would get acupuncture
or take licorice root medicine.

429
00:32:17,704 --> 00:32:21,074
But then, I started developing
a heat rash on my body.

430
00:32:24,878 --> 00:32:25,879
Exactly like this.

431
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:29,349
Do Gyeom.

432
00:32:30,751 --> 00:32:31,885
It is a blister.

433
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:33,120
Let me see.

434
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,322
But it clearly seemed non-contagious.
Why is it spreading?

435
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,758
- Are you okay?
- Stay back, Tae Young.

436
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:40,160
Have you had any prior injuries
or ailments?

437
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:42,863
I sprained my arm.

438
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,199
He took a licorice root medicine.

439
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,202
I gave it to him.

440
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,672
It is just a painkiller.

441
00:32:52,139 --> 00:32:53,874
I got it from Sinjae Pharmacy.

442
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,582
The disease did not develop
from any illness.

443
00:33:03,217 --> 00:33:05,819
Those who took licorice root medicine
as they were sick developed it.

444
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:40,621
Why follow me all this way,

445
00:33:40,621 --> 00:33:42,356
just to be of no help like this?

446
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,424
That is what your face says.

447
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:47,194
Please, do not read my mind.

448
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:53,367
Yun Gyeom is writing a masterpiece
in prison.

449
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:55,602
I know that.

450
00:33:56,103 --> 00:34:00,040
If I had brought the real Yun Gyeom back

451
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,877
when I met him in Qing,

452
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,647
what would have happened?

453
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,853
One thing is clear.

454
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,655
Tae Young,

455
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:17,758
you wouldn't have been happy.

456
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:27,034
Just stop this talk and have some rest.

457
00:34:44,785 --> 00:34:47,387
Only some supplies from the Grain Bureau

458
00:34:47,387 --> 00:34:49,723
and the Health Office
reached the quarantine village.

459
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:50,858
Only some?

460
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:54,761
The rest were sent to
Bak Jun Gi's homes.

461
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,832
There were other strange things.

462
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:16,583
I followed but lost him

463
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:19,786
around the pharmacy district.

464
00:35:21,655 --> 00:35:23,090
The pharmacy district?

465
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,360
Find out what is going on right now.

466
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,906
Why are the symptoms so severe?

467
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,519
Other patients also had
licorice root medicine.

468
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:56,089
It seems something was added to it.

469
00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:57,824
What could have been added?

470
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,994
I believe they added blood plants.

471
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,462
Blood plant?

472
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:05,465
Blood plant is a toxic herb
not even listed in "Bencao Gangmu."

473
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:08,502
It is a rare plant from the West,
neither in Joseon nor Qing.

474
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:10,537
A small amount was likely added

475
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:12,940
to mimic the symptoms
of a strange disease.

476
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,474
It was advised to take half a pill.

477
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,777
Swallowing a full pill at once
likely caused acute poisoning.

478
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:18,779
Those who consumed it daily

479
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:20,814
were slowly poisoned and died.

480
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,716
I took it daily, too.

481
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,352
I suppose I will die soon.

482
00:36:26,987 --> 00:36:28,622
Are you certain it is blood plant?

483
00:36:28,622 --> 00:36:31,892
With a few pills, I was not sure,
but with a batch gathered,

484
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:36,396
it emitted a distinct fishy smell
unique to blood plant.

485
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,065
A fishy smell?

486
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,335
The herbs he stores here
are made into pills

487
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:43,937
in the back warehouse and sold.

488
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:48,509
But what is that herb? Smells so fishy.

489
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,378
That was blood plant.

490
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:57,217
Bak Jun Gi is selling pills
made of blood plants.

491
00:36:57,618 --> 00:36:58,552
What?

492
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,854
He didn't try to profit
from the disease.

493
00:37:00,854 --> 00:37:02,022
He spread a fake one

494
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:04,491
to make money.

495
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:12,633
My mother injured herself badly.

496
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:15,669
She is in severe pain,
so give me some licorice root medicine.

497
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,705
We are out.

498
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,308
It arrives late tonight.
Come early tomorrow morning.

499
00:37:35,756 --> 00:37:37,424
The Ministry of Constitution

500
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:40,127
as well as the Royal Tribunal halted
their investigation to focus here.

501
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:43,430
I got news from the diseased village.

502
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,232
Goodeoki has figured it all out.

503
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:46,567
Should we clean it up?

504
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:49,736
It ended faster than expected.

505
00:37:50,737 --> 00:37:53,540
Clean it up thoroughly. Leave no trace.

506
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:56,743
Are you halting everything again?

507
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:05,686
How dare you enter without permission!

508
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:06,787
Eavesdropping?

509
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:10,057
There are still plenty of herbs left.

510
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:12,359
Why are you calling to clean it up?

511
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,761
Do you even know what this is?

512
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,301
A poison pill.

513
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:25,506
I realized when you said
Goodeoki couldn't have been infected.

514
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,709
It was not a strange disease.

515
00:38:29,843 --> 00:38:32,346
It seems you have prepared this
for so long.

516
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,982
You have not been caught,
so why stop this so early?

517
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,784
Not a single blemish must be made
to the Chief Minister.

518
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:40,287
I will stop at even the smallest risk.
That is how I play it.

519
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,490
I thought you were bold,
but you are a coward.

520
00:38:43,757 --> 00:38:47,461
It explains why you are
just filling Chief Minister's coffers.

521
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:48,595
What?

522
00:38:48,595 --> 00:38:50,964
Why? Are you going to hit me again?

523
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,735
Hit me once more,
and I'll make sure you never wake up.

524
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:01,241
May I offer my help?

525
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:04,511
Surely they would not bother tracking

526
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:05,946
a bored concubine out for a walk?

527
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:10,517
In exchange, make me your official wife.

528
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:12,586
What?

529
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:15,289
I am tired of being belittled
as a mere concubine.

530
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:20,260
And I refuse to let my child
be treated as illegitimate.

531
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:24,932
I 'll redistribute the pills

532
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:27,334
to ensure the disease
continues spreading.

533
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:31,238
But burn the quarantine village to make
sure the Royal Tribunal finds nothing.

534
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,208
Let Goodeoki burn to ashes as well.

535
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,126
There is a detoxifying herb.

536
00:39:54,061 --> 00:39:55,062
Is that true?

537
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:57,564
A retired royal physician
called Toji is here,

538
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:59,233
and he said brewing the Baeksacho roots

539
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,468
neutralizes blood plants.

540
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:04,371
It is not a rare herb,
but it is unavailable here.

541
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,240
We must inform the chief guard.

542
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,742
We need to find Baeksacho
and treat the patients.

543
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,778
The chief guards work for Bak Jun Gi.

544
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,982
They don't want us to recover.

545
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:19,953
Then, I will speak to them.

546
00:40:19,953 --> 00:40:21,021
No.

547
00:40:21,021 --> 00:40:23,690
Even higher officials here are
just patients.

548
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,828
Even if we are doomed,
let us not hasten our deaths.

549
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:30,831
I will go to Hanyang myself.

550
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,266
You cannot, Tae Young.

551
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:34,001
You shouldn't do this
as you are pregnant.

552
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:35,736
It does not matter. I must.

553
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:37,137
I have to save them.

554
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:39,506
Once inside, no one can
leave this place.

555
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:41,275
Didn't you notice the guards?

556
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,277
There are no guards
on the rear mountain.

557
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,179
We forage for herbs freely there.

558
00:40:45,646 --> 00:40:47,681
Beyond the mountain
is the government office.

559
00:40:47,681 --> 00:40:50,117
Even if you pass it,
you will be stopped outside.

560
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:52,886
You'll die before you reach Hanyang.

561
00:40:52,886 --> 00:40:54,054
Everyone, just stop.

562
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,429
Where are you going? Let me go with you.

563
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:03,897
Please let us go.

564
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:06,800
We must avenge ourselves
against Bak Jun Gi.

565
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:08,302
What?

566
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:11,071
Bak Jun Gi ordered the slaughter
of the Devoted Hearts Association.

567
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:15,409
He was the one the Leader
tried to assassinate in Qing.

568
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:24,017
You must come back safely.

569
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,753
Do Gyeom lost his brother already.

570
00:41:28,288 --> 00:41:29,656
Once is enough.

571
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:12,833
Mother.

572
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:17,538
They might burn the quarantine village.

573
00:42:18,305 --> 00:42:19,206
What?

574
00:42:19,206 --> 00:42:22,509
They claim the wind spreads the disease.

575
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,112
Who would make such a decision?

576
00:42:25,112 --> 00:42:26,480
The king himself.

577
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:41,495
Do you think he made it?

578
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,499
Are you worried about your brother?

579
00:42:48,535 --> 00:42:51,138
I am worried about you.

580
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:13,327
What is happening?

581
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:14,795
They plan to burn this place down.

582
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:17,764
They say the disease
spreads through the wind.

583
00:43:37,017 --> 00:43:38,151
What are you doing?

584
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:42,456
How can the wind spread disease?
You fools.

585
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,525
I am the Hongmungwan
Deputy Tribunal Officer.

586
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,193
Bring the chief guard here now.

587
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:51,732
If you have something to say,
say it to me.

588
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,435
I am the chief of the office
in charge of this place.

589
00:43:56,537 --> 00:43:58,438
Bak Jun Gi.

590
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,610
It has been a while.

591
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:08,615
This disease is not contagious.

592
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,884
You know that.

593
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:13,420
What do you think you are doing?

594
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,630
Was pillaging the provinces
not enough for you?

595
00:44:24,531 --> 00:44:25,566
How dare you!

596
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,701
Don't you fear the heavens?

597
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,137
How could you poison the people?

598
00:44:30,571 --> 00:44:33,540
When will the Chief Minister's
storehouses be full enough?

599
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:37,211
Do you intend to fill them
with the blood of all the people?

600
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:40,180
It is because of you.

601
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,684
You kept interfering,
so I had to act decisively.

602
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:45,953
What grand plans do you have

603
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:48,021
that require such effort?

604
00:44:49,456 --> 00:44:50,691
Are you plotting treason

605
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,794
to shake the world itself?

606
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:58,799
I only do my best
with what I am tasked with.

607
00:44:58,799 --> 00:45:00,701
You are no different from me.

608
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:04,538
You are a servant to the Chief Minister.

609
00:45:08,141 --> 00:45:11,778
Speak as much as you want,
as this will be your last words.

610
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:15,549
By morning, you will be ashes.

611
00:45:21,288 --> 00:45:22,422
Be careful.

612
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:27,060
You never know when you'll be discarded.

613
00:45:33,367 --> 00:45:34,201
Hae Gang.

614
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:37,838
Sending one mere rat
and showing off like that?

615
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:40,574
Leave no trace behind.

616
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:42,776
Burn everything to ashes.

617
00:45:42,776 --> 00:45:46,547
You scoundrel.
You will face divine retribution.

618
00:45:48,549 --> 00:45:50,617
Hae Gang.

619
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:11,672
What happened?

620
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,708
We apprehended the owner
of Sinjae Pharmacy,

621
00:46:14,708 --> 00:46:17,544
but he claimed he bought licorice root
medicine from a stranger and sold it.

622
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:18,779
Licorice root medicine?

623
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,281
Is it not just a painkiller?

624
00:46:22,082 --> 00:46:23,717
We are analyzing the pills,

625
00:46:23,717 --> 00:46:25,752
but it may take some time.

626
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:31,758
The Chief Minister pushed the king

627
00:46:31,758 --> 00:46:33,927
to order the burning
of the quarantine village.

628
00:46:34,394 --> 00:46:35,395
My Lord.

629
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:38,298
They claim the disease
in the capital spreads through the wind.

630
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:41,468
We had no evidence to refute it,

631
00:46:42,402 --> 00:46:43,670
so we couldn't stop it.

632
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,535
My goodness.

633
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:21,942
My goodness.

634
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:25,879
Please find a way to save her.

635
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:32,319
We are all going to die anyway, My Lord.

636
00:47:34,254 --> 00:47:37,024
If they plan to kill us,
let them do it quickly.

637
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:39,693
Shall I go outside and distract them?

638
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,061
While they are distracted...

639
00:47:41,461 --> 00:47:42,462
I...

640
00:47:44,932 --> 00:47:47,000
I was the bait.

641
00:47:50,337 --> 00:47:52,840
The Leader's will has been fulfilled.

642
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:02,482
You...

643
00:48:24,271 --> 00:48:25,906
What is mixed
with the licorice root medicine

644
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,109
is blood plant.

645
00:48:55,602 --> 00:48:56,670
Deok Hun.

646
00:49:01,041 --> 00:49:03,443
Take the patients
and feed them the detoxifying herb.

647
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:04,545
Yes, sir.

648
00:49:08,048 --> 00:49:12,452
Where is Yun Gyeom?

649
00:49:30,571 --> 00:49:32,739
I thought I'd die, but I survived.

650
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:33,774
Let us go now.

651
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:41,481
Madam, where are you heading so early?

652
00:49:41,748 --> 00:49:43,083
To a gathering with other ladies.

653
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:45,285
But you were not invited.

654
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:48,222
What if you are turned away
at the door again?

655
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:57,164
Here, eat. This is good for pain.

656
00:49:58,098 --> 00:49:59,900
Kkeoksoe, you eat too.

657
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:02,569
Hurry up and eat.

658
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,705
It is really good for you. Eat it.

659
00:50:05,873 --> 00:50:07,140
Come on, eat.

660
00:50:11,378 --> 00:50:13,080
- Search the place.
- Yes, sir.

661
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:25,792
What is the meaning of this?

662
00:50:26,293 --> 00:50:28,028
Why are you entering my house like that?

663
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:30,030
In various of your houses in Hanyang,

664
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,766
herbs and rice you pocketed

665
00:50:32,766 --> 00:50:34,968
from the Health Office
and Grain Bureau were found.

666
00:50:34,968 --> 00:50:37,271
And for that,
you cause such a commotion?

667
00:50:39,173 --> 00:50:42,042
In the barn,
we found ground blood plants,

668
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:45,879
and in the back storage, licorice
root medicine mixed with blood plants.

669
00:50:54,488 --> 00:50:56,056
I know nothing about this.

670
00:50:56,557 --> 00:50:58,225
This house belongs to my concubine.

671
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:01,128
You did all of this, didn't you?

672
00:51:01,128 --> 00:51:03,463
Are you trying to frame me now?

673
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:05,899
You should have listened
when I told you to clean up.

674
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:06,934
You!

675
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:10,704
A government official,
tasked to care for the people.

676
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:15,542
How could you commit such heinous
and unforgivable crimes?

677
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:19,913
As if spreading poison to massacre
innocent people was not enough,

678
00:51:19,913 --> 00:51:22,149
you even tried to burn
the quarantine village to hide it.

679
00:51:22,583 --> 00:51:24,484
Aren't you afraid of the heavens?

680
00:51:24,785 --> 00:51:26,453
The Chief Minister is my heavens.

681
00:51:28,522 --> 00:51:30,891
Do you really think you can punish me?

682
00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:33,894
Guards!

683
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:37,631
Inform the Chief Minister at once.

684
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,438
How foolish.

685
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:47,741
This was all directed
by the Chief Minister.

686
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,178
What?

687
00:51:59,686 --> 00:52:01,255
What will happen to me?

688
00:52:01,255 --> 00:52:02,990
What will happen to me?

689
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:05,459
Concubine Kim So Hye,

690
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,196
you are equally guilty
of aiding Bak Jun Gi's crimes.

691
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:11,064
Arrest her and take her
to the Royal Tribunal.

692
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:18,906
What should I do?

693
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:22,943
Let go of me!

694
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:24,845
What are you doing? Help me.

695
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:26,647
Help me! What are you doing?

696
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:29,183
Help me.

697
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:31,485
Let go! Stop this!

698
00:53:03,483 --> 00:53:07,888
- My goodness, Elder Master.
- Elder Master.

699
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:10,290
Elder Master.

700
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:14,127
- What now?
- My goodness.

701
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:19,099
Elder Master.

702
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:22,202
No.

703
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,171
What do we do?

704
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:28,475
Goodness.

705
00:53:35,015 --> 00:53:35,916
Yun Gyeom.

706
00:53:40,087 --> 00:53:41,088
Yun Gyeom.

707
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,525
Yun Gyeom!

708
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,528
Yun Gyeom.

709
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:52,699
Yun Gyeom.

710
00:53:56,336 --> 00:53:58,705
He couldn't endure the imprisonment.

711
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:04,978
His body was recovered
by Deputy Tribunal Officer Seong.

712
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:26,567
The servants shall return
to their owners,

713
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:29,069
government servants
to their respective offices,

714
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,673
and wanderers and displaced people
to their hometowns.

715
00:54:33,073 --> 00:54:36,343
The criminals will be investigated
and duly punished.

716
00:54:41,215 --> 00:54:42,216
Servant Goodeoki.

717
00:54:48,655 --> 00:54:50,357
Allow me to serve as a legal advocate

718
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,560
one last time.

719
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,095
What is a legal advocate?

720
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:56,964
What does that even mean?

721
00:54:58,232 --> 00:54:59,099
Let it be so.

722
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:04,671
These people

723
00:55:06,273 --> 00:55:08,775
are neither physicians nor nurses.

724
00:55:11,345 --> 00:55:12,312
This man

725
00:55:13,747 --> 00:55:15,716
ran away, unable to endure
his master's beating,

726
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,019
and that woman has burn scars

727
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:20,621
from rejecting her master's advances.

728
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:23,156
That man failed to pay tenant fees,

729
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:26,326
and that man could not endure
the excessive labor demands.

730
00:55:27,394 --> 00:55:31,098
Despite all this, they did their part
in the quarantine village.

731
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:33,166
Thanks to them,

732
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:37,171
patients survived in a village

733
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:39,106
without medicine or food aid.

734
00:55:40,107 --> 00:55:41,508
They boiled medicinal
decoctions all day,

735
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,810
foraged for herbs in the wild,

736
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:46,914
cleaned up after the sick
and took care of them,

737
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:50,083
and even tended the dead
without hesitation.

738
00:55:51,518 --> 00:55:52,819
Yet you plan to send them back

739
00:55:56,623 --> 00:55:58,525
just like that?

740
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:02,229
With a merciful heart,

741
00:56:03,297 --> 00:56:05,365
please provide a way
for them to survive.

742
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,936
I earnestly plead with you.

743
00:56:13,407 --> 00:56:17,044
I shall consider this carefully
and handle it accordingly.

744
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:25,719
However,

745
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:32,559
why do you not defend yourself?

746
00:56:43,937 --> 00:56:44,905
I...

747
00:57:10,197 --> 00:57:11,832
have no grievances.

748
00:57:22,075 --> 00:57:24,578
Servant Goodeoki,
receive the royal decree.

749
00:57:40,327 --> 00:57:41,662
This is what the king proclaims.

750
00:57:42,062 --> 00:57:44,965
Servant Goodeoki disrupted
moral order and customs.

751
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:47,301
She is a grievous offender.

752
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:49,736
However,

753
00:57:49,736 --> 00:57:54,241
Chief and members of Cheongsu County's
Yuhyangso submitted a joint appeal.

754
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:58,579
Although she is guilty
of hiding her status,

755
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:02,416
she was a good and righteous person

756
00:58:02,416 --> 00:58:04,952
who showed kindness to the oppressed.

757
00:58:05,152 --> 00:58:08,655
Thus, we humbly petition Your Highness

758
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:13,460
to show her mercy.

759
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:18,198
We humbly plead.

760
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,435
Furthermore, the people
of Cheongsu County

761
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:23,770
risked their lives
to petition in protest.

762
00:58:30,644 --> 00:58:33,313
Please grant our wish.

763
00:58:33,313 --> 00:58:35,782
Are you aware
that protesting incurs flogging?

764
00:58:36,116 --> 00:58:37,918
We've already prepared to die for this.

765
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:51,498
I humbly beg Your Highness.

766
00:58:51,498 --> 00:58:53,967
She shows no regard for rank or class,

767
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:55,569
and has a kind heart.

768
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:58,839
She has always cared for our hardships.

769
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:02,509
Please, show compassion
and grant our plea.

770
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,846
This overwhelming support
from so many people

771
00:59:06,413 --> 00:59:08,615
reflects their sincere and noble hearts.

772
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:10,817
I am deeply moved.

773
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,287
Furthermore,

774
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:18,192
she volunteered
to enter the quarantine village,

775
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:19,993
uncovered the truth
of the strange disease,

776
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:24,231
and saved countless lives
that I failed to protect.

777
00:59:24,698 --> 00:59:28,335
Her merit and contribution
must be recognized.

778
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:30,804
Therefore, weighing her crimes
and merits carefully,

779
00:59:31,672 --> 00:59:32,940
Servant Goodeoki's

780
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:36,343
status as a slave is revoked.

781
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,107
Bak Jun Gi never revealed

782
01:00:07,107 --> 01:00:08,542
his superior, the Chief Minister.

783
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:20,187
Whether it was loyalty

784
01:00:20,187 --> 01:00:23,123
or resignation to death,
we can only speculate.

785
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:30,564
As for Kim So Hye,

786
01:00:30,564 --> 01:00:32,733
being the concubine of a traitor,

787
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:35,869
she was demoted to the lowest status
and became a government servant.

788
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:40,007
Her unborn child will
likely share the same fate.

789
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:44,211
There were twelve babies.

790
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:06,393
My child.

791
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:10,397
My dear child.

792
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:15,369
My daughter.

793
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:23,844
You have endured so much.

794
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,383
You have truly suffered.

795
01:02:31,385 --> 01:02:34,054
My poor Goodeoki.

796
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:36,924
Goodeoki was dragged back
with stones thrown at her,

797
01:02:38,759 --> 01:02:40,360
but she returned to a path of flowers

798
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:43,330
and reunited with her long-lost father.

799
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,332
How pitiful, my child.

800
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:52,506
Yun Gyeom.

801
01:02:54,374 --> 01:02:55,309
Did I

802
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,346
properly complete your novel?

803
01:03:13,427 --> 01:03:17,297
Yes, it is a perfect ending, Tae Young.

804
01:03:22,469 --> 01:03:24,471
(Aloe)

805
01:03:26,874 --> 01:03:29,042
Our Cheongsu County's pride,
the Aloe Festival,

806
01:03:29,042 --> 01:03:31,278
is already in its third year.

807
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:34,748
Expected visitors will likely triple
compared to last year.

808
01:03:36,016 --> 01:03:39,019
Who is in charge of
the product brochures?

809
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:40,854
That would be me, Chair Lady.

810
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:44,858
Please ensure the text is large
and easy to read at a glance.

811
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,661
Are we still negotiating
with performers?

812
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:50,597
The Flower Troupe is fully booked.

813
01:03:50,597 --> 01:03:53,433
Make sure to secure the deal.
Offer them more if needed.

814
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:54,501
Okay?

815
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:57,070
Madam,

816
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,941
would you be able to serve
as the product exhibition guide?

817
01:04:01,508 --> 01:04:03,110
If the Chair Lady wishes it,

818
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:06,313
I must oblige.

819
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:07,881
Thank you.

820
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:10,851
Please ensure everyone pays
close attention to their roles.

821
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:12,019
Understood?

822
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,921
Yes, ma'am.

823
01:04:17,057 --> 01:04:18,292
Migrants?

824
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:21,795
You propose we settle migrants
in Cheongsu County?

825
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:23,530
To create jobs,

826
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,333
expand farmland,
and grow the aloe enterprise.

827
01:04:27,634 --> 01:04:29,203
Business is fine,

828
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:32,472
but it might disrupt the order
and decorum of our customs.

829
01:04:32,472 --> 01:04:36,643
Why do you always oppose
my proposals so persistently?

830
01:04:36,643 --> 01:04:40,147
Am I not the Chief of Cheongsu County?

831
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:42,649
Don't you respect the previous Chief?

832
01:04:43,617 --> 01:04:45,285
What era are we in
to speak of respect to the prior?

833
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:47,221
Rather than bickering,

834
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:50,023
let us seek input
from Special Inspector Seong.

835
01:04:51,058 --> 01:04:53,393
Come in.

836
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:57,731
Our dashing Special Inspector Seong,
so radiant as always!

837
01:04:57,731 --> 01:04:59,066
How dazzling.

838
01:04:59,533 --> 01:05:03,070
The sound of your debate echoed
outside the Yuhyangso.

839
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:05,906
Why do you always raise
your voices in disputes?

840
01:05:05,906 --> 01:05:08,542
Your voice is louder than mine.

841
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:10,677
- Mine?
- Now.

842
01:05:10,677 --> 01:05:13,180
I have something to inform you both.

843
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:16,550
A royal decree
has arrived from the court.

844
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,419
It seems I must return to Hongmungwan.

845
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:20,854
I see.

846
01:05:22,723 --> 01:05:23,724
But...

847
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:29,263
There was vandalism
at your father-in-law's grave?

848
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:30,230
Yes.

849
01:05:30,464 --> 01:05:32,966
They say they will move the grave
within the year.

850
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,602
They may say otherwise later,

851
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:38,172
so be sure to get a written pledge
with the exact date.

852
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:39,573
Yes.

853
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:43,577
By law, property sales

854
01:05:43,577 --> 01:05:45,679
cannot be changed after fifteen days,

855
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:48,448
so if you want to cancel the contract,
you must file a petition

856
01:05:48,448 --> 01:05:50,717
- by the day after tomorrow.
- Yes.

857
01:05:51,318 --> 01:05:52,553
Next.

858
01:06:00,928 --> 01:06:02,229
It has been a while.

859
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:04,798
What brings you here?

860
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,067
Are you here to take something again?

861
01:06:07,534 --> 01:06:08,635
Hello, sir.

862
01:06:08,836 --> 01:06:10,170
That is not it.

863
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:13,540
I have opened a large
legal advocate office in Hanyang,

864
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,742
I was wondering if you would like
to work together.

865
01:06:15,742 --> 01:06:17,044
I am not interested.

866
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:19,379
I was not asking you.

867
01:06:24,918 --> 01:06:26,053
What do you think?

868
01:06:30,457 --> 01:06:31,325
Me?

869
01:06:38,498 --> 01:06:39,967
Peek-a-boo.

870
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:44,137
My goodness, how fair and pale.

871
01:06:44,137 --> 01:06:46,440
That is why we named her
Baekyi, remember?

872
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:50,010
Who did she take after
to look this beautiful?

873
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,779
Who else?
She took after her pretty mother.

874
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:59,419
Baekyi, you cry
only when you are with your mother,

875
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:02,456
but you stop crying right away
when with Mak Sim.

876
01:07:02,456 --> 01:07:03,724
Exactly.

877
01:07:04,024 --> 01:07:05,692
She must think I am her mother.

878
01:07:06,493 --> 01:07:08,695
I told Baekyi to be born
as a noble in her next life,

879
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:10,998
and look at her now, a noble young lady.

880
01:07:10,998 --> 01:07:12,366
Baekyi, let us go.

881
01:07:13,066 --> 01:07:14,801
I will go visit my brother-in-law now.

882
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:17,771
If our Baekyi catches a cold,
it is trouble.

883
01:07:17,771 --> 01:07:20,941
That is true.
You go on peacefully with your husband.

884
01:07:21,275 --> 01:07:23,110
We will look after the young lady here.

885
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,715
Look at this.

886
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:31,318
Here, take this.

887
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:34,488
- Father.
- My goodness.

888
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:36,356
- Man Seok.
- Man Seok.

889
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:38,492
- Mom is here.
- Uncle is here.

890
01:07:41,028 --> 01:07:43,530
- Was it hard watching the baby?
- Not at all.

891
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:45,365
You are so well-behaved.

892
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:48,569
Our Man Seok really took
after his father and mother.

893
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:52,639
Man Seok is growing so fast, Tae Young.

894
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:54,808
He is so heavy.
I can hardly carry him anymore.

895
01:07:54,808 --> 01:07:56,310
Our Man Seok.

896
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,411
My goodness.

897
01:07:57,945 --> 01:08:00,013
By the way, where is Yun Gyeom?

898
01:08:00,013 --> 01:08:01,014
Inside.

899
01:08:01,448 --> 01:08:03,517
Yun Gyeom, we are here!

900
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,188
- You are here.
- Yes.

901
01:08:08,188 --> 01:08:09,990
You must be tired
from your long journey.

902
01:08:10,457 --> 01:08:12,492
I have some great news.

903
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:15,696
I've been appointed to a government post
and will be moving to Hanyang.

904
01:08:15,696 --> 01:08:18,765
Really? That is wonderful news.

905
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:20,868
Have you finished your manuscript?

906
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:22,970
Yes.

907
01:08:23,904 --> 01:08:25,405
I have finally completed it.

908
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:41,421
You will not execute me at night,

909
01:08:42,322 --> 01:08:43,390
so what brings you here?

910
01:08:51,365 --> 01:08:52,299
What?

911
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,109
The Deputy Chief granted permission.

912
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:06,780
Hurry and change clothes
so you can leave.

913
01:09:13,587 --> 01:09:16,957
Are you saying you'll be executed
in my place?

914
01:09:19,793 --> 01:09:22,396
What kind of absurd act is this?

915
01:09:24,131 --> 01:09:27,067
Do you think I will just leave
with a simple thank you?

916
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:30,737
I once thought I could change the world.

917
01:09:31,772 --> 01:09:32,739
I

918
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:35,442
was arrogant.

919
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:38,245
If your thoughts had changed,
you should have returned home!

920
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:39,713
I did go.

921
01:09:41,448 --> 01:09:42,349
But

922
01:09:43,684 --> 01:09:45,519
that was not my place anymore.

923
01:09:51,191 --> 01:09:52,459
"I will protect you."

924
01:09:53,093 --> 01:09:54,661
"I will be your refuge."

925
01:09:55,095 --> 01:09:56,363
"I will return."

926
01:09:57,764 --> 01:10:00,334
I could not keep a single one
of those promises I made.

927
01:10:09,476 --> 01:10:10,577
So I have

928
01:10:12,112 --> 01:10:13,614
one final request.

929
01:10:15,249 --> 01:10:16,183
Allow me

930
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:19,353
to keep my last promise.

931
01:10:20,954 --> 01:10:22,322
Please help me,

932
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:25,893
so Do Gyeom

933
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:28,862
does not lose his brother again.

934
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:37,304
I used my last breath to come here.

935
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:39,873
So please

936
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:42,276
return home

937
01:10:44,378 --> 01:10:46,413
and live happily in my stead.

938
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:43,303
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

939
01:11:47,474 --> 01:11:48,609
How does it feel?

940
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:54,448
Many sacrifices were made
to reach this point.

941
01:11:55,782 --> 01:11:59,286
Thanks to them,
I have achieved my dream.

942
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:02,723
Living by the sea with my father.

943
01:12:06,793 --> 01:12:07,861
Is that all?

944
01:12:08,395 --> 01:12:11,465
You have a wonderful husband
and a cute son too.

945
01:12:12,432 --> 01:12:14,935
But why did it take you so long?

946
01:12:14,935 --> 01:12:16,370
It took you three years.

947
01:12:16,603 --> 01:12:19,573
Well, there was so much to revise
in the beginning.

948
01:12:19,573 --> 01:12:22,976
Writing in prison caused utter chaos.

949
01:12:22,976 --> 01:12:24,378
You are always so lazy.

950
01:12:25,946 --> 01:12:27,181
You are always nagging.

951
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:29,216
Do you think I ever have time?

952
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,385
Because of our busy Legal Advocate,

953
01:12:31,385 --> 01:12:34,054
I am stuck with childcare
and your father.

954
01:12:34,054 --> 01:12:36,290
Fine, I get it.

955
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:43,130
By the way, when Man Seok gets excited,
he seems

956
01:12:43,463 --> 01:12:45,332
just like a celestial storyteller.

957
01:12:45,332 --> 01:12:47,267
Don't even joke about that.

958
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:50,337
Man Seok will ace the state exam
and become an official.

959
01:12:52,506 --> 01:12:53,907
Now that you mention it,

960
01:12:54,341 --> 01:12:57,845
studying for the exam with you
was very challenging.

961
01:12:57,845 --> 01:12:58,745
What!

962
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:02,683
It must have been very tough
for my younger brother.

963
01:13:17,364 --> 01:13:18,665
Man Seok.

964
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:19,933
Man Seok.
