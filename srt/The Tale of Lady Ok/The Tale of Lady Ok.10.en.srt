00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,071
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,982
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,056
I loved someone before our marriage.

5
00:00:56,924 --> 00:01:00,060
He was an artist
who comforted many people.

6
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,129
And

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,499
he sneezed from pine pollen.

8
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:06,767
Pardon?

9
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,979
My goodness.

10
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:22,583
When did you figure it out?
It was when I hummed?

11
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,686
It slipped it out, so I knew it.

12
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,187
Memory loss?

13
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,423
You treat this like a joke?

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,826
I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,529
What about your performance in Qing?

16
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:38,131
Do not worry about that.
I have postponed it.

17
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:42,936
You have to play along.

18
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,239
The Director passed away.

19
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,608
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,843
It was the royal order to go to Qing.

21
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:52,813
He knew there was no way back.

22
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,617
Yet, he sacrificed everything
to protect you.

23
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,319
He "killed" himself for you.

24
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,054
Why didn't you stop him?

25
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,856
How could you just let this happen?

26
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,192
How could I stop it?
It was three to one.

27
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,326
Three to one?

28
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,397
Huh? I thought you said
you found everything out.

29
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:14,434
Don't tell me the Young Master
and Dokki planned it together.

30
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:15,969
Huh?

31
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,043
It will be fine.

32
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:24,912
It's likely Tae Young hasn't found out.

33
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,113
That is not true.

34
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,017
She said, "Dokki, call
for the Elder Master to come."

35
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,084
Goodness.

36
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,391
- Look. He is here.
- My goodness.

37
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,098
How did it go?

38
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,238
- I got caught totally.
- Oh, no.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,343
Your face looks pale,
as if you came back from the dead.

40
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,011
It seems you got scolded badly.

41
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,479
It was severe.

42
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,783
I nearly wet myself
from how much she scolded me.

43
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,252
What did she say?

44
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,388
As we expected.

45
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:10,357
- She told me to leave.
- No.

46
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,794
No, that cannot happen.
I will go and talk to her myself.

47
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,596
Don't.

48
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,365
She doesn't know we were all in this.

49
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,801
I told her it's me who deceived you,

50
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,569
so be careful not to get caught.

51
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,606
Huh? I now just wish
she knows everything.

52
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:28,308
I kept quiet to avoid slipping it out,

53
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,244
and it feels like I have mold
in my mouth from holding it in.

54
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,679
My heart races, worrying
when she will figure everything out.

55
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,781
This is killing me.

56
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,718
What if Mak Sim finds out
she has been deceived?

57
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,952
Finds out about what?

58
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,522
I'm startled.

59
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,658
What are you hiding,
acting so suspicious?

60
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,062
If you don't tell me,
I will go tell the Madam.

61
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,163
Where is she now?

62
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,032
Madam!

63
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,600
- Hey!
- Mak Sim.

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,169
- Stop it.
- Lift her.

65
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:56,303
Please, I beg you.

66
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,077
My goodness.

67
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,749
Oh my.

68
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,620
How can two people look
so identical, like a mold cast?

69
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,988
When I first met him,

70
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,990
I thought the world was deceiving me.

71
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,991
That's right.

72
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,394
My apologies.

73
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:24,731
You are him, right? The man
who gave our lady the Gat Ornament.

74
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,466
Artist, Chon Seung Hwi.

75
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,236
Do you know me?

76
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,604
Of course.

77
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,940
My Baekyi liked you so much.

78
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,511
Anyway, Mak Sim,
you must keep this a secret.

79
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,681
Sure. I didn't hear anything.

80
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,218
Staying here might get us caught,
so I will take my leave.

81
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,219
- Yes.
- Yes.

82
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,691
My goodness, look at that.
Even their walking is the same.

83
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:51,959
Amazing.

84
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,329
Show me this.

85
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,032
How much is this?

86
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,403
Here, this way.

87
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,365
You are here, dear.

88
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,902
I thought you went back home in anger.

89
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:39,239
A guest is here.

90
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,607
A guest?

91
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,513
Huh?

92
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:50,684
You...

93
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,029
Where is everyone?

94
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,232
I am always running errands,

95
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,435
but I feel like I am the last
to know important matters.

96
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,737
This is strange.

97
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,060
Hey, why did you come here?

98
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,895
Mind your own business.

99
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,597
Who are you?

100
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:37,731
Me?

101
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:42,302
I am a member of
Director Chon Seung Hwi's household.

102
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:46,006
I am also the leader
of the Yudam troupe, Man Seok.

103
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,207
And my hobby is...

104
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,475
- Enough.
- Okay.

105
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,812
Where did you first meet?

106
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,581
Answer me at the same time.

107
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,116
One, two, three.

108
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:57,284
- Ikcheon.
- Ikcheon.

109
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,686
Ikcheon.

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,457
Did you plan everything
after meeting there?

111
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:06,894
No, it was just a coincidence.
We ran into each other there.

112
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,429
Explain in detail.

113
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:15,135
Man Seok said Yun Gyeom was in Qing,

114
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:16,270
so we went to Qing.

115
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,672
In Qing, I ate something bad

116
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,142
and got severe diarrhea.
I was vomiting with loose bowels.

117
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,378
- That bad?
- You have no idea.

118
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:26,813
I have so much to tell you,
and I was just...

119
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,681
What is it?

120
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,883
- Read the room.
- Read what?

121
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:30,851
Then what?

122
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:34,521
You failed to meet your brother in Qing,
so you planned this?

123
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,192
No, I met him.

124
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,063
Then why hasn't
the Elder Master returned?

125
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,370
Can you recognize me?

126
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,707
Yun Gyeom.

127
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:56,743
Let's go home.

128
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,821
Yun Gyeom.

129
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,526
Why are you doing this, Yun Gyeom?

130
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:17,698
Did you also turn away
and ignore Tae Young like this?

131
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,501
Keep it down.

132
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,706
If we are found out now,

133
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:29,510
everything I prepared could go to waste.

134
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,612
What are you preparing?

135
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,213
Don't try to find out more.

136
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,753
Is this why you haven't returned
for seven years?

137
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:42,256
Even if the cause is important,

138
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,892
how can the eldest son
abandon the family?

139
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:46,894
Father

140
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,364
has passed away, Yun Gyeom.

141
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:57,037
So please come home.

142
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,373
Tae Young is suffering greatly.

143
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:05,546
(Seong Yun Gyeom)

144
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,117
I'm not Seong Yun Gyeom.

145
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,254
I have no wife, no brother,

146
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:16,957
and no father.

147
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,059
What did you say?

148
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:27,968
I can't go back home anymore.

149
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:33,207
Your brother is dead.

150
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,810
Live on thinking like this.

151
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,820
(Seong Yun Gyeom)

152
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,357
On the way back,
I met the Director again.

153
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:53,994
The Director and I were
about to go perform in Qing.

154
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:59,199
Stopping by the inn for some rice soup
sounds perfect.

155
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,367
- Oh.
- Oh.

156
00:10:01,502 --> 00:10:02,736
How did it go?

157
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:04,104
Well...

158
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,675
It seems he didn't meet him.

159
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:11,311
No, he met him,
but he refused to come back with us.

160
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,046
Huh? Why?

161
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,515
Come in, Dokki.

162
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,116
- Let us go too.
- Well.

163
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,217
Wait.

164
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,186
Could you please help us?

165
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,854
- Hey!
- You are her friend.

166
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,657
Could you just show up
for a moment, please?

167
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,259
If everyone sees Yun Gyeom is alive,

168
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:27,194
Madam Tae Young will avoid widowhood.

169
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,830
Stop the nonsense and leave.
Go! Go inside!

170
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,998
Dokki.

171
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,833
- What is he even saying?
- Wait.

172
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,902
Go. Don't look back. Just go.

173
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,871
- Man Seok.
- Yes?

174
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,507
Let us postpone the performance.

175
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,009
You know that is impossible.

176
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:44,044
How can I delay the royal order?

177
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,412
This is not like last time

178
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:48,615
when a few days' delay led
to just a few lashes.

179
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:51,385
If I go to explain,
I will face execution.

180
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,986
Do you wish for my death?

181
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,855
You go tell them, and I will "die."

182
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,023
I must "die."

183
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:56,990
Huh?

184
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,392
Not you, but me.

185
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,662
If I "die", we cannot perform.

186
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,230
They will understand.

187
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,932
What a horrible thing to say.

188
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:07,467
No, wait...

189
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:09,203
Are you serious?

190
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,238
You will fake your death and go with us?

191
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:14,074
There is no other way.

192
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,611
Can't the performance
be postponed for a while?

193
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:20,581
It is a royal order.
It cannot be delayed, my lord.

194
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,416
Please stop him. I beg you.

195
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:26,053
That is too much to ask.

196
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:29,656
If he offers to help,
just let him do so.

197
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,225
Stop it already!

198
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:33,227
Do you think this is some kind of joke?

199
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,128
Do I look like I am joking to you?

200
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,164
I am doing this because I am desperate!

201
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,366
Your words alone are
a great comfort to me.

202
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,302
I will return and protect Tae Young
as best as I can.

203
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,971
Please leave before it is too late.

204
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,405
Let us go now.

205
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,940
Get up now, please!

206
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,543
If we miss our boat,
it is all over for us.

207
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,011
Please, Director!

208
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,113
Please pull yourself together!

209
00:11:56,083 --> 00:12:00,287
This is my own choice.
Don't let it be your burden.

210
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,191
Honestly,

211
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:08,295
I don't understand why you'd go
this far, even as a friend.

212
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,434
I loved her

213
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,571
long before she married your brother.

214
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:26,480
Hearing about her suffering,
I couldn't bear to just stand by.

215
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:29,983
Are you truly okay with this?

216
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,521
It is settled then!

217
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,891
Mak Sim, we are taking the Master home!

218
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,961
What if we get caught?

219
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:44,031
You know we will be all dead
if that happens, right?

220
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:47,501
Well, if I say he is my brother,

221
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:50,871
why would anyone suspect?

222
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,408
Yes, they look identical.
How will anyone tell them apart?

223
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:57,110
Acting as someone else is my profession.

224
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,478
I can do it without getting caught.

225
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,815
But you can't fool Madam Tae Young.

226
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:04,351
If she asks why you were gone
for seven years,

227
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,819
what would you say?

228
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,421
Does anyone here know?

229
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,257
Just say it is memory loss.

230
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,193
Be reasonable, will you?

231
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,862
You keep being annoying.

232
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:16,630
- Let go!
- You little...

233
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,765
But there is a problem.

234
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,302
If I remember correctly, Tae Young said

235
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:25,539
my brother has a scar on his shoulder.

236
00:13:25,539 --> 00:13:28,208
But I'm not sure what it looks like.

237
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,211
See? That won't do.

238
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,214
She will check your shoulder right away.
What will you do then?

239
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,250
Just make any mark there.

240
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,985
- Do you think that will work?
- Why not?

241
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,152
It is not a scar.

242
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:41,255
It is a brand.

243
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:44,258
Luckily, I know what it looks like.

244
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,693
The character, "heart."

245
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:51,298
Here.

246
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,904
You are going too far.

247
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,372
What do you expect me

248
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,541
to do with this?

249
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,109
Take it to my father.

250
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,810
Tell him the body

251
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,215
was not found.

252
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:11,818
Thanks to Goodeoki,

253
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,788
I saw my father's face once more,
and that is enough.

254
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,558
Take good care of him.

255
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:19,459
I entrust this to you.

256
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,994
How can you go this far?

257
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:24,231
How can you have no regrets
about Chon Seung Hwi?

258
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,001
Did a life as an artist
mean nothing to you?

259
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:34,274
Goodeoki holds
a greater meaning in my life.

260
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:43,150
Please reconsider it. I beg you.

261
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,553
If I hesitate,
I might not be able to leave.

262
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:48,989
Goodness.

263
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,492
What about me?

264
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,094
If you live as Seong Yun Gyeom,

265
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,599
that means you will never see me again.

266
00:14:58,599 --> 00:15:00,367
I can come to visit you.

267
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,036
Stop crying.

268
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:05,706
Enough.

269
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:10,410
This one.

270
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,181
Are you sure about this?

271
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:17,684
If it's done, there is no turning back.

272
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:21,321
I'm doing this not to turn back.

273
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,341
The man who abandoned his family
for his own goals is not my brother.

274
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:44,244
The man who sacrificed his life for you

275
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,147
is my true brother.

276
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,815
Thank you so much.

277
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,117
Indeed.

278
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,352
Who in this world
could do something like this?

279
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,822
Without you coming,
we might have buried the wrong man

280
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,891
and spent a lifetime in mourning,

281
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,227
not being able to be a legal advocate.

282
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,496
Madam, don't worry too much.

283
00:16:02,863 --> 00:16:05,499
Even after the banquet,
we didn't get caught.

284
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:08,235
We won't get caught, Tae Young.

285
00:16:08,235 --> 00:16:10,871
As far as I am concerned,
he is my brother.

286
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,743
Your kindness towards me

287
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,414
leaves me deeply grateful.

288
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:23,951
But,

289
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:27,821
I cannot accept this.

290
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:29,323
Well,

291
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:33,260
are you going to send him away
when he has nowhere to go?

292
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,262
How can I?

293
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,967
Because of me,
he gave up his lifelong dream.

294
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,736
So to be fair,
I must give up everything too.

295
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,441
As soon as things are settled here,

296
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,577
I will leave Cheongsu County.

297
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,745
- What?
- Madam.

298
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:54,214
You worked so hard to build this family,

299
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:55,749
and now you are leaving?

300
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:56,917
Exactly.

301
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,820
How hard we worked to build this family.

302
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:02,289
As the head of the family,

303
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,292
I must prevent the family
from being ruined.

304
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:09,396
The entire family cannot live
a false life together.

305
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:15,035
I have lived as a daughter-in-law
with no shame before my father-in-law.

306
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,839
I have lived as a wife with no shame
before my husband.

307
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,041
In any circumstance,

308
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,210
I have done my duty with pride.

309
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:27,814
Yet I allowed a man
who is not my husband into my room.

310
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,049
Tae Young, that was my...

311
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,920
From now on, I leave the family
in your hands, Do Gyeom.

312
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:38,258
Tae Young.

313
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,127
Stop restoring the legal office.

314
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,195
This place

315
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,598
should remain closed.

316
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,502
- Tae Young.
- Madam.

317
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:50,804
Do something.

318
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,707
Tae Young.

319
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,110
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

320
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,745
Forgive you?

321
00:17:59,713 --> 00:18:01,748
You went this far because of me,

322
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,750
but you are actually a bad liar.

323
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,153
How hard it must have been to hide this.

324
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,292
You may leave, Tae Young.

325
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,831
I never imagined a life without you,

326
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:21,802
but if this is what you truly want,
I will gladly let you go.

327
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:26,006
If it is a choice that brings you joy,
I will support it.

328
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:28,575
But if you are leaving out of duty

329
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,878
or fear of harming the family,

330
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,413
I cannot allow it.

331
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:37,451
I understand what you mean.

332
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,658
I am deeply sorry for causing you pain.

333
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:48,362
I am truly sorry
for acting without consent.

334
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,567
Mi Ryeong will see.

335
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,035
I understand, so stop.

336
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:01,842
You are eating with relish.

337
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,145
Is there a beggar in your stomach?

338
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:08,815
So tell me. You're here
to get caught, right?

339
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,751
She had already found out
before I arrived.

340
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,352
Right. Madam noticed

341
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,454
and sent Kkeutdongi to Hanyang.

342
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,791
My goodness, it seems
she truly intends to leave.

343
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,394
What if she does?
It might actually be better.

344
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:23,997
Living in constant fear of being caught
is far worse than her leaving.

345
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,132
Right.

346
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:27,367
Rather than staying in Cheongsu County
and see the family ruined...

347
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,571
Better to travel the land
and find happiness.

348
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:32,339
- Agreed!
- Absolutely!

349
00:19:32,906 --> 00:19:35,042
- Yes, indeed.
- Indeed, yes.

350
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,278
- Truly wonderful.
- Absolutely wonderful.

351
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,549
- Ongheya.
- Ongheya.

352
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,351
Hey.

353
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,421
Why are you playing along with Mak Sim
when it is your first meeting?

354
00:19:47,955 --> 00:19:50,524
Would you join me on this journey?

355
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:52,059
- Huh?
- My goodness.

356
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,228
Where to?

357
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,762
Throughout the whole country.

358
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:59,032
I am the Director's servant
and will serve him for life.

359
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,068
And you?

360
00:20:01,068 --> 00:20:03,036
My goodness, you are right!

361
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,974
I am the Madam's servant,
so I must go with her.

362
00:20:06,974 --> 00:20:07,908
Right.

363
00:20:08,342 --> 00:20:10,077
What are you saying, Mak Sim?

364
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,044
I will pack my things.

365
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,379
Are you out of your mind?

366
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:15,749
Stay where you are.

367
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,351
I will rip out your tongue.

368
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:18,485
I am eating.

369
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:20,120
Hand the bowl over.

370
00:20:23,924 --> 00:20:24,791
Dear.

371
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,727
Who are you calling dear?

372
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,630
What should I call you then? Goodeoki?

373
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,732
While we are here,
I must use respectful terms.

374
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,268
How could you commit
such an undutiful thing?

375
00:20:34,835 --> 00:20:37,171
Have you thought about
how your father would feel?

376
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:41,475
Why do you always put others
before yourself?

377
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:44,378
You are the one
who gave up your life for others.

378
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:48,348
Three times.

379
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,584
I asked you to leave
with me three times.

380
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:52,486
You refused me three times. Why?

381
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,956
Because your precious family is here

382
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,124
along with your dream.

383
00:20:58,258 --> 00:20:59,960
I thought you were trapped here.

384
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,363
But no. It was that this place was
more precious to you than I was.

385
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,801
That is why I came.

386
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,536
To help you protect
what is precious to you.

387
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,473
I can give up everything
as long as I have you.

388
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,877
I told you I did not want that.

389
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:20,047
Even if you do not, what can we do?
There's no turning back.

390
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:21,181
Fine.

391
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:24,218
You must be happy now,
as we can finally leave together.

392
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:27,321
Chon Seung Hwi who faked his death

393
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,023
and Goodeoki, a runaway slave,
they can be together forever.

394
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:31,525
What a happy life it will be.

395
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,560
If we don't kill each other first.

396
00:21:34,061 --> 00:21:36,864
Then don't leave.

397
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:39,399
Everything you care about is here.

398
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:40,868
Just because I care,

399
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:43,136
I have to leave.

400
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:46,139
Do you think lying
and hiding is an easy life?

401
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:49,009
Even my single lie is a grave sin.

402
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:50,744
How could I put my family

403
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,547
in such danger as well?

404
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,885
Fine.

405
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:01,755
Let us say you visit the family
from time to time.

406
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,223
What about being a legal advocate?

407
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,127
Can you truly give up being
a legal advocate?

408
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,101
After all,

409
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:18,238
that dream belonged
to the real Lady Tae Young.

410
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,714
Why did you give this to my husband?

411
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:31,952
Were you trying to kill him?

412
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:35,155
Yes.

413
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,093
He is what Ok Tae Young cares
for the most.

414
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,729
A brother-in-law she raised like a son

415
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:44,798
who passed first
in the state examination.

416
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,801
How could you...

417
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,404
Failing to tear her apart physically,

418
00:22:50,404 --> 00:22:51,872
I wanted to tear her heart

419
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,907
to show her what living in hell means...

420
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,275
Please stop!

421
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,919
- Do you have no arms?
- Right.

422
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,088
You talk so much. Is this yours?

423
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,324
Have you seen Mi Ryeong?

424
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:12,826
No, isn't she inside?

425
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,196
Isn't Mi Ryeong in her room?

426
00:23:16,196 --> 00:23:17,564
No, she's not.

427
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,133
She is nowhere in the house.

428
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:22,836
It seems she went to her family home.

429
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,439
We were all at the legal office,

430
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:26,507
so no one knows.

431
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:28,976
- I will ask the servants.
- Right.

432
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:31,678
No, it's late. I will go myself.

433
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:35,482
Kkeutdongi, do you know
where the Young Madam is?

434
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,618
Well...

435
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,588
What is it? What happened?

436
00:23:42,222 --> 00:23:45,425
The Young Madam has been taken away.

437
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,862
What do you mean? Why?

438
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,097
Well...

439
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:53,000
The Young Madam is said
to have killed her mother.

440
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,809
What are you talking about? Murder?

441
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:04,745
Well.

442
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:09,683
It is about the Young Madam.

443
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:13,353
They said she killed her own mother.

444
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:14,188
Huh?

445
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:16,723
I do not understand it, either,

446
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,125
but they said her mother

447
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:21,595
returned seeking revenge on the Madam.

448
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:26,600
And the Young Madam
deliberately approached her husband

449
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,835
and married him.

450
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:29,636
But the thing is

451
00:24:30,437 --> 00:24:33,674
the husband knew nothing about it.

452
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,983
She tried to confess everything.

453
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,485
She wanted to confess and leave,
but I stopped her.

454
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,988
She approached me on purpose.

455
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,524
She must have had no feelings for me.

456
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:52,693
She confessed so easily

457
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:56,230
and said she would leave just as easily.

458
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,331
Yun Gyeom.

459
00:24:57,331 --> 00:25:00,767
Do you think
she really committed murder?

460
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,272
When the sun rises,

461
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:08,609
I will find out exactly what happened.

462
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,544
I won't go.

463
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:13,881
Yun Gyeom.

464
00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:02,229
(Cheongsu County)

465
00:26:02,863 --> 00:26:04,198
Is it Lady Song?

466
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,066
No.

467
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,535
It is the body from the reexamination.

468
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:10,070
Oh.

469
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:15,175
A slave brand was found
on the battered face

470
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:17,144
during the reexamination

471
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:20,380
Could it be...

472
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,085
Dol Seok?

473
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:28,188
It was Dol Seok.

474
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,091
It must be Lady Song's doing.

475
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:34,595
The person who branded him
was Lady Song.

476
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:37,097
I know. I received
an anonymous letter yesterday.

477
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:43,136
The body belonged to Dol Seok,
a servant of Lady Song.

478
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,206
Lady Song killed Dol Seok out of hatred.

479
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:49,142
So we went to arrest her,

480
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:54,348
but she was already dead.

481
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,550
How is your health?

482
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,889
Now Do Gyeom

483
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,493
must know everything.

484
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:48,468
I no longer wish to live.

485
00:27:49,469 --> 00:27:50,804
Why

486
00:27:52,206 --> 00:27:54,107
did you go to see your mother alone?

487
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,778
Tell me.

488
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:00,214
Confess everything to me.

489
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:07,988
My mother...

490
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:12,793
She gave poison to Do Gyeom.

491
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:18,198
She planned to kill both Do Gyeom
and his elder brother.

492
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:24,571
But that was not all.

493
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:28,375
Mother.

494
00:28:30,711 --> 00:28:31,745
My child.

495
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:53,400
How did you find this place?

496
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:56,470
A wretch who should have died long ago

497
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,807
is still alive after clinging to
Ok Tae Young.

498
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:01,975
How could...

499
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,479
How could a person do such a thing?

500
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:07,114
How could you...

501
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:23,263
This is a handkerchief
with Seong Yun Gyeom's name.

502
00:29:26,733 --> 00:29:29,469
But this man has a brand on his face.

503
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,606
If we destroy his face,
it will solve everything.

504
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,711
They killed all the people

505
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:42,049
in the mountain village?

506
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,824
So,

507
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:53,594
is that why you killed your mother?

508
00:29:55,729 --> 00:29:56,663
Yes.

509
00:29:56,897 --> 00:29:57,898
How?

510
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:03,237
I gave her poison.

511
00:30:08,709 --> 00:30:09,610
No.

512
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,678
Your mother

513
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:14,848
was strangled.

514
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:18,986
Even if you hated her,

515
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:21,822
how could you go so far?

516
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:22,823
What...

517
00:30:23,557 --> 00:30:26,994
What drove you to such cruelty?

518
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:28,729
What has tormented you

519
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:31,965
so deeply?

520
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,838
It should have all been mine.

521
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:41,909
Everything should have been mine.

522
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,120
Mother.

523
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,821
Do Gwang.

524
00:30:57,457 --> 00:30:59,226
If my son had lived,

525
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:02,629
I would have been there.

526
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:24,318
If my son had lived,

527
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:28,722
I would have been happy.

528
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:42,870
I was so envious.

529
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:47,841
Because of her,
I lost my son and live in torment,

530
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,746
while she, reunited with her husband,

531
00:31:53,547 --> 00:31:56,750
was so happy, so I couldn't endure it.

532
00:32:06,226 --> 00:32:07,861
Stop it now, Mother.

533
00:32:09,062 --> 00:32:10,197
Even my brother

534
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:13,500
would wish for that.

535
00:32:22,242 --> 00:32:23,844
Please stop me.

536
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:28,282
I cannot stop myself anymore.

537
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:36,056
Come to the authorities with me
and confess, Mother.

538
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:40,894
If you reveal the Magistrate's crimes,
they will show leniency.

539
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:46,300
I will do everything I can
as a legal advocate for you.

540
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:49,002
Whether exiled or imprisoned,

541
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:52,739
I will serve you forever, Mother.

542
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:08,322
Very well, I will do that.

543
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:11,325
But first,

544
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,962
could you fetch some water for me?

545
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:33,814
That was

546
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:37,284
the last time I saw my mother.

547
00:33:38,986 --> 00:33:40,754
When I returned with the water,

548
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,024
she had already passed.

549
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,731
Perhaps it is for the best.

550
00:33:52,533 --> 00:33:54,334
It is all over now.

551
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:00,207
My mother must now be at peace.

552
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,345
So I will take the punishment

553
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:10,083
for her sins.

554
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:14,454
No.

555
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:19,693
Your brother already bore
the punishment for your parents.

556
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,831
Do you think I will stand by

557
00:34:28,836 --> 00:34:30,437
and let you take it too?

558
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:43,183
So the Magistrate conspired with
Inspector Baek's wife to kill a slave,

559
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:46,687
and falsely claimed him
as Lady Ok's husband and made her a widow?

560
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:47,688
Yes.

561
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:49,034
They likely did it to earn
the virtuous arch

562
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:51,091
and boost their appraisal scores.

563
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:54,628
But Inspector Baek's wife insisted
it was not revenge.

564
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,397
However, I heard her daughter
was not the killer.

565
00:34:57,397 --> 00:35:00,434
- Who was it, then? The Magistrate?
- Let me go, you fools!

566
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:02,936
- We do not know.
- Why are you arresting an innocent man?

567
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,672
Once he is taken in,
all accomplices will be revealed.

568
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:06,640
Let go!

569
00:35:08,842 --> 00:35:09,943
Is this a spectacle?

570
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:12,346
Get lost, you all!

571
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:14,948
How dare you shout
after committing murder!

572
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:17,451
Who says I committed murder?
Who dares...

573
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:18,685
Let go!

574
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:20,354
Let me go.

575
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:31,965
Madam...

576
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,636
Legal advocate! Please defend me!

577
00:35:36,236 --> 00:35:38,672
I found a legal advocate. Let me go!

578
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:42,543
Will you help me?

579
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:44,912
You said we should reconcile.
You forgave everything.

580
00:35:45,879 --> 00:35:46,847
I refuse.

581
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,116
You wretched woman...

582
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:54,521
Madam, please help me.

583
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,123
Madam, I beg you!

584
00:35:57,524 --> 00:35:59,526
For the sake of my ties to you,

585
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:04,097
if I must highlight your crimes,

586
00:36:04,097 --> 00:36:06,033
Penal Code Article 420.

587
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:08,001
Unlawful detention and interrogation.

588
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,604
Ho Code Article 104,
destruction of another's property.

589
00:36:10,604 --> 00:36:12,472
Penal Code Article 407, arson.

590
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:13,340
And...

591
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:19,980
Penal Code Article 305, murder.

592
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:22,316
Execution by dismemberment.

593
00:36:25,485 --> 00:36:26,253
No.

594
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:28,522
No.

595
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:32,092
No!

596
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:43,704
Let us go now.

597
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:53,146
Let us go together.

598
00:36:53,146 --> 00:36:54,515
Why are you walking so fast?

599
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,887
While we are together,

600
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:02,589
I must act as your husband, right?

601
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:05,392
How could I let my wife go alone

602
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,661
to such a dangerous crime scene?

603
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:10,597
I am good at fighting now.
I can protect you too.

604
00:37:10,597 --> 00:37:13,667
Once this is resolved,
I will leave Cheongsu County.

605
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:17,404
Your first case was
about your sister-in-law's brother

606
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,806
and your last case is about her.

607
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:21,241
How meaningful.

608
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:25,746
While you are here, could you act
as the eldest son of the Seong family?

609
00:37:26,213 --> 00:37:28,849
Anything you need, just say it.

610
00:37:31,552 --> 00:37:34,888
Could you console Yun Gyeom?

611
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:50,170
So, this is a poison wine, right?

612
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,506
Did I almost die?

613
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:54,074
Yes.

614
00:37:54,074 --> 00:37:57,945
Living as Ok Tae Young's husband
is no easy task, right?

615
00:38:09,723 --> 00:38:10,657
Where are you going? Why?

616
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:13,961
Why? What are you looking at?
What is it?

617
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,368
Huh?

618
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:24,238
Why? What is it?

619
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,649
The soldiers who came to arrest Lady Song
after receiving the report

620
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,318
should have come that way.

621
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,157
But

622
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,760
why are there footprints here?

623
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:55,569
And at the time of the murder,
the Magistrate was in his office.

624
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:59,239
But he could have ordered
someone else to do it.

625
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:01,909
Who would follow
such an order so easily?

626
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:05,345
Why not? Many people would do it
if money is involved.

627
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:08,649
The overseer.

628
00:39:09,783 --> 00:39:11,718
Wouldn't the overseer do it?

629
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:18,458
What is that?

630
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:20,194
Wait.

631
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,576
Whose item is this?

632
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:37,611
Seem not to belong to the overseer.

633
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:46,587
I noticed this ring during the banquet.

634
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:49,656
The chief lady was wearing it,
but it is mine.

635
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:52,125
What? Did you steal it?

636
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:55,462
No, I received it from that woman.

637
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:57,998
What exactly did she give it to you for?

638
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:03,136
- Well, that is...
- Why did you go to Lady Song's house?

639
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:05,272
Did you go there?

640
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:08,408
This ring was found at her house.

641
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,990
I heard you were isolating yourself.

642
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:27,995
I decided to clear my mind
by reading some books.

643
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:29,263
Books.

644
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:32,232
Top scholars are different.
I prefer a drink for a headache.

645
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:37,404
Here.

646
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:46,747
Did you hear?

647
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,816
Thanks to your wife, we are alive.

648
00:40:56,156 --> 00:41:00,460
I told Tae Young not to leave
if she does not wish to.

649
00:41:00,727 --> 00:41:01,728
Well done.

650
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:03,463
I think so too.

651
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,400
If I am gone, there will be no risk.

652
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,669
She is no longer a widow.

653
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:10,304
If I leave, the problem is solved.

654
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,973
She may choose to leave with you.

655
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:18,178
Let us discuss that
once your wife returns safely.

656
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:21,381
Are we back to this topic again?

657
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,283
Shouldn't you at least

658
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:25,652
check on your wife?

659
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,959
She deliberately approached me.

660
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:34,261
I was deceived into marrying her.

661
00:41:35,095 --> 00:41:39,032
Had I not been fooled,
none of this would have happened.

662
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:46,607
I apologize. It reminded me
of my own experience

663
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:49,009
hearing that she deliberately deceived
and approached you.

664
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,245
Oh.

665
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:54,948
If she only acted to approach you,

666
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:56,383
and never felt anything in her heart,

667
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,486
Tae Young would never have approved

668
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:01,588
your marriage.

669
00:42:07,928 --> 00:42:11,198
Regardless, your wife sincerely tried
to fulfill her mother's wishes.

670
00:42:11,198 --> 00:42:13,767
She gave her whole heart

671
00:42:13,767 --> 00:42:16,003
to marry you earnestly.

672
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:19,506
That sincerity reached
both you and your sister-in-law.

673
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:25,806
The murder of Song Mi Ok

674
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,309
is linked to the virtuous arch case.

675
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:34,047
The Royal Inspector dispatched

676
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:37,651
will oversee it in person.

677
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:07,414
Cha Mi Ryeong confessed
to killing her mother.

678
00:44:07,414 --> 00:44:10,851
She testified to hating her mother enough
to commit the murder,

679
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:12,319
so the motive for murder is sufficient.

680
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:14,988
The legal advocate will defend.

681
00:44:14,988 --> 00:44:18,692
While Cha Mi Ryeong confessed
to poisoning her mother,

682
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:19,693
the autopsy revealed

683
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:24,398
that Song Mi Ok's cause of death
was strangulation with a rope.

684
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:30,504
Cha Mi Ryeong was unaware
of her mother's true cause of death.

685
00:44:30,504 --> 00:44:33,740
Additionally, there are no defensive
wounds commonly found on perpetrators.

686
00:44:34,775 --> 00:44:37,911
Then why did she confess
to killing her mother?

687
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:44,284
Because my mother, who killed others,
took her own life,

688
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,787
I decided to bear the punishment

689
00:44:48,055 --> 00:44:49,590
for her sins.

690
00:44:51,325 --> 00:44:53,093
Before her death,

691
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:56,563
Song Mi Ok and Oh Dal Seong
killed the slave Dol Seok

692
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:59,766
and used his body
to falsely claim I was a widow.

693
00:45:01,034 --> 00:45:03,270
Summon Oh Dal Seong

694
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,738
arrested for Dol Seok's murder.

695
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:12,312
I don't understand what she means.

696
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:14,147
Do you think you can lie in court?

697
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:15,182
I am telling the truth!

698
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:17,484
One day, there was a body
at the office gate

699
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:19,953
and a handkerchief with the name on it.

700
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:21,321
How many times must I say it?

701
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:25,058
That handkerchief, too,
was forged by Song Mi Ok.

702
00:45:25,959 --> 00:45:26,927
I don't know.

703
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:30,464
My Lord, Oh Dal Seong,

704
00:45:30,764 --> 00:45:33,066
when he found Dol Seok's body
was being examined,

705
00:45:33,433 --> 00:45:36,436
killed Song Mi Ok fearing exposure
as an accomplice

706
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:37,871
once her arrest revealed everything.

707
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:39,806
He then sent an anonymous letter
blaming her for the murder.

708
00:45:39,806 --> 00:45:41,775
This is slander and speculation.

709
00:45:44,378 --> 00:45:45,879
Did you write this?

710
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:47,848
Yes.

711
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:56,089
This document is an official record
of Cheongsu County that he confirms.

712
00:45:56,857 --> 00:46:01,161
Compare the handwriting with the letter
sent to the provincial office.

713
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:16,176
No, that is not my writing.
I did not write it.

714
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:18,445
You scoundrel!

715
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:22,115
How could a government official,
paid by the nation, kill its people?

716
00:46:22,749 --> 00:46:25,719
Can't handwriting be forged easily?

717
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:26,620
Then

718
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:29,523
to whom did you make the agreement?

719
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:31,191
(Agreement, written promise)

720
00:46:31,425 --> 00:46:32,359
Agreement?

721
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:35,062
How did you know?

722
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:36,330
At the banquet at my house,

723
00:46:37,364 --> 00:46:39,533
I overheard the conversation
between you and Song Mi Ok.

724
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:40,868
So,

725
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:43,904
you pretended to forgive me

726
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:45,672
and invited me to the banquet?

727
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:47,374
You cunning...

728
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:49,243
Mind your words!

729
00:46:49,243 --> 00:46:50,143
My Lord.

730
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:52,813
This man, Oh Dal Seong

731
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:56,650
was lured by Song Mi Ok's plan

732
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,619
and committed ruthless murders

733
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,554
for personal gain.

734
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:02,489
He claimed the body as my husband

735
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:04,057
and forced me into widowhood.

736
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:08,328
He directed me
to be humiliated mercilessly.

737
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:09,363
That is not true!

738
00:47:09,863 --> 00:47:11,465
I did not hire the kidnappers.

739
00:47:17,271 --> 00:47:18,939
I was told if I signed the document,

740
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:25,579
they'd find some kidnappers
and create the virtuous arch in exchange.

741
00:47:27,281 --> 00:47:28,315
Who is it...

742
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,419
Who promised you that
and took your signature?

743
00:47:35,856 --> 00:47:36,924
It was...

744
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,260
The true killer of Song Mi Ok
who was arrested.

745
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:42,729
I request a confrontation
with him, Ji Dong Choon.

746
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:48,802
He has been arrested?

747
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:54,441
This is ridiculous.

748
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:57,845
How could someone like me
arrange the virtuous arch?

749
00:47:58,278 --> 00:48:00,614
What is this about agreements
and kidnappers?

750
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:03,116
What nonsense is all this?

751
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,320
Of course, I sent the laborers.

752
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,588
That is my job.

753
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:10,524
But how could I know

754
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:12,926
everything they do?

755
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:15,762
Both of you deny knowing?

756
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:18,165
- Yes.
- Yes.

757
00:48:18,165 --> 00:48:19,499
- Yes, we deny it.
- We deny it.

758
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:22,636
Even if there are witnesses

759
00:48:22,636 --> 00:48:25,072
who saw you meeting several times?

760
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:28,509
Fine, let us say we knew each other.

761
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:31,011
How does that prove

762
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:33,480
I killed Song Mi Ok?

763
00:48:34,081 --> 00:48:35,082
My Lord.

764
00:48:35,816 --> 00:48:39,019
I request Hong Soo Hee
of Cheongsu County as a witness.

765
00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:59,806
I just went to return
the ring I had received.

766
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:01,175
Of course.

767
00:49:01,175 --> 00:49:02,943
Why accuse an innocent person?

768
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:07,014
Then why do you look so uneasy,
as if you are guilty?

769
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:10,050
I think

770
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:14,321
I have seen the murderer.

771
00:49:15,522 --> 00:49:18,158
- What?
- Then why didn't you say so earlier?

772
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:19,459
I beg you.

773
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:22,229
If you draw a sketch and testify,

774
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:24,798
I will have Do Gyeom help Woongyi
pass the exam.

775
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:31,572
Also, let me be the chief lady
of the Mother's Sanctuary.

776
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:32,840
Seriously?

777
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,874
Deal.

778
00:49:38,846 --> 00:49:39,847
It is him.

779
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:43,650
He is the criminal.

780
00:49:45,752 --> 00:49:46,820
Are you certain?

781
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,123
Yes, I saw him clearly with my own eyes.

782
00:49:50,123 --> 00:49:53,994
Honestly, could you forget
a face like his after seeing it?

783
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:55,395
It is not true.

784
00:49:56,263 --> 00:49:58,732
I truly know nothing about it.

785
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,534
If you cannot remember,

786
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,004
I will help you recall that day.

787
00:50:09,776 --> 00:50:11,478
Why did I foolishly receive this?

788
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:14,815
Lady Hong visited to return the ring
she received from Song Mi Ok.

789
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:16,850
When Cha Mi Ryeong left to get water,

790
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:19,253
Lady Hong tried to enter
to meet Song Mi Ok.

791
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:28,295
But upon seeing Ji Dong Choon enter,

792
00:50:28,795 --> 00:50:30,497
Lady Hong ran away in fear.

793
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,971
Ji Dong Choon entered the room

794
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:42,776
and brutally strangled
Song Mi Ok to death.

795
00:50:47,247 --> 00:50:48,315
Mother!

796
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:01,628
Are you saying

797
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:04,464
when the soldiers arrived,
he was still there?

798
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:06,333
If the soldiers were delayed,

799
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:10,904
Cha Mi Ryeong would have
also lost her life to him.

800
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:12,773
That is an absurd speculation.

801
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,177
This is a drawing of the footprints
behind the door.

802
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:19,847
Compare them to his shoes

803
00:51:19,847 --> 00:51:21,715
and compare the scratches on his hands

804
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:24,117
to the flesh under Song Mi Ok's nails.

805
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,125
I...

806
00:51:38,665 --> 00:51:40,200
Also, seven years ago,

807
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,803
he kidnapped and abused children,

808
00:51:43,036 --> 00:51:46,373
using them for illegal mining,
and earned severe punishment.

809
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:48,041
Yet he committed grave sins again.

810
00:51:49,543 --> 00:51:51,278
His punishment must be harsher.

811
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:53,480
No.

812
00:51:54,014 --> 00:51:55,482
I truly did not do it, not me.

813
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:57,184
Say it.

814
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:02,222
The Magistrate ordered me to do it.

815
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:05,359
- Are you out of your mind?
- Guards!

816
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:08,061
Take Oh Dal Seong and Ji Dong Choon
to prison now.

817
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:11,331
Don't give them a drop of water
until they confess all their crimes.

818
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,468
My Lord, it is not true.

819
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:15,702
- Father.
- Father.

820
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:18,739
No, it cannot be.

821
00:52:18,739 --> 00:52:20,073
You wretch...

822
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,243
That wretch...

823
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:24,711
It cannot be.

824
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:29,483
Cha Mi Ryeong is not the person
who killed Song Mi Ok.

825
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:32,920
Instead, she testified

826
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,122
against Oh Dal Seong and Song Mi Ok
for killing Dol Seok.

827
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:38,425
She also revealed their collusion
with the kidnappers

828
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:40,594
to help you apprehend them.

829
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:44,665
Therefore, I sincerely request

830
00:52:45,866 --> 00:52:47,501
the release of Cha Mi Ryeong.

831
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:52,940
Cha Mi Ryeong

832
00:52:54,074 --> 00:52:57,511
is declared innocent.
She may return home.

833
00:52:57,911 --> 00:53:00,047
Young Madam.

834
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,264
Everyone has worked so hard.

835
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:19,166
Well done.

836
00:53:22,102 --> 00:53:25,239
I never imagined footprints
would be the key.

837
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,673
Nonsense.

838
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:29,776
Let us go.

839
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,349
Mi Ryeong.

840
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,368
Sorry for being late.

841
00:54:00,874 --> 00:54:03,177
- Let us go, let us all leave.
- Thank you for your efforts.

842
00:54:03,677 --> 00:54:06,013
- Hey, Kkeutdongi.
- I am so exhausted.

843
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:07,481
You were so incredible today.

844
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:11,351
Oh Dal Seong was already at risk

845
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:12,920
of dismissal for embezzlement.

846
00:54:14,154 --> 00:54:16,823
Someone approached the Magistrates

847
00:54:16,823 --> 00:54:20,027
through the overseer,
targeting those at risk of dismissal

848
00:54:20,027 --> 00:54:21,795
and secured agreements for bribes.

849
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,065
They then sent the kidnappers.

850
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,034
Perhaps the overseer

851
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:30,871
is just a loyal pawn for someone else.

852
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:33,907
But will the overseer reveal
who is behind him?

853
00:54:33,907 --> 00:54:35,509
Seven years ago,

854
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:38,111
he refused to speak in the mining case.

855
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:41,615
Perhaps it would be better
to release him and track him.

856
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:43,050
Can you

857
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:46,220
convince Oh Dal Seong to talk?

858
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:53,126
You know what will happen if you speak.

859
00:54:58,765 --> 00:55:01,635
At the court, I saw your family.

860
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:04,571
It was truly a heartwarming sight.

861
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:23,690
The use of virtuous arches
for revenge killings

862
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:26,760
will be fully reported to the King.

863
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,796
This way, no more innocent widows
will be wrongfully murdered.

864
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:32,766
We will enforce stricter evaluations
and greater caution.

865
00:55:32,766 --> 00:55:36,670
However, if you reveal this
before the mastermind gets caught,

866
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:38,939
they might disappear and hide.

867
00:55:38,939 --> 00:55:42,376
Punishing the guilty
and condemning the wicked is good,

868
00:55:42,576 --> 00:55:46,847
but ensuring they cannot repeat
their crimes

869
00:55:47,981 --> 00:55:49,583
must be more meaningful.

870
00:55:51,585 --> 00:55:54,588
It is all thanks to you
for creating this rightful cause.

871
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:59,059
I am grateful that you listened
to the words of a mere woman.

872
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:00,427
Thank you.

873
00:56:04,064 --> 00:56:06,400
My Lord, Oh Dal Seong killed himself.

874
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,868
What?

875
00:56:24,585 --> 00:56:27,421
My goodness, our Legal Advocate Lady.

876
00:56:29,656 --> 00:56:31,458
I will be watching you.

877
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:37,364
How dare you point your finger at her!

878
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:39,066
Who are you?

879
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:40,701
I am just excited to see you.

880
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:41,668
It has been a while.

881
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:45,772
What is wrong with this guy?

882
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:48,208
How handsome.

883
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,355
The head madam Ok Tae Young
of the family of Seong Gyu Jin,

884
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:04,525
who was once the magistrate
of Cheongsu County,

885
00:57:05,225 --> 00:57:08,028
has worked tirelessly
to uncover the false virtuous arch case,

886
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:11,498
which caused the death
of innocent lives.

887
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:14,268
Her efforts and contributions
are significant

888
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:17,004
and merit recognition.

889
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:18,739
- Indeed!
- Of course!

890
00:57:19,339 --> 00:57:20,841
As a reward,

891
00:57:20,841 --> 00:57:24,745
a monument shall be erected
in Cheongsu County

892
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:32,986
and each household among the people
shall receive a roll of cotton cloth.

893
00:57:34,621 --> 00:57:35,455
Bravo.

894
00:57:37,157 --> 00:57:39,826
And to Ok Tae Young,

895
00:57:39,826 --> 00:57:42,863
ten rolls of colorful silk
shall be bestowed.

896
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:45,465
- Ten rolls! Wonderful!
- What an honor!

897
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:48,001
A monument in Cheongsu County?

898
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:49,603
That is impressive.

899
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:52,272
They say it will be harder to receive
a virtuous arch in the future.

900
00:57:52,272 --> 00:57:54,808
- So this is a huge gain.
- Absolutely.

901
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:57,644
She saved her sister-in-law,
caught the murderer,

902
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:59,880
and elevated Cheongsu County's honor.

903
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,483
Our legal advocate has solved
the last case magnificently.

904
00:58:03,483 --> 00:58:04,384
Now, make some noise!

905
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,323
I say legal advocate! You say lady!

906
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:11,191
- Legal advocate!
- Lady!

907
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:13,060
- Legal advocate!
- Lady!

908
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,027
Make some noise!

909
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:17,664
Even louder!

910
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,906
I had a hard time evading
the spies trailing me.

911
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:29,510
Because of her,
the virtuous arch plan failed

912
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,946
and the Chief Minister
is deeply disappointed.

913
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,215
It's indeed frustrating.

914
00:58:36,283 --> 00:58:38,385
Seven years ago,
when you were the Minister of War,

915
00:58:38,385 --> 00:58:40,621
she cost you the gold mine as well.

916
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:46,093
But it is fortunate the Chief Minister
and you were not exposed.

917
00:58:46,693 --> 00:58:48,395
And I was released as well.

918
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:51,965
Oh Dal Seong took his own life,
which was convenient.

919
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:56,703
I repeatedly warned him

920
00:58:57,237 --> 00:58:59,773
that if he interfered with your plans,

921
00:59:01,842 --> 00:59:02,843
he would be...

922
00:59:05,712 --> 00:59:07,047
You know it very well.

923
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:20,961
Failing to handle a mere woman...

924
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:23,530
Dispose of it.

925
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:29,736
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

926
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:32,606
Don't be. Please take a seat.

927
00:59:32,606 --> 00:59:33,507
Yes.

928
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:37,144
Why are you sitting there?
Stand up and greet him at once.

929
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:48,589
My apologies.
My daughter has no manners at all.

930
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:38,939
I don't believe I am superior
because I have more.

931
01:00:39,773 --> 01:00:42,209
I believe having more means
I have more responsibility.

932
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:45,712
I want to be a legal advocate.

933
01:00:45,712 --> 01:00:47,548
Many people suffer injustices

934
01:00:47,548 --> 01:00:49,383
but cannot file a lawsuit,

935
01:00:49,383 --> 01:00:51,385
because they cannot read
and understand the law.

936
01:00:52,753 --> 01:00:55,756
I want to help those people.

937
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,330
Being a legal advocate

938
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:09,203
is no longer just your dream now.

939
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,908
It seems to have become my dream too.

940
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,182
So I feel so sad to leave.

941
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:35,596
Where exactly are we headed now?

942
01:01:35,596 --> 01:01:38,198
Even if you are leaving,
you should say goodbye properly.

943
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:44,938
Didn't I tell you to stop the repairs?

944
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:45,906
This?

945
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,242
It was not me.

946
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,213
Thank you so much, Legal Advocate Lady.

947
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:56,083
Thanks to you, my daughter,
a victim of the virtuous arch

948
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,585
can now rest in peace.

949
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,823
Other bereaved families
have also come to visit.

950
01:02:28,415 --> 01:02:29,416
Madam.

951
01:02:30,517 --> 01:02:33,687
- Madam, you are here.
- Thank you, Madam.

952
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:36,356
- Thank you, Madam.
- We are so grateful, Madam.

953
01:02:36,356 --> 01:02:37,591
Thank you so much, Madam.

954
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,694
You are truly
the pride of Cheongsu County.

955
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:43,430
Thank you, Madam.

956
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:45,966
Thanks to you,
we also received blessings.

957
01:02:45,966 --> 01:02:48,068
Because of you,
life feels worth living again.

958
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:49,369
We respect you, Madam.

959
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:50,771
Congratulations.

960
01:02:51,605 --> 01:02:54,007
You asked why I came
after "killing" Chon Seung Hwi.

961
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:57,945
I wanted to see you being happy
with my own eyes.

962
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,133
It seems you have something to say.

963
01:03:22,503 --> 01:03:25,639
Speak when you are ready. I will wait.

964
01:03:29,843 --> 01:03:31,078
Just once...

965
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:33,981
Just for one time...

966
01:03:37,184 --> 01:03:39,386
Can I be selfish?

967
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:42,890
About what?

968
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:47,895
To make you

969
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:53,634
my true husband and live here together,

970
01:03:55,869 --> 01:04:00,040
doing what I want to do.

971
01:04:03,944 --> 01:04:04,878
You often claim

972
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,849
everyone is equal,

973
01:04:09,283 --> 01:04:11,318
but why are you so harsh
only on yourself?

974
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:14,388
Stop only helping others.

975
01:04:14,388 --> 01:04:16,223
Stop sacrificing yourself and forgiving.

976
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:18,425
For once, live as you wish.

977
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:20,761
You know it to.

978
01:04:22,729 --> 01:04:24,398
I am slave Goodeoki.

979
01:04:24,631 --> 01:04:27,801
I respected you
even when you were a slave.

980
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:30,370
A slave who learned to read,

981
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:33,240
earned money by selling peanuts,
and planned your escape.

982
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:35,809
You didn't stay in your given life.

983
01:04:35,809 --> 01:04:38,979
You splashed filth on your master
and escaped oppression.

984
01:04:39,613 --> 01:04:43,250
This life you carved out for yourself
is precious.

985
01:04:44,484 --> 01:04:47,621
You deserve it, fully.

986
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:51,425
This now is your life.

987
01:04:52,226 --> 01:04:53,227
Then

988
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:56,163
what about your dream?

989
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:59,633
You gave it all up for me.

990
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:01,468
How can I

991
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:05,172
live happily on my own?

992
01:05:05,172 --> 01:05:08,976
No, I feel like I am stepping
onto the greatest stage of my life.

993
01:05:09,643 --> 01:05:12,746
I am living as the protagonist
of my story with you as my wife.

994
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:16,149
This is like achieving my dream too.

995
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:22,723
One day, when people find out,

996
01:05:23,991 --> 01:05:26,593
death will be inevitable.

997
01:05:26,593 --> 01:05:28,862
But even if I can live
just one day as your husband,

998
01:05:29,663 --> 01:05:31,098
death does not scare me.

999
01:05:32,332 --> 01:05:35,369
In fact, even now, if I were to die,

1000
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:37,204
the days spent with you

1001
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:39,840
were the happiest of my life.

1002
01:05:47,347 --> 01:05:49,983
So let us make sure we don't get caught.

1003
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:54,521
Just as you live as Tae Young,
not Geodeoki,

1004
01:05:55,689 --> 01:05:57,391
I will no longer be Chon Seung Hwi

1005
01:05:58,592 --> 01:05:59,993
but Seong Yun Gyeom.

1006
01:06:06,366 --> 01:06:09,636
Now then, call me.

1007
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:12,673
Who am I?

1008
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:20,514
My husband.

1009
01:07:09,396 --> 01:07:13,967
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1010
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:16,870
What do you mean the ceiling
in Yun Gyeom's room collapsed?

1011
01:07:17,137 --> 01:07:18,172
Exactly.

1012
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:20,207
But where will I sleep tonight, then?

1013
01:07:20,207 --> 01:07:22,743
You two are married.
Why not share a room?

1014
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:24,111
My goodness.

1015
01:07:24,111 --> 01:07:27,247
I just wish for you to sleep peacefully
just once,

1016
01:07:27,247 --> 01:07:29,449
but how can life be so hard for you?

1017
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:31,718
I am your...

1018
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:35,122
husband.

1019
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:36,590
I'll make sure we don't get caught.

1020
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,226
Flawlessly, without the slightest error.

1021
01:07:39,226 --> 01:07:41,228
Now, repeat after me.

1022
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:43,664
I am the best.

1023
01:07:43,664 --> 01:07:44,831
I am amazing.

1024
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:51,004
Will you give me a wedding gift?

1025
01:07:51,004 --> 01:07:52,206
What if they are slave hunters?

1026
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,541
What if Lady So Hye is searching for me?

1027
01:07:54,908 --> 01:07:57,010
What if she sees me
and my husband together?
