1
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,002
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,038
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,982
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,357
What is your name?

5
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,495
My name is Goodeoki.

6
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,364
Your name is Ok Tae Young.

7
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,302
From inside to outside,
you will become Tae Young.

8
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:13,173
I want you to live as yourself.

9
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:17,411
Living forever in hiding under a veil is

10
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,412
not like you.

11
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,415
Have you forgotten who you are?

12
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,317
We kept calling you "my lady",

13
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,586
so you really think
you are Lady Ok Tae Young.

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,556
Remember this.
You are not the real Lady Ok Tae Young.

15
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,759
The Goodeoki who dreamed
of living by the sea with her father,

16
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,231
died two years ago in a fire at an inn.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,700
The life I received in place of the lady

18
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,670
cannot be lived by Goodeoki.

19
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,741
Now you are truly yourself.

20
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,980
They murdered the slave Baekyi
and faked it as a suicide.

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,917
I report the Baek Do Gwang family
for the crime of murdering slave Baekyi.

22
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,453
Arrest the entire Baek Do Gwang family.

23
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,788
Let go of me! What are you doing?

24
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:06,627
By the way,
what is your name, young lady?

25
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:08,662
My name is...

26
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,766
Ok Tae Young.

27
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,316
Why did you have to
stir up such trouble?

28
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,418
Are you happy now?

29
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,688
That I did not run away with some man
but came back to save you instead?

30
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:40,160
Our lady is surprisingly
quite resentful despite her appearance.

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,395
Yes, I am.

32
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:44,965
What? I think I am really Tae Young
because you have been calling me "Lady"?

33
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,937
I did not know
you disliked that so much.

34
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,173
It is not that I dislike it.

35
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:55,642
I was worried it might lead to trouble.

36
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:02,516
I do not wish to enjoy privileges
as Lady Tae Young,

37
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,986
but to do what she should have done.

38
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:07,554
I know.

39
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,023
The one who freed me
from hiding in fear was

40
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,327
Baekyi.

41
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:17,497
So I will never forgive those

42
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,267
who hurt Baekyi.

43
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,241
- Mak Sim.
- Mak Sim.

44
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:28,542
Over here.

45
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,143
There she is.

46
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,311
Mak Sim!

47
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,647
What happened? Did you break your arm?

48
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,349
Do you have a broken shoulder?

49
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,285
Do not worry.
My bones are not easy to crack.

50
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,522
Thank goodness.
Thanks to your strong bones, Mak Sim.

51
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,723
Oh my.

52
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,559
By the way, I heard
Baek Do Gwang's family was all arrested.

53
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,560
Yes.

54
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,596
How did the Magistrate get involved?

55
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,101
Before I could examine it myself,

56
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,870
the body and examination report
were sent home?

57
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,809
My Lord, it is customary

58
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,811
in Cheongsu County not to oversee

59
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,147
the examination of suicides yourself.

60
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:10,417
The coroner's report clearly stated

61
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,186
that the death was by hanging,

62
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:13,678
but I found the head wound suspicious,

63
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,485
so I showed it to the coroner
in the upper village.

64
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:22,029
The cause of death is
undoubtedly a brain contusion.

65
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,631
Who would hang themselves after dying?

66
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,266
- Does that make sense?
- No.

67
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,268
Why was the brain contusion

68
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,505
not mentioned in the examination report?

69
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,775
That is because...

70
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,045
Spare me. I only followed orders.

71
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,614
Was it Special Inspector Baek's orders?

72
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,351
Answer her.

73
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:45,752
Yes.

74
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,590
Arrest this man now.

75
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,593
Transfer the body to the office
for reexamination.

76
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,976
Did you trust the word of a mere coroner
to arrest us like this?

77
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,379
Where were you and with whom
last night around midnight?

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,550
I was packing my belongings
to go to Hanyang.

79
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,685
What is your relation

80
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:21,421
to the deceased Baekyi?

81
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,461
There was no relationship.

82
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,863
Baek Do Gwang had feelings for her.

83
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,732
They claim it is the other way around.

84
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:33,600
That Baekyi was the one
who had feelings.

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,469
That is not true.

86
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,604
She had no interest in him at all.

87
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,308
Perhaps Baek Do Gwang might not be

88
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:45,546
the one who killed Baekyi.

89
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,316
Me?

90
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,886
Are you suspecting me?

91
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:57,191
I asked where you were
last night around midnight.

92
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,494
I was preparing for the farewell party.

93
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,966
Listen, My Lord.

94
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,803
She tried to change her fate,

95
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,506
but when things did not go her way,
she killed herself.

96
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:21,014
It is late tonight.
Everyone, go back home.

97
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,451
The consequences of this insult
will be severe.

98
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,853
Let us go.

99
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,187
Until this investigation is over,

100
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:32,025
no one is permitted
to leave Cheongsu County.

101
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:35,329
My Lord, we must leave
for Hanyang tomorrow morning.

102
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:37,064
Will you stay confined

103
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:40,300
until the investigation is over?

104
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:01,588
Throwing off the veil
as if she is someone big and goes,

105
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,857
"I report you for the crime
of murdering?"

106
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,993
There were rumors she was plain,

107
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:08,929
but she is much prettier than expected.

108
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,797
That is because she is young.

109
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:13,033
Do you not know what they say
about youthful arrogance?

110
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,301
But

111
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:17,571
do you think the Special Inspector's
family truly killed the servant?

112
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,739
That could be true.

113
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:21,675
If a lowly slave seduced my son,
I would kill her too.

114
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:25,445
Even if they did, it could have been
settled by compensating for the slave.

115
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,247
Why arrest a noble

116
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:29,883
over the death of a mere slave?

117
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,285
The magistrate will try to use this

118
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,787
to curb Yuhyangso's influence.

119
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,524
This is why he made a public show
of arresting Special Inspector's family.

120
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,159
Whether guilty or not,

121
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,795
we must win this time.

122
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,463
That's right.

123
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,733
If we lose, the underlings might forget
their place and start...

124
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,861
You should be careful!
We are having a conversation!

125
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,558
Madam.

126
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,945
I am close to giving birth

127
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,848
and in great pain.

128
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:05,652
See? They are already doing it.

129
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,323
Madam, I am a government slave.

130
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,326
When I worked in the Hanyang office,

131
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,194
I heard that
when government slaves are pregnant,

132
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:17,397
we get a month's leave by law.

133
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,236
How dare you

134
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,471
bring up the law!

135
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,940
Cheongsu County has its own rules.

136
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,175
Get out and work!

137
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,346
This is why this matter is critical.

138
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,482
Should we not come up with a plan?

139
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,951
Our lord introduced a legal advocate.

140
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,219
Don't worry.

141
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,956
He is the best legal advocate
in Hanyang.

142
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,794
I am a Veteran Legal Advocate.

143
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,867
- What is a legal advocate?
- A law expert.

144
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,304
They have law books this big
and have gotten a fortune for his service.

145
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,439
It seems they are preparing
for a fierce defense.

146
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,742
Tell me more details.
Did you hear anything else?

147
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,278
The legal advocate plans to fire back.

148
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,346
He wants to set fire to Cheongsu County?

149
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,347
Is the advocate insane?

150
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,217
So, would he mean accusing me

151
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,085
of accusing them of murder?

152
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,924
- What is this?
- What?

153
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,559
- They came to the wrong place.
- My lady!

154
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,793
Is this what you meant by firing back?

155
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,962
- My goodness.
- What is happening?

156
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,797
What brings you here?

157
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,701
- What is going on?
- Take her away.

158
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,836
No!

159
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,737
Take me instead.

160
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,738
Mak Sim!

161
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,374
- What? Why?
- What is this?

162
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,475
Wait.

163
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,377
Are they really taking me?

164
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,847
- Mak Sim!
- Why are they taking her?

165
00:09:39,847 --> 00:09:41,148
Please don't.

166
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,816
What is on earth going on?

167
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:45,219
She is accused of insulting
an innocent noble

168
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,286
despite being a servant.

169
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,255
The murder is under investigation.

170
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,389
How could they be innocent?

171
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:52,559
She may flee
if the case is cleared not guilty.

172
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,695
With the bribed coroner's confession,

173
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,929
they will not be cleared not guilty.

174
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,066
The coroner bit his tongue
to death last night.

175
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,934
Take her away!

176
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,203
- My lady!
- Mak Sim!

177
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,406
How will I live if you are gone?
What should I do now?

178
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:08,876
If summoned to the office,

179
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,644
deny everything.

180
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,812
Yes.

181
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:14,181
You must all know that servants

182
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:17,384
who betray their masters
must pay with their lives, right?

183
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,088
Ok Bi, you will testify

184
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:23,690
that Baekyi frequented our house.

185
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,225
Yes.

186
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:29,296
Dol Seok, come to the main house
after your morning tasks.

187
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:31,565
Yes.

188
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,740
The insolence of parentless ones
never ceases.

189
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,775
Go.

190
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:46,947
Did you bribe the coroner
and even have him killed himself?

191
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,483
Hiding in your quarters

192
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,218
made you grow a knack for fiction.

193
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:54,388
Why was Mak Sim taken?

194
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,889
Our legal advocate says

195
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,858
false charges deserve reverse judgment.

196
00:10:57,858 --> 00:10:59,993
You falsely accused us of murder.

197
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,762
So she will face punishment
as a murderer would.

198
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,398
Did you hire a legal advocate

199
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,467
only to destroy evidence

200
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,736
and kill Mak Sim out of spite?

201
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:12,005
You are naive about
the ways of the world.

202
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,642
You insulted more than my family.

203
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:18,712
You dared to challenge the Yuhyangso

204
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:20,848
leading Cheongsu County
with nothing but the magistrate

205
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,149
at your back.

206
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,184
Is this the price for...

207
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,420
This will not merely be
the price you pay

208
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,689
but an example for all to see.

209
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,925
There was no murder.

210
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:35,329
Slave Baekyi dreamed foolishly
and killed herself.

211
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:39,366
You, in your blind defiance,

212
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,070
will lead even her mother to death.

213
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:48,342
Let's go.

214
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,011
Did you truly

215
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,782
never have feelings for Baekyi?

216
00:11:58,886 --> 00:11:59,887
No.

217
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,856
I do not even know who Baekyi is.

218
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,386
It must have hurt a lot.

219
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,391
I will send aloe for your wounds.
Apply it to heal.

220
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,265
(Servant)

221
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,434
Please let me meet the Magistrate.

222
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,169
(Cheongsu County)
I have something to report.

223
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,904
This is not a place for anyone to enter.

224
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:54,141
I have the right to know how
the murder charge is being investigated.

225
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,242
I said no.

226
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:08,922
Just this once.

227
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:14,094
No way, I am a lady now.
What if someone sees?

228
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:20,000
It is urgent, so I have no choice.

229
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,498
You are late again. Hurry up.

230
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:19,793
Young Master?

231
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,133
I thought you already left.

232
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:36,043
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,045
What about you? Why are you here?

234
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,848
What are those clothes and that sword?

235
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,584
But you cannot even climb a wall.

236
00:14:45,686 --> 00:14:47,454
A wall? Me?

237
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:51,228
Must you follow me this far?

238
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:55,028
Why not respect my feelings

239
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,697
when I refused to leave with you?

240
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,799
- What?
- And that face.

241
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,201
How can you walk around so shamelessly?

242
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,404
What about my face?

243
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,439
Do not tell me

244
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:08,442
the story
about hiding your face was a lie.

245
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,745
Did you make it up to gain my sympathy?

246
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:12,746
What?

247
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,915
Making up stories is your job,

248
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,250
but this is too much.

249
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,219
Did you hear about Baekyi?

250
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,022
Are you going to write about my pain
of losing her as well?

251
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:25,292
Must you really be this cruel?

252
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,627
Listen, young lady.

253
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:28,362
Just call me Goodeoki!

254
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,334
Goodeoki?

255
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:36,370
Your acting is truly impressive.

256
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,005
You are an excellent storyteller.

257
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,607
Storyteller?

258
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,644
This is my heart.

259
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,779
Why are you like this?

260
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,948
Oh.

261
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:53,287
I think I know
who you are mistaking me for,

262
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,689
but I am not the person you think I am.

263
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,257
Then who are you?

264
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:59,426
Are you going to say that
you are a government officer or something?

265
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:03,096
Everything is ready.

266
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,840
Are you

267
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,443
really not the Young Master?

268
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:18,812
Forget it.

269
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:24,952
What is this?

270
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,665
The Young Master cannot be skilled
in martial arts.

271
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,001
But how can someone
look so much like him?

272
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,505
It makes no sense.

273
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,506
Is it not him?

274
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,074
It does not seem so.

275
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,712
What should I do? I said so much to him.

276
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,388
Look who is here.

277
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,156
- Father.
- Yes.

278
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,691
Father.

279
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,194
You are here.

280
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,029
It is cold. Let us go inside.

281
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,631
Yes.

282
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,569
As the rumors go,

283
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,205
Cheongsu County is controlled
by Yuhyangso.

284
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:21,875
Even the officials act
according to their will.

285
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:25,112
How can a place
known for purity be so corrupt?

286
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:27,948
For the past three years,

287
00:17:27,948 --> 00:17:31,151
someone has persistently demanded
reform in Yuhyangso.

288
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:34,154
Who is this righteous person?

289
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,824
It is the daughter
of the late Ok Pil Seung.

290
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,861
What was her name?
Tae Young, I believe.

291
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,464
She was also the master
of the late Baekyi.

292
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,367
Did you hear about Baekyi?

293
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,837
Are you going to write about my pain
of losing her as well?

294
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:54,608
She even valued the life
of a mere servant

295
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,009
and worked hard to save her.

296
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,712
She is truly a virtuous lady.

297
00:17:58,712 --> 00:17:59,713
Indeed.

298
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,218
Will you be able to uncover
the truth of this case?

299
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:11,986
(Daesong)

300
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:14,328
Everyone says no.

301
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,563
This is the only place left.
Can you please accept it?

302
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,332
I will pay as much as you ask.

303
00:18:18,332 --> 00:18:20,200
Money is not an issue.

304
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,436
That veteran is said to be unbeatable.

305
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,271
- Still...
- But...

306
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,340
This is impossible.

307
00:18:29,076 --> 00:18:31,044
(Daesong)

308
00:18:31,512 --> 00:18:32,880
Are you feeling unwell?

309
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,182
I suddenly feel nature calling.

310
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,283
Go then.

311
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,621
Make way! I am about to burst!

312
00:19:05,846 --> 00:19:07,781
It is said that those who hide are

313
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,150
the ones trying to flee.

314
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,952
What is this? Hand it over now!

315
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:15,088
What do you mean?
We are just doing our job.

316
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,324
Wait, we have a sketch here.

317
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,725
I am Ok Tae Young,

318
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:20,661
the daughter of Ok Pil Seung
of Cheongsu County.

319
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:25,132
People these days are clever,
pretending to be noble.

320
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:26,867
- Let us see.
- She is pretty.

321
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,068
How dare you!

322
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,537
Hae Gang, go ahead first.

323
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:32,706
It is fine, go on.

324
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,678
What will you do with that?

325
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,947
If you are curious, come closer.

326
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,481
I almost want to get stabbed.

327
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:44,117
Do you even know
how to swing that? Try it!

328
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:57,464
What is this?

329
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,567
Get her!

330
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,606
Move!

331
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,219
Hey, you are quite something.

332
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,621
You are not a lady, are you?

333
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:32,533
I will not go easy on you
like a noble lady.

334
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:34,401
- We are leaving.
- We will go.

335
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:39,406
- We are going.
- Let's go.

336
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:46,947
What brings you here...

337
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:50,317
You do not mistake me
for that storyteller today.

338
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,353
That person is

339
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,323
not skilled in martial arts.

340
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,762
Is that man the one you love?

341
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,365
You said you rejected him to leave.

342
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,935
Did you part ways with him?

343
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:12,439
I deeply apologize
for my rudeness that day.

344
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,842
And the words you heard.

345
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:17,344
I hope you can forget them.

346
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,680
Do I really resemble him that much?

347
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,015
Unless there is some secret
to your birth,

348
00:21:23,016 --> 00:21:26,887
it seems
the two of you are "dobulkyungoh."

349
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:28,522
Dobulkyungoh?

350
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,058
"Do" as in "imitation,"
"Bul" for "similarity,"

351
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:33,894
"Kyung" as in "surprise,"
and "Oh" for "fascination."

352
00:21:33,894 --> 00:21:37,931
It means a figure identical to another,
as if it were a doppelganger.

353
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:41,602
Thank you for your help today.

354
00:21:41,602 --> 00:21:43,737
I must leave to find a legal advocate.

355
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:47,040
You called that deceased slave
your companion.

356
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:49,810
Baekyi

357
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,647
was my one and only, dearest companion.

358
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:55,115
A slave?

359
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:59,520
Regardless of age or status,
I believe all lives

360
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,722
are precious and equal.

361
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:10,564
Then,

362
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,835
why not become
a legal advocate yourself?

363
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:20,807
No one can truly represent
your feelings better than you.

364
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:22,943
How could I?

365
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,480
I know nothing about the law.

366
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,982
There is no need to memorize
the entire code.

367
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:30,784
Mak Sim, was it?

368
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,153
You only need to save Baekyi's mother.

369
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:37,724
Where can I find a law book?

370
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,593
In the government office archives,

371
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:42,729
you can find a law book along
with records of every legal procedure.

372
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:44,598
And

373
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:48,368
I happen to have the key
to that archive.

374
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:50,871
Even if you are a government officer,

375
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,973
using that
for personal reasons is not allowed.

376
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:55,843
You will be in trouble
if the Magistrate finds out.

377
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,778
I doubt that.

378
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:00,147
I am Seong Yun Gyeom.

379
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:04,718
The Magistrate of Cheongsu County
is my father.

380
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,534
Are you looking for death?

381
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,470
I am destined to die anyway.

382
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:27,774
They are keeping me alive for now,
waiting to frame me later.

383
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,746
Take this.

384
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:35,449
Kkeutdongi brought it.

385
00:23:36,283 --> 00:23:39,319
My goodness,
this is such a precious thing.

386
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,023
The lady of that house said
to give it to you.

387
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,268
Come here!

388
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,274
My goodness.

389
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:04,578
What happened to your shoulder?
Is it okay?

390
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,981
But Mak Sim is too fragile already.

391
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:09,917
My lady.

392
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,453
Her face has become worn with care.

393
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:17,191
You look more worn out.
What are you saying?

394
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:18,525
Here, eat this.

395
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,928
I asked the jailers for some medicine.

396
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,630
Take it, and it will ease
the pain a little.

397
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,868
It does not hurt at all.
It just looks like it does.

398
00:24:27,868 --> 00:24:29,870
Look, it is getting better.

399
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,904
See for yourself.

400
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:34,341
See?

401
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,911
Do not worry about me.

402
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,614
Take care of yourself. Okay?

403
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,050
Eat up.

404
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,226
It is that way.

405
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:05,272
I told you it is that way.

406
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,509
This way is faster.
Do you not know shortcuts?

407
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:10,444
How do you know the shortcuts?

408
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:12,212
I memorized everything
the last time I came.

409
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:13,680
I am good at memorizing things.

410
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,418
Hurry up.

411
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,988
It is urgent. Why are you so slow?

412
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:50,684
Are there any Chinese characters
you do not know?

413
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:51,685
No.

414
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:55,489
I studied with my brother
while he was grave keeping.

415
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:58,258
So your swordsmanship was
also taught by him?

416
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:01,862
Yes. He worried about me being alone,
so he taught me.

417
00:26:03,872 --> 00:26:05,332
(Jijoo County Army)

418
00:26:05,332 --> 00:26:07,701
What are you writing down?

419
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:11,905
The investigation is
the Magistrate's job, is it not?

420
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,908
I am preparing
in case they escape punishment.

421
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:18,779
I have looked up legal articles
or precedents

422
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,381
to make sure Mak Sim
is not falsely punished.

423
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:26,587
Could I borrow more law books?

424
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,388
I want to read as much as I can.

425
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,124
Of course. Over there.

426
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:42,903
Do you know why I am helping you?

427
00:26:42,903 --> 00:26:44,805
Because I seem desperate to you?

428
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,107
When I saw you jump walls

429
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,911
and wield a blade against ruffians,
I was impressed.

430
00:26:56,183 --> 00:27:00,153
I used to think
women needed protection from men.

431
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:05,025
But you seem to have the courage
to protect even men.

432
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:11,532
I believe you can achieve what you want.

433
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,434
So I decided to help you.

434
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:18,539
I will surely succeed.

435
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,208
And in return for your help,

436
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:25,412
I will make sure to
save you too someday.

437
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,400
What is wrong with you?

438
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:06,153
What do you mean Dol Seok is missing?

439
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,423
Send people to find him now.

440
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:12,693
We must proceed quietly.

441
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,295
If the Magistrate finds out,
the trial will be delayed.

442
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:18,699
What if Dol Seok went to the Magistrate?

443
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,434
Do not worry, Madam.

444
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:23,370
He will meet the same fate
as the coroner before reaching him.

445
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:26,940
He ran away once before,

446
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,375
so he should be fleeing again.

447
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,646
The trial is in two days.
I hope nothing goes wrong.

448
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:35,616
Why not end it earlier
and be done with it?

449
00:28:45,526 --> 00:28:46,727
Your insolence has tarnished

450
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,229
the prestige of the Yuhyangso.

451
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:53,000
In the name of the chief
of Cheongsu County, I intended

452
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,637
to punish you severely,
but will conclude with restoring order

453
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:59,173
for your family's honor.

454
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,677
Is this an appeal for reconciliation?

455
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:05,712
It means I will forgive you.

456
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,414
Forgive?

457
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,817
If a not guilty verdict is reached,
Mak Sim will die.

458
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,886
Withdraw your accusation
before the verdict

459
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:14,588
and Mak Sim will be released.

460
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,090
They will even pay
for the dead slave's worth.

461
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,325
Accept it.

462
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:21,495
But only if you kneel before everyone.

463
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:27,534
Is it right to treat

464
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:30,337
a noble lady like this
without her father present?

465
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:33,407
Let us observe how it unfolds.

466
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:34,408
Then,

467
00:29:35,976 --> 00:29:39,346
how much will you pay
for Baekyi's worth?

468
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:41,682
In Cheongsu County,
slaves cost ten taels

469
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:43,483
and horses 30 taels.

470
00:29:43,483 --> 00:29:46,053
They will value her at 30 taels,
the cost of a horse.

471
00:29:46,053 --> 00:29:47,754
How generous of them.

472
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:48,989
In addition to that,

473
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:51,792
what about the Inspector's property,

474
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:54,695
including land and assets?

475
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,934
Even the sum is far too insufficient
to replace Baekyi.

476
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:03,203
Rejecting this is foolish.

477
00:30:03,203 --> 00:30:05,639
Do you not realize
there are no witnesses or evidence?

478
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,274
It is not that there is no evidence,

479
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,410
but instead, it was destroyed.

480
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:12,813
Offering a settlement
before the verdict is

481
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,315
akin to a confession.

482
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:16,783
Watch your words!

483
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:18,919
Do you wish to be charged
with defamation too?

484
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,388
The ones who should be arrested
are the lords

485
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:23,490
and madams here.

486
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:30,664
As per the Great Ming Code, Article 323,

487
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:33,734
private settlements
in criminal cases are prohibited.

488
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,035
And Article 405.

489
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,872
Settling a murder case privately

490
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:41,675
is subject to aggravated punishment.

491
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,078
Surely, the legal advocate knows this.

492
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:51,251
Then, I will see you tomorrow
at the government office.

493
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:00,294
She is truly a bold woman.

494
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,331
Does she appear so to you too?

495
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:19,413
Our Baekyi.

496
00:31:21,215 --> 00:31:22,850
This is all she had.

497
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,511
Are you there?

498
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,974
Have you come for more aloe?

499
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:28,015
Wait here a moment.

500
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,626
I am doomed to die anyway.

501
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,462
So I came to apologize.

502
00:32:43,664 --> 00:32:45,065
What are you talking about?

503
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:46,900
It is all because of me.

504
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,968
I...

505
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:50,804
I am the guilty one.

506
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,481
What is this?

507
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:05,152
What? Dol Seok, is that you?

508
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:07,588
Have you lost your mind?
Why are you doing this to me?

509
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:08,689
Are you insane?

510
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:13,393
What is wrong with you?
Are you really...

511
00:33:13,393 --> 00:33:15,028
Don't.

512
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:20,267
Do you think I want to do this?

513
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:23,904
I must follow orders
for both of us to survive.

514
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:27,508
Orders? By whom?

515
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:28,909
Baekyi.

516
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:32,546
Where are you?

517
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:35,749
Why is the Young Master here?

518
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,051
Baekyi.

519
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,654
Baekyi.

520
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:43,724
Madam said

521
00:33:45,492 --> 00:33:48,262
the young master must see this
to sever his attachment!

522
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,302
Stop it, Dol Seok.

523
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:58,572
What is going on?

524
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:01,375
Baekyi, you called me out first
for the first time.

525
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,646
Did you change your mind?

526
00:34:21,161 --> 00:34:22,162
Baekyi.

527
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,768
Baekyi.

528
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:31,705
What did you do to Baekyi?

529
00:34:32,306 --> 00:34:33,907
I asked you what you did to her!

530
00:34:40,247 --> 00:34:41,415
Stop it!

531
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:45,452
You fool!

532
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:49,723
Is this your order, Mother?

533
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:52,025
Did both of you
order Baekyi to be killed?

534
00:34:52,993 --> 00:34:56,263
Why do you always fail
and make things worse?

535
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,436
What crime did Baekyi commit?

536
00:35:03,337 --> 00:35:05,472
I liked her, but it was only me.

537
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:09,510
She did not even like me back.
So why kill her?

538
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:12,613
For a lowly slave

539
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,382
to sway your heart, isn't that a crime?

540
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,752
None of us were here.

541
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,721
I will send the coroner.

542
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,623
Handle it cleanly as a suicide.

543
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:25,959
Baekyi.

544
00:35:35,169 --> 00:35:36,637
What did our Baekyi

545
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:39,273
do wrong?

546
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,042
I committed a deadly sin.

547
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:45,712
What did she say?

548
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:50,317
Before she died, what did Baekyi say?

549
00:35:51,285 --> 00:35:52,886
Baekyi.

550
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:55,856
Hey, what is going on? Open your eyes!

551
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,292
It is better

552
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,261
to die like this

553
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:07,034
than to show an immoral act

554
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:14,208
to my love.

555
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:28,155
"My love?"

556
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:32,259
Am I her love?

557
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,264
Then, did Baekyi also...

558
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:39,867
Yes.

559
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:42,202
Not even once.

560
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,806
Not even once did she smile at me.

561
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:49,710
She only pushed me away.

562
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:52,913
I thought I was the only one
who loved her.

563
00:37:03,624 --> 00:37:05,526
Because of her status,

564
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,464
she must have pushed you away.

565
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,547
From the moment I saw Baekyi,
I fell for her.

566
00:37:27,648 --> 00:37:29,249
When I was seven years old,

567
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:34,221
I confessed my feelings
and gave her this stone.

568
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:37,224
Pure and white.

569
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:40,260
Does it not resemble Baekyi?

570
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:44,598
I never knew she kept it all this time.

571
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,902
She must have taken it out often

572
00:37:51,305 --> 00:37:53,106
to remember you.

573
00:37:53,373 --> 00:37:56,143
She also refused when I asked her
to leave with me.

574
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:57,177
That too,

575
00:37:59,146 --> 00:38:00,814
she must have regretted deeply.

576
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:10,924
So, please do not deny your feelings

577
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,927
for Baekyi.

578
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:16,630
Do not ignore her.

579
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,734
Please remember her.

580
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:25,472
I...

581
00:38:29,676 --> 00:38:31,979
I cannot testify.

582
00:38:34,681 --> 00:38:37,518
Even threatening her with adultery
is punishable by death.

583
00:38:38,218 --> 00:38:42,856
How could I testify
against my own parents?

584
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:02,809
Thank you for bringing Master Baek.

585
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:04,912
It was unexpected.

586
00:39:05,379 --> 00:39:08,615
I did not even imagine
Baek Do Gwang and Baekyi loved each other.

587
00:39:08,615 --> 00:39:10,050
Baek Do Gwang

588
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:13,987
cannot testify against his parents.

589
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:16,156
But it does not matter.

590
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,126
As long as you have Dol Seok,

591
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,428
the victory is yours.

592
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:23,163
I do not seek victory.

593
00:39:24,398 --> 00:39:26,133
I want to save Mak Sim.

594
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:28,869
This matter must bring punishment
to the Special Inspector Baek family

595
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,571
so Cheongsu County is restored.

596
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:33,774
If so, Dol Seok will face death.

597
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:37,611
He tried to harm Baekyi
so he must be punished.

598
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,146
No matter how evil the task,

599
00:39:40,581 --> 00:39:42,850
if ordered by their master,
a servant must obey.

600
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,854
If they refuse or resist
their master's command,

601
00:39:47,855 --> 00:39:48,989
they will be killed.

602
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:52,726
Even if they suffer injustice,

603
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,561
if they harm their master, they die.

604
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:58,031
If they are lucky enough to escape,

605
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,534
they'll live their lives in hiding.

606
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:03,704
If they are caught,

607
00:40:06,773 --> 00:40:08,609
they will still be killed.

608
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:11,411
Then, how do you plan to save Mak Sim?

609
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,146
I will find a way.

610
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,882
Are you going to kneel to them?

611
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:19,786
Legal advocates

612
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,690
do not fight by kneeling.

613
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:37,604
These will wear out.

614
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:41,141
These fine shoes are given
by Lady Tae Young.

615
00:40:41,141 --> 00:40:42,943
I must wear them sparingly.

616
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:49,917
I just thought

617
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:53,720
you seemed so lonely and pitiful.

618
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:59,526
Regardless of that man's status,
if he truly was your beloved,

619
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:02,963
I wished you would elope with him.

620
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:07,801
I just wanted my lady to be happy,
no matter what.

621
00:41:14,007 --> 00:41:15,676
Why is it that about you

622
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:20,147
I never knew anything?

623
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:27,087
I am sorry, Baekyi.

624
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:50,344
Everything will turn out fine, yes?

625
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:51,845
- It must.
- Indeed.

626
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:05,859
Dol Seok is missing.

627
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:07,561
It seems he has run away.

628
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:11,765
Regarding the death
of Ok Tae Young's servant Baekyi,

629
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:13,151
we have conducted further investigation.

630
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,436
A traumatic head injury was found
on Baekyi's skull

631
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:19,806
and traces of blood were discovered
at an abandoned house near Mount Unbong.

632
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,977
It is clear Baekyi was murdered.

633
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:25,045
Right.

634
00:42:26,046 --> 00:42:29,449
However, regarding the relationship
between Baekyi and Baek Do Gwang,

635
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:31,818
witness testimonies are inconsistent

636
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:34,555
and no direct evidence links

637
00:42:34,555 --> 00:42:36,957
their family to Baekyi's death.

638
00:42:37,891 --> 00:42:41,195
As such, the Baek family is

639
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:43,363
acquitted of the murder charges.

640
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:47,568
What will happen to our Mak Sim?

641
00:42:47,568 --> 00:42:49,903
If they are innocent,
what happens to Mak Sim?

642
00:42:50,771 --> 00:42:52,039
Mak Sim.

643
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:54,041
- Mak Sim.
- Mak Sim.

644
00:42:54,641 --> 00:42:56,243
Mak Sim, are you okay?

645
00:42:58,178 --> 00:42:59,913
What do I do now?

646
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:03,884
My lady.

647
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:12,626
My Lord.

648
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:14,828
According to Article 359
of The Great Ming Code,

649
00:43:14,828 --> 00:43:16,630
the punishment
for false accusation is hanging.

650
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,265
So the servant Mak Sim
who falsely accused others of murder

651
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:21,001
should be executed.

652
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,905
Will she be executed?

653
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:28,342
The false accusation against
Baek Do Gwang's family for murder

654
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:31,512
was not made by the servant Mak Sim,
but by me, Ok Tae Young.

655
00:43:32,212 --> 00:43:36,350
Yet they accuse Mak Sim
to avoid targeting me

656
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:39,553
and plan to use her
as an example to warn others.

657
00:43:39,553 --> 00:43:40,687
Nonsense.

658
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:44,124
We just seek punishment
for the guilty, according to the law.

659
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:47,661
Since Mak Sim did not
make the false accusation,

660
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:49,830
she will not be punished

661
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:52,566
for false accusation.

662
00:43:54,601 --> 00:43:57,471
- Lady Tae Young was right.
- This is how it should be.

663
00:43:58,338 --> 00:43:59,373
However,

664
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:01,942
the crime of insulting a noble

665
00:44:04,044 --> 00:44:06,213
must still be punished.

666
00:44:07,114 --> 00:44:10,851
Insulting a noble is
also punishable by hanging.

667
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,487
Unless the insult was directed
at their own master,

668
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,022
it does not warrant hanging.

669
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:20,227
According to Article 347
of The Great Ming Code,

670
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:22,196
if a noble is insulted,

671
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:24,131
the matter must be resolved
through the court

672
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:25,999
and private punishment is prohibited.

673
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:30,137
Furthermore, Mak Sim has
already been beaten

674
00:44:30,137 --> 00:44:31,939
and endured harsh imprisonment.

675
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:34,107
Thus, she should be acquitted
and released.

676
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:37,611
That is right.

677
00:44:37,611 --> 00:44:41,315
No parent could bear it

678
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,418
if their child were unjustly murdered.

679
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:52,326
Consider the heart of a mother
who has lost her child.

680
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,064
My son and my family were

681
00:44:57,064 --> 00:45:00,067
utterly humiliated by that lowly servant

682
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:03,003
and your house's scheming,
so what should I consider?

683
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:06,306
Punish her with death.

684
00:45:08,308 --> 00:45:09,576
Please...

685
00:45:11,445 --> 00:45:16,216
Servant Mak Sim, under Article 347
of The Great Ming Code,

686
00:45:16,216 --> 00:45:18,151
is sentenced for insulting a noble

687
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:25,559
to ten lashes.

688
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:32,533
My Lord, ten lashes for a body
already weakened by imprisonment?

689
00:45:32,533 --> 00:45:34,701
This is as good as winning, Madam.

690
00:45:34,701 --> 00:45:37,905
Looking at her,
a single slash could kill her.

691
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:40,107
Mak Sim.

692
00:45:43,076 --> 00:45:44,077
My lady.

693
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,749
What is going on?

694
00:45:48,749 --> 00:45:51,418
Our Mak Sim is going to die.

695
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:52,586
Mak Sim.

696
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,755
What do we do?

697
00:45:58,125 --> 00:45:59,660
She is going to die.

698
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:03,897
- My lady.
- Mak Sim.

699
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,067
Mak Sim.

700
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,205
Stop it!

701
00:46:15,742 --> 00:46:19,179
My Lord, I am the one
who falsely accused them of murder.

702
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:22,115
I am the one who insulted them.

703
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:25,752
If punishment must be dealt with
for these crimes,

704
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:28,856
I should be the one to be punished.

705
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:35,429
Please let me take the slashes instead.

706
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,631
No, that won't do.

707
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,533
Is this not a good idea?

708
00:46:39,533 --> 00:46:41,602
Give the order, My Lord.

709
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,070
That is unacceptable.

710
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,273
How could a noble be punished
in front of commoners?

711
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:47,541
Exactly.

712
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,344
What could be
a greater humiliation? Right?

713
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:57,818
What kind of noblewoman offers
to take punishment for a servant?

714
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:58,952
My lady.

715
00:46:58,952 --> 00:46:59,953
My lady.

716
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:02,923
What are you waiting for?
Bind her and slash her now!

717
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:08,762
My Lord! What are you doing?
Give the order!

718
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,999
- I said, slash her!
- I killed her.

719
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:18,405
Baekyi...

720
00:47:22,476 --> 00:47:24,084
was my beloved one.

721
00:47:29,186 --> 00:47:30,250
Baekyi...

722
00:47:31,066 --> 00:47:33,320
She was the woman
I loved since childhood!

723
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:37,090
Are you out of your mind?

724
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,192
Are you confessing?

725
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:40,861
Confessing? My son
has done nothing wrong!

726
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,196
Yes, that is correct.

727
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:44,665
I called Baekyi to run away together,

728
00:47:44,665 --> 00:47:46,233
but when she refused,

729
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,802
I killed her in anger
and staged it as a suicide.

730
00:47:48,802 --> 00:47:50,137
Enough!

731
00:47:50,737 --> 00:47:52,773
No, My Lord, this is not true!

732
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:57,244
Baek Do Gwang has confessed
to the murder.

733
00:47:57,244 --> 00:47:58,812
He shall be detained

734
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:01,315
and retried according to the law.

735
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:03,150
Dol Seok did it.

736
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,853
Where is Dol Seok? Bring him here now!

737
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:07,487
It was Dol Seok who tried to defile her!

738
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:09,957
- Did you not see it yourself?
- Do Gwang!

739
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:13,961
- Do Gwang!
- She is alive. She is alive.

740
00:48:14,328 --> 00:48:16,830
Get up now. Are you okay?

741
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:19,700
My lady.

742
00:48:21,635 --> 00:48:23,871
From now on, in Cheongsu County,

743
00:48:23,871 --> 00:48:25,706
it shall no longer be allowed

744
00:48:25,706 --> 00:48:28,709
to punish household servants
based on family rules.

745
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,912
How dare you dictate

746
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:34,481
how I govern my household servants!

747
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:36,550
The law does not dictate interference
in internal household matters is allowed.

748
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,752
Don't you know that?

749
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,623
Documents were found

750
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:45,626
hidden in the government's cabinet

751
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:48,695
detailing three years
of unaddressed petitions

752
00:48:48,695 --> 00:48:51,064
for reform in the Yuhyangso.

753
00:48:54,935 --> 00:48:57,804
The Yuhyangso,
which should maintain local order,

754
00:48:57,804 --> 00:48:59,673
instead exploited the people

755
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:02,743
for its own gain, oppressing them.

756
00:49:03,844 --> 00:49:06,513
Though servants are lowly by status,

757
00:49:06,513 --> 00:49:09,883
they are clearly still people
created by heaven.

758
00:49:11,552 --> 00:49:13,020
Henceforth, in Cheongsu County,

759
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:16,757
any punishment of servants
without due accusation

760
00:49:16,757 --> 00:49:20,460
or privately employing government servants
to disrupt the state

761
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:24,798
shall be strictly punished
according to the law.

762
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,768
This is a royal order.

763
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:43,083
My lady.

764
00:50:03,704 --> 00:50:04,805
Baekyi.

765
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,708
In your next life,

766
00:50:10,477 --> 00:50:12,346
please find love and happiness

767
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,718
that you could not have in this one.

768
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,356
Farewell, Baekyi.

769
00:50:31,231 --> 00:50:32,432
My dear child.

770
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,702
Baekyi.

771
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:42,409
In your next life, be born a noble.

772
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:49,183
Do not be born as my daughter again.

773
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:04,198
Baekyi.

774
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:15,943
Why did Baek Do Gwang make that choice?

775
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:20,247
He could not deny the feelings

776
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:23,617
he had for Baekyi, it seems.

777
00:51:27,621 --> 00:51:31,558
In any case, congratulations
on your first victory as a legal advocate.

778
00:51:32,993 --> 00:51:34,895
It is my first, and also my last.

779
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:39,266
In that case,
my help feels less worthwhile.

780
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:44,004
You asked if the man

781
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:47,841
who resembles you is my beloved.

782
00:51:49,877 --> 00:51:50,944
That man

783
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,482
seems to be my first love.

784
00:51:57,584 --> 00:52:00,787
At first, the difference
in status and circumstances

785
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,624
forced me to turn away.

786
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:07,528
Later, I refused to leave with him

787
00:52:08,662 --> 00:52:10,697
because of what I had to do.

788
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:15,969
But since I always kept his gifts
and cherished the memories,

789
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,940
those feelings must have been love.

790
00:52:23,377 --> 00:52:24,912
Now that I have realized it,

791
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,882
I cannot convey my feelings to him.

792
00:52:31,518 --> 00:52:36,423
But I also feel that I must not deny
or reject those feelings.

793
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:42,496
Do you regret not leaving with him?

794
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:49,069
You said it was the one thing
you wanted to remember as Goodeoki.

795
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,705
And now you want to erase even me.

796
00:52:54,074 --> 00:52:57,477
You should forget me too.

797
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:00,013
The life I received in place of the lady

798
00:53:00,914 --> 00:53:02,783
cannot be lived as Goodeoki.

799
00:53:05,552 --> 00:53:07,955
You are truly yourself now.

800
00:53:12,693 --> 00:53:13,694
Oh.

801
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,898
Even if we part ways,

802
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:21,468
let us keep them together
so they are not lonely.

803
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:26,740
And if you ever think of me someday,

804
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:29,743
could you look at them?

805
00:53:30,277 --> 00:53:31,712
Then I might feel

806
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,582
a little less lonely.

807
00:53:51,932 --> 00:53:55,269
My lady, I am told
I can take a leave now.

808
00:53:55,269 --> 00:53:57,538
It is all thanks to you.

809
00:53:58,272 --> 00:53:59,640
Is it not Lady Tae Young?

810
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,443
Thank you.

811
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:06,480
Thank you so much.

812
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,915
Lady Tae Young, thank you.

813
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:11,652
Thank you.

814
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:13,120
It is all thanks to you, Lady Tae Young.

815
00:54:15,189 --> 00:54:16,356
Lady Tae Young.

816
00:54:24,051 --> 00:54:24,932
No.

817
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:28,669
I do not regret it.

818
00:54:30,971 --> 00:54:32,806
Even if I can never see him again,

819
00:54:36,343 --> 00:54:38,512
the memories will not disappear.

820
00:54:47,521 --> 00:54:50,724
Baek Do Gwang is exiled
to an unknown island.

821
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:53,293
Special Inspector Baek's family
is ruined now.

822
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:55,896
Yuhyangso's reputation is in shambles.

823
00:54:55,896 --> 00:54:58,398
The officers who used to provide
information from the government

824
00:54:58,398 --> 00:55:00,701
are being replaced
by Songju County officers.

825
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:03,437
Moreover, the vacant
Special Inspector position

826
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:06,240
is to be selected
by the Magistrate himself.

827
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,709
What? But last time,
when yielding to Special Inspector,

828
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:11,478
it was promised
the next term would go to our lord.

829
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,113
Enough.

830
00:55:14,248 --> 00:55:16,783
How is the marriage proposal
for your daughter progressing?

831
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:19,152
Why do you ask all of the sudden?

832
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,524
Does the governor not have
a son at a marriageable age?

833
00:55:28,362 --> 00:55:29,563
Is he not Chon Seung Hwi?

834
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:32,399
Chon Seung Hwi.

835
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:37,004
Greetings. Enjoy your shopping.

836
00:55:39,406 --> 00:55:42,042
Why are there so many people
at the fabric shop?

837
00:55:42,042 --> 00:55:43,377
Did you not see the notice?

838
00:55:43,377 --> 00:55:45,112
There has been a drought for months now.

839
00:55:45,112 --> 00:55:46,213
I saw it.

840
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,249
But what does that have to do
with so many people here?

841
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:53,854
Well, the King declared

842
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:56,490
that balance
between yin and yang brings rain.

843
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:00,327
So he ordered all noble bachelors
and maidens to marry.

844
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:05,299
That is why everyone is scrambling
to get wedding clothes made.

845
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:07,734
Honestly,

846
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:11,605
how would the heavens know the difference
between nobles and commoners?

847
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:13,173
Are we not people too?

848
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:16,243
Why must only nobles marry each other?

849
00:56:16,243 --> 00:56:18,111
I really dislike this.

850
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:20,380
Then

851
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:24,618
I suppose Goodeoki
would also get married.

852
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:27,454
She is a noble now.

853
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:30,991
It is strange.

854
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:34,561
How did your statuses get reversed?

855
00:56:35,896 --> 00:56:39,833
Indeed, fate works in mysterious ways.

856
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:44,338
Even though there are so many women
admiring you,

857
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:46,807
are you still so upset?

858
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:47,808
Yes.

859
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:52,212
Enough to regret becoming
a professional storyteller.

860
00:56:58,919 --> 00:57:02,055
The Magistrate is looking for me?

861
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:03,056
Yes.

862
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:05,259
Why? For what?

863
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,594
How would I know? Am I the Magistrate?

864
00:57:07,594 --> 00:57:09,263
Wait! Hold on!

865
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:13,400
Could it be, maybe he wants...

866
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,702
Why would the Magistrate want our lady?
What for?

867
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:19,072
Is he not thinking
of making her his daughter-in-law?

868
00:57:19,673 --> 00:57:21,241
My goodness.

869
00:57:21,241 --> 00:57:24,778
What wonderful news this is!

870
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:26,213
This is too good.

871
00:57:26,213 --> 00:57:28,916
I must inform Madam
in Hanyang right away.

872
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,351
Yes, that's right.

873
00:57:31,351 --> 00:57:33,153
- I am leaving now.
- Thank goodness.

874
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:34,988
This is such wonderful news.

875
00:57:34,988 --> 00:57:36,356
My lady, wait for me.

876
00:57:36,823 --> 00:57:39,159
- Move your face away.
- Okay. Got it.

877
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:40,827
My lady.

878
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:44,965
I am so happy. This is great.

879
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,276
You recommended it,
so you should explain.

880
00:58:03,532 --> 00:58:04,232
Lady Tae Young.

881
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:10,924
Have you ever considered
becoming a legal advocate?

882
00:58:10,924 --> 00:58:13,026
She will do it.

883
00:58:16,196 --> 00:58:17,197
What did you say?

884
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:19,700
Legal advocate?

885
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,134
- Not marriage?
- Mak Sim!

886
00:58:27,074 --> 00:58:28,242
Please go on.

887
00:58:28,742 --> 00:58:29,743
We...

888
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:32,112
Well...

889
00:58:33,127 --> 00:58:36,517
I want to make Cheongsu County

890
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:38,685
a place where anyone
can seek justice fairly.

891
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:42,439
So, I was hoping you could help those

892
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,058
who cannot read or write.

893
00:59:01,322 --> 00:59:02,609
My goodness.

894
00:59:05,184 --> 00:59:08,170
Do you think I can handle
being a legal advocate?

895
00:59:08,482 --> 00:59:11,885
You did well
even in such a short time last time.

896
00:59:12,419 --> 00:59:16,790
That was because it involved Mak Sim
and Baekyi, who are my family.

897
00:59:17,926 --> 00:59:21,112
You worked for Cheongsu County
for three years requesting reforms

898
00:59:22,088 --> 00:59:23,997
and even looked after Dol Seok,
did you not?

899
00:59:24,431 --> 00:59:28,402
What? Did you tell the Magistrate
about what happened with Dol Seok?

900
00:59:29,102 --> 00:59:30,370
About what?

901
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:32,973
That you gave Dol Seok travel expenses

902
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:35,242
and disguised him to help him escape?

903
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:38,078
Come on, are you really
going to speak so loudly about it?

904
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:41,348
How can a man speak
in such a mumbling voice?

905
00:59:41,348 --> 00:59:45,652
But if they find out
you helped a criminal escape,

906
00:59:45,652 --> 00:59:47,221
you could be put to the rack.

907
00:59:47,221 --> 00:59:50,290
Lower your voice.

908
00:59:51,325 --> 00:59:52,326
To the rack...

909
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:53,527
This is ridiculous.

910
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:57,197
Seriously.

911
00:59:59,499 --> 01:00:02,536
The matter of Special Inspector Baek
is my failure

912
01:00:02,536 --> 01:00:04,738
as the chief of the Yuhyangso.

913
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:06,206
In the future, the Yuhyangso

914
01:00:07,174 --> 01:00:10,511
will focus solely on its original role
of supporting the government office.

915
01:00:10,511 --> 01:00:11,845
Regarding Special Inspector Baek,

916
01:00:11,845 --> 01:00:15,649
I was worried it might strain relations
with the Yuhyangso.

917
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:18,418
But you're so magnanimous.
That's a relief.

918
01:00:20,854 --> 01:00:24,358
Also, for those of Cheongsu County
struggling with drought,

919
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:28,095
I intend to open my granary
and distribute relief grain.

920
01:00:28,095 --> 01:00:30,864
Your generosity is
deeply appreciated, Scholar Cha.

921
01:00:30,864 --> 01:00:32,666
Thank you for your kindness.

922
01:00:35,903 --> 01:00:38,639
I heard you are choosing
the next Special Inspector.

923
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:42,442
If it's okay, I would like
to recommend three worthy candidates

924
01:00:42,442 --> 01:00:45,112
from which you may choose.

925
01:00:49,657 --> 01:00:51,051
That is an excellent idea.

926
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:57,925
Also, as all have daughters
at marriageable age,

927
01:00:57,925 --> 01:01:00,394
you can also consider them
as potential daughters-in-laws.

928
01:01:00,394 --> 01:01:04,264
This could be an opportunity
to find a match for your son as well.

929
01:01:04,264 --> 01:01:06,633
This is killing two birds
with one stone.

930
01:01:09,269 --> 01:01:13,173
That is also a splendid idea.

931
01:01:20,113 --> 01:01:21,982
So, you are saying

932
01:01:21,982 --> 01:01:25,619
you intend to use my marriage
as a political tool?

933
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:27,888
Does it not sound like a good plan?

934
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:29,790
If you form an alliance with
the Yuhyangso Special Inspectors family,

935
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,125
it will be hard to punish them
for their faults in the future.

936
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:34,261
It is the opposite.

937
01:01:34,261 --> 01:01:37,030
By allying with the next
Yuhyangso Special Inspector,

938
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,233
they will exercise more self-restraint.
Don't you agree?

939
01:01:40,621 --> 01:01:44,371
But you know I do not wish to marry.

940
01:01:44,945 --> 01:01:46,907
This is a royal order for marriage.

941
01:01:46,907 --> 01:01:50,277
If you disobey the king's command,
even our father will be punished.

942
01:01:50,277 --> 01:01:51,578
How can you say it is not your concern?

943
01:01:51,578 --> 01:01:53,013
You are saying that
because it is not your marriage.

944
01:01:54,781 --> 01:01:58,852
Perhaps, you have feelings
for a woman...

945
01:02:00,187 --> 01:02:02,189
Do you? Right?

946
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:08,128
I think Lady Tae Young would be
a fine match for my elder brother.

947
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:14,334
You are hesitating. Forget it.

948
01:02:14,334 --> 01:02:17,604
Just marry the daughter
of the next Special Inspector.

949
01:02:18,762 --> 01:02:22,109
Is there a suitable candidate
for the next Special Inspector?

950
01:02:25,315 --> 01:02:27,481
If you become
the Magistrate's daughter-in-law,

951
01:02:27,481 --> 01:02:30,417
your father's position
as Special Inspector will be guaranteed.

952
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:33,187
It is not just
the Special Inspectors position.

953
01:02:33,187 --> 01:02:36,690
If we become in-laws, the chief position
is only a matter of time.

954
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:38,392
Is that so?

955
01:02:51,038 --> 01:02:54,208
What? You are marrying Lady Seon Hui?

956
01:02:54,808 --> 01:02:57,244
Lady Seon Hui, the most beautiful woman
in Cheongsu County?

957
01:02:57,244 --> 01:03:00,080
You always pretend not to care
about women, but you picked well.

958
01:03:00,547 --> 01:03:01,882
I did not pick.

959
01:03:01,882 --> 01:03:04,017
It is a royal order,
so I am merely obeying it.

960
01:03:04,017 --> 01:03:05,018
But you are pleased.

961
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:08,055
Speak of the devil.
Your bride-to-be is here.

962
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:26,999
Oh my.

963
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:31,011
The Magistrate's son is marrying
Scholar Cha's daughter.

964
01:03:32,212 --> 01:03:35,382
What a mess. What are we going to do?

965
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:38,085
Then where will our lady be sent?

966
01:03:38,585 --> 01:03:40,087
From what I have heard,

967
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:42,689
Scholar Jang's son from the upper village
has no betrothal yet.

968
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:44,391
Why would he not?

969
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:47,995
Because there is nothing worthwhile
in that household.

970
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:51,331
By the way, have you seen
that son's face?

971
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:54,101
- No.
- He is even uglier than you.

972
01:03:54,101 --> 01:03:57,771
Oh my, I have never seen anyone
uglier than you in my life.

973
01:03:58,872 --> 01:04:00,908
Poor him. What do we do with that boy?

974
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:03,810
Wait a minute.

975
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:07,414
By the way,
is this a compliment or an insult?

976
01:04:07,414 --> 01:04:08,916
Anyway, it is not happening.

977
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:11,118
Do not ever bring it up
again, understood?

978
01:04:11,118 --> 01:04:13,220
Understood. No need to lose your temper.

979
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:16,456
But seriously, why did
the Magistrate call her to his house?

980
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:18,559
If he is not planning to make her
his daughter-in-law, why?

981
01:04:20,561 --> 01:04:21,995
This is heavy.

982
01:04:22,796 --> 01:04:24,298
Take your time and talk.

983
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:27,501
A woman as a legal advocate.

984
01:04:27,501 --> 01:04:28,936
You are truly remarkable.

985
01:04:28,936 --> 01:04:32,039
If it were not for the Magistrate,
I would not have dared to dream of it.

986
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,073
Do not say that.

987
01:04:33,807 --> 01:04:38,045
I have recorded various cases
for your reference. Read them carefully.

988
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:42,482
I expect they will greatly benefit
Cheongsu County in the future.

989
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,320
My Lord, please lower
your speech when addressing me.

990
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:47,080
Well...

991
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:51,040
Shall I?

992
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:54,579
You are here.

993
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:59,166
Lady, I did not know you were here.

994
01:04:59,166 --> 01:05:00,472
I was just about to leave.

995
01:05:00,968 --> 01:05:04,571
If there is anything you do not know,
feel free to come by and ask.

996
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:08,509
And since it is late,

997
01:05:08,509 --> 01:05:11,044
escort the young lady to her home.

998
01:05:11,044 --> 01:05:13,914
No, thank you.
My servants are with me, so it is fine.

999
01:05:14,715 --> 01:05:16,483
You are about to enter into a marriage.

1000
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:18,552
I am concerned
it might cause unnecessary rumors.

1001
01:05:18,552 --> 01:05:21,355
I have been careless once again.

1002
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:25,158
Well, since it is late, get inside.

1003
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:37,171
Why can he not marry Lady Tae Young?

1004
01:05:37,171 --> 01:05:41,041
Father intends to ally
with the Special Inspector's family.

1005
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:44,011
How could I defy that wish?

1006
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:45,379
Is that not so, Father?

1007
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:48,916
Do not live
as obliviously as your elder brother.

1008
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:50,884
- Let us go inside.
- Yes.

1009
01:05:59,526 --> 01:06:01,094
I am sorry, my lady.

1010
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:02,763
It is fine. Take your time.

1011
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:06,233
- Let us go now.
- Okay.

1012
01:06:09,536 --> 01:06:12,806
Considering she left the Magistrates home
with a pile of gifts,

1013
01:06:12,806 --> 01:06:14,575
the Magistrate might be planning

1014
01:06:14,575 --> 01:06:17,444
to remarry.

1015
01:06:17,444 --> 01:06:19,713
We already suspected this.

1016
01:06:19,713 --> 01:06:23,116
Since the Special Inspector case,
they have been in sync.

1017
01:06:23,116 --> 01:06:25,485
She is cunning,
the more I think about it.

1018
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:29,089
She needs a marriage
but lacks a suitable prospect,

1019
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:31,892
so she aims for the Magstrate's position
to seize power.

1020
01:06:31,892 --> 01:06:35,495
It is certain she will cause chaos
at the Mothers' Sanctuary.

1021
01:06:45,772 --> 01:06:49,109
Why did you go there late at night
with the young master still at home?

1022
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:52,946
- What are you saying?
- The daughter of a ruined family

1023
01:06:52,946 --> 01:06:55,482
shamelessly flaunting herself
with a body tainted by bandits.

1024
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:58,452
Do you think you can become
the mistress of the Seong family?

1025
01:06:58,452 --> 01:06:59,553
Mother.

1026
01:06:59,553 --> 01:07:02,956
The Magistrate could fall for her
if she sets her mind on seducing him.

1027
01:07:03,624 --> 01:07:06,093
If needed,
I will find another match for you.

1028
01:07:06,093 --> 01:07:08,028
You and the governor's family
must never unite.

1029
01:07:10,504 --> 01:07:11,365
Until now,

1030
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:15,169
I have ignored your slander
about me and my family

1031
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:18,238
because none of it was true.

1032
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:22,843
But today will be
the last time I endure it.

1033
01:07:23,277 --> 01:07:25,652
What will you do
if you do not endure it?

1034
01:07:25,653 --> 01:07:27,915
I will file defamation charges
against every one of you

1035
01:07:28,348 --> 01:07:29,950
and make you face the consequences.

1036
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,853
So, do not dishonor me and my family

1037
01:07:34,188 --> 01:07:35,989
with baseless accusations anymore.

1038
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:37,357
Who says they are baseless?

1039
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:39,793
Someone clearly saw you
entering that house.

1040
01:07:39,793 --> 01:07:43,564
I went to get the litigation records
as I was offered to be a legal advocate.

1041
01:07:43,564 --> 01:07:48,502
Thus, you must not spread slander
that tarnishes the Magistrate's name.

1042
01:07:50,337 --> 01:07:52,139
Especially if you hope to become family.

1043
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:53,173
If you do not want misunderstandings,

1044
01:07:53,173 --> 01:07:55,542
stay away from the legal advocate role.
Understood?

1045
01:07:55,542 --> 01:07:57,978
- How dare you make such excuses!
- Let us leave.

1046
01:07:58,445 --> 01:07:59,613
Those excuses.

1047
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:01,782
Do you truly believe that story?

1048
01:08:14,595 --> 01:08:17,130
Eavesdropping is not my hobby,

1049
01:08:17,564 --> 01:08:19,733
but I happened to overhear everything.

1050
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:23,804
I apologize
for causing such misunderstandings.

1051
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:26,874
In the future...

1052
01:08:26,874 --> 01:08:28,308
If we continue speaking like this,

1053
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:30,711
it will lead to more misunderstandings.

1054
01:08:31,645 --> 01:08:32,646
I will take my leave.

1055
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:34,815
But...

1056
01:08:48,595 --> 01:08:50,264
- You are here.
- Father.

1057
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:53,967
How could Scholar Moon
become a Special Inspector?

1058
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,869
He was not even a candidate
for the position.

1059
01:08:55,869 --> 01:09:00,040
The Magistrate never intended to accept
the chief's recommendation from the start.

1060
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,142
To think he would betray us like this.

1061
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:03,777
My precious rice!

1062
01:09:03,777 --> 01:09:05,546
Then what about the marriage?

1063
01:09:05,546 --> 01:09:08,048
What will happen to my wedding, Father?

1064
01:09:08,048 --> 01:09:09,616
I heard his son's wedding
will proceed as planned.

1065
01:09:09,616 --> 01:09:12,286
But Scholar Moon
doesn't even have a daughter.

1066
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:14,788
So who exactly is the wedding with?

1067
01:09:15,088 --> 01:09:16,290
Ridiculous!

1068
01:09:23,297 --> 01:09:24,331
Tae Young.

1069
01:09:25,632 --> 01:09:26,767
Grandmother!

1070
01:09:29,436 --> 01:09:32,072
Why have you come without sending word?

1071
01:09:32,372 --> 01:09:34,641
The matter was urgent,
so I came quickly.

1072
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:36,610
Why? What is happening?

1073
01:09:36,610 --> 01:09:39,446
A marriage proposal has arrived
from Hanyang.

1074
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:41,515
A marriage proposal?

1075
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:53,594
With her wisdom and intelligence

1076
01:09:53,594 --> 01:09:54,261
(Marriage Proposal)

1077
01:09:54,261 --> 01:09:56,697
and warm and gentle nature,

1078
01:09:56,697 --> 01:10:00,300
I humbly request she become the bride
of my eldest son, Seong Yun Gyeom.

1079
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,336
Will you grant it?

1080
01:10:02,703 --> 01:10:05,973
It is the Magistrate's son, is it not?

1081
01:10:05,973 --> 01:10:08,475
Hold on a moment.
Madam has not finished yet.

1082
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:12,246
No matter the challenges we face,

1083
01:10:12,246 --> 01:10:15,983
we will be a steadfast roof
and wall for her.

1084
01:10:15,983 --> 01:10:19,286
(We vow to overcome
any adversity together.)

1085
01:10:19,286 --> 01:10:22,022
(Our family promises this
with all sincerity.)

1086
01:10:22,022 --> 01:10:23,690
(If you grant this union,)

1087
01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:26,960
(it will bring honor
and joy to our family.)

1088
01:10:27,694 --> 01:10:30,764
Are you certain about this decision?

1089
01:10:31,498 --> 01:10:36,370
Yes, I wish to marry Lady Tae Young.

1090
01:10:37,037 --> 01:10:39,039
You should have said
so earlier, Brother.

1091
01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:45,879
From the descendant
of the Changnyeong Seong clan, Gyu Jin.

1092
01:10:45,879 --> 01:10:46,914
Gyu Jin?

1093
01:10:48,415 --> 01:10:50,651
- Great.
- Wonderful.

1094
01:10:52,019 --> 01:10:53,453
This is great news.

1095
01:10:57,024 --> 01:11:01,695
So there will be no reconciliation
with Yuhyangso.

1096
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:07,167
I never intended to work
with Yuhyangso from the beginning.

1097
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:10,737
Did you always consider Lady Tae Young
as your daughter-in-law?

1098
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:11,972
If not,

1099
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:14,741
why would I keep her close
and observe her?

1100
01:11:14,741 --> 01:11:17,144
Then why did you not order
the marriage sooner?

1101
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:19,179
You hesitated, you fool.

1102
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:21,715
You.

1103
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,086
Marriage is not a trivial matter.

1104
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:29,556
It takes over the entire life
of a woman.

1105
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,860
So I waited for you
to decide on your own

1106
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,295
with the determination
to take full responsibility.

1107
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:38,632
I wanted you to
make the choice yourself.

1108
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:42,536
I thought I was unworthy
of Lady Tae Young.

1109
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:46,006
Yes, keep that resolve for life.

1110
01:11:46,006 --> 01:11:48,242
Cherish and respect each other.

1111
01:11:48,242 --> 01:11:51,378
Consult on everything,
and live well together.

1112
01:11:51,378 --> 01:11:53,280
That is all you need to do.

1113
01:11:53,947 --> 01:11:54,948
Yes.

1114
01:11:54,948 --> 01:12:00,320
Of course, that depends on whether
Tae Young accepts your proposal, right?

1115
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:01,321
Yes.

1116
01:12:01,922 --> 01:12:02,923
What?

1117
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:07,561
I hope she accepts it.

1118
01:12:11,798 --> 01:12:13,767
Why are you hesitating?

1119
01:12:13,767 --> 01:12:15,269
Exactly.

1120
01:12:15,802 --> 01:12:18,705
Where else would you find
such a father-in-law?

1121
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:23,143
And the groom is the finest gentleman
in Cheongsu County.

1122
01:12:23,143 --> 01:12:26,146
You both know why I am acting this way.

1123
01:12:26,813 --> 01:12:30,317
What if I get married
and my true identity is revealed?

1124
01:12:31,251 --> 01:12:32,853
It will bring ruin

1125
01:12:33,487 --> 01:12:35,656
not only to the Ok family
but also the Seong family.

1126
01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:38,358
It will not be revealed.

1127
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:40,494
It has not been revealed so far.
What is the worry?

1128
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:43,030
Even walking without a veil,
no one noticed!

1129
01:12:43,797 --> 01:12:45,732
But what if I marry and have children?

1130
01:12:45,732 --> 01:12:47,234
What if I am discovered then?

1131
01:12:47,968 --> 01:12:49,636
I will be executed by dismemberment

1132
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:52,773
and my children will be enslaved.

1133
01:12:53,307 --> 01:12:54,708
Wait a second.

1134
01:12:54,708 --> 01:12:57,878
You said you would not marry,
but you thought about children already.

1135
01:12:57,878 --> 01:13:00,881
That is not the point.

1136
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:02,416
What to do now?

1137
01:13:04,484 --> 01:13:07,921
If you do not marry,
I will be flogged in public.

1138
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:09,857
And most likely,

1139
01:13:10,357 --> 01:13:13,360
I will die after just a few slashes.

1140
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:16,096
Madam.

1141
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:21,735
Since it is the royal order,

1142
01:13:22,236 --> 01:13:24,505
you must marry someone anyway.

1143
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:27,508
If you dislike
the Magistrate's family so much,

1144
01:13:27,508 --> 01:13:30,143
you can marry
into the Jang family instead.

1145
01:13:30,143 --> 01:13:34,314
They say their family expects
their daughter-in-law to bear 12 sons.

1146
01:13:35,482 --> 01:13:38,485
If anything happens,
I will take responsibility.

1147
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:39,853
Do not be afraid.

1148
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:46,693
Can I really go through with the wedding
in place of Lady Tae Young?

1149
01:13:46,693 --> 01:13:48,128
What do you mean by "in place of"?

1150
01:13:48,562 --> 01:13:51,765
No matter what others says,
you are my granddaughter, Tae Young.

1151
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,403
You cleared Baekyi's wrongful charges
and saved Mak Sim.

1152
01:13:57,604 --> 01:14:00,007
And you gained the Magistrate's favor.

1153
01:14:00,007 --> 01:14:02,376
All these connections are your doing.

1154
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,986
Why are you delaying
the betrothal letter?

1155
01:14:12,986 --> 01:14:16,423
Are you perhaps thinking
of rejecting my proposal?

1156
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:21,562
Why do you want to
marry me, Young Master?

1157
01:14:22,262 --> 01:14:25,732
I understand I may not have
many prospects, but you are different.

1158
01:14:26,266 --> 01:14:29,937
You already heard I have someone I love.

1159
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:32,272
You said you refused to leave with him.

1160
01:14:32,806 --> 01:14:35,475
You even said
you do not regret parting ways.

1161
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:38,612
Moreover, as a storyteller,
his status differs from yours.

1162
01:14:38,612 --> 01:14:40,447
A marriage would be impossible anyway.

1163
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:44,151
If he looks exactly like me,

1164
01:14:45,319 --> 01:14:48,488
you can think of me
as him if that helps.

1165
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:53,627
This is a marriage you must go through.

1166
01:14:53,627 --> 01:14:57,731
I hear your only other prospect is
Jang Pil Ju from the upper village.

1167
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:01,134
Surely, I am a better option than him.

1168
01:15:01,134 --> 01:15:03,470
That is all about me.

1169
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:06,974
You still have not answered
why you wish to marry me.

1170
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:13,981
Among all the women I know,

1171
01:15:15,282 --> 01:15:17,117
you are the one I like the most.

1172
01:15:19,553 --> 01:15:21,855
Your ideals are the same as mine.

1173
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:25,492
No matter what I do,

1174
01:15:25,993 --> 01:15:29,563
I find myself wondering
how you might feel about it.

1175
01:15:30,631 --> 01:15:34,168
If you were to marry someone else,

1176
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,837
I would not be able
to speak with you anymore.

1177
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,875
I could not bear that.

1178
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:46,213
Does that answer your question?

1179
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,319
Hearing your answer makes it
even clearer that I cannot.

1180
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:54,555
- Why not?
- What if

1181
01:15:55,522 --> 01:15:59,760
I have a secret
that must never be revealed?

1182
01:16:03,864 --> 01:16:05,832
Who does not have secrets?

1183
01:16:08,268 --> 01:16:09,403
Keep them hidden.

1184
01:16:10,537 --> 01:16:12,406
If no one knows, it is not a problem.

1185
01:16:16,543 --> 01:16:18,846
I cannot do that.

1186
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:21,114
Then tell me your secret.

1187
01:16:24,151 --> 01:16:27,187
I will protect you.

1188
01:16:38,498 --> 01:16:41,068
Why do you walk away without telling me?

1189
01:16:41,068 --> 01:16:43,737
The person you want to marry is not me.

1190
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:47,741
The one who shares
your ideals is not me.

1191
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:49,109
Then who is it?

1192
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:50,744
Is it your other self?

1193
01:16:51,211 --> 01:16:54,014
Am I so intolerable that you would act

1194
01:16:54,882 --> 01:16:56,517
as if you are someone else?

1195
01:16:56,517 --> 01:16:57,918
That is not it.

1196
01:16:59,253 --> 01:17:00,687
Young Master, I am...

1197
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:05,292
I am not truly myself.

1198
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:09,296
I do not understand.

1199
01:17:10,931 --> 01:17:12,099
Lady So Hye,

1200
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:19,106
the daughter of Lord Kim Nak Su,

1201
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:23,510
I am her...

1202
01:18:36,316 --> 01:18:40,888
(The Tale of Lady Ok)

1203
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:44,057
Please save me.

1204
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,526
Forget about Goodeoki

1205
01:18:45,526 --> 01:18:47,561
and let us leave
this dreadful Chungcheong-do.

1206
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:50,464
Why do my steps feel so heavy?

1207
01:18:50,464 --> 01:18:52,332
I don't know.

1208
01:18:53,267 --> 01:18:54,635
Is this truly necessary?

1209
01:18:55,636 --> 01:18:57,237
That is all gold.

1210
01:18:57,704 --> 01:19:00,574
It was discovered in Mt. Unbong.

1211
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:03,710
All I heard was
that this was the last trade.

1212
01:19:06,647 --> 01:19:10,384
You must capture all the remnants
of the traitorous faction immediately.

1213
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:13,921
Hurry, get inside!

1214
01:19:13,921 --> 01:19:15,255
Do you know who I am?

1215
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:18,458
I am not doing this to help you,
just so you know.
