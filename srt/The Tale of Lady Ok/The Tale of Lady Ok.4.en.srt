1
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,002
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,038
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:49,049
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,626
Why did you walk away just like that?

5
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,296
Young Master, the person
you want to marry is not me.

6
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,798
Am I so unbearable that you'd pretend

7
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,067
to be someone else?

8
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,902
It's not like that.

9
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,805
Young Master...

10
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:15,876
Lady So Hye,

11
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,114
the daughter of Lord Kim Nak Su,

12
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,452
I am her...

13
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,492
Come here.

14
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,127
- It is not her.
- Yes.

15
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,329
This is not her.

16
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,531
Not her, either.

17
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,066
Come here.

18
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,068
It is not her. Scatter to search now.

19
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,607
Go die! You filthy maggot, just go die!

20
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:23,243
Those villains and that lady seem
to go to Songju County.

21
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,914
I knew they would be after me,

22
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,451
but I did not expect them
to come this far.

23
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,453
Her fiancé was taken away

24
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,722
by her servant Goodeoki,

25
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,341
and she got a chamber pot
dumped over her head.

26
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,959
I would chase her
to the ends of the world too.

27
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,435
You must have been very startled.

28
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,206
I thought I was prepared
to accept any secret.

29
00:02:52,206 --> 00:02:54,450
But honestly, I was surprised.

30
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,811
The reason you rejected my proposal
was not because of me.

31
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,346
That's a relief.

32
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,316
No matter how necessary it is,

33
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,953
I am afraid of marriage.

34
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,723
I can act as a noble for myself.

35
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,426
But if I marry, there will be heirs.

36
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,095
How could the child of a servant

37
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,999
dare to carry on
the lineage of a noble family?

38
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:22,002
Please, Young Master.

39
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,606
Please keep this a secret.

40
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:35,182
If you are worried
that I might reveal the secret,

41
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:40,988
shall I share a secret of my own,
that cannot be revealed, either?

42
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,028
Your secret can't compare to mine.

43
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:58,505
I did not wish for marriage, either.

44
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,010
I...

45
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,948
cannot embrace a woman.

46
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,886
Huh?

47
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,522
If this secret is revealed,

48
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,359
I would not escape death as well.

49
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:23,030
So please forgive me

50
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,599
for not being honest.

51
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:36,543
Didn't you promise me
that you would save me once?

52
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,413
Yes.

53
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:40,714
Then

54
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:43,584
marry me and become
the daughter-in-law of the Magistrate.

55
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:49,056
I will become a shelter for you.

56
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:59,499
I believe this way, it can save us both.

57
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,305
After marriage,
even if someone recognizes you,

58
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,141
they will just think Goodeoki resembles
the Magistrate's daughter-in-law.

59
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,943
This will put an end to it.

60
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,145
As you know,

61
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:17,284
there are many people in this world
who look alike.

62
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:32,165
♪The bride step forward♪

63
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:47,481
♪Bow with respect♪

64
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,354
♪Respond politely♪

65
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,678
She is even more beautiful
than I imagined.

66
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,846
Indeed.

67
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:21,348
Who would believe
that she used to be the grimy Goodeoki?

68
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,718
Even her lady would not recognize her.

69
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,058
Alright, let us just leave.

70
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,125
Why?

71
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:36,163
Does seeing her in person
make your heart ache?

72
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:39,366
Why did you insist on coming here
in the first place?

73
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,270
For artists like us,

74
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,540
even wounds like these
become source for our work.

75
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,743
Anyway, I have seen enough. Let us go.

76
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,880
Well, since we are here,

77
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,082
let us sprinkle some salt on the wound.

78
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,483
For the sake of art.

79
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,586
Let us take a good look
at the groom's face.

80
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,157
Let me see.

81
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:27,114
Huh? No way.

82
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:34,154
How can...

83
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:50,137
How can there be someone
who looks exactly like you?

84
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,873
Do you happen to have a twin brother?

85
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:56,944
Did your mother also have an affair
with the Magistrate?

86
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,478
- You...
- How dare I...

87
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,380
Stop the nonsense.

88
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,282
I was just too shocked.

89
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,619
What is so similar
that you are making such a fuss?

90
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,921
You two were not just similar.
You were identical.

91
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,123
I thought it was
some kind of magic trick.

92
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,459
He is neat and handsome.

93
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,062
But I do not see the resemblance.

94
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,598
If it were me,
I'd think I was looking in a mirror.

95
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,167
Then tell me.

96
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:24,137
Why would she marry someone
who looks like me?

97
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,472
Huh?

98
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:28,609
Could it be that she wanted to marry him
to keep remembering me?

99
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,843
Why would you think that?

100
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,144
It is strange.

101
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,515
Out of all the people, why would she marry
someone who looks like me?

102
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,850
If the face is the same,
I'd marry the Magistrate's son too.

103
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,852
Why?

104
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:41,688
What is wrong with me? I'm very popular.

105
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,891
As an artist, you are.

106
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:46,226
But not as a man. Let us be honest.

107
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,096
Not as a man? Honestly?

108
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51,532
Honestly, the Magistrate's son

109
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,867
is incredibly rich
and skilled in martial arts.

110
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,870
He's much more better
than a wandering storyteller

111
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,240
of illegitimate birth like you.

112
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,943
Stop using honesty as an excuse
to cross the line!

113
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:08,071
You cannot marry
because of your status anyway.

114
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:10,184
Forget about Goodeoki

115
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,953
and let us leave
this dreadful Chungcheong-do.

116
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,224
This is very strange.

117
00:09:18,492 --> 00:09:22,496
Why do my steps feel so heavy?

118
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,402
Oh.

119
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:31,004
Father, there they come.

120
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,718
Even the weather is perfect today.

121
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,779
Get inside.

122
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,128
Tae Young.

123
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,697
This is your room.

124
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,815
Am I really allowed to use this room?

125
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:52,786
Of course. This study is for you.

126
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:55,088
Father has also arranged an office
for your duties

127
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,090
as a legal advocate
near the government office.

128
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:02,062
From now on,
consider me your own father.

129
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:06,967
I will be your strong
and steadfast support.

130
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:12,072
As both a legal advocate and the eldest
daughter-in-law of the Seong family,

131
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,042
I will strive to fulfill my duties
without lacking, Father.

132
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:18,208
And if you can

133
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,783
give me a grandchild
calling me "Grandpa",

134
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,619
that would be even better, right?

135
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,990
Aren't you being too rushed?

136
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,358
No, I am not.

137
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,293
You should hurry up.

138
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,863
I am starting to feel shy.

139
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,507
This household even gets
new clothes tailored for the servants.

140
00:11:46,507 --> 00:11:49,710
- How do I look?
- You look at least ten years younger.

141
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,845
- You might even get married, Dokki.
- Really?

142
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,747
Stop talking nonsense about marriage.

143
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:58,118
You ungrateful thing! You said
you would serve the Ok family forever.

144
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,686
Why did you come along?

145
00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,955
That is such a sad thing to say.

146
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,958
Mak Sim, can you live without me?

147
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,959
I cannot.

148
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,328
Even if you scold me all the time,

149
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,131
I need to see your face day and night.

150
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,066
Day and night,

151
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,336
I feel like my insides are burning
in anger when I see your face.

152
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,005
Really?

153
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,706
Am I that bad?

154
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,177
If there were a state examination
for being ugly,

155
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:26,346
yo'd be the top one for sure.

156
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,182
That'd be a good thing.

157
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,717
- Topping an exam is always good.
- Goodness.

158
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,153
Is that how you feel about me?

159
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,822
What is this drink?
It smells so strange.

160
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:39,026
It is a liquor
made from epimedium herbs.

161
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,894
The cloth seller Gong drank this

162
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,996
and has six sons now.

163
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,198
- Really?
- Let me tell you.

164
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,133
Just one sip of this

165
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:48,635
and an 80-year-old man
can urinate hundreds of li away.

166
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,871
Stop it .

167
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,739
Why are you so embarrassed?

168
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,576
- I can urinate thousands of li.
- My goodness.

169
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:08,789
Now that you are home,
you should rest in your room.

170
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,525
Would that be okay?

171
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,560
I will tell the servants
that you should rest well

172
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:17,631
since the military examination
will be soon.

173
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,534
As you said,
with the upcoming examination,

174
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,302
there will be days I cannot come home.

175
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,974
Shall I pour you another drink?

176
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,277
No, that is enough. I must step out.

177
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,112
Now?

178
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:36,984
I have a lot things to deal with.

179
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:47,561
How dare he fooled
my daughter like that!

180
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,800
How humiliating!

181
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,138
The Magistrate must have a weakness.

182
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,441
Once I grasp it,

183
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:06,747
I will break his neck
to cut off his breath.

184
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:10,784
One.

185
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:12,129
Two.

186
00:14:13,815 --> 00:14:14,255
One.

187
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,082
Two.

188
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:20,033
One.

189
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,970
Once Moon Soo is here,
we should move to the safe house.

190
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,573
We're getting bigger and bigger,

191
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,209
so we should be cautious when training.

192
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:38,111
Are you bringing Moon Soo here yourself?

193
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:39,179
Of course.

194
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,449
You are newly married.
What if your wife finds out?

195
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,487
She does not know what you are doing.

196
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,826
I must take care
not to let her find out.

197
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:24,858
(Heart)

198
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:45,139
(Heart)

199
00:15:47,748 --> 00:15:50,784
(Heart)

200
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,290
From now on,
keep enough social distance.

201
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:58,559
If five or more gather,

202
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,061
they will be deemed rebels
and be punished.

203
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,196
Are you clear?

204
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:05,832
What is this?
They forced marriages on us

205
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,434
and now they imposed distancing.

206
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:11,338
Why does this king have so many orders
about what to do or not to do?

207
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,041
Well, he took the throne by coup.

208
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,709
So coup must be his
greatest fear, right?

209
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,445
You'd never know
when rebels might strike.

210
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,047
So he cannot fall asleep easily.

211
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:23,417
That is a problem for Hanyang.
This little village has no rebels.

212
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,485
Even if you searched,
there would be none.

213
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:28,188
Lord Bak Jun Gi.

214
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,532
I heard you became the Mining Inspector

215
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:31,692
(Mining Inspector: officer for exploring mines)
for the Chungcheong region.

216
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,861
But you are here
in a humble place like this.

217
00:16:33,861 --> 00:16:36,096
Do not say that.

218
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,732
Aren't we like brothers?

219
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,902
Is the Minister of War doing well?

220
00:16:41,902 --> 00:16:43,070
Actually,

221
00:16:43,637 --> 00:16:47,107
he has sent me
to deliver something to you.

222
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,542
What is it?

223
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,713
Take a look.

224
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,621
This is an outcrop, right?

225
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,995
It's all gold there.

226
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,598
I discovered this outcrop

227
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,169
in Mt. Unbong over there.

228
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:18,605
Mt. Unbong?

229
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,775
Do you mean the Mt. Unbong
in Cheongsu County?

230
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:22,776
Exactly.

231
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:34,454
Are you asking me to mine the gold
in Mt. Unbong and send it over?

232
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,290
Just send the amount they want

233
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:38,725
and the rest will be ours.

234
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,361
Don't you know what happens
if the discovered outcrop

235
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,930
is not reported to the court?

236
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,866
That is why we must hide it well.

237
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,204
You were framed for the Minister of War's
corruption and forced to live a rural life.

238
00:17:50,838 --> 00:17:52,906
Do you plan to be used again
by the Minister of War and Bak Jun Gi?

239
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,907
Used?

240
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,676
I received the position
of Chief in return

241
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,645
and thanks to that, you can manage
the Mother's Sanctuary and the Academy.

242
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:01,081
Do you think I hold the position
because I am the chief's wife?

243
00:18:01,982 --> 00:18:04,051
Mother's Sanctuary
and Cheongsu Academy

244
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,053
are the fruits of my efforts.

245
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,254
Fine.

246
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:10,357
But with the strict Magistrate,
I cannot even skim from tributes

247
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,192
and it is suffocating.

248
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:15,462
We are short on funds
for Deok Hun's wedding

249
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,297
and we cannot find
a proper match for him.

250
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,099
- Absolutely not.
- My dear.

251
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,269
What if the Magistrate finds out
and reports this to the court?

252
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,906
We would not only lose
the Chief's position but also utter ruin!

253
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:26,907
My dear!

254
00:18:28,976 --> 00:18:30,177
What nonsense is this?

255
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,012
Don't bring this up again.

256
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:44,791
Do you mean we should give up
the gold mine in fear of the Magistrate?

257
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,326
That is ridiculous.

258
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,928
Someone finally understands.

259
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:50,197
I will cooperate,

260
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:53,066
but keep it from your wife.

261
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,269
Will you do that?

262
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:59,640
To think such a treasure is buried
in Mt. Unbong...

263
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,378
If you fund the mining operation,

264
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,314
we will split the profits as agreed.

265
00:19:08,682 --> 00:19:10,450
That is fair.

266
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,487
But since this is risky,

267
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:17,357
I have one condition.

268
00:19:20,394 --> 00:19:22,095
To become in-laws?

269
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:25,799
Do you mean
between Deok Hun and Seon Hui?

270
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,836
After what happened,
our Seon Hui has nowhere else to go.

271
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,737
You must take responsibility.

272
00:19:31,405 --> 00:19:34,508
How is it our fault
that the Magistrate changed his mind?

273
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:38,412
Besides, Deok Hun is
already in marriage talks in Hanyang.

274
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:39,746
So that will be hard for us.

275
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,816
I will offer you a house
in the prime area of Hanyang.

276
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,588
I will also provide all the support
Deok Hun needs to go forward.

277
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:07,274
They make such a perfect couple, right?

278
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,511
Indeed.

279
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,479
We must hurry
with the wedding preparations.

280
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,385
Next.

281
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:20,787
Number 26.

282
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:22,035
Next.

283
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:25,859
You from the fish stall!
Did you just cut in line?

284
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:27,828
Go to the back.

285
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,732
I am watching closely
with my own eyes,

286
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,634
so everyone stay in line.

287
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:41,175
It is true that your mother donated
farmland to Deokheung Temple.

288
00:20:41,175 --> 00:20:43,544
How could she sign such a document?

289
00:20:43,544 --> 00:20:47,080
Her head is not clear these days.
How pitiful!

290
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:52,953
Then go to the physician

291
00:20:52,953 --> 00:20:55,756
and obtain a medical statement
about her condition.

292
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,192
If it can be proven
she was not in a good state,

293
00:20:58,192 --> 00:20:59,826
we might be able to nullify it.

294
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,094
Really?

295
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,597
I will go ask right away.

296
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:04,965
Thank you so much.

297
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:08,135
Do Gyeom.

298
00:21:15,676 --> 00:21:17,711
I picked this up on my way.

299
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,914
Thank you, Do Gyeom.

300
00:21:22,316 --> 00:21:25,385
The weather is nice today.
Shall we go for a walk together?

301
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,660
I only came to thank you

302
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,362
for sending rice cakes to the Academy.

303
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,765
Why didn't you mention
that you topped the exam?

304
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:43,904
Because you are
my brother's precious wife.

305
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:49,009
Please do not try so hard
to fill the void left by my late mother.

306
00:21:50,177 --> 00:21:52,613
Whatever it is, just tell me.

307
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:53,847
I will help you.

308
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:57,951
There's something
that you can't help with.

309
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,355
Like an archery contest?

310
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,566
Bullseye!

311
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:17,137
Tae Young, how did you...

312
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,774
It has been a while,
but I have not lost my skills.

313
00:22:20,774 --> 00:22:21,775
Father.

314
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:24,211
Father, did you see that?

315
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:25,212
I saw it.

316
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:29,016
So, you are skilled
in martial arts as well.

317
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,185
I learned a little from my brother.

318
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,487
But why are you back at this hour?

319
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,823
I have overexerted myself lately,
so I have a bit of a headache.

320
00:22:36,823 --> 00:22:39,927
I will visit the physician
and get some medicine.

321
00:22:39,927 --> 00:22:42,429
No need. I just need some rest.

322
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:47,100
Do not let me interrupt you.
Keep going with the shots.

323
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:48,969
Do Gyeom.

324
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:50,804
Here.

325
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:54,975
Look at the target
through the lower part of the bow hand.

326
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:57,277
Shift your weight forward.

327
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:58,378
Hold steady here.

328
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,315
The only variable is the wind.

329
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,821
Release.

330
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,795
- Brother.
- Quickly.

331
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:17,197
- Come here.
- Go.

332
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,301
- Come here.
- Help me.

333
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,403
Help me.

334
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:24,671
Spare me.

335
00:23:31,445 --> 00:23:34,848
Why struggle so hard to climb the wall
in the middle of the night?

336
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:39,233
Please let me go.
My father is seriously ill.

337
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:43,724
At least let Bong Soon go. I beg you.

338
00:23:43,724 --> 00:23:46,293
- Please.
- Shut it, you brat!

339
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:50,430
Tie shackles on their ankles
so they can never escape again.

340
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,100
- Yes, sir.
- No, please don't!

341
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,268
Let go of me.

342
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:58,138
Please.

343
00:24:01,074 --> 00:24:03,177
I beg you, please.
At least let Bong Soon...

344
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,478
I said let go of me!

345
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:09,449
You sold your own child
and now you are causing a scene.

346
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:11,952
I never sold my child.

347
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,620
You claimed
it was to teach her business.

348
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,089
You said you would feed her well,
and you took her away.

349
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:19,092
Why imprison her
and refuse to let her go?

350
00:24:22,496 --> 00:24:23,564
You fool.

351
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,001
This is the document you signed.

352
00:24:28,502 --> 00:24:29,503
Let us go.

353
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:36,310
- Are you alright?
- Are you okay?

354
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,511
Get up.

355
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:40,147
You are bleeding.

356
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,282
My goodness.

357
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,452
This is a Slave Sale Document.

358
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:46,592
(Slave Sale Document: agreement to be slaves)
Forced Enslavement

359
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,321
(Forced Enslavement: forcing civilians to be slaves)
is clearly illegal.

360
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:49,823
Did they trick illiterate people
to sign them

361
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,225
and take the children?

362
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:53,427
It bears the government office's seal
to make it look official.

363
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,164
Those scoundrels must have forged
the documents.

364
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,800
Please help me.

365
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,803
Save my Bong Soon.

366
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:12,012
(Silk Merchant Guild)

367
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:15,949
The government office?

368
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:21,021
It is possible
Bong Soon was really sold.

369
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,356
We must confirm the facts first.

370
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:26,126
I completely understand that,
but why the disguise?

371
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:28,228
And what is with your outfit, my lady?

372
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:29,963
This makes it easier for me
to move around.

373
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:31,999
Kkeutdongi, you can handle this, right?

374
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:34,501
Kkeutdongi cannot do this.
Really, I cannot do this!

375
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:35,702
You better do it well.

376
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:39,239
If you are caught pretending to be
a noble, your limbs will be torn apart.

377
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:40,674
My limbs.

378
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,042
What brings you here?

379
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:47,848
I heard there is a painting
by Master Hui Suk from Qing here.

380
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:50,150
I am Hyeok from the Jin family

381
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:53,520
in the Songju County.

382
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,023
Yes, please come in.

383
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:58,025
Let us go.

384
00:26:02,296 --> 00:26:04,064
So, I heard many paintings have arrived.

385
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:07,067
Yes. If you head upstairs,
you will find excellent pieces.

386
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,736
My goodness.

387
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,272
A true masterpiece
with nature delicately portrayed.

388
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,541
You truly have a taste for art.

389
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,811
This piece arrived
just yesterday from Qing.

390
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,280
What do you think of this one?

391
00:26:42,603 --> 00:26:43,871
I have not seen you before.

392
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,645
I am a servant of Master Jin.

393
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:54,014
I was looking for the outhouse.

394
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,453
You are a woman.

395
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:02,789
You, come here.

396
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,796
I have been waiting for you.

397
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,797
Let us go.

398
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:20,841
I am hungry. Over here.

399
00:27:21,708 --> 00:27:23,143
I am so hungry.

400
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:25,746
Here.

401
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,949
- Please give me some.
- Please.

402
00:27:28,949 --> 00:27:29,983
- Me too.
- Please.

403
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:33,754
- Give me some.
- Please.

404
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,456
Give me some.

405
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:38,725
- Give me one more.
- Please.

406
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,094
Please.

407
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,498
I am hungry.

408
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,867
Quiet!

409
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:56,009
Are there any small but sturdy ones
among them?

410
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,312
Most of them are small except for a few.

411
00:27:58,846 --> 00:27:59,847
Look at them.

412
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,982
Those two over there are both 15,

413
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:04,351
but that one is much smaller in size.

414
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:07,421
Look at that appearance.
Is that a boy or a girl?

415
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,090
Despite appearances,
he is from a noble family.

416
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:13,594
Are you doing it reckless?

417
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:15,162
Do not worry.

418
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:18,165
He ended up as a plaything
for nobles in a courtesan house

419
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:19,333
and was discarded.

420
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,005
Father.

421
00:28:25,005 --> 00:28:26,373
Moon Soo, you punk!

422
00:28:26,373 --> 00:28:28,408
He was caught wearing women's clothes
by his parents,

423
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:31,011
beaten nearly to death,
and then kicked out.

424
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:36,350
A man has been placed
near the Magistrate.

425
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,585
I will send words when he is away.

426
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:39,586
Yes.

427
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:47,728
Pretending to be a noble
is not an easy task.

428
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:49,363
I must tell Father as soon as possible.

429
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,434
I should have taken the master's clothes
to the training hall today.

430
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:56,136
You can go there tomorrow.

431
00:28:56,136 --> 00:28:57,137
Yes.

432
00:28:58,772 --> 00:28:59,773
What?

433
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:02,743
But your husband
should be at the training hall now.

434
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,511
Why is he over there?

435
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:12,719
Isn't that the courtesan house?

436
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:18,025
Perhaps he is having a drink
with his fellow trainees.

437
00:29:18,025 --> 00:29:19,326
Let us pretend we did not see him.

438
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,996
But you are newlyweds.
Shouldn't he come home to rest?

439
00:29:22,996 --> 00:29:25,299
What is he doing?

440
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:27,835
He will come when it is time.

441
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:31,004
Do not tell anyone about this.

442
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:39,673
You must be Moon Soo.

443
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:44,144
Who are you?

444
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:53,020
(Cheongsu County)

445
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:58,625
Are you saying you did not see
the face of the buyer?

446
00:30:58,625 --> 00:30:59,626
Yes.

447
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,330
All I heard is that this is supposed
to be the last one.

448
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:12,439
Someone sent me

449
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:15,742
this time log.

450
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:21,081
It seems the Silk Merchant Guild
has placed someone to spy on me.

451
00:31:21,782 --> 00:31:23,851
They plan to use my absence

452
00:31:23,851 --> 00:31:25,919
to trade the children.

453
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,689
Who could have provided the information?

454
00:31:28,689 --> 00:31:31,091
How about we act now?

455
00:31:31,091 --> 00:31:34,394
Then we cannot find out
who intends to trade and why.

456
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,699
From tomorrow on,

457
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:41,502
spread the rumor that I am leaving
for a business trip.

458
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:45,339
Then, station trustworthy people
to watch the guild

459
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,874
and have them tail anyone suspicious.

460
00:31:47,274 --> 00:31:49,409
I will assist you.

461
00:31:51,645 --> 00:31:52,713
No, you cannot.

462
00:31:52,713 --> 00:31:54,047
You lack manpower.

463
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,550
Most importantly,
someone must look after the children.

464
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,718
I said no.

465
00:31:57,718 --> 00:32:00,654
I will follow quietly from a distance.
I am capable of...

466
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:01,889
I said no!

467
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,430
No!

468
00:32:22,676 --> 00:32:23,677
My lady!

469
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:25,646
My lady!

470
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,281
What?

471
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,449
Why are you running? Do not run.
Is something wrong?

472
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,684
Your husband is back.

473
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:32,886
Now?

474
00:32:32,886 --> 00:32:35,522
Hurry inside.
I will set up the table with drinks.

475
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:45,866
Yun Gyeom.

476
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,280
(Heart)

477
00:33:17,064 --> 00:33:18,065
Tae Young.

478
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:27,407
I came to see you,

479
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:29,409
but I was disappointed
to find you were not here.

480
00:33:30,344 --> 00:33:31,979
But seeing you now pleases me.

481
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,381
You just arrived.

482
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,651
So where are you headed again?

483
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:41,355
The exam is near

484
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:45,158
and I thought working outside
might help me focus.

485
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:00,908
May I ask

486
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,310
about the mark on your shoulder?

487
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:06,513
Or I should not ask about it?

488
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:12,653
You saw it?

489
00:34:18,725 --> 00:34:19,826
It seems

490
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,297
I should not ask.

491
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:29,403
Please give me a few days.

492
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,907
I will tell you everything
when I'm back.

493
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:20,387
Let us rest here for a while.

494
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:22,022
Take a short break.

495
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:24,725
Move now.

496
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:33,800
We are almost Gyeongsang-do.

497
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,309
Did he promise to come back?

498
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:45,712
He promised to save us all.

499
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:48,415
What did you say?

500
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:52,553
Speak up, you brats!

501
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,356
- Sir.
- Get up.

502
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,158
- Get up. Move.
- Hurry up.

503
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,593
- Get up.
- Move.

504
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:01,695
Darn it.

505
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,298
Darn it.

506
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,374
My Lord.

507
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:17,811
Where were you

508
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:22,249
taking these children?

509
00:36:23,016 --> 00:36:24,117
If I tell you,

510
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:26,520
I will die.

511
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:29,523
What are you waiting for? Strike them.

512
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:59,753
- Chun Sam.
- Chun Sam.

513
00:37:00,354 --> 00:37:01,355
Stay back.

514
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,657
- Chun Sam.
- Chun Sam.

515
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:04,892
Chun Sam.

516
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:12,326
Run.

517
00:38:22,803 --> 00:38:24,771
- Go save the children.
- Yes, sir.

518
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:28,542
Get them!

519
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:29,543
Hurry, get them!

520
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:31,144
Grab them.

521
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:32,646
Grab them.

522
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,648
Moon Soo, let us go.

523
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:35,916
There.

524
00:38:56,904 --> 00:38:58,572
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

525
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:02,509
Did you see his face?

526
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,180
No, I didn't.

527
00:39:07,881 --> 00:39:09,483
Do not worry.

528
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:12,519
Let us go home.

529
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:15,689
How dare they set a trap!

530
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:19,660
If you ran away,
you should have gone elsewhere.

531
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,595
Why bring them here?
What were you thinking?

532
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:24,164
What if we are exposed?

533
00:39:24,164 --> 00:39:25,432
Do not worry.

534
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:28,235
Judging by their questions
asking where we were headed,

535
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,937
the Magistrate does not know this place.

536
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:31,972
Neither do the children.

537
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:35,943
I will find more suitable children,
so do not worry too much.

538
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:42,950
I will never let that Magistrate
get away with this.

539
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:49,623
The children claimed they did not know
the destination.

540
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:52,359
The guild is shut down,
and we lost some children.

541
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:54,595
This is a serious setback.

542
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:58,298
If not for the one who helped us,
this could have been much worse.

543
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:05,005
Who could that person possibly be?

544
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,476
It seems they are the same individual
who sent the message to me.

545
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:20,921
(Devoted Hearts House)

546
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:21,955
(Heart)

547
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,790
I was just about to escort you.

548
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:45,239
Where is my husband?

549
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,779
Why were you in such a dangerous place?

550
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:06,587
I want to ask you that too.

551
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:09,289
Why were you there? How did you...

552
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:10,924
Are you hurt?

553
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:13,293
What exactly are you doing?

554
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:15,362
Bringing children
to such a secretive place

555
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:16,763
and training them in combat?

556
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:18,899
And what is that mark on your shoulder?

557
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,836
Are you plotting treason?

558
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,444
I am the leader of this group,
Devoted Hearts Association.

559
00:43:31,178 --> 00:43:34,581
The mark on my shoulder
signifies my membership.

560
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:37,351
(Heart)
I rescue and protect

561
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:39,620
children like me.

562
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:44,358
Are you saying
all these children are outcasts?

563
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:47,227
Yes.

564
00:43:51,298 --> 00:43:53,634
So you sent the message to Father

565
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,602
and only brought back that child.

566
00:43:56,069 --> 00:44:00,440
Moon Soo has no place to return to.

567
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,213
When people see someone different
from themselves,

568
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:09,883
they mock, beat, and even kill them.

569
00:44:12,686 --> 00:44:15,088
That child over there

570
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:18,659
was beaten so severely
that he cannot use one arm for good.

571
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:21,361
How could he do that?

572
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:22,863
This child

573
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,501
tried to take his own life
because he could not endure it.

574
00:44:27,501 --> 00:44:28,836
I saved him.

575
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,245
To prepare for any situation,

576
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:41,348
I taught them self-defense,

577
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:44,785
not military training or rebellion.

578
00:44:44,785 --> 00:44:46,186
I understand your intentions,

579
00:44:47,921 --> 00:44:49,823
but this is too dangerous now.

580
00:44:49,823 --> 00:44:51,258
Just because they are different,

581
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:54,528
I cannot stand by
and watch them be killed.

582
00:44:55,229 --> 00:44:56,363
I must

583
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:02,069
create a world that
embraces differences.

584
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,105
I...

585
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:08,909
I do not understand.

586
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,678
Is all this truly necessary?

587
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:14,147
Did you not once say
all people under heaven are equal?

588
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:19,987
I thought
someone like you would understand.

589
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:38,772
This is good.

590
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:42,743
Bravo. Cheers!

591
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:56,456
I am feeling drunk.

592
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:57,958
Raise your cups.

593
00:45:59,293 --> 00:46:00,394
Cheers.

594
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:04,865
What if we are arrested for treason
just for gathering here?

595
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:06,533
It was said no gathering
of five or more.

596
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:09,736
See? Only four here.
One, two, three, four.

597
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:12,906
No, three. I am off to the restroom.

598
00:46:12,906 --> 00:46:14,141
Fine.

599
00:46:15,843 --> 00:46:18,812
Anyway, congratulations
on your wedding, Deok Hun.

600
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:21,949
You have claimed
the beautiful Lady Seon Hui.

601
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,217
But do you know this?

602
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:25,886
Your wife was almost married
into the Magistrate's household.

603
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:30,791
The Yuhyangso tried to gain favor
with the Magistrate, but they failed.

604
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,027
With the new Magistrate, your father's
reputation has clearly fallen.

605
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,364
Baek Do Gwang's family was ruined
and forced to flee overnight

606
00:46:38,031 --> 00:46:39,299
all because of the Magistrate, right?

607
00:46:39,299 --> 00:46:41,001
Now, even doing whatever I want
with my own servants

608
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:42,970
is no longer possible
in Cheongsu County.

609
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:44,137
Stop it.

610
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:46,874
Let go of me. What are you doing?

611
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:49,209
What's happening? What's going on?

612
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:51,578
I cannot believe this.

613
00:46:52,546 --> 00:46:54,581
This person is no woman but a man.

614
00:46:55,382 --> 00:46:56,583
What?

615
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:58,886
I almost embraced him and was shocked.

616
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:00,554
This is disgusting.

617
00:47:00,554 --> 00:47:01,889
Are you sure you are not mistaken?

618
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,924
How is she a man? She looks beautiful.

619
00:47:03,924 --> 00:47:05,058
Come take a closer look.

620
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,730
Let me see.

621
00:47:12,733 --> 00:47:14,234
- Stay still.
- Do not touch me.

622
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:15,235
Nothing is there.

623
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,904
Check lower too.

624
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:18,438
Hold still.

625
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:25,512
A man pretending to be a woman
to sell drinks

626
00:47:25,512 --> 00:47:27,147
and you dare to
threaten me with a knife.

627
00:47:27,147 --> 00:47:29,082
I am just a musician
playing my instrument.

628
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:31,051
I never claimed to be a woman.

629
00:47:31,051 --> 00:47:32,686
Your voice is disgusting.

630
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:35,989
Hey, why don't you speak properly?

631
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:39,326
So what?
Are you actually planning to stab me?

632
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:47,134
I am protecting myself.

633
00:47:47,901 --> 00:47:50,237
It is because you insult me so freely.

634
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:53,373
Insult? What kind of revolting creature
are you? I should just kill you.

635
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,777
What is this disgusting thing
that has crawled into Cheongsu County?

636
00:47:57,544 --> 00:47:58,679
Let us just kill him.

637
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,315
What is the Magistrate doing

638
00:48:01,315 --> 00:48:03,450
to allow something like this
to hide in Cheongsu County?

639
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,887
Guards, take him to Yuhyangso now.

640
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:10,757
The Chief will execute this person
to restore order to Cheongsu County

641
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:12,793
and reclaim the honor of Yuhyangso.

642
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:14,361
How can you take an innocent person

643
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:17,431
and drag him away like this?

644
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,835
Why is Yun Gyeom's wife
in a courtesan house?

645
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:23,737
I am here as a legal advocate

646
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:26,740
and witnessed this dreadful situation.

647
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:29,643
This is not for a woman to meddle in.

648
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,445
Take him to Yuhyangso now!

649
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:33,747
If there is a crime committed, it should
be handled at the government office,

650
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:35,716
not dragged off to Yuhyangso.

651
00:48:35,716 --> 00:48:39,253
Maintaining the village's order
and customs is Yuhyangso's duty.

652
00:48:39,253 --> 00:48:42,256
Then, I will report
to the government office

653
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:44,758
Yuhyangso has dragged away
an innocent person.

654
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:54,101
Take him to the government office.

655
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:58,172
Let us see how the Magistrate explains
allowing such a thing to exist.

656
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:00,841
Let us find out.

657
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:11,118
Hae Gang has been taken
to the government office?

658
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:13,954
I barely stopped them
from dragging him to Yuhyangso.

659
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:15,722
If not Yuhyangso,

660
00:49:15,722 --> 00:49:17,791
he will face execution wherever he goes.

661
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:20,827
What will you do?

662
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:22,696
Will you barge in the government office
to save him?

663
00:49:22,696 --> 00:49:25,065
Yes, if that is what it takes.

664
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:27,201
Yun Gyeom, do not do that.

665
00:49:27,201 --> 00:49:30,704
If you are a legal advocate,
you should help

666
00:49:30,704 --> 00:49:33,173
the innocent ones taken unjustly
instead of stopping me.

667
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:36,610
Do you only care about servants?

668
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,013
Is it because you are
a former servant yourself?

669
00:49:43,517 --> 00:49:45,419
How can you say such a thing?

670
00:49:50,958 --> 00:49:53,460
I am sorry. I was too desperate.

671
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:58,398
Hae Gang was

672
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:02,603
the first child I saved.

673
00:50:11,778 --> 00:50:13,847
Are you okay?

674
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:16,517
When I was near death,

675
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:20,821
Young Master Yun Gyeom
found and saved me.

676
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,624
From then on,

677
00:50:24,925 --> 00:50:26,994
we started helping children like us.

678
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:30,130
Because that

679
00:50:32,299 --> 00:50:34,968
felt like the reason we were alive.

680
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:43,510
I just

681
00:50:46,747 --> 00:50:49,416
wanted to live a normal life.

682
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:19,479
Why has the Magistrate allowed
such filth to remain

683
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,248
in Cheongsu County?

684
00:51:21,682 --> 00:51:23,217
What matters were so urgent

685
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:25,819
that the safety of the people
of Cheongsu County was ignored?

686
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:29,189
If such creatures were to seduce
our men and spread disease,

687
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:31,491
what would you do then?

688
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:34,728
For the sake of Cheongsu County,
this must be dealt with now.

689
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:37,364
- Kill him.
- Execute him.

690
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:40,534
- Kill him.
- Execute him.

691
00:51:40,534 --> 00:51:41,535
Kill him.

692
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:43,937
Kill him.

693
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:44,938
Kill him.

694
00:51:45,339 --> 00:51:46,473
He must die.

695
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:48,442
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

696
00:51:48,442 --> 00:51:49,443
Execute him.

697
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:55,182
According to the will of Yuhyangso,

698
00:51:55,716 --> 00:51:56,950
for the sake of Cheongsu County,

699
00:51:57,651 --> 00:51:59,419
this man will be executed.

700
00:52:00,187 --> 00:52:02,656
Kill him.

701
00:52:02,656 --> 00:52:05,325
- Kill him.
- Kill him.

702
00:52:07,961 --> 00:52:09,062
He must die.

703
00:52:16,537 --> 00:52:17,804
Why is our lady here?

704
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:19,273
Why is our lady...

705
00:52:32,786 --> 00:52:35,756
I am Ok Tae Young, a legal advocate.
I will defend for hims.

706
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:40,794
Are you out of your mind?

707
00:52:40,794 --> 00:52:43,430
How dare you oppose
a judgment made by your father-in-law!

708
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:47,434
There is no need for this case. Go back.

709
00:52:47,434 --> 00:52:51,004
Are you saying I should choose
who to defend?

710
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:53,106
That is not a person.

711
00:52:53,106 --> 00:52:54,241
He is a person.

712
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:57,744
He has committed no crime,
but was molested,

713
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,515
and is now a victim in prison.

714
00:53:05,052 --> 00:53:06,220
If he is a person,

715
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,089
regardless of status or position,

716
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:12,025
he deserves equal judgment
under the law.

717
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:15,629
How can you justify a decision
based on Yuhyangso's will?

718
00:53:15,629 --> 00:53:17,764
There is no law to protect them,

719
00:53:17,764 --> 00:53:20,334
so they will not be
protected by any law.

720
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:21,468
What you are saying

721
00:53:21,468 --> 00:53:24,638
implies there is no legal basis
to kill them, either.

722
00:53:27,007 --> 00:53:29,376
Enough of this!

723
00:53:30,143 --> 00:53:31,979
How dare a woman interfere

724
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:34,882
and disrupt the customs
of Cheongsu County?

725
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:36,717
I am saying we must stop
this senseless killing!

726
00:53:38,018 --> 00:53:39,319
Killing? How dare you!

727
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:41,722
Do I have to keep listening
to this nonsense, My Lord?

728
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:44,691
Will you allow such a monster
to roam freely?

729
00:53:45,826 --> 00:53:48,662
There is no law,
but I urge you to follow precedent.

730
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,665
Precedent? Ridiculous.

731
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,369
In the year of Gyeongmyo, August 12,

732
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:58,172
there was a recorded judgment
on Nam Chun Gil of Somun-ri.

733
00:53:59,373 --> 00:54:01,508
The king decreed,

734
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:03,644
"Nam Chun Gil,
a bipolar person falls ill,

735
00:54:04,144 --> 00:54:08,115
so do not interrogate him harshly,
but send him to live alone in exile."

736
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:12,753
In administering justice,

737
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:16,323
caution must be taken repeatedly,
as stated in Seogyeong.

738
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:19,526
The king himself
acknowledged all people

739
00:54:19,526 --> 00:54:22,996
as the subjects of heaven,
not to be killed recklessly.

740
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,365
So how can someone be executed

741
00:54:25,365 --> 00:54:29,069
for simply being different
without any legal justification?

742
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:47,087
The judgment on this man is deferred.

743
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:48,028
What?

744
00:54:48,029 --> 00:54:51,191
We will send a report to the royal court,
and upon receiving their reply,

745
00:54:51,592 --> 00:54:55,696
a final judgment will be made
according to their decree.

746
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:41,909
Hae Gang has returned
to Devoted Hearts House, not the prison.

747
00:55:42,776 --> 00:55:46,480
Until the royal court's decree arrives,
he will stay there.

748
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:50,684
During this time, we plan to relocate
the Devoted Hearts House to a safe house.

749
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:04,932
Tae Young.

750
00:56:05,999 --> 00:56:09,937
Thank you for helping Hae Gang.

751
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:12,105
You said I only helped servants
because of my background.

752
00:56:13,307 --> 00:56:14,875
I could not let that pass.

753
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:19,513
You unexpectedly hold grudges.

754
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,824
Should I give up everything

755
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:33,861
and live only as the eldest son
of the Seong family?

756
00:56:38,465 --> 00:56:42,603
If that is what you wish, I will do so.

757
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:47,407
Do not say what you do not mean.

758
00:56:49,276 --> 00:56:51,245
You know I cannot ask that

759
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:54,147
of you.

760
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:09,663
It has been a while.

761
00:57:09,963 --> 00:57:11,565
We have something new.

762
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:13,333
Maybe next time.

763
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,701
Take your time.

764
00:57:14,701 --> 00:57:18,071
It would be better to visit a physician
and get a diagnosis.

765
00:57:18,872 --> 00:57:20,707
My father-in-law is quite busy
these days.

766
00:57:21,608 --> 00:57:24,077
If the medicine does not work again,
either close the shop

767
00:57:24,077 --> 00:57:26,046
or bend over backward to fix it.

768
00:57:26,046 --> 00:57:27,681
I told you, that is not an option.

769
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:29,983
No credit for medicine. Now go!

770
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:31,652
Please, sir.

771
00:57:31,652 --> 00:57:36,423
Just one dose for my father
will cure his cough.

772
00:57:36,423 --> 00:57:38,225
Bring the money, and you will have it.

773
00:57:44,598 --> 00:57:47,467
- One bowl of soup, please.
- Right away.

774
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:48,902
Take care.

775
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,272
Thank you so much, Madam Legal Advocate.

776
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:54,274
Eat up.

777
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:03,417
What are you staring at
instead of eating?

778
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:05,385
What is so fascinating
about those potatoes?

779
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:09,990
I was thinking of Chun Sam
from the Silk Merchant Guild.

780
00:58:10,357 --> 00:58:12,259
He was always hungry.

781
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:15,329
I am worried
he might be starving somewhere now.

782
00:58:15,329 --> 00:58:17,631
The Magistrate is searching for him.

783
00:58:17,631 --> 00:58:19,967
He has asked for help
from the Gyeongsang Provincial office,

784
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:21,268
so please wait a bit longer.

785
00:58:21,268 --> 00:58:22,503
Gyeongsang-do?

786
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:24,938
It cannot be Gyeongsang-do.

787
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:28,275
What? Do you know something?

788
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:31,445
Didn't you say you did not know
where they went?

789
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:33,146
I do not know where they went.

790
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:35,949
Are you playing us?

791
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:37,985
Did you hear something?

792
00:58:37,985 --> 00:58:41,154
The day we took off, I overheard
something while boiling potatoes.

793
00:58:42,122 --> 00:58:47,294
I heard them say
they would return after leaving.

794
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:49,396
Return after leaving?

795
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:50,964
Where?

796
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:53,767
To a mountain very close.

797
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:56,603
A mountain that close?

798
00:59:01,575 --> 00:59:02,643
Mt. Unbong?

799
00:59:56,563 --> 00:59:59,533
Can we really keep the rest

800
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:01,201
after sending what we owe
to the Minister?

801
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:05,072
Of course.
It is a reward for your hard work.

802
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:08,675
We apologize for the delay
caused by interference along the way.

803
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:11,044
It was because of that Magistrate.

804
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:21,722
I hear the Magistrate will begin
searching this mountain tomorrow.

805
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,057
What? Why? How did he find out?

806
01:00:24,057 --> 01:00:25,259
What do we do now?

807
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:28,061
- Stop everything.
- Yes, sir.

808
01:00:28,061 --> 01:00:30,464
Stop! Everyone, stop working!

809
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,801
We are starving.

810
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:36,870
We cannot keep going like this.

811
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,772
Shut up.

812
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:40,707
We should have followed Moon Soo.

813
01:00:41,441 --> 01:00:42,743
If we had gone with him,

814
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:44,978
we would have food
and martial arts training.

815
01:00:52,553 --> 01:00:54,221
What did you just say?

816
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:56,990
Who would teach martial arts?

817
01:00:57,758 --> 01:01:00,127
Martial arts training in this situation?

818
01:01:01,895 --> 01:01:04,031
They must be rebels.

819
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:08,635
It seems the heaven is on our side.

820
01:01:08,635 --> 01:01:12,206
The Magistrate will be too busy
chasing rebels to bother with this place.

821
01:01:16,109 --> 01:01:18,011
Where has Moon Soo gone?

822
01:01:18,745 --> 01:01:21,114
Tell me now,
and I will give you plenty to eat.

823
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:29,957
At 5 a.m. tomorrow,

824
01:01:29,957 --> 01:01:31,959
split into groups and search Mt. Unbong.

825
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:33,994
- Are you clear?
- Yes, sir!

826
01:01:43,403 --> 01:01:45,973
My Lord, the provincial governor
is on his way here.

827
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,141
What do you mean?

828
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:51,311
It is said that rebels are conducting
military training at Devoted Hearts House.

829
01:02:02,222 --> 01:02:03,223
There is no one here.

830
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:08,262
Look! Not even an ant can be found!

831
01:02:08,262 --> 01:02:11,298
Exactly, how can
the entire courtesan house be empty?

832
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:12,799
They must have already been transferred.

833
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:15,068
This is evidence of a conspiracy!

834
01:02:22,843 --> 01:02:23,844
Darn it.

835
01:02:40,694 --> 01:02:42,729
Where is this wind coming from?

836
01:03:22,002 --> 01:03:23,737
We are done for. Go now.

837
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:24,771
No, Hae Gang.

838
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:27,941
You must not be exposed.

839
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:29,076
How can I leave you?

840
01:03:29,076 --> 01:03:30,911
Leave it to me and go now.

841
01:03:33,614 --> 01:03:34,948
Go no!

842
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:46,727
What did you burn?

843
01:03:46,727 --> 01:03:48,795
Did you burn evidence of rebellion?

844
01:03:48,795 --> 01:03:50,230
Rebellion? No.

845
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:52,733
I was simply taking care
of pitiful children.

846
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:54,134
Really?

847
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:58,005
This is a misunderstanding. I will
explain everything to the magistrate.

848
01:03:58,839 --> 01:03:59,840
Right.

849
01:04:08,282 --> 01:04:09,850
In your dream.

850
01:04:10,817 --> 01:04:13,987
Because you will die here as a rebel.

851
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:22,029
(Heart)

852
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:34,274
There was a same symbol in the hidden
room behind the Devoted Hearts House.

853
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:38,278
How could such a scheme go unnoticed?

854
01:04:38,278 --> 01:04:40,480
It is not just about being unaware.

855
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,149
My son captured this rebel

856
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,620
only for the Magistrate
and his daughter-in-law to set him free.

857
01:04:48,422 --> 01:04:53,026
All remaining rebels
must be captured now.

858
01:04:53,827 --> 01:04:56,630
If the court learns of rebellion
in Cheongsu County,

859
01:04:57,164 --> 01:04:58,866
you will not escape blame.

860
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:01,869
I will delay sending the report.
Round them up now.

861
01:05:03,537 --> 01:05:05,205
That is the only way for you to live.

862
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:08,542
It must be addressed first.

863
01:05:11,144 --> 01:05:14,181
Suspend the search of Mt. Unbong.

864
01:05:14,948 --> 01:05:15,949
Yes.

865
01:05:18,485 --> 01:05:20,354
From now on, we will track down

866
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:22,489
all remaining rebels
hiding in Cheongsu County.

867
01:05:23,056 --> 01:05:25,692
Ensure not even an ant escapes
Cheongsu County.

868
01:05:25,692 --> 01:05:27,294
Block all pathways

869
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:30,531
and search everyone's bodies for marks
without exception.

870
01:05:32,032 --> 01:05:34,001
Anyone resisting is a rebel

871
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,936
and may be killed immediately.

872
01:05:35,936 --> 01:05:37,004
Do you understand?

873
01:05:37,004 --> 01:05:38,005
Yes, sir!

874
01:05:42,576 --> 01:05:43,577
Pass!

875
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:49,483
Quickly, Yun Gyeom.

876
01:05:49,483 --> 01:05:51,351
Go to the safe house
where the children are.

877
01:05:53,387 --> 01:05:55,222
We cannot bear this false accusation.

878
01:05:55,222 --> 01:05:56,557
How can they call us rebels?

879
01:06:02,162 --> 01:06:04,631
I came to pack up things.

880
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:07,634
Thankfully, you are here as well.

881
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:11,104
He also needs to leave
for the training camp.

882
01:06:11,104 --> 01:06:12,406
Indeed.

883
01:06:12,406 --> 01:06:14,641
Show me your shoulder.

884
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:16,743
I will stamp your identification tag.

885
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:19,780
It has already been stamped.

886
01:06:21,582 --> 01:06:23,851
I see. Understood.

887
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:26,420
Father.

888
01:06:28,222 --> 01:06:31,658
Hae Gang is not a rebel.

889
01:06:31,658 --> 01:06:32,659
Yun Gyeom.

890
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:36,597
Now, gathering people
for military training is

891
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:39,233
simply indefensible.

892
01:06:39,233 --> 01:06:41,134
It was not military training.

893
01:06:42,102 --> 01:06:44,371
It was to help the children learn

894
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:46,974
to protect themselves, Father.

895
01:06:49,743 --> 01:06:53,280
And how do you know that?

896
01:06:58,218 --> 01:07:00,420
Yun Gyeom, please.

897
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,421
Yun Gyeom.

898
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:08,629
(Heart)

899
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:18,205
What is this?

900
01:07:19,306 --> 01:07:20,674
Why is this here?

901
01:07:20,674 --> 01:07:23,510
He was only helping those kids.

902
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:26,813
Why did you go this far to help them?

903
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:30,851
Because

904
01:07:35,322 --> 01:07:36,890
I am the same as those children.

905
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:40,227
I just wanted to survive.

906
01:07:40,227 --> 01:07:41,495
I just wanted them to survive.

907
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:45,799
I was only seeking a way
to keep living, Father.

908
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:47,835
If you found a way to live,

909
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,204
you should have hidden it.

910
01:07:51,805 --> 01:07:56,543
For the first time, I am grateful that

911
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:59,479
your mother passed before seeing this.

912
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:01,648
I am not ashamed before Mother, Father.

913
01:08:01,648 --> 01:08:03,884
My life has values!

914
01:08:03,884 --> 01:08:05,018
Shut it, you fool!

915
01:08:05,018 --> 01:08:07,321
Father! Please calm your anger.

916
01:08:12,326 --> 01:08:13,727
How could you

917
01:08:15,495 --> 01:08:18,098
have married him?

918
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:19,833
It was my choice.

919
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,368
I knew everything
and still chose that, Father.

920
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:29,376
From now on,
you will live only as my son

921
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:31,879
and her husband.

922
01:08:32,746 --> 01:08:35,415
And you will scrape the stamp off

923
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:37,718
even if you must tear it
from your flesh!

924
01:08:45,225 --> 01:08:46,560
I cannot do that.

925
01:08:48,061 --> 01:08:53,200
Before being a son or a husband,

926
01:08:55,702 --> 01:08:57,471
I am the leader
of the Devoted Hearts Association.

927
01:09:03,076 --> 01:09:04,711
- You promised!
- Yes.

928
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:07,214
- Go on inside.
- I will eagerly wait.

929
01:09:07,214 --> 01:09:09,183
- See you in Okcheon.
- Yes.

930
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:16,723
In ten days,

931
01:09:16,723 --> 01:09:20,394
there will be a recital in Okcheon,
Jeolla-do. Be prepared.

932
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:26,600
How much did you get paid
to make you grin like that?

933
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,936
♪Wait for me, Jeolla-do♪

934
01:09:28,936 --> 01:09:32,306
♪Here I come♪

935
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:34,641
What is this again?

936
01:09:36,243 --> 01:09:37,711
Take off your clothes now.

937
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:39,980
All of a sudden?

938
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:46,987
Fine, I will. I have a severe
fear of blades.

939
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:51,191
Should you not at least tell me why?

940
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,462
But...

941
01:09:55,996 --> 01:09:57,030
It burns.

942
01:09:57,598 --> 01:09:59,466
Here. See for yourself.

943
01:10:14,014 --> 01:10:17,251
From this moment,
you are no longer my son.

944
01:10:21,488 --> 01:10:23,457
Leave this place now.

945
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:26,260
If I see you again,

946
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:28,161
I will kill you myself

947
01:10:30,197 --> 01:10:31,832
for being a traitor.

948
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:35,736
So

949
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:39,306
never return to this place.

950
01:10:42,075 --> 01:10:43,143
My son.

951
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:55,589
Yun Gyeom.

952
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:58,158
It seems they are searching
beyond Cheongsu County.

953
01:11:19,413 --> 01:11:20,814
Traitors! Seize them!

954
01:11:30,357 --> 01:11:31,358
Open it.

955
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:33,594
Open it.

956
01:11:35,562 --> 01:11:36,563
Over there.

957
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:45,138
That way. Seize them.

958
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:46,273
Seize them.

959
01:11:46,273 --> 01:11:47,274
Catch them!

960
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,623
Hurry, get inside!

961
01:12:02,623 --> 01:12:03,624
Understood.

962
01:12:20,574 --> 01:12:21,942
Why did you run away?

963
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:24,478
That is...

964
01:12:25,946 --> 01:12:27,614
You must speak honestly.

965
01:12:27,614 --> 01:12:28,982
Where is the man who was with you?

966
01:12:41,228 --> 01:12:44,665
Why are you acting so recklessly?

967
01:12:44,665 --> 01:12:46,433
Let us talk this through calmly!

968
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:50,170
- Strip this man now!
- Yes, sir.

969
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:54,708
I will do it myself.

970
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,719
It is me.

971
01:13:07,855 --> 01:13:10,624
Why did you run away
when you bear no stamp?

972
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:14,161
When someone comes at you with a sword,

973
01:13:15,128 --> 01:13:17,364
running away is human instinct.

974
01:13:18,465 --> 01:13:20,234
Are you fleeing
because you have committed another crime?

975
01:13:21,034 --> 01:13:22,402
Tell the truth.

976
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:26,139
Why do officers intimidate the innocent?

977
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:29,910
Should you not be pursuing
real traitors instead?

978
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:37,684
I am Seong Yun Gyeom,

979
01:13:39,152 --> 01:13:40,754
the son of the Magistrate
of Cheongsu County.

980
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:49,429
Let us go.

981
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,076
Are you okay, Young Master?

982
01:14:03,076 --> 01:14:05,279
Yes, are you okay?

983
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,414
What were you doing here?
Where is my husband?

984
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:08,782
Well...

985
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:20,360
Hurry, get inside!

986
01:14:37,878 --> 01:14:40,414
- You...
- Do you know who I am?

987
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:42,716
You look like you know me too.

988
01:14:45,953 --> 01:14:46,987
Are you being pursued?

989
01:14:46,987 --> 01:14:48,722
I am looking for a place to hide.

990
01:14:48,722 --> 01:14:51,592
Are you bearing the stamp of traitors?

991
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:53,827
I am no traitor.

992
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:55,262
So you do bear the stamp.

993
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:00,934
Let us exchange clothes.

994
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:05,439
What are you doing?

995
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:09,243
If you get caught,
you will be killed as well.

996
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,844
I do not care.

997
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:13,981
I appreciate the sentiment,
but I cannot put you in danger as well.

998
01:15:13,981 --> 01:15:15,649
Do not worry.

999
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:20,521
I am not doing this to help you,
just so you know.

1000
01:15:26,226 --> 01:15:28,929
I owe you a great debt.

1001
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:31,064
Thank you, Young Master.

1002
01:15:31,064 --> 01:15:33,033
The son of a Magistrate is a traitor.

1003
01:15:33,734 --> 01:15:35,202
That cannot be allowed.

1004
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:38,438
It is a misunderstanding.
He is not a traitor.

1005
01:15:38,438 --> 01:15:39,606
Fine.

1006
01:15:40,607 --> 01:15:44,711
Even with the seal, you may still
be inspected, so be cautious.

1007
01:15:45,078 --> 01:15:46,480
The village is dangerous.

1008
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,217
So take the small path by the tree
behind the inn.

1009
01:15:50,784 --> 01:15:51,852
Thank you.

1010
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:59,960
Hurry and go now.

1011
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,995
Take care of your wife and leave now.

1012
01:16:12,372 --> 01:16:13,373
Go.

1013
01:16:45,005 --> 01:16:46,306
Come on, Yun Gyeom.

1014
01:16:46,306 --> 01:16:48,242
You must leave Chungcheong-do at once.

1015
01:16:48,242 --> 01:16:52,045
I will look after your father and brother.
Do not worry.

1016
01:16:59,453 --> 01:17:02,523
I will send word as soon as I arrive.

1017
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:06,927
When the situation calms
and Father's anger subsides,

1018
01:17:07,995 --> 01:17:09,530
you must return.

1019
01:17:10,697 --> 01:17:12,099
I will.

1020
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:14,268
I promise.

1021
01:18:02,783 --> 01:18:03,917
Sit down.

1022
01:18:16,597 --> 01:18:19,299
Did he leave you behind after all?

1023
01:18:25,138 --> 01:18:29,309
You must have been lonely all this time.

1024
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,945
I was never lonely for a moment

1025
01:18:33,747 --> 01:18:38,085
because we understood each other
better than anyone.

1026
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,256
And Father and Young Master

1027
01:18:43,557 --> 01:18:45,792
all cherish me so dearly.

1028
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:53,133
Thank you for saying that.

1029
01:18:53,634 --> 01:18:57,671
I understand
what my husband is doing, Father.

1030
01:18:58,338 --> 01:19:00,340
I cannot understand it.

1031
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:01,341
However,

1032
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:05,345
as a father, I regret the harsh words
I spoke to him.

1033
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:07,814
I feel only remorse for that.

1034
01:19:10,384 --> 01:19:11,718
I am sure

1035
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,688
he understands that, Father.

1036
01:19:15,956 --> 01:19:20,594
I will permit you to send word to him.

1037
01:19:21,895 --> 01:19:23,430
But you must leave
this house immediately.

1038
01:19:24,264 --> 01:19:25,299
Father.

1039
01:19:25,299 --> 01:19:26,834
Steel yourself.

1040
01:19:26,834 --> 01:19:28,936
Leave this house without looking back.

1041
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:31,205
Why do you wish to cast me out?

1042
01:19:31,205 --> 01:19:33,006
I am the eldest daughter-in-law
of the Seong family.

1043
01:19:33,006 --> 01:19:36,043
Please, let me stay
and wait for my husband in this house.

1044
01:19:36,043 --> 01:19:37,744
If he intended to return,

1045
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:40,080
he would not have left at all.

1046
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,015
That is not true, Father.

1047
01:19:42,015 --> 01:19:44,218
He vowed to me that he would return.

1048
01:19:44,218 --> 01:19:47,254
Our family will not remain unharmed.

1049
01:19:47,254 --> 01:19:50,858
So leave at once.

1050
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,595
That is not true.

1051
01:19:55,529 --> 01:19:57,898
There is no evidence that the Devoted
Hearts Association is a group of rebels.

1052
01:19:57,898 --> 01:19:59,766
You will remain unharmed.

1053
01:19:59,766 --> 01:20:03,470
The Magistrate of Cheongsu County,
Seong Gyu Jin, receive the royal decree.

1054
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,061
Father.

1055
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:30,631
- Father.
- You cannot go there.

1056
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,473
(Royal Decree)

1057
01:20:39,473 --> 01:20:40,853
Magistrate Seong Gyu Jin is ordered

1058
01:20:40,853 --> 01:20:42,242
to receive the decree with courtesy.

1059
01:20:51,885 --> 01:20:52,886
Tae Young.

1060
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:56,290
Leave this house.

1061
01:21:18,545 --> 01:21:21,448
The misguided rebellious hearts
spreading everywhere

1062
01:21:21,448 --> 01:21:25,719
have even reached Cheongsu County,
which grieves me deeply.

1063
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:28,922
Training soldiers and conspiring is

1064
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:31,291
undeniably an act of treason.

1065
01:21:31,758 --> 01:21:34,027
The negligence
of Magistrate Seong Gyu Jin

1066
01:21:34,027 --> 01:21:36,129
failed to prevent this
and let the leader escape.

1067
01:21:36,129 --> 01:21:38,398
This is equivalent
to being complicit in treason.

1068
01:21:40,968 --> 01:21:43,570
This decree is unjust,
Provincial Governor.

1069
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,339
If the rebels were not captured,

1070
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:49,176
there is no proof that they were rebels.

1071
01:21:49,176 --> 01:21:50,544
Did you smuggle them out

1072
01:21:50,978 --> 01:21:53,881
or did the Magistrate collude with you
and release them as before?

1073
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:54,882
This is a false accusation!

1074
01:21:54,882 --> 01:21:58,018
You wretched woman!
How long will you evade with words?

1075
01:21:58,519 --> 01:22:00,220
Do you think your eloquence

1076
01:22:01,054 --> 01:22:03,190
can overturn the royal decree?

1077
01:22:06,527 --> 01:22:07,761
Provincial Governor.

1078
01:22:07,928 --> 01:22:09,730
You must not obstruct the decree.

1079
01:22:10,864 --> 01:22:14,801
Therefore, Magistrate Seong Gyu Jin is
stripped of his office

1080
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:17,204
and his estate
and household are confiscated.

1081
01:22:18,038 --> 01:22:19,206
Mak Sim.

1082
01:22:19,206 --> 01:22:21,575
In recognition of his loyalty
in suppressing and punishing the rebels,

1083
01:22:21,575 --> 01:22:24,711
the Chief of the Cheongsu County
Yuhyangso, Lee Chung Il,

1084
01:22:24,711 --> 01:22:26,747
is rewarded by royal command.

1085
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:28,949
What are they saying?

1086
01:22:28,949 --> 01:22:30,517
This is absolutely outrageous.

1087
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:38,792
Father.

1088
01:22:39,593 --> 01:22:42,863
- You cannot leave.
- This cannot happen.

1089
01:22:42,863 --> 01:22:44,565
Father.

1090
01:22:44,565 --> 01:22:47,100
- Do not go, Young Master.
- Father.

1091
01:24:11,652 --> 01:24:16,223
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1092
01:24:16,223 --> 01:24:19,259
Sell them off immediately
at the slave market in Gungchon-ri.

1093
01:24:19,726 --> 01:24:22,162
I have nothing to offer in return.

1094
01:24:22,162 --> 01:24:23,297
Be gone.

1095
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,199
You have no one to protect you now.

1096
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:27,801
If you keep pretending to be noble
and get caught, what will you do?

1097
01:24:27,801 --> 01:24:30,037
It seems my guess was right.

1098
01:24:30,037 --> 01:24:32,773
You truly have become
Bak Jun Gi's lapdog.

1099
01:24:32,773 --> 01:24:35,342
Bak Jun Gi is not even
from Cheongsu County.

1100
01:24:35,342 --> 01:24:37,377
How did he learn about the treason
at the Devoted Hearts Association?

1101
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:39,646
Are you sure you will be okay on your own?

1102
01:24:39,646 --> 01:24:41,114
Just wait. When we leave this mountain,

1103
01:24:41,114 --> 01:24:42,983
you will thank me.

1104
01:24:42,983 --> 01:24:44,685
I was too greedy.

1105
01:24:44,685 --> 01:24:47,187
I thought I could achieve it all.
