00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,071
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,982
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,656
Don't leave.

5
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,530
Stay by my side, dear.

6
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,591
Let's go back.

7
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,993
I fear you might catch a cold
in the night breeze.

8
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:34,995
Okay.

9
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,365
Why are you crying?

10
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,566
I'm not.

11
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,603
Really...

12
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,472
Even if you like me this much,

13
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,442
a noblewoman shouldn't run out barefoot
without manners.

14
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,346
Long ago,

15
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:56,149
Lady So Hye came looking for me.

16
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:57,985
Here in Cheongsu County?

17
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:01,221
She is probably still
searching for me everywhere.

18
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:04,491
No, I believe she has forgotten
everything by now.

19
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,160
I heard she got married
and seems to be living well now.

20
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,163
If so, that is fortunate.

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,336
Anyway, I will find your father.

22
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,810
At first, I searched for him myself.
Then I even hired others,

23
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,881
but I couldn't find him
so I nearly gave up now.

24
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,118
Even if it might take some time,

25
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,755
I will find him, so don't worry.

26
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,991
Thank you.

27
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:45,732
And earlier, I know I left so suddenly
without saying a word.

28
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:47,201
I'm truly sorry.

29
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:50,604
From now on, I will even tell you
when I go to the bathroom.

30
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,679
Then we are no longer pretending.

31
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,114
We are truly husband and wife now.

32
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,883
Here, take this.

33
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:04,651
Why?

34
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,453
Get on my back.

35
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,890
No. What if someone sees us?

36
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,993
So what? I am carrying
my own wife on my back.

37
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,495
Or should I carry you in my arms?

38
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,464
No...

39
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:20,100
Hurry and get on my back.

40
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,448
I will never forget tonight
for the rest of my life.

41
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,685
Because this is the night
my wife ran out barefoot to find me.

42
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,489
To be honest,

43
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,059
I thought it might take a while for this,
so I didn't have high hopes.

44
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:51,365
I am sorry for making you wait so long.

45
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,546
We are home.

46
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,483
You can put me down now.

47
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:14,288
But you are barefoot.
Let me carry you directly to your room.

48
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,223
The servants will see.

49
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,859
Who will see us at this hour?
No one is around.

50
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,760
Huh?

51
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,501
What are you doing there?

52
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,736
It is still not solved here.

53
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,938
They are still fighting?

54
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,308
Then go and stop them.
Why are you just standing here?

55
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,744
It is a bit tricky to intervene
in this situation.

56
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:39,880
Tricky? Let us see.

57
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,249
What am I to you?

58
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,885
What exactly is our relationship?

59
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:45,853
You and me?

60
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,522
We are sharing meals. What else?

61
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,824
- Is that all?
- What else is there?

62
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,392
Do you really not know?

63
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,528
What do you mean? You are asking me.

64
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,395
Me?

65
00:04:55,796 --> 00:05:00,400
You are being petty and jealous
for no reason.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,336
Jealous? Who is jealous here?

67
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:04,004
And what did I even do?

68
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,306
You asked if I liked Man Seok.

69
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,908
- Because you do!
- Huh?

70
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,377
Not like that.

71
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,081
So, this fight is because of you?

72
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,682
I swear I have nothing to do with this.

73
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,685
Since the love cheers

74
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,188
and calling her "Miss,"
I knew something was going to happen.

75
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:25,192
"Miss?" Didn't I
tell you to behave properly?

76
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,327
It is a misunderstanding, I...

77
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,328
Shh.

78
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,732
What am I supposed to do
as my charm is too overwhelming?

79
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,034
I'm naturally friendly.

80
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,202
And the thing is,

81
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,871
she has no such feelings for me.

82
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,907
- That's not the point.
- Fine.

83
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,409
So what if I like Man Seok? What then?

84
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,345
This is driving me crazy.

85
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,647
You...

86
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,048
Is it true?

87
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,551
True or not, what does it matter to you?

88
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,586
We are not even married or anything.

89
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:55,956
Your words hurt me.

90
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,424
I even delivered your baby.

91
00:05:57,424 --> 00:06:00,327
So, since you saw my best and worst,

92
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,729
does that make me yours?

93
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,630
Are you not?

94
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,232
Stop answering with questions
and just say it!

95
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,767
How am I supposed to say that?

96
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,068
How can I know if you don't say it?

97
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,103
Shouldn't you just know clearly
without me telling you?

98
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,673
Goodness, let us just stop talking.

99
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,441
My goodness.

100
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,616
I...

101
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,921
I like you.

102
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,095
Huh?

103
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,730
A public confession?

104
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,099
I wish I hadn't seen anything.

105
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,639
My goodness.

106
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,673
Where are you going?

107
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,910
I told you already. Come back!

108
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,945
- Hey.
- Mak Sim, come back.

109
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,014
- No.
- Mak Sim, come back.

110
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,750
- Don't do that.
- Mak Sim, just come back.

111
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:03,090
Where is the honey jar?

112
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,092
I need to make some honey water
for Do Gyeom.

113
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:07,027
Leave it. I will do it.

114
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:22,276
I am so embarrassed. I wish I could die.

115
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,883
- What do I do?
- My goodness.

116
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:31,852
Really...

117
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,621
It is fine.

118
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,961
Do you really like me,

119
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,897
or was it solely to take revenge
on Tae Young

120
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,866
that you approached me on purpose?

121
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,369
Don't make any excuses
or ask for forgiveness.

122
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,672
Just tell me the truth. No,

123
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:55,142
tell me your true feelings.

124
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,947
No matter whether it hurts me or not.
Just tell me.

125
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,851
When we first met,
when you dropped that ornament.

126
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,953
Was that a coincidence?

127
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:06,954
Or...

128
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,490
Was it all planned?

129
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,196
At the time, I didn't know
you were Seong Do Gyeom.

130
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:21,034
I was simply in a rush
to the legal advocate office.

131
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:28,575
What else? What else
do you want to know?

132
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,647
When you said you wanted to be
like Tae Young,

133
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,517
was that how you truly felt?

134
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:38,252
Yes.

135
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,256
Despite my resentment at the time,

136
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,460
I came to truly respect her
while staying by her side.

137
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,063
What about at the Lantern Festival?

138
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,133
Did you throw yourself at the cart

139
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:56,036
just to win my favor and marry me?

140
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,304
No.

141
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,240
It was instinctive.

142
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,110
I did that because I was afraid
you would get hurt.

143
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,983
You must be so tormented.

144
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:14,288
I never expected you'd agonize
over each detail.

145
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,523
If not for this child,

146
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,560
you wouldn't have to keep

147
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,129
someone like me by your side.

148
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,536
No!

149
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:31,071
No!

150
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,142
Mi Ryeong!

151
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,911
No! Tae Young!

152
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,613
Get a physician. Now!

153
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:42,416
- Tae Young, what do I do?
- Mi Ryeong.

154
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,219
- What do I do?
- It is okay, it will be okay.

155
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,621
- What do I do?
- It is okay.

156
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,590
Tae Young.

157
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,759
I must have lost my mind.

158
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,330
Did you have a fight with her?

159
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,299
I just wanted to talk to her,

160
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,102
but I think I pushed her too hard.

161
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:03,470
Goodness.

162
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,712
How is she doing?

163
00:10:12,513 --> 00:10:13,981
Well...

164
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,816
Did something happen to the baby?

165
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,117
No.

166
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,120
You just missed your monthly period.

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,456
You are not pregnant.

168
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,692
What are you saying?

169
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,962
I suffered from severe morning sickness.

170
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,031
When someone desperately wants a child,

171
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,367
the body might mimic pregnancy symptoms.

172
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,537
It is possible for the body
to be fooled.

173
00:10:36,537 --> 00:10:39,673
So, it was all imagination?

174
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:51,185
I must have truly lost my senses,
Tae Young.

175
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,655
How could I delude myself like this?

176
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:56,557
It can happen.

177
00:10:56,557 --> 00:11:00,260
I have heard of such cases before.

178
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,696
The entire household was concerned.

179
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:05,666
I feel so ashamed.

180
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,100
Don't think that way.

181
00:11:07,301 --> 00:11:09,570
Who could be more upset than you?

182
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:16,076
But did you have a quarrel
with your husband?

183
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,946
For a long time,

184
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,383
he has struggled
because he couldn't trust me.

185
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,555
He endured only because of the child.

186
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:34,027
But now, he might think
even the pregnancy was a lie.

187
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,232
Please speak to him on my behalf.

188
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,306
You mean she thought she was pregnant?

189
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:47,608
Yes.

190
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:51,144
So don't blame yourself.

191
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:55,549
Then, is Mi Ryeong okay?

192
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,417
Yes, she is fine.

193
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,720
That is a relief.

194
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,989
It is truly a relief.

195
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:04,858
From now on, I'll take good care of her.

196
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:09,062
I trusted Mi Ryeong,

197
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,732
so I stopped her from leaving.

198
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,636
I kept things from you

199
00:12:15,636 --> 00:12:17,638
to protect you from being hurt.

200
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:20,741
Yes.

201
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:26,813
Then why can't you just trust Mi Ryeong?

202
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,950
Even if you can't trust her,

203
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,653
once you brought her
back from the court,

204
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:36,423
you should forget about the past
and do your part as a husband.

205
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,594
I apologize.

206
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,930
Mi Ryeong worries that now,

207
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,000
you'll misunderstand this as deception.

208
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,127
My child,

209
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,097
thank you for coming
to such an unworthy mother.

210
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:54,434
Until we meet,
please grow healthy and strong.

211
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,073
My child, did you hear
your father's voice today?

212
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:03,577
Even if he must be tired
from his time at the academy,

213
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,846
he read you a book.

214
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:11,885
He is the first to be the top scholar
in Cheongsu County.

215
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:13,253
He is an honorable man.

216
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:17,457
Moreover, he forgave
your lacking mother.

217
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,560
He is a generous man.

218
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:42,282
If I feel this empty,
how must Mi Ryeong feel?

219
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:46,887
She feared that if no child was born,
she might grow distant from Do Gyeom

220
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,922
or be forced to leave this house.

221
00:14:48,922 --> 00:14:50,991
That fear made her imagine pregnancy.

222
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,994
Mi Ryeong believed a child

223
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,964
was what tied her to Do Gyeom.

224
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,131
Do Gyeom

225
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,435
thinks his wife doesn't love him.

226
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,570
How could that be true?

227
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,872
Indeed.

228
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,107
Now that they have spoken,
things should improve.

229
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,477
This might make their bond stronger.

230
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,279
I should go check on them.

231
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,481
Where are you going at this hour?

232
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,284
I worry they might argue again.

233
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,854
How did you know they fought?

234
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,322
Well...

235
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:25,993
- I overheard it.
- Seriously.

236
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,794
It was not intentional.

237
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:32,466
Why do you meddle so much
in your married brother-in-law's affairs?

238
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:36,270
As the matriarch of the household,
I arranged the marriage,

239
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,338
and since I am partly the cause
of their troubles,

240
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,840
I feel responsible for resolving them.

241
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,810
If we have a child, it'll be a disaster.

242
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,778
What?

243
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,980
A disaster, I said.

244
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,282
Are you implying

245
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,185
I raised Do Gyeom poorly?

246
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:54,488
Of course not. Top scholar Seong
is a pride of this family.

247
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:55,989
Don't mock me.

248
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,158
Are you saying I raised him too lovingly

249
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,961
so all he knows is to receive?

250
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:02,129
No.

251
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,299
Do Gyeom is not someone
who only knows to receive.

252
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:07,601
Didn't he risk his life

253
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:09,570
traveling to Qing for you?

254
00:16:10,037 --> 00:16:13,240
I just mean he struggles a bit
with expressing emotions.

255
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:15,275
Don't be upset.

256
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:19,580
I never intended
to diminish your hard work.

257
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:22,149
- It is just...
- Just what?

258
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,385
Don't try to handle everything for him.

259
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,187
He needs to experience it himself.

260
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:30,057
He must experience failures
and setbacks himself

261
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:33,527
to overcome them.

262
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,698
Of course, I understand your wish

263
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:40,868
to spare him even the smallest pain.

264
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,904
But keeping the truth from him
to spare his feelings

265
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,206
was a mistake in the first place.

266
00:16:47,975 --> 00:16:50,544
It seems like my valid points
are annoying you.

267
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:51,912
That't true.

268
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:54,715
You are good at
reading others' feelings.

269
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,119
Why are you laughing?

270
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,120
Because I'm happy.

271
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,323
Arguing like this makes me feel like
we are husband and wife.

272
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,025
It feels normal, and I like it.

273
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,428
The moment we officially become a couple,
you can start nagging.

274
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:11,365
How did you hold back this long?

275
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,401
Okay.

276
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:19,573
Since we've broken the dam of restraint,
let me add one more thing.

277
00:17:19,573 --> 00:17:24,011
Don't meddle in Mak Sim
and Dokki's affairs, either.

278
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:25,646
Why not?

279
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:29,716
Just leave them be.
They will sort it out on their own.

280
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,784
But...

281
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:33,921
Instead of spending time on them,
pay attention to me.

282
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,591
Stop looking at others and focus on me.
Understood?

283
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,528
Tsk.

284
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,633
Will you come closer?

285
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,601
No.

286
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:55,609
Fine, I will not push you.

287
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,663
- You are here.
- Yes. It has been a while.

288
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:21,969
Hello.

289
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,673
It has indeed been a long time,
Chief Lady.

290
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:29,843
Yes, you have stayed indoors
for some time.

291
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:31,879
What brings you here today?

292
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,215
I no longer have a reason to hide.

293
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:39,219
I heard the one-eyed overseer died.

294
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,921
Really?

295
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,322
How...

296
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,691
I'm not sure,

297
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:47,895
but I heard his superior cut him off.

298
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:53,066
Oh. I heard your husband is taking
the state exam.

299
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,368
Yes.

300
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,871
He wishes to become
a Special Inspector for Cheongsu County.

301
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,806
Didn't he lose his memory?

302
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,010
The special exam is near.
Wouldn't it be hard for him to make it?

303
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:06,213
He may have lost his memory,
but not his knowledge.

304
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,148
Somehow,

305
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:12,352
my husband and Young Master Woongyi
have become competitors.

306
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,490
The results will be very intriguing.

307
00:19:17,024 --> 00:19:18,759
Indeed.

308
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,865
By the way, I heard the new Magistrate
on his first day

309
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,668
held a drinking party
in the government office with courtesans.

310
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:30,003
This is truly concerning.

311
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,507
With the drought this year,

312
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:36,109
people are selling their land
to pay taxes.

313
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,411
How could he...

314
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:40,080
The Chief will request solutions.

315
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,515
Let us wait and see.

316
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:45,752
Eternal ginseng? What is that?

317
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,721
Normal ginseng? Mountain ginseng?

318
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:52,125
Because you are from the countryside,
you are unfamiliar with many things.

319
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,361
Well...

320
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,698
Eternal ginseng is
an extremely valuable and rare crop.

321
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,569
Historically, it was used solely
by the royal family,

322
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,039
but now it is a prominent export
to Qing and Japan.

323
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,407
It has become highly popular.

324
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:11,545
And how does this relate

325
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:13,580
to Cheongsu Country's current condition?

326
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:22,656
A dear friend of mine,
Heo Soon from Hamcheong County,

327
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,825
is selling eternal ginseng seeds.

328
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:27,694
It is so scarce
that people clamor for it,

329
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,864
but he has agreed to sell them
exclusively to Cheongsu County.

330
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:32,833
How lucky you are!

331
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:40,374
How can you call someone a true leader
if he only solves crises?

332
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,176
With a small investment,

333
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,779
we can transform Cheongsu County's
people into prosperous landowners.

334
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,482
This is an opportunity
you should not miss.

335
00:20:58,592 --> 00:20:59,993
- Stand back.
- Step aside.

336
00:21:02,496 --> 00:21:04,164
Madam, please see this.

337
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,332
My Lord.

338
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,302
The new magistrate
looks quite formidable.

339
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:09,469
Yes, he is new.

340
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:29,456
But can eternal ginseng grow

341
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,925
in Cheongsu County amid this drought?

342
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:35,796
They claim it is a drought-resistant crop
that grows easily.

343
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:40,267
If true, it sounds like a great proposal.
What is there to hesitate about?

344
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,203
We spent everything hiring an expert
for Woongyi,

345
00:21:43,203 --> 00:21:46,673
and now we cannot even afford
to pay taxes.

346
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:50,677
Why would you hire an expert
without consulting me first?

347
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,980
First, it was Ok Tae Young's
brother-in-law.

348
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,649
And now, Ok Tae Young's husband
is competing with Woongyi.

349
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,385
What if Woongyi fails again?
Would that please you?

350
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,322
Anyway, I agree to grow eternal ginseng!

351
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,091
But there is something

352
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,895
that feels suspicious.

353
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,163
Suspicious?

354
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:13,834
About what? The Magistrate?

355
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,003
I will think this through carefully.

356
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:17,204
You must promise

357
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,073
to act as if you heard nothing.

358
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:34,087
You seem to be enjoying studying
despite disliking it.

359
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,889
I even hear you humming.

360
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:41,929
Don't you feel sad
seeing me live like this?

361
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:47,367
Well, I did feel sad and worried
when you stopped being an artist.

362
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,036
But now,

363
00:22:50,571 --> 00:22:54,908
living in this countryside, hidden away,
free from being recognized,

364
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,377
it feels nice too.

365
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:01,915
Oh, what happened with Mak Sim?

366
00:23:01,915 --> 00:23:03,083
Well,

367
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,620
I just whispered something
about Madam Tae Young's past with her.

368
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,789
That is all.

369
00:23:09,022 --> 00:23:10,724
So Dokki misunderstood?

370
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:13,126
Yes. He completely misread it.

371
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,095
Here he comes.

372
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,266
Master, the roof is fixed now.

373
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,568
So you can return to your room.

374
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,972
You fixed it?

375
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,507
Seriously?

376
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:38,852
Hey.

377
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,921
Be nice to Mak Sim.

378
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,457
What are you talking about?

379
00:23:43,457 --> 00:23:45,425
She likes you, right?

380
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,694
I will wish both of you happiness,

381
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:49,096
so good luck to you.

382
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,899
- Huh?
- Seriously.

383
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:54,635
Hey, I have no feelings for her.

384
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:58,972
You punk! There is nothing wrong
with Mak Sim for you not to have feelings!

385
00:23:58,972 --> 00:24:02,376
She has a heart
as warm as a fluffy quilt.

386
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:03,810
- Seriously?
- And not only that.

387
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,748
She is wise,
and she has dexterous fingertips.

388
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:10,217
No matter how hard my day is,
just seeing her makes me

389
00:24:10,217 --> 00:24:14,555
laugh like a madman.

390
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:15,556
Do you understand?

391
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,291
I cannot listen to this anymore.

392
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,693
- Hey, Dokki.
- Yes.

393
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:21,995
Why didn't you tell that
to Mak Sim last night?

394
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:24,865
You are telling that to Man Seok now?

395
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:28,635
Exactly. Why cry over spilled milk?

396
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:31,505
It is too embarrassing
to say such things to her face.

397
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:33,173
Is this a distinct feature here

398
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,975
or is this house cursed?

399
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,078
Why are all the men here
so incompetent at romance?

400
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:39,146
I absolutely agree.

401
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,814
This won't do.

402
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,016
I will use my talents

403
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:46,687
to teach you how to win Mak Sim's heart.

404
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:49,523
What do you say?
Will you follow my advice?

405
00:24:49,523 --> 00:24:51,825
Yes, I will follow it.

406
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:53,861
Just tell me what to do.

407
00:25:00,434 --> 00:25:04,004
This is a pawn receipt left
by Bang from the lower village.

408
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:08,909
But the items were sold
before the deadline.

409
00:25:08,909 --> 00:25:10,043
What do we do?

410
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:13,146
Here, take a break and have some of this
while you sort it out.

411
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:17,050
Why is there so much food?

412
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,186
Did the Elder Master send more?

413
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:22,656
He said to prepare something good
for your strength, so I made steamed fish.

414
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:25,592
It looks delicious. Let us eat together.

415
00:25:27,594 --> 00:25:29,897
You both clearly like each other,

416
00:25:29,897 --> 00:25:32,432
so why not stop playing hard-to-get

417
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:35,202
and just consummate your relationship
with Dokki?

418
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:38,172
How shameless of you to say that
in front of Madam!

419
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,541
Because I am annoyed.

420
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:44,111
Dokki's sighs kept me awake all night.

421
00:25:44,111 --> 00:25:46,113
Why is everyone here
having love quarrels?

422
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:47,881
I am the only lonely one.

423
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,216
Will you shut up?

424
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:51,552
Did the two
in the bridal chamber argue again?

425
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:56,190
No. The Young Master has not even gone
to the academy.

426
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,125
They seem to be staying together.

427
00:25:59,026 --> 00:25:59,960
Really?

428
00:26:27,154 --> 00:26:30,190
(I cannot bear to face you, Do Gyeom,)

429
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,125
(so I leave this letter.)

430
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,368
(Because the only reason)

431
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:45,239
(you accepted me
into your family has vanished,)

432
00:26:46,273 --> 00:26:50,811
(I no longer feel
I belong in this place.)

433
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:57,251
(Please stop suffering because of me.)

434
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:19,973
(When was it?)

435
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:23,610
(Mi Ryeong's mother
is a distant relative,)

436
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,746
(and she suddenly came one day
and left her here)

437
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:28,348
(as if she was abandoning her.)

438
00:27:29,616 --> 00:27:31,985
(I told her that if she stopped crying
and behaved,)

439
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:34,788
(her mother would come back for her.)

440
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:36,990
Mom.

441
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,861
Since then, without a single complaint,

442
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:44,198
she lived only to take care of me,
a single father.

443
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:29,877
(How happy she must have been
when her mother came back.)

444
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:33,847
(Afraid her mother might leave again,)

445
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:36,517
(she must've done everything
she asked of her.)

446
00:28:36,517 --> 00:28:38,619
I wish I'd take a break from washing.

447
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,053
Okay, go inside.

448
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:41,989
- Good luck.
- Thanks. Bye.

449
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:45,626
I just saw Lady Mi Ryeong earlier.

450
00:28:45,626 --> 00:28:48,095
I think she came to see her father.

451
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:50,998
No, she was heading into Yeonpunggak.

452
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:53,967
Really? She went into a courtesan house?

453
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:55,335
Goodness.

454
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:58,739
- Mae Hyang.
- Master, you have visited after so long.

455
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:05,345
It seems you want
to make me happy today, Myeong Wol.

456
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:08,081
Master, you are quite drunk.

457
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:30,003
Come closer.

458
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:34,308
My goodness, not just your face
but even your skin is so fair.

459
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:35,309
Well...

460
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:36,944
Sorry.

461
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:42,683
Yes, I will bring out the drinks now.

462
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,991
You look new here. Are you alone?

463
00:29:50,991 --> 00:29:54,728
I am looking for someone.

464
00:29:54,728 --> 00:29:57,664
Who shall I call for you?

465
00:29:57,664 --> 00:29:59,800
Yeong Rang? So Yool?

466
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,134
Mi Ryeong.

467
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,770
Is there a woman named
Cha Mi Ryeong here?

468
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,472
Mi Ryeong.

469
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:09,977
She is probably
by the corridor over there.

470
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:12,212
Pour me a drink.

471
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:15,449
Let me have a taste.

472
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:18,886
So beautiful.

473
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:21,121
- You are making me shy.
- Shy?

474
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:24,925
Here, pour me a drink as well.

475
00:30:27,261 --> 00:30:28,395
You should come and sit too.

476
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:29,696
Let go of my hand.

477
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,698
I'm not a courtesan.

478
00:30:31,698 --> 00:30:35,202
If you are in a courtesan house,
you are one. What nonsense is this?

479
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:37,437
Just ignore her.

480
00:30:37,437 --> 00:30:38,972
Play with me instead.

481
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:40,007
Let go.

482
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:42,509
What are you going to do?

483
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:47,314
One should not treat a woman not listed
in the registry with disrespect.

484
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:48,482
What if I do?

485
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,617
Then what?

486
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:52,085
If you are curious,

487
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,022
go ahead and try.

488
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,065
What is this?

489
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:06,266
You tell me.

490
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:07,601
Will you move aside?

491
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:09,136
I won't.

492
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,071
Why? Who are you?

493
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:12,072
Me?

494
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,942
Her husband.

495
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,715
Why are you here?

496
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,153
Don't you really know why?

497
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:32,025
Are you ashamed that I'm working
in a place like this?

498
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:35,762
Even before marriage,

499
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:38,232
I sewed and cooked here.

500
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:42,169
I have nowhere else to go for now,

501
00:31:43,337 --> 00:31:44,605
but I will move soon.

502
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:48,342
Why leave a perfectly fine house
to rely on this place?

503
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:52,145
Do you mean to separate from me?

504
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:55,148
I have countless reasons
to be kicked out of that house.

505
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:57,951
Since I have no child,
don't feel responsible.

506
00:31:57,951 --> 00:32:00,521
Don't pity me. Feel free to kick me out.

507
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,457
Don't burden yourself because of me.

508
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,326
Simply request separation,
and it will be done.

509
00:32:08,962 --> 00:32:10,030
No.

510
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,431
You said you hated me.

511
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:14,301
I make you miserable. So why?

512
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,136
Because I love you.

513
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:20,440
Regardless of your intentions,
what you did,

514
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,677
your background, or what,

515
00:32:24,811 --> 00:32:26,380
I love you.

516
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:31,485
I didn't hold onto you
because of the child.

517
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:34,988
I held on because, thanks to the child,
I had an excuse to keep you by my side.

518
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:40,494
For all the times I lacked honesty
and acted foolishly,

519
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:43,463
I am sorry.

520
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:51,071
I knew how hard it must have been,

521
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:52,840
but I was not someone you could lean on.

522
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,643
I hurt you and made you feel lonely.

523
00:32:59,613 --> 00:33:01,682
I am truly sorry.

524
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:12,659
Careful.

525
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,104
See?

526
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:26,673
Told you they'd work it out themselves.

527
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:33,514
Let us unload. One, two, three.

528
00:33:33,514 --> 00:33:35,449
This way. Thank you.

529
00:33:38,952 --> 00:33:40,287
Everything seems fine.

530
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,423
I wanted to stay close to you,

531
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:46,326
but I was assigned to Hongmungwan,
so I am flustered.

532
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:50,864
Everyone dreams of a central post.
It is a privilege, not a burden.

533
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:53,200
But what if I miss you, Tae Young?

534
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:56,670
Our dear young master.

535
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,407
When did you grow so mature?

536
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:05,045
Do you remember the day
I packed my things to leave?

537
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,950
Father has passed,
and my brother is gone.

538
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,886
I am no more than a stranger to you.

539
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:15,155
I cannot bring disgrace to your family.

540
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:16,456
A stranger?

541
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:19,760
You are the only family I have left now.

542
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,695
You are my only family too.

543
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:25,933
I don't wish to leave, either.

544
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:30,604
If you had not stopped me that day,

545
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:32,639
I wouldn't be here now.

546
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:38,445
Thank you for raising me
with boundless love.

547
00:34:39,112 --> 00:34:40,280
I am forever grateful.

548
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,851
Honor your late father's wishes,

549
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:48,021
and be someone the people can rely on.

550
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,157
I will remember that.

551
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:55,596
Young Master has grown so much

552
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:57,831
to earn a post in Hanyang.

553
00:34:57,831 --> 00:34:59,967
How admirable and praiseworthy.

554
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,102
- I am moved to tears.
- Goodness.

555
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,439
It is a joyous occasion.
Why are you crying?

556
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:06,940
- I'm not crying.
- Fine.

557
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:12,880
Young Madam, there will be
many good things in your future.

558
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,414
I will miss you.

559
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:16,783
Please visit me in Hanyang.

560
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:22,422
I am comforted knowing
you are here, Yun Gyeom.

561
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,791
Don't worry about the household

562
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:27,361
or Tae Young.
I will take good care of her.

563
00:35:28,095 --> 00:35:29,029
Sure.

564
00:35:30,697 --> 00:35:32,432
- Tae Young.
- Yes?

565
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:38,172
I will never take off this bracelet.

566
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:40,307
Neither will I.

567
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:47,014
This is the first heartfelt gift
I have ever received.

568
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:50,817
Are you trying to make me cry?

569
00:35:53,587 --> 00:35:56,723
Please stay healthy, Tae Young.

570
00:35:58,659 --> 00:35:59,526
Yes.

571
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:02,863
If your husband troubles you, send word.

572
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,200
Yes.

573
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:08,669
Take care.

574
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:12,472
Safe travels.

575
00:36:12,472 --> 00:36:13,607
Stay well.

576
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:49,009
Thanks to you, I found a fine residence
in Hanyang for them.

577
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:52,145
You raised him like your own son,

578
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:53,647
so you must feel empty now.

579
00:36:54,648 --> 00:36:56,350
I have many cases to deal with,

580
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:58,852
and my husband's state exam is near,

581
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:00,454
so I will keep myself busy.

582
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:01,855
That is great.

583
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:05,759
By the way, have you heard
of eternal ginseng?

584
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:08,428
Eternal ginseng?

585
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:10,664
I haven't.

586
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,666
What is it?

587
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,134
I'm not sure, either.

588
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:15,836
I heard that the Chief Lady

589
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:18,505
was encouraging investment
in eternal ginseng farming.

590
00:37:19,273 --> 00:37:21,808
After the mining losses seven years ago,

591
00:37:21,808 --> 00:37:24,011
I worry she is plotting
another reckless scheme.

592
00:37:24,378 --> 00:37:25,746
Should I look into it for you?

593
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:28,215
There is no need.
The exam is near, so don't mind this.

594
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,584
It is probably nothing serious.

595
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:33,921
Knowing how fanciful she is,
I just asked out of caution.

596
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:40,360
But this time, your husband
must pass the scholars' exam.

597
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:44,531
The Chief Lady is going around
saying he will fail.

598
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:45,766
Oh my.

599
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:50,904
You have read the required texts,

600
00:37:50,904 --> 00:37:54,341
studied the writings
of the Eight Masters,

601
00:37:54,341 --> 00:37:55,776
and broadened your perspective

602
00:37:55,776 --> 00:37:57,911
by reading the history book
and "Hundred Schools of Thought."

603
00:37:57,911 --> 00:37:59,580
In the remaining days,

604
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,816
it would be wise to review
model compositions.

605
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:05,285
Your writing tends to lean on emotion,

606
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,353
which worries me.

607
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:09,890
What are you doing?

608
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,225
I just wanted to poke you.

609
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:13,293
Focus on your studies.

610
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:16,063
The Chief Lady is wishing
for your failure.

611
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,664
Don't pressure me.

612
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,433
- Let go.
- No.

613
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:23,737
Let go.

614
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,405
Just once more.

615
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:30,110
Oh.

616
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:37,150
I brought you a snack.
Eat while studying.

617
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,185
Thank you.

618
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,288
Did you see that?

619
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:43,490
Mak Sim!

620
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,159
It is so pretty.

621
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,629
This? Dokki gave it to me.

622
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,197
He said he found it on his way home.

623
00:38:50,998 --> 00:38:54,668
By the way,
could you read this while you eat?

624
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:57,771
Dokki gave it to me,
but I cannot read what it says.

625
00:38:57,771 --> 00:38:58,772
Really?

626
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:02,509
- Dokki wrote you a love letter.
- Huh?

627
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:04,845
Dear Mak Sim who is
as warm as a fluffy quilt.

628
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:08,182
I thought it was some account
from the fish market.

629
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:09,550
Enjoy your snack.

630
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,518
Wait, I will finish reading it.

631
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,323
But you told me not to interfere.

632
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:18,192
Was it you who told Dokki to do this?

633
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:20,160
Not only that.

634
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:23,797
The script, acting, and plot
were all my direction!

635
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,471
Here.

636
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:36,743
Your teeth can be hidden
but you can't neglect them.

637
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:38,879
There is a forest here.

638
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,113
Stay still. One, two, three.

639
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,382
Be gentle.

640
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,252
Do you want smiling eyebrows
or crying ones?

641
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,920
- Smiling ones.
- Smiling? Okay.

642
00:39:52,893 --> 00:39:54,995
Good, one more. It looks great.

643
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:56,997
More sweat.

644
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:58,966
Stop distracting him. Go outside.

645
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:00,133
You fit perfectly.

646
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:03,837
When giving it to Mak Sim,
should I just hand it like this?

647
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:08,308
- Not like that. It is too scary.
- Okay.

648
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:09,343
Here it is.

649
00:40:09,643 --> 00:40:11,211
Here it is.

650
00:40:11,678 --> 00:40:12,479
Smile.

651
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:16,517
That is good,
but can you smile a little prettier?

652
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,619
- Here it is.
- Yes, that is the one.

653
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:20,754
Yes, excellent.

654
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:21,889
Here it is.

655
00:40:25,526 --> 00:40:26,493
What is this?

656
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:30,797
I'm asking you.

657
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:18,045
You did well.

658
00:41:18,045 --> 00:41:20,247
But why are you neglecting your studies?

659
00:41:21,048 --> 00:41:22,449
Then,

660
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:26,653
if I pass the exam,
will you grant me a wish?

661
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,790
- All of a sudden?
- Don't you want to?

662
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,559
If you pass, I will. What is it?

663
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,863
I will tell you after I pass.

664
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:40,000
Eat this. If you don't rest,
you will get sick.

665
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,968
Okay.

666
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:43,036
Here.

667
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,877
I am too busy studying to use my hands.

668
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:50,944
So here.

669
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:55,849
Dip it in syrup for me.

670
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:07,628
Open your mouth.

671
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,364
Sorry.

672
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:54,141
This won't do.

673
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:55,275
Yes?

674
00:42:55,542 --> 00:42:58,846
If this goes on, I will fail the exam.

675
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,582
Yes, that makes sense.

676
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,083
Well,

677
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,985
Dokki fixed the roof,

678
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:07,621
so until the exam is over,
let us sleep apart.

679
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:08,922
In separate rooms?

680
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:12,459
If I fail the exam and fail to
become the Special Inspector,

681
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:14,294
the Chief Lady
will ridicule me mercilessly.

682
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:17,297
The entire village is interested
in my state exam.

683
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:18,565
I cannot humiliate myself.

684
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:22,436
Take the sleep elixir and sleep tight.

685
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,628
Sorry.

686
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,368
One cow.

687
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:56,470
Two cows.

688
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,139
Three cows.

689
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:01,508
Four cows.

690
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,947
Three hundred twenty-six cows.

691
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:10,384
Three hundred twenty-seven cows.

692
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:24,565
In a market where the crowd,
bewitched by joy, had lost themselves...

693
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:26,600
Stood a young lord,

694
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:31,004
disguised and watching intently.

695
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,853
I am truly mad.

696
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:05,072
Why are my eyes so blurry?

697
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:14,374
It hurts.

698
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:25,152
Again. There is a flow to this,
and you lost it.

699
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,020
Try answering this.

700
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:32,125
To learn and practice,
is it not a delight?

701
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:33,293
Correct?

702
00:46:37,764 --> 00:46:38,665
No.

703
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,606
I am fine.

704
00:46:51,211 --> 00:46:53,514
- Moon Ji Ho.
- Scholars have come from all regions.

705
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:56,049
Han Kyung Soo.

706
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,586
Passing the exam is not
everything in life.

707
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:02,222
You can try again.
This is not the end of life.

708
00:47:02,222 --> 00:47:03,657
What are you saying?

709
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:05,692
Think of this as the last chance.
Understood?

710
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:07,127
- Okay.
- Cha Woongyi.

711
00:47:07,127 --> 00:47:10,330
- Here.
- Eat this.

712
00:47:10,764 --> 00:47:13,000
- Stay calm.
- Like you have always been.

713
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,501
Stay calm.

714
00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:18,639
Don't be nervous, Yun Gyeom.
Just do your best.

715
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,209
Even if I don't pass,
don't be disappointed.

716
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:23,076
Of course.

717
00:47:23,076 --> 00:47:25,012
Now is not the time
for such lack of confidence.

718
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:26,413
Repeat after me.

719
00:47:26,413 --> 00:47:28,382
I am amazing. I am the best.

720
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,851
I am amazing. I am the best.

721
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:31,752
Yes.

722
00:47:31,752 --> 00:47:33,053
Say it, and it will come true.

723
00:47:33,353 --> 00:47:34,888
Seong Yun Gyeom.

724
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:36,023
That is us.

725
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:37,925
Elder Master!

726
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,493
Top scholar!

727
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:42,729
- Elder Master!
- Top scholar!

728
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:44,798
Aren't they too loud?

729
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:46,633
Just focus on Woongyi.

730
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:47,634
Goodness.

731
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:48,936
Top scholar!

732
00:47:48,936 --> 00:47:52,272
- Elder Master!
- Top scholar!

733
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:40,087
A question about politics?

734
00:48:40,354 --> 00:48:42,723
An essay question was given
about politics again?

735
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:43,624
Yes.

736
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:47,728
Why is there an essay question
about politics in a scholars' exam?

737
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:52,266
Perhaps the King wishes
to gather scholars' opinions.

738
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:53,333
My goodness.

739
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:56,270
We didn't prepare
for an essay question on politics.

740
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,504
Was it difficult?

741
00:48:57,504 --> 00:49:00,440
I poured my feelings into it,
writing with all my heart.

742
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,342
I wrote it earnestly.

743
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:03,810
Feelings, fine.

744
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,079
- As long as you tried your best.
- Yes.

745
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,283
But why feelings?
It is not a letter anyway.

746
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,485
- I am satisfied.
- Yes.

747
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,188
A fine piece of work. This is a pass.

748
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,257
This is the essay of candidate 63.

749
00:49:18,458 --> 00:49:19,826
(Ranking List)
The results are here.

750
00:49:19,826 --> 00:49:22,129
Wait.

751
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:24,998
- Is it there?
- What does it say?

752
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:26,066
Hold on a second.

753
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:29,169
He passed!

754
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:31,605
Our son passed.

755
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,142
You are remarkable.

756
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,210
Hold on.

757
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,479
Not there.

758
00:49:39,479 --> 00:49:41,148
- Seong Yun Gyeom is not listed.
- What?

759
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,285
What did I say?

760
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:48,355
Do you think just anyone can pass
the scholars' exam?

761
00:49:50,023 --> 00:49:51,291
I am sorry, guys.

762
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:54,294
- It is okay.
- Yes.

763
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:56,163
- There is always a next time.
- You did great, son.

764
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:58,198
I am so proud of you.

765
00:49:59,499 --> 00:50:02,035
The top scholar of the scholars' exam is

766
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:04,404
Seong Yun Gyeom.

767
00:50:04,404 --> 00:50:06,039
- What?
- Top scholar!

768
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,642
Top scholar!
Our master is the top scholar!

769
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,011
Well...

770
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,079
Oh my.

771
00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:16,383
You shouldn't be pleased like that.

772
00:50:16,383 --> 00:50:18,719
This is embarrassing.

773
00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:25,025
You are the top scholar.

774
00:50:28,562 --> 00:50:29,897
Hurry, here.

775
00:50:30,264 --> 00:50:33,367
Let us not just gloss over this.

776
00:50:33,367 --> 00:50:37,137
We should not let this pass
without a proper celebration, right?

777
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:38,405
Stop it.

778
00:50:38,405 --> 00:50:40,374
Two top scholars in one family?

779
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:42,776
We should hang a plaque for this,
right, Elder Master?

780
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:44,178
Certainly.

781
00:50:44,178 --> 00:50:45,879
Did you just call him "Elder Master?"

782
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:49,483
He is now the Elder Top Scholar Seong.

783
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:54,388
Stop it, guys. Just eat.
You are flattering me too much.

784
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:56,623
You should be flattered all the way.

785
00:50:56,623 --> 00:50:58,725
- Eat up.
- Let me serve. Sit down.

786
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,028
You have worked so hard.

787
00:51:01,028 --> 00:51:02,563
I am truly proud of you.

788
00:51:02,796 --> 00:51:04,798
A fine teacher and a fine student.

789
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:06,300
Well then,

790
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,269
to celebrate our Elder Master having won
the first place in the exam,

791
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:14,808
- cheers!
- Cheers!

792
00:51:17,611 --> 00:51:18,879
- Hold on.
- Huh?

793
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:22,082
What is it?

794
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:26,119
My goodness.

795
00:51:31,024 --> 00:51:33,093
Why did you suddenly do that?
You made me shy.

796
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:34,595
I am applying what I have learned.

797
00:51:38,498 --> 00:51:39,566
Well,

798
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:43,103
now that I have passed the exam,

799
00:51:44,071 --> 00:51:47,074
will you grant me my wish?

800
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:48,842
Of course.

801
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:50,777
What is your wish?

802
00:51:52,412 --> 00:51:54,681
What I postponed for the state exam.

803
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:58,986
First night.

804
00:52:05,425 --> 00:52:08,862
Do you mean the first night together?

805
00:52:17,604 --> 00:52:19,640
Wait a minute. What do you mean?

806
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,141
First night?

807
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,911
You've been sharing a bed,
and you call today the first night?

808
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:27,247
Then, until now?

809
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:30,651
I postponed it so it wouldn't interfere
with his studies.

810
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:33,754
But still...

811
00:52:34,188 --> 00:52:36,223
Wait, what should you wear?

812
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:37,224
Check this out.

813
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:40,060
My goodness.

814
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,128
This one?

815
00:52:41,128 --> 00:52:43,096
Let us see.

816
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:48,769
You prepared everything
like a blushing bride.

817
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,437
This is for you, Mak Sim.

818
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:52,039
For me?

819
00:52:52,973 --> 00:52:56,743
Tonight, I will be your wedding matron.

820
00:52:58,045 --> 00:52:59,112
What do you...

821
00:52:59,313 --> 00:53:00,747
You and Dokki should marry.

822
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:05,752
It would be great for you two
to stay together from now on.

823
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:09,590
What is all this about?
It is not necessary.

824
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,526
It is not grand,
but I prepared it in advance.

825
00:53:12,526 --> 00:53:14,492
Yun Gyeom has also filled
the biggest room

826
00:53:14,493 --> 00:53:16,230
with new furniture and bedding.

827
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:24,538
Do you remember?

828
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,307
The flower shoes I gave to Baekyi.

829
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:31,311
Baekyi never got to walk a flowery path,

830
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:35,749
but I hope you can walk one.

831
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:42,222
Being with you here feels
like a flower field to me.

832
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:44,658
You like it though, right?

833
00:53:52,032 --> 00:53:54,801
What if she does not want it?
What should I do?

834
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:57,838
Then we wait a bit longer.
Don't worry too much.

835
00:53:57,838 --> 00:53:58,872
Right.

836
00:53:58,872 --> 00:54:02,176
It is just us, so there is no shame
if the bride runs away.

837
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:03,177
True.

838
00:54:03,177 --> 00:54:06,547
If you are too nervous, repeat after me.

839
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:07,948
I am amazing.

840
00:54:08,649 --> 00:54:10,417
I am the best.

841
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:14,454
I am amazing. I am the best!

842
00:54:14,454 --> 00:54:16,657
- How do you feel?
- I feel full of energy now.

843
00:54:16,657 --> 00:54:17,991
That is it. Good.

844
00:54:17,991 --> 00:54:19,493
- I am amazing.
- That is right.

845
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:21,161
- I am the best.
- Great!

846
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:23,030
I am the best!

847
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,668
Here she comes.

848
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:41,782
- Why?
- My goodness.

849
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:18,051
How beautiful.

850
00:55:45,846 --> 00:55:49,016
I have admired you for such a long time.

851
00:55:50,017 --> 00:55:52,352
This is so embarrassing,
so just get on with it.

852
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:53,687
Yes, let us move on.

853
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:59,826
Tomorrow at dawn, I will go to Baekyi
and make my pledge

854
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:04,331
to take care of you for the rest
of my life, so she can stop worrying.

855
00:56:07,467 --> 00:56:11,271
But will Baekyi grant us her blessing?

856
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:15,876
She will be happy.

857
00:56:17,778 --> 00:56:19,780
She followed you like a father.

858
00:56:24,117 --> 00:56:25,219
Cheers.

859
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:33,160
You two drank it.

860
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,595
Now there is no turning back.

861
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:37,331
You will live together
until your hair turns gray.

862
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:40,100
So please stop fighting because of me.

863
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,069
May you grow old together in harmony.

864
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:42,936
Now.

865
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:46,039
Get on with it!

866
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,908
- My goodness.
- Get on with it!

867
00:56:48,308 --> 00:56:51,578
My goodness, what to do?
Wait, what is all this about?

868
00:56:51,578 --> 00:56:52,980
What is this all about?

869
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,252
Start with linking arms.

870
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:02,556
What now?

871
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,462
Just put your arms around her
and start from there.

872
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:24,978
(The happiest days
of my life were passing by.)

873
00:57:27,414 --> 00:57:30,417
(Unaware of the trials
that awaited us ahead,)

874
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:35,088
(we simply basked in our happiness.)

875
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:04,484
Thank you for granting my wish.

876
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:10,123
How is it that you always know
exactly what I want?

877
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:15,162
That is because your wish is my wish.

878
00:58:16,563 --> 00:58:19,299
You share all your time with me

879
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:23,303
and cherish the people dear to me.

880
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:27,374
I cannot imagine a single day
without you anymore.

881
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:29,376
This is serious.

882
00:58:29,376 --> 00:58:32,546
It seems you cannot live a day
without me now.

883
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:37,217
Right. How did you know the answer
to the essay question about politics?

884
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:40,120
I heard they asked
about famine relief measures.

885
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:43,156
Oh.

886
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:47,728
My response is like this.

887
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:51,899
Despite consistent relief efforts,
the suffering of the people deepens

888
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:53,734
due to the greed of corrupt officials

889
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:55,502
engaging in bribery and exploitation.

890
00:58:59,506 --> 00:59:01,041
That was your answer?

891
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:06,280
It is a miracle you were not arrested
and flogged for saying that.

892
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,949
Of course, I proposed a solution.

893
00:59:09,483 --> 00:59:11,151
I suggested nobles open their granaries

894
00:59:11,151 --> 00:59:13,220
and actively engage
in private relief efforts.

895
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,821
By promoting a spirit of generosity

896
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:17,524
and rewarding those
who lead such efforts,

897
00:59:17,524 --> 00:59:20,928
we could expedite the relief process.

898
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:24,831
You asked nobles
to open their granaries?

899
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:25,866
Yes.

900
00:59:27,601 --> 00:59:29,503
Isn't that what you are doing now?

901
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:32,472
Indeed.

902
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:38,712
I merely emulated
and applied what I learned from you,

903
00:59:40,013 --> 00:59:41,515
and I became a top scholar.

904
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:43,650
You are truly remarkable.

905
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:51,158
But did you think

906
00:59:52,693 --> 00:59:56,630
my wish was our first night together?

907
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:04,404
No, of course not.

908
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:13,480
I was just worried
you might have misunderstood.

909
01:01:55,315 --> 01:01:56,383
Do Gyeom.

910
01:01:57,651 --> 01:01:58,952
You startled me.

911
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:02,322
I'm not going anywhere. What is it?

912
01:02:02,322 --> 01:02:05,659
Yun Gyeom passed the scholar exam
with the highest marks.

913
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:06,627
Really?

914
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:10,631
See? I knew he would succeed.

915
01:02:10,631 --> 01:02:13,133
I miss everyone so much.

916
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:15,035
I am so homesick it hurts.

917
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:18,605
Is my daily affection
not enough for you?

918
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:21,108
No, so you must try harder.

919
01:02:29,249 --> 01:02:31,418
Don't be like that.

920
01:02:32,286 --> 01:02:34,421
You told me to try harder.

921
01:02:36,323 --> 01:02:38,959
I am leaving now. Eat well.

922
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:39,993
Yes.

923
01:02:49,236 --> 01:02:51,438
The petitions still
have not been processed?

924
01:02:51,438 --> 01:02:54,441
The new Magistrate is not doing his job.

925
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:58,312
Are the rumors that he bought
his position with money true?

926
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:00,347
Next, please.

927
01:03:04,151 --> 01:03:05,652
Madam.

928
01:03:05,652 --> 01:03:07,654
Aren't you Goo?

929
01:03:07,654 --> 01:03:12,759
It seems I have fallen victim to a scam.

930
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:14,828
A scam?

931
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:17,164
Explain everything in detail.

932
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:19,967
There is a guy named Heo Soon
from Hamcheong County.

933
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:23,604
He claimed to sell
the rare eternal ginseng seeds, and I...

934
01:03:23,604 --> 01:03:24,705
Eternal ginseng?

935
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:27,975
It seems you know of it.

936
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:32,246
I mortgaged my fields
to buy those seeds.

937
01:03:32,246 --> 01:03:35,549
Days have passed since the promised date,
but I have heard nothing.

938
01:03:35,549 --> 01:03:37,017
What should I do?

939
01:03:37,017 --> 01:03:39,486
Didn't Bang make
a similar request earlier?

940
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:43,257
It seems this isn't
just an ordinary matter.

941
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,696
A family with two top scholars.

942
01:03:49,696 --> 01:03:53,433
Your late father must be
so proud from above.

943
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:56,737
I believe it is thanks

944
01:03:56,737 --> 01:04:00,674
to the positive encouragement
provided by you, Chief.

945
01:04:01,608 --> 01:04:02,476
Me?

946
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:05,712
Yes, of course, it is thanks to me.

947
01:04:06,046 --> 01:04:06,947
Indeed.

948
01:04:06,947 --> 01:04:09,416
You know how to flatter others.

949
01:04:12,352 --> 01:04:13,353
What is it?

950
01:04:17,357 --> 01:04:19,459
Hey, explain to me.

951
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,562
Why is there no word from Heo Soon?

952
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:24,765
Heo Soon? Why ask me?

953
01:04:24,765 --> 01:04:26,500
Don't feign ignorance.

954
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,102
The entire county is in turmoil.

955
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:32,072
What is happening in Cheongsu County?

956
01:04:32,072 --> 01:04:33,540
What is happening?

957
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:37,778
Everyone has spent their entire fortune
on those eternal ginseng seeds!

958
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:39,580
- What?
- Eternal ginseng?

959
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,881
Eternal...

960
01:04:42,482 --> 01:04:43,717
Eternal ginseng?

961
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:44,618
Yes!

962
01:04:44,618 --> 01:04:48,755
No, I rejected his proposal.

963
01:04:48,755 --> 01:04:49,756
What do you mean?

964
01:04:49,756 --> 01:04:52,693
Your wife agreed and took charge

965
01:04:52,693 --> 01:04:54,695
with your consent.

966
01:04:54,695 --> 01:04:56,296
This...

967
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,571
Come out now!

968
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:06,607
We know you are in there!

969
01:05:06,607 --> 01:05:09,843
If you don't come out now,
we will break into your house!

970
01:05:09,843 --> 01:05:12,246
I have many children to raise.

971
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:14,815
We will all starve to death.

972
01:05:15,148 --> 01:05:18,652
Madam, please save us!

973
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:21,788
I have a headache.

974
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:24,892
My head hurts.

975
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:29,897
What is all this, Lady Hong?

976
01:05:29,897 --> 01:05:33,033
I have no idea how this happened...

977
01:05:33,033 --> 01:05:35,869
Give me my money!

978
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,437
- What is it?
- That was everything we had!

979
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,539
Let go of me.

980
01:05:39,606 --> 01:05:41,008
Stop her.

981
01:05:42,009 --> 01:05:43,343
Give me my money!

982
01:05:43,343 --> 01:05:45,379
Give me back my money now!

983
01:05:45,379 --> 01:05:47,614
What are you doing? Show some dignity!

984
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:49,016
Stop it.

985
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:50,984
What is going on here?

986
01:05:50,984 --> 01:05:52,786
We are doomed.

987
01:05:53,453 --> 01:05:57,958
Cheongsu County is completely doomed
because of this woman.

988
01:05:58,492 --> 01:06:00,227
Why me? What did I do?

989
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:03,530
I was only following
the Magistrate's orders.

990
01:06:04,698 --> 01:06:05,732
The Magistrate?

991
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:09,503
(Cheongsu County)

992
01:06:10,003 --> 01:06:13,006
He couldn't get through me,
so he went to lure my wife?

993
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:14,708
Magistrate, come out!

994
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,378
I said come out, Magistrate!

995
01:06:19,913 --> 01:06:21,648
What is this commotion?

996
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:27,487
What is going on here?

997
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:29,289
What do you mean?

998
01:06:32,226 --> 01:06:33,861
That is Lord Kim Nak Soo.

999
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:35,495
Kim Nak Soo?

1000
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:37,731
The official from the Board of Rites,
Kim Nak Soo,

1001
01:06:37,731 --> 01:06:39,333
Lady So Hye's father.

1002
01:06:52,212 --> 01:06:55,649
Quickly, go to the legal advocate office
and hide with Madam Tae Young.

1003
01:06:55,649 --> 01:06:57,017
Hurry, go!

1004
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:59,353
What? Eternal ginseng?

1005
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,222
I am the Chief of Cheongsu County.

1006
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:05,158
And you made everything fall apart...

1007
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:06,126
Hey.

1008
01:07:07,761 --> 01:07:09,263
Are you the new Special Inspector?

1009
01:07:10,397 --> 01:07:11,598
You look familiar.

1010
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:18,705
Is that so?
But this is my first time seeing you.

1011
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:22,776
I am the Special Inspector of Yuhyangso,
Cheongsu County, Seong Yun Gyeom.

1012
01:07:31,418 --> 01:07:32,519
Man Seok.

1013
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:34,922
Where is Madam Tae Young?

1014
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:37,591
She went out saying
she was investigating.

1015
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:38,659
Where to?

1016
01:07:43,163 --> 01:07:44,631
Didn't I clearly refuse it?

1017
01:07:44,631 --> 01:07:46,500
Do you think this county is a joke?

1018
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,402
You couldn't get through me,

1019
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:51,271
so you lured my wife
to take over Cheongsu County?

1020
01:07:54,708 --> 01:07:55,742
Someone.

1021
01:08:02,182 --> 01:08:03,951
How dare you be like this to me!

1022
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:06,153
How dare you!

1023
01:08:06,153 --> 01:08:08,989
How dare you!

1024
01:08:10,424 --> 01:08:14,027
Calm down. Let us stop.

1025
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:17,464
Stop? Over my dead body.

1026
01:08:22,002 --> 01:08:24,738
Okay, both of you calm down.

1027
01:08:24,738 --> 01:08:26,840
- Let go.
- Over my dead body.

1028
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,108
Let go now!

1029
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:29,510
I'm not going to take it back.

1030
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:10,484
Wait a minute.

1031
01:09:13,887 --> 01:09:15,189
Aren't you Goodeoki?

1032
01:09:29,469 --> 01:09:31,305
It is so good to see you, Goodeoki.

1033
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:54,368
=The Tale of Lady Ok=
