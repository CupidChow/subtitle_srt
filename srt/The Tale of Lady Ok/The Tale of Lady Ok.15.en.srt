00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,138
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,049
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,395
- What is this?
- What is going on?

5
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,635
Where is Song Seo In?

6
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:11,171
Who are you referring to?

7
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,073
Take this woman first.

8
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,409
- We will find Song Seo In.
- Yes, sir.

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,276
Take her away.

10
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,813
- No, please. What should we do?
- Madam.

11
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,081
- No, please.
- Madam.

12
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,916
- Madam.
- Wait a moment.

13
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,852
Madam.

14
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,055
- Madam. No.
- Madam.

15
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,525
Who were those people earlier?

16
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,760
Are they not heading toward our house?

17
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,395
Let's hurry back now.

18
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:36,797
Wait.

19
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,266
Should we really be going?

20
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,269
We... What?

21
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,271
Kkeutdongi.

22
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,840
Madam told me to show you this.

23
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,008
What?

24
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,277
If I send this signal,

25
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:54,581
you must escape with Man Seok
without looking back, Yun Gyeom.

26
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,884
How can I leave without you?

27
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:59,520
That is the only way for me to live
and for everyone to survive.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,721
Is that the only way?

29
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,689
If I were alone, I'd argue my way out.

30
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,092
But if they see Yun Gyeom with me,
it is all over.

31
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:07,127
They will suspect if they run away.

32
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,195
Just say

33
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,131
you regained your memories,

34
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,234
so you left me.

35
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,036
I refuse.

36
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,504
Don't be stubborn.

37
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,973
Hide in the seaside house, okay?

38
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,211
When you see this signal, you run.

39
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,546
Understood?

40
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,715
You run. Let us go, Master.

41
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:31,018
This means running without looking back.

42
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,819
Only then can Madam and we survive.

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,654
Now! Let us go!

44
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,989
- Wait, calm down.
- What?

45
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,157
Explain what happened.

46
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,725
They mentioned Song Seo In

47
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,094
and kept asking about Goodeoki.

48
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:43,931
Did they really mention
the name Song Seo In?

49
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,332
I heard it clearly.

50
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,867
See? They knew everything.

51
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,602
Let us go. Quickly!

52
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,872
Hey, hold on. But...

53
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,546
I said no, not now. Hold on.

54
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:01,782
You promised.

55
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,820
Let go. Wait.

56
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,924
I said not now.

57
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:25,072
Oh my, what will happen to Madam?

58
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:28,342
No matter what, you must go. Go now.

59
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,511
Not now.

60
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:34,114
Kkeutdongi, let us meet again alive.

61
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:34,982
We will go back.

62
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,149
Go now.

63
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,484
Quickly.

64
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,533
- Move aside.
- My goodness.

65
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:57,704
Tell me where they went.

66
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,373
How could I know?

67
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,475
We truly do not know anything.

68
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:05,312
Our Elder Master

69
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:08,549
left early this morning.

70
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:10,150
Really?

71
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,885
He regained his memory and left.

72
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,389
Oh, I see.

73
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,392
Why was the Elder Master in such a hurry
so early in the morning?

74
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,860
- Where is he?
- What?

75
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,930
He went toward Mt. Unbong.

76
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:24,765
- Pursue him.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:25,832
My goodness.

78
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,867
What is this?

79
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:29,636
What should we do?

80
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:32,573
Are you crazy?

81
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:35,509
How could you tell them that? You fool!

82
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,845
Don't worry.
He went in the opposite direction.

83
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,646
Good grief.

84
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,115
Look at our clever Kkeutdongi,
even in moments like this.

85
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,251
Well done.

86
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:48,188
Is it true that Legal Advocate Ok
is a runaway slave?

87
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,858
Then what about the real Ok Tae Young?

88
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:53,560
What on earth is going on?

89
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,795
This must be

90
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:59,600
the daughter of the deceased Magistrate
seeking revenge.

91
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:03,837
But would the Royal Tribunal
act without evidence?

92
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,973
It must have been ordered
by the Minister of Taxation.

93
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,642
With that crazy woman's delusions
and her father's death,

94
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,078
how much she must have begged
the Minister.

95
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,081
But what does it mean
that Special Inspector Seong is fake?

96
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,584
It is obviously a lie.

97
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,853
But he could actually be a fake.

98
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,622
This is too much.

99
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:24,658
Have you already forgotten the help
Special Inspector Seong and his wife

100
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,460
have given to Cheongsu County?

101
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,963
That is right.
Special Inspector Seong cannot be a fake.

102
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:31,632
His younger brother
works in Hongmungwan,

103
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,434
so any misunderstanding will be cleared.

104
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,702
That must be true.

105
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,174
My Lord.

106
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,510
I heard my sister-in-law is being taken
to the Royal Tribunal.

107
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,146
I just heard of it today
from the Royal Tribunal.

108
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,281
What?

109
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,582
A report was filed,

110
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,185
and since we are acquainted,
they excluded us from the investigation.

111
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,854
My sister-in-law cannot
possibly be a runaway slave.

112
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,557
Who on earth submitted
such outrageous information?

113
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,160
It was Bak Jun Gi.

114
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,363
His concubine

115
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,632
claims Legal Advocate Ok is her slave.

116
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:07,968
Could there be
another motive behind this?

117
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,838
Perhaps Bak Jun Gi
got to know about the inspection.

118
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:13,507
That may not be the case,

119
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,577
as there is some evidence
that concerns me.

120
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:19,580
Song Seo In, the eldest son
of former Gyeonggi Provincial governor,

121
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,148
Song Byeong Geun,

122
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,884
is said to have a face identical
to your brother's.

123
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,555
And a slave named Goodeoki,
who lived nearby

124
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,823
and fled ten years ago,

125
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,894
is said to be your sister-in-law.

126
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:38,131
I don't know how much that slave
resembles my sister-in-law,

127
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,766
but that cannot be true.

128
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,470
I personally brought my brother back.

129
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,074
But now they claim
your brother is a fugitive.

130
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:52,079
You will be investigated too.

131
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,497
You were told to head to the seaside,
so why are we going this way?

132
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:13,100
If they look into it, they will know
right away that we bought fishing gear.

133
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:17,037
You are surprisingly sharp sometimes.

134
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,673
Shall we sit down for a moment?

135
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:21,675
My goodness.

136
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,644
Your legs are sore, right?

137
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,749
They are stiff.

138
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,955
Thank you, Man Seok.

139
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:36,390
All of a sudden?

140
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,624
Just

141
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,595
for being by my side
no matter what happens.

142
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:45,365
I am your eternal servant, right?

143
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,568
Servant? Why do you say so?

144
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,970
You are my

145
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,506
friend.

146
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,808
My only friend.

147
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:00,214
Stop being sentimental.

148
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,648
Seriously.

149
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:05,886
Anyway, it has been a while
since I last saw this.

150
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,161
Have you been well?

151
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,128
You are grateful, right?

152
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,833
Here.

153
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,170
Why are you giving it back?
I showed off already for giving you that.

154
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,938
I cannot take this.

155
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,307
Why are you giving it back again?
You cannot do that.

156
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,178
You love the Qing.

157
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:34,681
Take this and go there.

158
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,755
What is this? Why are you doing this?

159
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,425
Let us part ways now.

160
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,793
Huh?

161
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,028
I am turning myself in.

162
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,464
What?

163
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,267
So

164
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,070
you ran in the direction of Hanyang?

165
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,139
You came here to abandon me
and turn yourself in?

166
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,375
Yes.

167
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:05,479
But there is no proof
that Madam is Goodeoki.

168
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,848
And the Young Master will help us again.

169
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,284
Just stick to the plan.

170
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,485
Don't you trust Madam?

171
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,254
If Song Seo In's name was brought up
at the Royal Tribunal,

172
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:16,323
it means there is evidence.

173
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,991
If I run away in this situation,

174
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,060
Madam will be interrogated.

175
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,729
If anything is revealed,
the investigation will drag on.

176
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,432
What if she faces torture because of me
when she is even carrying a child?

177
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,400
That cannot happen.

178
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:30,537
But if you turn yourself in,
you may die.

179
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,009
I'm prepared for that.

180
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:43,183
Then take me.

181
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:47,254
I cannot bear watching you suffer alone.
I will go with you.

182
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,555
What are you saying?

183
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:50,524
At least you have to survive.

184
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,995
How could I live without you?
That would be no fun.

185
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:05,973
They are there.

186
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,010
- Oh.
- Get up.

187
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,512
- You go now.
- No, Master.

188
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:12,513
Run!

189
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:16,016
Crawl and don't look back. Go now.

190
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,184
How could I leave you behind?

191
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,185
Just go.

192
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,686
I cannot. Master.

193
00:10:19,686 --> 00:10:22,089
Are you going to disobey your master?
I said go.

194
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,359
I am Song Seo In. Here I am.

195
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,395
Huh? But you called me your friend...

196
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,098
Over there.

197
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,111
Master!

198
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,386
Master, no!

199
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,787
- Go!
- Master.

200
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,557
Master.

201
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,158
Are you okay? Let me see.

202
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,092
Let me see.

203
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:02,262
Why are you doing this?

204
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,331
You could have just captured us.

205
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,999
You are looking for me, right?

206
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,634
So let him go.

207
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,637
Let me see, Master.

208
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:17,444
He won't get caught, right?

209
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,147
What happens if he does?

210
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,217
He dies.

211
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:26,887
Huh?

212
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:31,525
Elder Master defied the royal orders.

213
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34,595
Royal orders?

214
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,231
If only I had not begged him...

215
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,568
Why? What made him
defy the royal orders?

216
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,104
Tell me.

217
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,873
Tell me!

218
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:49,042
My goodness.

219
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,351
That wench was a slave?

220
00:11:57,651 --> 00:12:01,088
How dare such a lowly wench
pretend to be noble.

221
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,023
What kind of brazen woman
has two husbands?

222
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,125
So that must be
the kind of face you need

223
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,160
to have two men by your side.

224
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:19,873
Change into this.

225
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,443
No visitors allowed.

226
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,235
I went to the prison,
but they would not allow visits.

227
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,370
What is going on, Do Gyeom?

228
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,842
You should tell me everything.

229
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,380
Yun Gyeom you met is not

230
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,517
my real brother.

231
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,222
I brought someone who resembles him.

232
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,926
The two of them knew each other before,

233
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:17,331
and he has been in love with Tae Young
for a long time.

234
00:13:17,998 --> 00:13:21,301
So I begged him to act as my brother.

235
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,571
I pleaded with him.

236
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,907
Then where is your real brother?

237
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,210
Did you not meet him?

238
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,479
No.

239
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,848
I met him.

240
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,050
(Seong Yun Gyeom)

241
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:40,220
I am not Seong Yun Gyeom.

242
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,858
I have no wife, no brother,

243
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,628
and no father.

244
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,697
It was all my doing.

245
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:54,601
Everything was my fault.

246
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,338
I would have done the same.

247
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,373
But Mi Ryeong,

248
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,708
my sister-in-law

249
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,616
might truly be a runaway slave.

250
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:06,273
Excuse me.

251
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,742
He is bleeding so much.

252
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,912
There is a lot of blood here.
Please call a physician here.

253
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,749
Hey, can't you hear me?

254
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:16,984
Hey!

255
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,620
Stop yelling!

256
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,357
Are you okay?

257
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:26,393
Are you fine? Why can't you speak?

258
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:28,228
It's driving me crazy.

259
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,429
- Darn it.
- No.

260
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,899
You cannot die before me.

261
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,667
I am really scared right now.

262
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,702
Why did you...

263
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:39,106
Why did you get caught
when I told you to run away?

264
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:42,142
I got hurt because of you.
Now, it is pointless.

265
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,112
This is killing me.

266
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,147
It hurts that much?

267
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,017
No, I'm just upset about
losing the money bag.

268
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,619
I gave you that money.

269
00:15:52,853 --> 00:15:54,154
I never got it back.

270
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,691
So, I bought that seaside house
for you, okay?

271
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:01,695
Why are you bragging about it now
when we are going to die soon?

272
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:04,598
If we are dying,
should the accounts not be clear?

273
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,570
Then, I am not sorry to you either.

274
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,438
I got hurt trying to save you.

275
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:12,873
I am in so much pain.

276
00:16:13,674 --> 00:16:14,675
I mean,

277
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:19,079
I was deeply moved by your actions.
I never expected that.

278
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,548
That is just who I am.

279
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:26,653
But,

280
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,289
how exactly are we going to die?

281
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,091
Is it going to be a beheading?

282
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,094
Who knows?

283
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:37,798
Since we disobeyed the royal order,
it might be dismemberment.

284
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,801
You know that way of
tying the limbs to oxen

285
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:43,537
and making them pull
until they are torn apart.

286
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:45,739
Me too?

287
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,575
Would they go through such trouble
to kill a mere servant?

288
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,444
I don't know. How could I?

289
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:53,313
Should we hire a legal advocate,
maybe to avoid execution?

290
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,782
But would an advocate help
against defying a royal order?

291
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,751
I don't know.
Just stop talking. My head hurts.

292
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,087
Empty your mind.
Stop thinking about anything.

293
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,127
But

294
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,364
being under the same roof as Tae Young,

295
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,500
I feel somewhat reassured.

296
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:17,871
Madam wouldn't know
we got captured, right?

297
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:20,507
She must not know.

298
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,377
That way, she would lie to survive.

299
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,758
I told you to leave it by the door.
Why do you keep coming inside?

300
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,027
What if the disease spreads to you?

301
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:43,397
I didn't come in because I wanted to.

302
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,433
I am just trying to fulfill my duty.

303
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,371
They are starting quarantines
outside the city.

304
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:56,977
I suppose I must go as well.

305
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,046
You must go and
receive proper treatment.

306
00:18:00,881 --> 00:18:02,850
There aren't even
adequate medicines here.

307
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:06,053
I had no idea my life
would end so abruptly.

308
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,924
What fleeting riches was I chasing
to do something so foolish?

309
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,026
Death, you say?

310
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,096
Do not speak such weakness.

311
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,131
I heard Bak Jun Gi's concubine

312
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,968
claimed Legal Advocate Ok
as her servant.

313
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,771
Legal Advocate Ok ruined her plans
multiple times.

314
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:28,842
She is probably using that as an excuse
to torment her further.

315
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:33,413
You clearly do not know Bak Jun Gi.

316
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:38,385
The reasons behind his actions
are never so petty.

317
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,030
The servant Goodeoki,
in the year of the Monkey, January,

318
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,065
fled with her father.

319
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:55,435
She hid in a tavern in Goesan,
Chungcheong-do.

320
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,473
There, for one year,
she worked as a tavern servant.

321
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,477
In the year of the Chicken, January,
she met Ok Tae Young,

322
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,079
the daughter of Ok Pil Seung,
who was on her way back from Qing.

323
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,417
And a few days later,
when a band of thieves killed everyone,

324
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,986
she decided to assume the identity
of Ok Tae Young.

325
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,856
She came to Cheongsu County

326
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,325
and lived as Ok Tae Young
for nine years.

327
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:23,263
Is your name Goodeoki?

328
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:27,067
What is your name?

329
00:19:30,137 --> 00:19:31,238
Your name is

330
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,373
Ok Tae Young.

331
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,678
I asked you if your name is Goodeoki.

332
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,518
Tae Young's last wish was
for you to be taken in.

333
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:47,087
Should we not honor her wish?

334
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,458
I am

335
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,195
the daughter of Lord Ok Pil Seung,

336
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:58,398
Ok Tae Young.

337
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,170
What evidence do you have

338
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:09,276
to presume I am the servant Goodeoki?

339
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:15,215
Records from the Chungcheong-do office
of the bandit case

340
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,151
and testimony from the officer
who retrieved the bodies state

341
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:21,054
two women were found near the barn
during the attack.

342
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:24,157
The one inside was burned
beyond recognition.

343
00:20:24,525 --> 00:20:28,161
The one outside was alive
but barely breathing.

344
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:32,032
They claim the slave Goodeoki pushed
Ok Tae Young into the barn,

345
00:20:32,032 --> 00:20:34,601
stole her silk clothes and ring,

346
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,637
and pretended to be her.

347
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:43,477
I was unconscious
when I was moved to Cheongsu County.

348
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:47,548
My body was burning with fever,
and I was dying.

349
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:51,051
Also, with bandits taking everything,

350
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,053
how would I have found silk clothes

351
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:56,757
and a ring from a body
burned beyond recognition?

352
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,325
How could I have worn it?

353
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:05,065
Then, how will you prove that
the slave Goodeoki resembles your face

354
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,400
as Kim So Hye remembers?

355
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,502
Why should I have to prove it?

356
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,307
You trusted the delusions
of an unstable woman,

357
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,976
so you should prove it, sir.

358
00:21:19,947 --> 00:21:21,782
In Cheongsu County,
when Ok Tae Young returned from Qing,

359
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,884
there was no one who knew her face
well enough to confirm it.

360
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:26,620
If Goodeoki wanted to impersonate her,

361
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,422
she could have done so easily.

362
00:21:28,422 --> 00:21:31,725
Does that mean the Ok family took in
a runaway slave

363
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,429
as their daughter-in-law
without looking into her?

364
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,101
If I truly were a runaway slave
as you say,

365
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:42,469
how could I have lived
as a lady of a noble family

366
00:21:42,903 --> 00:21:45,072
without getting caught?

367
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:52,913
Do you know Song Seo In?

368
00:21:58,285 --> 00:22:00,454
Officers were looking for someone
by that name at my house.

369
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,189
So you don't know him?

370
00:22:04,358 --> 00:22:05,292
I do.

371
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,998
Are you perhaps referring
to the artist Chon Seung Hwi?

372
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:13,734
Seven years ago,

373
00:22:15,202 --> 00:22:18,238
he came to Cheongsu County
to perform as a storyteller.

374
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,616
Yes. During my performance
in Cheongsu County 7 years ago,

375
00:22:24,617 --> 00:22:25,479
I saw Ok Tae Young.

376
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,080
I fell for her at first sight
and pursued her.

377
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,849
Perhaps I was a sudogeo.

378
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,653
What? Sudogeo?

379
00:22:34,254 --> 00:22:35,155
Yes.

380
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:39,459
"Sudo" as in "coveting someone,"
"geo" as in "take possession."

381
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,061
That is me, a sudogeo.

382
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:48,202
So, you are saying you are not
Seong Yun Gyeom but Song Seo In?

383
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:49,837
Yes.

384
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:53,674
I am Chon Seung Hwi,
director of the Yudam troupe.

385
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:56,276
A celestial storyteller.

386
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:59,046
Whether you are Song Seo In
or Chon Seung Hwi,

387
00:22:59,046 --> 00:23:01,114
the woman you followed around

388
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:03,450
was not Goodeoki but Ok Tae Young?

389
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,354
Goodeoki is indeed the runaway slave
I fell for ten years ago.

390
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,456
But after she ran away

391
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:12,392
and I left home, I never saw her again.

392
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,829
But seven years ago in Cheongsu County,

393
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,498
I saw Ok Tae Young,
who resembled Goodeoki.

394
00:23:19,032 --> 00:23:22,769
I fell for her and pursued her,

395
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:27,174
but she ended up marrying Seong Yun Gyeom,
the Magistrate's son.

396
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:31,478
But Ok Tae Young's husband,
Seong Yun Gyeom

397
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:33,680
looked exactly like me.

398
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,049
It was like looking at a dobulkyungoh.

399
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:39,152
You do not know dobulkyungoh, either?

400
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:42,990
Anyway, it was fascinating.

401
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,259
Truly, it felt like destiny.

402
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:49,796
It was a mere coincidence.

403
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:55,335
Just as I resemble the slave Goodeoki,

404
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,706
Song Seo In resembling my husband
is also just a coincidence.

405
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:05,546
Knowing he resembled Song Seo In,

406
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:07,814
why did you marry Seong Yun Gyeom?

407
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,035
Why would I reject the position

408
00:24:11,036 --> 00:24:12,653
of the Magistrate's
eldest daughter-in-law?

409
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:16,957
Back then, it was a royal order
to marry someone,

410
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:20,394
and I received a marriage proposal
from my father-in-law.

411
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:24,965
Then why did Seong Yun Gyeom leave home?

412
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,603
Perhaps because it was a forced marriage,
we did not get along.

413
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,872
After a big fight, he left home

414
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,975
and did not return for seven years.

415
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:39,046
You had no idea
that the man who returned was not

416
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,815
Seong Yun Gyeom but Song Seo In?

417
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:43,851
My husband is

418
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,254
Seong Yun Gyeom.

419
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:50,123
The man who left seven years ago
was Seong Yun Gyeom.

420
00:24:50,457 --> 00:24:52,459
The man who returned was Song Seo In.

421
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,261
No matter how similar they look,

422
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:58,665
why couldn't I recognize my own husband?

423
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,003
He confessed he was Song Seo In.

424
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:06,273
Yes?

425
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,979
The runaway Song Seo In has been captured
and is being investigated.

426
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,810
Yun Gyeom, are you hurt?

427
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:46,180
Just a minor one. It's fine.

428
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,347
Yun Gyeom.

429
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:51,151
From now on, I will take responsibility.
Don't worry.

430
00:25:53,287 --> 00:25:54,254
Listen carefully.

431
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:57,424
You know nothing about this.

432
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:58,792
What?

433
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:00,761
If you truly think of me
as your brother,

434
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:02,696
follow my lead this time.

435
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,499
Do not forget why you sought me out.

436
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,169
This is all for Tae Young.
Do you understand?

437
00:26:11,338 --> 00:26:12,372
But this is...

438
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:20,881
Is he

439
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:23,917
your elder brother?

440
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,189
Yes, he is.

441
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,158
He is my brother.

442
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,528
This man has confessed
he is not your elder brother.

443
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:36,230
Yun Gyeom.

444
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,764
I am afraid I have to tell you now.

445
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:41,702
I am not your brother. I am Song Seo In.

446
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,437
I am sorry.

447
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:46,273
Yun Gyeom, why are you doing this?

448
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:49,810
When Seong Yun Gyeom left home
seven years ago,

449
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,880
you were young.

450
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,715
How could you recognize him
as your brother?

451
00:26:54,715 --> 00:26:56,750
He is my brother.

452
00:26:57,084 --> 00:26:59,686
No matter what anyone says,
this is my brother.

453
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:03,724
See? I fooled everyone perfectly.

454
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:06,793
- Yun Gyeom!
- I am a professional storyteller.

455
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,162
My job is acting as someone else.

456
00:27:09,162 --> 00:27:11,765
I deceived my wife, my brother,
and the entire household.

457
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,934
I fooled all of Cheongsu County.

458
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:16,770
And this Seong Do Gyeom here

459
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,206
had no idea I resembled Seong Yun Gyeom.

460
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,442
He was desperately searching
for his brother.

461
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:26,013
So when he saw someone identical to him,
he naturally mistook me.

462
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:31,485
He called me his brother,

463
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,288
and the servants addressed me
as Elder Master.

464
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:36,390
It seemed like the perfect opportunity.

465
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,660
The opportunity to live as the husband
of Ok Tae Young, whom I loved.

466
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,431
However, one thing troubled me.

467
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:48,969
There was a royal command
to perform in Qing.

468
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:52,272
The only way to refuse it
was to fake my death.

469
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,444
So, I decided to live as Seong Yun Gyeom

470
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:58,912
and returned after seven years.

471
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,248
But no one doubted me.

472
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,420
When I claimed memory loss,
even Ok Tae Young believed me.

473
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:15,128
So, I forged an identification tag,
and took the state exam.

474
00:28:15,596 --> 00:28:16,797
I did all that.

475
00:28:24,438 --> 00:28:25,439
I

476
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:27,474
am sorry.

477
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,043
I truly am.

478
00:28:33,347 --> 00:28:34,915
But...

479
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:57,004
Yun Gyeom.

480
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,511
How are you doing?

481
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:06,313
I am fine.

482
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,183
Are you hurt?

483
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:10,617
Did you eat anything?

484
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:12,686
What happened to your face?

485
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,256
Why did you confess?

486
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:18,625
So you could be released soon.

487
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,593
Yun Gyeom.

488
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:21,328
I have already defied a royal command.

489
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:25,399
Delaying will only
prolong your suffering.

490
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:33,173
I am no longer your husband.

491
00:29:33,707 --> 00:29:36,710
I am just Chon Seung Hwi.
Do you understand?

492
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:45,085
I am sorry I could not stay with you

493
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,921
until the end.

494
00:29:50,357 --> 00:29:51,191
Yun Gyeom.

495
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:53,894
Yun Gyeom.

496
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,098
Yun Gyeom.

497
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:26,687
Our Elder Master and Man Seok.

498
00:31:27,955 --> 00:31:32,492
Please let them escape safely
without getting caught.

499
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:35,996
And our Madam has done nothing wrong.

500
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:40,801
If anyone deserves punishment,
let it be me.

501
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:42,769
What are you saying?

502
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,406
No, let it be me.
Please punish me instead.

503
00:31:48,842 --> 00:31:51,478
The Chair Lady must have arrived
in Hanyang.

504
00:31:52,446 --> 00:31:55,816
Not knowing the news
is quite frustrating.

505
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:58,585
Don't worry too much.

506
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:06,827
How tiring.

507
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:09,129
My legs hurt.

508
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,566
How did it go?

509
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:15,936
The verdict has not been reached yet,
so it is uncertain.

510
00:32:16,236 --> 00:32:19,373
Legal Advocate Ok's brother,
a governor in Jeju, sent a letter.

511
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:21,508
The Royal Tribunal Officer testified.

512
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:23,844
It seems Legal Advocate Ok
has been cleared of suspicion.

513
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:26,246
Of course, that is only natural.

514
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:29,183
How could Legal Advocate Ok
possibly be a slave?

515
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:32,586
Indeed.

516
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,788
But what about Special Inspector Seong?

517
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:37,224
As for Special Inspector Seong,

518
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,129
it seems he is not Seong Yun Gyeom.

519
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:45,499
What?

520
00:32:45,866 --> 00:32:47,868
Something must have gone wrong,

521
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:51,872
as they say he is someone else
who merely looks identical.

522
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:54,875
My goodness, what shall we do?

523
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:56,610
Then

524
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:01,648
whose name
will Legal Advocate Ok's child take?

525
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:04,084
What?

526
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:07,054
I mean, she is pregnant.

527
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:18,665
Father, please stay well.

528
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:23,003
Stop crying. Someone might think
he has already passed away.

529
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:34,748
If I return alive, will you welcome me?

530
00:33:36,216 --> 00:33:37,818
I will consider it when you return.

531
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:41,655
Thank you for coming to see me.

532
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:44,825
Here is the Pueraria root medicine
for your knee pain.

533
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:49,329
When I am close to death,
what use is my knee?

534
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:51,532
Please leave.

535
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:00,674
They say Goodeoki will be released.

536
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:02,743
They claim I spoke nonsense
due to delusions.

537
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:05,279
Why are you not presenting
the evidence right away?

538
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:08,815
Why isn't she being dragged back here
but being used to your advantage?

539
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,385
- What?
- Why?

540
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,953
Did you think I wouldn't notice

541
00:34:12,953 --> 00:34:15,455
when you were using my home
as a secret storage?

542
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:22,729
After causing chaos in the Royal Tribunal
with the fake couple

543
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:25,966
and securing your promotion,
is your ambition not satisfied?

544
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,037
Stop dragging this on
and bring her in already.

545
00:34:39,713 --> 00:34:40,647
Didn't I tell you

546
00:34:42,716 --> 00:34:46,086
to wait for the right time?

547
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:48,555
If you

548
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,059
speak recklessly, I won't spare you.

549
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:12,980
That wretched Goodeoki,
I will bring her myself.

550
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:20,320
After the investigation is complete,
they bring new evidence?

551
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:23,056
What is the meaning of this now?

552
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,425
Apologies for arriving so late.

553
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,094
Goodness.

554
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:57,891
Man Seok, do you think Tae Young left

555
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:00,661
or will she face judgment with us?

556
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:03,197
Maybe she will face judgment with us.

557
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:06,333
Anyway, Cheongsu County
must be in chaos now.

558
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,267
Exactly.

559
00:36:07,267 --> 00:36:08,836
Once Chief Cha hears about you,

560
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:13,740
he will wail and cry in despair.

561
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,847
We planned to build an aloe village

562
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,548
and hold feasts together.

563
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:24,184
Since the foundation is already laid

564
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:27,421
and everything is prepared,
he will be able to handle it himself.

565
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,126
By the way, is that even tasty?
Can you actually eat that?

566
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:36,063
Why not? They say when you die
with a full stomach, you look radiant.

567
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,564
Why does radiance matter
if you are dead?

568
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:38,999
Are you trying
to charm a ghost bride or what?

569
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,836
Besides, they don't execute
people right away.

570
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:46,373
They will wait until autumn passes
to decide.

571
00:36:46,373 --> 00:36:47,407
Why?

572
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,610
Do they really consider the weather
before executions?

573
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,211
Of course.

574
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:53,313
If they recklessly kill people,
the heavens get angry,

575
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:55,682
and a bad harvest could ruin
the entire year.

576
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:59,052
So they wait until
after the harvest to execute?

577
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:02,789
Exactly. Some people live months
or even years

578
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:04,625
after receiving their sentence.

579
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:05,792
Not bad.

580
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:07,528
They feed you regularly,

581
00:37:07,528 --> 00:37:09,496
and you can sleep as much as you want
with nothing to do.

582
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,033
Chatting away in jail like this
might even be fun.

583
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:15,269
Some fun that is.

584
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,345
At the next investigation,

585
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,148
I will say I threatened you.

586
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,016
So just go with it.

587
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:31,752
Will they let me out, then?

588
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:32,986
Maybe they will.

589
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,256
This food is disgusting.

590
00:37:39,193 --> 00:37:41,395
I miss the meals Mak Sim used to make.

591
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,498
If I manage to get out alive,

592
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:48,001
I will bring you meals
in a three-tier lunchbox.

593
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:49,870
Forget it, you fool.

594
00:37:50,938 --> 00:37:52,573
If you make it out alive,

595
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:56,009
ensure to take good care of your Madam.

596
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:29,009
Madam.

597
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,144
You are still here.

598
00:38:33,447 --> 00:38:34,648
Are you okay?

599
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:41,889
Why have they summoned us here?

600
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:45,192
It seems he will deliver judgment.

601
00:38:45,792 --> 00:38:48,896
It is fine. I am prepared.

602
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:51,765
They won't kill us right away, right?

603
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,768
I am sorry, Man Seok.
This is all my fault.

604
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:56,436
No, it is fine.

605
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:00,340
Madam, stay strong.

606
00:39:00,908 --> 00:39:02,576
You have to make it out alive.

607
00:39:56,597 --> 00:39:57,731
Ok Tae Young

608
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:01,535
claims she didn't know
Song Seo In posed as Seong Yun Gyeom.

609
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:03,704
Song Seo In

610
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:07,307
confesses to impersonating
Seong Yun Gyeom without her knowing.

611
00:40:08,041 --> 00:40:08,942
Is this correct?

612
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:15,616
Answer me. Is this correct?

613
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:19,319
- It is correct.
- It is correct.

614
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:23,023
Then why did you both meet this past May

615
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:25,392
in Ikcheon?

616
00:40:27,661 --> 00:40:29,029
Ikcheon...

617
00:40:31,565 --> 00:40:34,968
That was a legal advocacy matter.

618
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:38,272
Song Seo In, under the name
Chon Seung Hwi, was wrongfully jailed

619
00:40:38,272 --> 00:40:40,140
after his works were stolen.

620
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,542
I was hired to advocate.

621
00:40:44,077 --> 00:40:45,979
Who hired you for the case?

622
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:50,350
- Pardon?
- Song Seo In was jailed.

623
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,920
Who hired you for the case? Speak.

624
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:56,590
Well...

625
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:00,194
It was...

626
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:09,169
Seize Song Seo In
and his servant Soeddung immediately.

627
00:41:10,804 --> 00:41:11,672
My Lord.

628
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:17,678
Wait.

629
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:26,053
My Lord, why are you doing this?

630
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:29,756
Last May in Ikcheon,
Ok Tae Young met them

631
00:41:29,756 --> 00:41:32,593
and conspired to murder
her runaway husband, Seong Yun Gyeom.

632
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,862
- What?
- Interrogate them.

633
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:36,363
Wait.

634
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:42,736
Wait.

635
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:51,445
My Lord.

636
00:41:55,315 --> 00:41:57,451
Soeddung, servant of Song Seo In

637
00:41:58,051 --> 00:41:59,887
hired Ok Tae Young for legal advocacy

638
00:41:59,887 --> 00:42:02,322
and summoned her to Ikcheon.

639
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,226
It was also confirmed that while
Song Seo In posed as Seong Yun Gyeom,

640
00:42:06,226 --> 00:42:07,895
Soeddung lived with him
in Cheongsu County.

641
00:42:08,595 --> 00:42:10,063
Therefore, Ok Tae Young

642
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:12,666
knew her returning husband
was not Seong Yun Gyeom.

643
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:16,136
It is clear you knew he was Song Seo In.

644
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:21,975
How dare you deceive the Royal Tribunal
and speak falsehoods.

645
00:42:27,748 --> 00:42:28,882
Wait, hold on.

646
00:42:35,789 --> 00:42:38,025
Why do you not tell the truth at once?

647
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:40,194
I don't know anything.

648
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:42,162
I truly know nothing.

649
00:42:42,162 --> 00:42:44,298
Collusion? That is absurd.

650
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,668
Will you persist in lying?

651
00:42:47,668 --> 00:42:50,737
Lord, how can you accuse me
without evidence?

652
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:14,328
Speak the truth about what you know!

653
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:15,495
Yes.

654
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:18,899
These people are clearly acquainted.

655
00:43:18,899 --> 00:43:22,536
Not only in Ikcheon but long before,
they have been closely connected.

656
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:27,407
It says so in the novel by Song Seo In,
"The Investigator and the Maiden."

657
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:28,308
You!

658
00:43:28,308 --> 00:43:30,511
Shut your darn mouth!

659
00:43:30,511 --> 00:43:33,514
That man is no mere servant.

660
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:36,550
He is the steward who managed
the Yudam troupe.

661
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,553
He hired her as a legal advocate
and even lived with them.

662
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,754
How can she claim ignorance?

663
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:44,558
Do you still insist you do not know him?

664
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:56,904
My Lord!

665
00:43:57,404 --> 00:43:58,972
Soeddung is innocent.

666
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,341
He only followed my orders.

667
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:03,777
They are clearly guilty of adultery.

668
00:44:03,777 --> 00:44:04,912
Shut up!

669
00:44:04,912 --> 00:44:07,648
Song Seo In and Ok Tae Young
stayed together in Ikcheon

670
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:09,183
sharing the same room.

671
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:12,519
It was because the ship was damaged,
and I couldn't leave, My Lord.

672
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:17,024
As for Seol Rang,
he was accused of theft.

673
00:44:17,024 --> 00:44:18,425
So he is slandering us.

674
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:24,231
Man Seok.

675
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,567
Man Seok!

676
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:33,507
Man Seok.

677
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:34,942
My Lord, please.

678
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:36,877
How can knowing each other prove

679
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:39,580
a plot to murder Seong Yun Gyeom?

680
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:43,050
How could you deceive me so?

681
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,284
Please believe me.

682
00:44:45,452 --> 00:44:48,021
I didn't kill my husband.

683
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,891
Guards.

684
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:53,560
Bind Ok Tae Young as well.

685
00:44:54,528 --> 00:44:55,462
You cannot do this.

686
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:57,631
My Lord, you cannot.

687
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:00,501
How can you torture a pregnant woman?

688
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:01,502
My Lord.

689
00:45:02,402 --> 00:45:03,704
It is all my fault.

690
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:06,974
Everything was caused by me alone.

691
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,277
Please punish me instead, My Lord.

692
00:45:10,644 --> 00:45:12,079
You must not, Do Gyeom.

693
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:15,415
It is all because of me.

694
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,785
Living as a widow was unbearable.

695
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:22,022
So I asked him to act as my husband.

696
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,825
I never killed my husband.

697
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:28,262
Please, I beg you to believe me.

698
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:31,265
You have already lied to me.

699
00:45:33,066 --> 00:45:35,869
Every of your word has lost
credibility here.

700
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,471
My Lord!

701
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:43,544
My Lord! I will explain everything.

702
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:44,711
It was me, My Lord.

703
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:46,213
I killed him!

704
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:57,191
When Deputy Tribunal Officer Seong
came looking for Seong Yun Gyeom,

705
00:45:57,991 --> 00:46:02,763
I was enraged at him
for abandoning his wife for seven years.

706
00:46:02,763 --> 00:46:04,798
When I met him in Qing,

707
00:46:04,798 --> 00:46:06,667
I urged him to return to his wife,

708
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,402
but he refused.

709
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:11,071
So I killed him with my own hands.

710
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:15,042
No, that is not true.

711
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:16,043
I...

712
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,546
I was deeply in love with her.

713
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:24,484
I wanted to live as her husband,
at least for a single day.

714
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:27,087
To hear her call me her husband once,

715
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:29,456
I deceived everyone. It was all me.

716
00:46:32,693 --> 00:46:34,428
Yun Gyeom.

717
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:35,429
I am sorry.

718
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:37,631
It was all my selfishness.

719
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:39,366
So,

720
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:45,839
I humbly ask you to release
this servant and this woman.

721
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,275
I beg you, My Lord.

722
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,485
Song Seo In has confessed to murder.

723
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:01,622
Detain him until the final verdict.

724
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:03,657
As for Ok Tae Young,

725
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,060
release her.

726
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:13,033
Yun Gyeom.

727
00:47:15,536 --> 00:47:16,503
My Lord!

728
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,110
Yun Gyeom!

729
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:38,926
What is your name?

730
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,133
Are you

731
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,703
the eldest daughter of Ok Pil Seung,

732
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:53,273
who served as an envoy to Qing,

733
00:47:57,678 --> 00:47:58,612
or

734
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,516
are you Kim Nak Soo's servant, Goodeoki?

735
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,998
I am asking you, what is your name?

736
00:48:24,471 --> 00:48:25,539
My name is...

737
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:37,384
Bring him here.

738
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:42,916
Father.

739
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,018
No.

740
00:49:46,153 --> 00:49:47,287
She is not my daughter.

741
00:49:47,788 --> 00:49:48,922
She is not my daughter.

742
00:49:48,922 --> 00:49:50,224
She is not my daughter.

743
00:49:58,765 --> 00:49:59,967
Father.

744
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:02,703
No!

745
00:50:02,703 --> 00:50:05,105
- No!
- No!

746
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:05,973
No!

747
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,309
Father!

748
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:10,744
Father!

749
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:16,550
Goodeoki!

750
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:20,187
Goodeoki!

751
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,891
Open your eyes, Goodeoki.

752
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:27,661
Someone save my Goodeoki.

753
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:29,630
Goodeoki.

754
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,064
Goodeoki.

755
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,601
Open your eyes.

756
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:37,137
Goodeoki.

757
00:50:37,437 --> 00:50:39,973
Your father is here, so open your eyes.

758
00:50:40,841 --> 00:50:43,510
Someone save my Goodeoki.

759
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:47,114
Goodeoki.

760
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:51,018
Open your eyes.

761
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,921
Goodeoki.

762
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:31,491
Man Seok.

763
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,401
Man Seok.

764
00:51:43,604 --> 00:51:44,538
Man Seok.

765
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:48,575
Wake up, Man Seok.

766
00:51:49,676 --> 00:51:50,544
Man Seok.

767
00:52:03,423 --> 00:52:06,093
Man Seok.

768
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,297
That wretched Dung So Hye

769
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,067
had Goodeoki's father

770
00:52:16,403 --> 00:52:18,472
with her all along.

771
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:22,476
Seriously.

772
00:52:24,945 --> 00:52:26,513
You confessed to murder

773
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,417
all for nothing.

774
00:52:33,086 --> 00:52:34,254
Even Madam

775
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,324
got caught.

776
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:40,928
Still,

777
00:52:42,629 --> 00:52:44,164
she got to see

778
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:47,668
her father again, at least.

779
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:55,309
We were going to live
by the seaside with her father.

780
00:52:58,111 --> 00:52:59,279
Now, we cannot.

781
00:53:04,251 --> 00:53:05,152
Right.

782
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:09,056
Since I bought you the house,

783
00:53:11,158 --> 00:53:12,492
if you had a son,

784
00:53:14,595 --> 00:53:15,629
I was going to ask you

785
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:19,333
to name him Man Seok

786
00:53:21,001 --> 00:53:22,202
after me.

787
00:53:24,438 --> 00:53:25,372
Are you crazy?

788
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:28,675
Then I will have a daughter.

789
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,617
We are really
just talking nonsense, right?

790
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,362
Man Seok.

791
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:53,600
Man Seok.

792
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:57,838
Man Seok.

793
00:54:15,956 --> 00:54:16,890
Man Seok.

794
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:25,832
Man Seok.

795
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:27,935
Man Seok.

796
00:54:29,303 --> 00:54:30,304
Man Seok.

797
00:54:31,672 --> 00:54:34,741
Man Seok.

798
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:36,944
Man Seok.

799
00:54:43,483 --> 00:54:46,587
Man Seok, answer me.

800
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:54,528
Man Seok.

801
00:54:55,195 --> 00:54:59,032
Man Seok, I am sorry.

802
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,344
After reviewing evidence and testimonies,
Song Seo In is found guilty

803
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:14,882
of killing Seong Yun Gyeom,
impersonating his identity,

804
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:19,086
and violating royal orders
by faking his death.

805
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,154
He is sentenced to execution.

806
00:55:30,264 --> 00:55:34,034
The servant Goodeoki is clearly guilty
of harming her master and fleeing.

807
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:37,804
And she is guilty of impersonating
the noble Ok Tae Young.

808
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:40,674
She deserves execution.

809
00:55:41,975 --> 00:55:42,809
However,

810
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:47,481
considering her service
as a legal advocate aiding many people,

811
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:51,785
she shall be returned
to her owner, Kim So Hye.

812
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,547
Where is my father?

813
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:55,949
Do you think I will let you see him?

814
00:56:56,316 --> 00:56:58,252
Because of you, my father is dead.

815
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:03,290
Right!

816
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:06,260
I heard you are pregnant.

817
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,198
Then that child is mine as well, right?

818
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:17,471
Welcome home, Goodeoki.

819
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:32,085
Do you resent me?

820
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,926
Despite tarnishing
the Royal Tribunal's authority,

821
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:44,097
I am truly grateful
you spared my sister-in-law, My Lord.

822
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:48,302
Saving Legal Advocate Ok

823
00:57:48,302 --> 00:57:50,103
despite opposition

824
00:57:51,338 --> 00:57:52,973
was the King's decision.

825
00:57:54,374 --> 00:57:57,711
If you were unaware she was a slave,

826
00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:01,782
you must have been as shocked as I was.

827
00:58:07,955 --> 00:58:09,289
I apologize,

828
00:58:10,891 --> 00:58:15,128
but she is like a mother to me,
regardless of status.

829
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:20,200
She took me in when I had nowhere to go,

830
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:24,404
and rebuilt a broken family.

831
00:58:31,311 --> 00:58:32,846
Though guilty of crimes,

832
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:35,249
I cannot

833
00:58:37,317 --> 00:58:39,286
blame her.

834
00:59:19,526 --> 00:59:20,661
Geumbok.

835
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:23,630
They asked me to move these herbs
to the storage.

836
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:24,932
I just stepped in briefly.

837
00:59:26,233 --> 00:59:27,334
What about my father?

838
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:29,303
He is safe in another shed.

839
00:59:29,303 --> 00:59:31,438
Don't worry about him.

840
00:59:32,139 --> 00:59:33,173
Where...

841
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,776
Where was he hiding all this time?

842
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,378
He said he lived in a secluded temple.

843
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:41,815
He ate well,
and even recovered from his illness.

844
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,018
He has been here for a while,

845
00:59:45,352 --> 00:59:48,155
but they locked him in another house,
afraid we might find out.

846
00:59:48,722 --> 00:59:50,891
- Is that so?
- Don't worry too much.

847
00:59:50,891 --> 00:59:52,993
They won't dare harm him now.

848
00:59:54,394 --> 00:59:56,964
Deputy Tribunal Officer's family
frequently sends people

849
00:59:56,964 --> 00:59:59,066
to patrol outside the house.

850
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:04,071
It has the Minister of Taxation on edge.

851
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:06,640
Why?

852
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,910
Is it not obvious?
This is Bak Jun Gi's secret storage.

853
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:12,546
The herbs he stores here
are made into pills

854
01:00:12,546 --> 01:00:15,115
in the back warehouse and sold.

855
01:00:16,884 --> 01:00:20,787
But what is that herb?
It smells so fishy.

856
01:00:22,623 --> 01:00:24,691
So that is why they needed aloe.

857
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:31,198
Why did you go to the Royal Tribunal
without permission?

858
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:33,867
I was frustrated by all the delays!

859
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:35,669
I told you there was a reason for this!

860
01:00:35,669 --> 01:00:37,871
What reason?
You have the diseased village.

861
01:00:37,871 --> 01:00:39,773
What more are you hiding?

862
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:43,143
If you act without my approval again,

863
01:00:43,977 --> 01:00:45,345
you will end up like your father.

864
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,267
Yun Gyeom.

865
01:01:09,203 --> 01:01:12,840
So, did you recover Man Seok's body?

866
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:18,145
Yes, we retrieved it
outside the city gates.

867
01:01:24,284 --> 01:01:25,219
Thank you.

868
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,923
Bury him in a sunny spot
in Cheongsu County.

869
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:32,259
That guy

870
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,930
used to sing about wanting
to be buried in Cheongsu County.

871
01:01:38,966 --> 01:01:42,936
And prepare a spot next to him for me.

872
01:01:43,837 --> 01:01:46,139
I will need to join him
and keep him company.

873
01:01:46,139 --> 01:01:48,175
When I return from Cheongsu County,

874
01:01:48,175 --> 01:01:49,743
I will find a solution no matter what.

875
01:01:49,743 --> 01:01:53,480
You cannot bear this unjust
accusation of murder.

876
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,515
What will you do?

877
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:58,151
Will you search for your brother again?

878
01:01:58,151 --> 01:02:00,621
- Yes, if I must.
- It will be futile.

879
01:02:00,621 --> 01:02:03,690
I am already a traitor to the king.

880
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:06,593
Stop worrying about me,

881
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:07,995
and instead,

882
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:11,498
protect your sister-in-law.

883
01:02:12,633 --> 01:02:15,435
This is my request to you.

884
01:02:23,443 --> 01:02:24,411
Take this.

885
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:28,415
Deliver this to her.

886
01:02:34,655 --> 01:02:37,858
Madam So Hye insisted
you must not be entering the house.

887
01:02:42,963 --> 01:02:44,131
Why?

888
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:47,067
Are you here to beg
for Goodeoki to be sold as well?

889
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:52,105
You are not the kind of person
to show such generosity.

890
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:54,775
Don't regret it after she dies.

891
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:56,376
Watch your words.

892
01:02:59,746 --> 01:03:01,248
Let me meet her once,

893
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:04,051
and I will keep this a secret.

894
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:06,420
What secret?

895
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:09,122
That a concubine dared to attend
the noblewomen's gatherings

896
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:10,924
only to be turned away,

897
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:14,294
and that you guard
Bak Jun Gi's storage like a dog.

898
01:03:15,762 --> 01:03:18,432
Must rumors of you being beaten
also spread?

899
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:24,571
Fine, let us do this.

900
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:28,075
It will be amusing to show you
her pitiful state.

901
01:03:28,075 --> 01:03:29,343
Why not?

902
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:46,527
What brings you here?

903
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,469
Your husband asked me
to deliver this to you.

904
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:02,042
Surely...

905
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:05,312
Not yet.

906
01:04:09,783 --> 01:04:11,285
Deputy Tribunal Officer Seong
and his wife

907
01:04:11,985 --> 01:04:14,354
have gone to Cheongsu County
for the servant's funeral.

908
01:04:19,726 --> 01:04:21,595
Will you just mourn like this?

909
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:26,366
What more can I possibly do?

910
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:30,470
I plan to hire someone

911
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:33,373
to help you escape.

912
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:35,676
Are you saying

913
01:04:37,511 --> 01:04:39,980
I have to become a runaway slave again?

914
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,316
Will you follow your husband to death?

915
01:04:42,316 --> 01:04:43,317
Or

916
01:04:44,017 --> 01:04:46,286
will you let your child
live as a servant?

917
01:04:47,554 --> 01:04:50,557
Is that how you repay
those who sacrificed for you?

918
01:04:54,795 --> 01:04:58,298
Without the name Ok Tae Young,

919
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,235
can you do nothing?

920
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:08,242
Deok Hun's father, upon isolation,
said something.

921
01:05:08,976 --> 01:05:11,712
The fact that amidst
the chaos of disease,

922
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:15,816
he made the infamous fraudulent couple
the talk of town

923
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:17,985
reveals that Bak Jun Gi

924
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:21,021
is hiding something.

925
01:05:22,022 --> 01:05:23,056
What?

926
01:05:23,056 --> 01:05:25,225
He diverted
the Royal Tribunal's attention

927
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:27,828
just as he misled
the Magistrate Seong seven years ago.

928
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,433
Just as he misled Father as well?

929
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:38,005
You cannot end up exploited
like Magistrate Seong.

930
01:05:38,005 --> 01:05:39,706
You must escape here, somehow.

931
01:05:42,676 --> 01:05:47,047
Do you know the symptoms
of this strange disease?

932
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:08,202
You pretended to be noble,
but look at you now.

933
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:09,970
What was it?

934
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:12,306
"This is our first meeting."

935
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,376
"I am the eldest daughter-in-law
of the Cheongsu County's Seong family."

936
01:06:16,376 --> 01:06:18,078
"My name is Ok Tae Young."

937
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:20,247
Ridiculous.

938
01:06:21,148 --> 01:06:23,250
How did you find out that Seo In and I

939
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:25,519
were pretending to be a married couple?

940
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:28,322
I followed you
when I heard you came to Hanyang

941
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:29,489
to sell aloe.

942
01:06:33,594 --> 01:06:34,828
This here is

943
01:06:35,762 --> 01:06:37,130
my husband.

944
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:39,800
I wanted to show him to you and boast.

945
01:06:40,868 --> 01:06:43,670
I saw you with Seo In
at your mother's grave.

946
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,506
You shameless wench.

947
01:06:51,645 --> 01:06:52,579
How does it feel?

948
01:06:54,214 --> 01:06:56,216
A servant pretending to be noble,

949
01:06:56,216 --> 01:06:59,152
giving, helping, and showing mercy,
did you enjoy it?

950
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:01,688
Of course, I did.

951
01:07:03,257 --> 01:07:05,058
I did many good things.

952
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:06,960
That was all pretense.

953
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,595
You are just a hypocrite.

954
01:07:08,595 --> 01:07:09,897
What is wrong with that?

955
01:07:11,598 --> 01:07:13,767
When the privileged show hypocrisy,

956
01:07:14,768 --> 01:07:17,204
at least, it allows the underprivileged
to breathe for a while.

957
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:19,206
Do you think that makes you
a great person?

958
01:07:19,873 --> 01:07:21,041
A great person?

959
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:23,277
No.

960
01:07:24,411 --> 01:07:26,647
I just wanted to be a human.

961
01:07:28,315 --> 01:07:29,550
But I should be better

962
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:33,487
than those who choose not to act
as a human when they can.

963
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:35,756
I am honest about my feelings.

964
01:07:35,756 --> 01:07:37,191
All nobles are like that.

965
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:39,760
There are many nobles

966
01:07:41,461 --> 01:07:43,530
of great virtue in the world.

967
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:47,801
My grandmother was noble,
and so was my father-in-law.

968
01:07:48,302 --> 01:07:50,804
Who is your grandmother?
Who is your father-in-law?

969
01:07:50,804 --> 01:07:52,673
You are not Ok Tae Young.

970
01:07:52,973 --> 01:07:54,808
You are just a fake.

971
01:07:54,808 --> 01:07:56,877
Yes, I am a fake.

972
01:07:56,877 --> 01:07:57,978
That is true.

973
01:07:58,545 --> 01:08:00,848
Thanks to you,
it was easy to live as a fake.

974
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:03,283
I learned so much in your place.

975
01:08:04,051 --> 01:08:05,552
For that, I am grateful.

976
01:08:11,291 --> 01:08:12,726
What a shame for you.

977
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,896
Now you are just a lowly maggot again.

978
01:08:17,397 --> 01:08:18,966
From now on,

979
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:22,002
until the day you die, I am your master.

980
01:08:22,002 --> 01:08:23,003
My master

981
01:08:24,805 --> 01:08:26,406
is not you.

982
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:29,376
What, are you going to say
you are your own master?

983
01:08:29,376 --> 01:08:30,978
If I have a master,

984
01:08:32,212 --> 01:08:34,648
it is Lady Tae Young,
who gave me a name,

985
01:08:36,049 --> 01:08:37,384
a dream, and her life.

986
01:08:37,384 --> 01:08:39,186
Do you want to die that badly?

987
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:42,556
- Shall I cripple your leg?
- Penal Code, Article 337,

988
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:45,859
assaulting or killing a servant
earns 100 lashes.

989
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,895
Could you survive that?

990
01:08:51,532 --> 01:08:52,866
Lord Kim Nak Soo

991
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:56,570
could not even withstand 30.

992
01:09:01,141 --> 01:09:02,509
How dare you say that

993
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:05,579
after getting my father killed!

994
01:09:05,579 --> 01:09:07,047
The one who caused his death

995
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,084
was none other

996
01:09:12,486 --> 01:09:13,887
than your husband, Lord Bak Jun Gi.

997
01:09:16,089 --> 01:09:16,924
What?

998
01:09:16,924 --> 01:09:20,260
He chose the most disposable person
to take the fall.

999
01:09:20,894 --> 01:09:22,930
Someone to cut loose
when things go wrong.

1000
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:27,034
- Shut up!
- You were just a hostage.

1001
01:09:27,034 --> 01:09:28,969
When Kim Nak Soo was captured,

1002
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:31,672
you were held as leverage so he couldn't
reveal Bak Jun Gi was behind all of it.

1003
01:09:39,746 --> 01:09:41,782
No matter how much you talk,

1004
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,952
you are still the woman
who killed her husband.

1005
01:09:45,652 --> 01:09:47,287
Because of someone like you,

1006
01:09:47,754 --> 01:09:49,690
Master Seo In will face execution!

1007
01:09:55,095 --> 01:09:56,330
Don't worry.

1008
01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:59,733
I will join him in death soon.

1009
01:10:05,572 --> 01:10:07,241
I am infected with a strange disease.

1010
01:10:10,143 --> 01:10:11,111
Darn it.

1011
01:11:02,396 --> 01:11:04,097
Please spare me.

1012
01:11:04,097 --> 01:11:05,666
Wait, just a moment.

1013
01:11:37,231 --> 01:11:38,232
Thank you.

1014
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:31,411
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1015
01:13:32,679 --> 01:13:36,250
I now begin to write my final story.

1016
01:13:37,384 --> 01:13:38,585
This is not a tale

1017
01:13:38,986 --> 01:13:41,488
of a sorrowful woman
mourning her husband.

1018
01:13:42,956 --> 01:13:46,593
This is a tale of a noble legal advocate

1019
01:13:47,027 --> 01:13:50,564
who was born a servant
but resilient like aloe

1020
01:13:50,564 --> 01:13:53,567
who stayed strong and helped others.

1021
01:13:55,469 --> 01:13:57,437
I trust this tale's end

1022
01:13:57,437 --> 01:13:59,940
will be filled
with how you will do, my love.

1023
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:01,875
From your husband.
