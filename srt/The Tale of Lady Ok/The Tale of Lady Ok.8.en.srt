1
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,645
Brother.

2
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,641
The body has decomposed so much…

3
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,561
that I cannot identify his face.

4
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,104
Was there an identification tag?

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,150
There was not an identification tag,

6
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,569
but there was an item with his name on it.

7
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,241
Here it is.

8
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,952
SEONG YUN-GYEOM

9
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,703
Considering all the circumstances,

10
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,873
it is highly likely that
he is Seong Yun-gyeom of your family,

11
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,835
so collect the body
and hold the funeral for him.

12
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,297
Can you turn his body
and show me his shoulder?

13
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,316
This corpse is not my husband.

14
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,488
How can that be?

15
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,323
Why do you think so?

16
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,493
My husband has a scar on his shoulder.

17
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:45,039
If it was a scar from seven years ago,
it would have healed by now.

18
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:49,085
It is a scar that would not disappear
unless it was carved out.

19
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,797
Moreover, this body is
a different height than him.

20
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,053
This hand does not look like
a skilled swordsman's hand either.

21
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:03,016
How can you be so sure that
he is not Seong Yun-gyeom by those things?

22
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,853
You sound

23
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,106
as though this corpse
has to be my husband.

24
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,858
Look.

25
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,403
There's something
that belongs to him there.

26
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:18,114
It is a common handkerchief
with his name embroidered on it.

27
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,076
It is as easy
as hiding an identification tag.

28
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,996
Could it be

29
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:29,250
because you fear your future as a widow

30
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,339
that you want to deny the fact
that this is your husband?

31
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,090
Listen, Magistrate!

32
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,426
Are you saying that

33
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,304
I am also pretending
not to recognize my brother's body?

34
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,264
No, that is not what I mean.

35
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,809
If you are not trying to get rid of
a decayed corpse that is unrecognizable,

36
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,937
you must reinvestigate it.

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,731
This corpse is not my husband.

38
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,693
And if you insult my sister-in-law
and my family once more,

39
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,279
I will not let you get away with it.
Remember that.

40
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,790
There comes Kkeut-dong. Kkeut-dong!

41
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,333
Come!

42
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,126
- What is that?
- What does he mean?

43
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,005
His height and everything else
is different from him.

44
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,173
It is not him.

45
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,634
My gosh, I knew it.

46
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,636
- It is not him.
- Go back to work.

47
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,680
Good grief.

48
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,847
By the way,

49
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,601
I heard an effigy doll was found
in the newlyweds' room this morning.

50
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,187
- What are you talking about?
- What doll?

51
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,356
What? I do not know either.

52
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,109
I heard it
from Lord Sin's servant, Ul-geum.

53
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,444
CHEONGSU COUNTY

54
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,551
Students who will take the military exam
may visit the training center.

55
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,052
Students that wish to take the subject

56
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,264
for prospective civil officials may visit
the legal advocate's office to prepare--

57
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:10,601
Lady Kim, I do not think they should
visit the legal advocate's office.

58
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,854
Can the literary exam students
go somewhere else?

59
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,063
Why is that?

60
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,525
Well, there have been some rumors.

61
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,068
What rumors this time?

62
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,989
The corpse at the government office
is not Young Master Seong's brother.

63
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,783
Of course it is.
She is insisting that it is not.

64
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,994
It is not just that rumor.

65
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,706
I heard she put an effigy doll
in the newlyweds' room!

66
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,999
What?

67
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,167
How horrible.

68
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,336
She is trying to make her childless
out of jealousy.

69
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,089
What a strange woman.

70
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,758
Is that not awful?

71
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,807
A rumor is going around
that a doll was in their room?

72
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,477
Almost everyone in Cheongsu County
seems to know about it.

73
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,354
We do not even know about it,
so how did the villagers know?

74
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,691
Only the three of us were in that room.

75
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,946
Well, there is one thing
I did not tell you.

76
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,909
Actually, I saw someone
eavesdropping on the two of you

77
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,911
while you were talking in the study.

78
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,163
Who is there?

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,377
- Really?
- Keep it down.

80
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,338
Why did you not tell us sooner?

81
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,299
I thought someone was
just passing by then.

82
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:26,928
Does this mean that the person
who was eavesdropping spread the rumor?

83
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,805
That is truly odd.

84
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,349
None of us roam about running our mouths.

85
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,978
There were many visitors
at the marriage ceremony.

86
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:40,233
Yes, we will not suspect
anyone in our household.

87
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,734
Just keep them quiet.

88
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,111
- Yes, my lady.
- Yes, my lady.

89
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,744
Inspector, Legal Advocate Lady Ok is here.

90
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:53,621
Let her in.

91
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,211
It has been such a long time.

92
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,422
Is it the first time
since I transferred away?

93
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,632
Yes.

94
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,342
I heard you were dispatched here,

95
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,929
so I came by to say hello
and discuss a matter with you.

96
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,305
What is it about?

97
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,891
Someone is

98
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,438
trying to turn me into a widow.

99
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,068
Who could it be?

100
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:29,365
During a regular meeting at Yuhyangso,

101
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,826
where I, Cha Chun-sik, am the chief,

102
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:36,122
the matter of your sister-in-law's action
has been discussed as she has been

103
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,166
harming the fine custom
of Cheongsu County.

104
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:39,834
Pardon?

105
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,587
Your sister-in-law has been
meeting other men

106
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,630
while working as a legal advocate.

107
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,593
Not long ago, she was even away
from home for a long time.

108
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:50,678
How indecent.

109
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,389
She went on a trip
as a legal advocate. That is all.

110
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,060
I did not want to have to say this,

111
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,189
but there is even a rumor

112
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,357
that you two are having an affair.

113
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,527
You are the chief of Yuhyangso.

114
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,946
You should be dispelling
such senseless rumors

115
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,408
that are unsettling the village.
How could you be swayed by them?

116
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,704
I will take my leave.

117
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,498
Wait. One moment.

118
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,083
If this is how you will react,

119
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,835
I must enforce restrictions.

120
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:28,132
How can a widow, who is considered
a sinner, leave the house?

121
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,176
Did you

122
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,513
just call her a widow?

123
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,475
Yes, I heard that you denied
that the corpse was your brother, but--

124
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,768
It was not my brother!

125
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,020
If he has not returned
in over seven years,

126
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,232
he is as good as dead, is he not?

127
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,236
Or is there any reason
why he is not returning

128
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,738
even when his wife is
being treated like a widow?

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,377
How could they do such a thing?

130
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:09,257
This is far too dangerous for an attempt
to enjoy a provocative rumor.

131
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,844
I wonder if this is happening because
I have made enemies as a legal advocate.

132
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,306
Someone who has a grudge against me

133
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,684
is trying to entrap me.

134
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,693
I think I saw Lady Song
at Young Master Seong's wedding.

135
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,861
Do you mean Young Master Baek's mother?

136
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,239
She definitely has a grudge against you.

137
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:56,971
Tae-young.

138
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,307
Are you in there?

139
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,726
I think you should come out.

140
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,446
Whose house is this?

141
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,076
Well, I definitely know
it is not my house--

142
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,077
Hush.

143
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:24,457
This house belongs to
my sister-in-law over there.

144
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,251
Of course. Do you not all think so?

145
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,170
- Of course.
- That is right.

146
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,047
Seven years ago,

147
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,966
my family was falsely charged
and was ruined.

148
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,427
In the place of my late father,

149
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,387
in the place of my absent brother,

150
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,724
in the place of myself
who was too young to do anything,

151
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,226
the person who recovered
this family's honor was

152
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,562
none other than Lady Ok.

153
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,401
<i>Carrying my late father's memorial tablet</i>

154
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,195
<i>as I returned to this house that day,</i>

155
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,614
<i>I made up my mind.</i>

156
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,910
From now on,
I will dedicate my life to you.

157
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,833
With the insults towards her
that I cannot even attempt to utter,

158
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,879
there is only one way to protect her.

159
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,717
The return of my brother.

160
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,305
Therefore, I will leave to search for him
as soon as day breaks tomorrow.

161
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,473
Young Master.

162
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,892
Yes. We should have
looked for him a long time ago.

163
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:28,062
Yes, is he not right?
Let us search everywhere and find him.

164
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,522
Why are you all doing this?

165
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,445
Must you cause trouble like this?

166
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,739
Appointments will be soon.
And you are a newlywed.

167
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,200
You should stop him too.

168
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,372
I think Master Yun-gyeom
should return as well.

169
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,250
You cannot be agreeing to this too.

170
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,168
I will return before the appointment.

171
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,962
I told you, he will not return.

172
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,463
It is useless to look for him.

173
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,091
How could you be so sure about that?

174
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,592
If he was going to return…

175
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:05,391
he would not have looked away
when he saw me.

176
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,897
When I was at the port in Ikcheon…

177
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,403
I saw him leaving for somewhere.

178
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:22,324
What… Then are you saying
that he looked away from you?

179
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,951
So please do not go.

180
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,455
I do not want you

181
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,124
to get hurt.

182
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,173
I did not know where to start,

183
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,926
but now I realize I must go to Ikcheon.

184
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,845
I will bring him back.

185
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,308
I will bring him back
even if I have to grab him by the collar.

186
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,408
Well, he is a grown man now.

187
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,454
I was worried that he might
embrace Lady Ok in front of his wife.

188
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,581
I know. He is making me blush.

189
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,416
Get going already!

190
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,475
- Let us go.
- Yes, my lord.

191
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,026
- Be careful.
- All right.

192
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,156
Keep your pillow close at night.

193
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:55,918
What a challenge it is
to secretly come here at night.

194
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,711
Thank you for making
the difficult journey.

195
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,005
Did it go well?

196
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,552
With your daughter and my husband
encouraging him from left and right,

197
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,972
the younger brother was easily
led to set out looking for his brother.

198
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,225
I did my best to spread rumors
that she is a widow as well.

199
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,561
Well done, my lady.

200
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,438
It would be easier to do it
without a man in the house.

201
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,982
By the way,

202
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:22,444
where did the magistrate
get the body at the government office?

203
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,247
If things go well this time, your fortune
will take a turn for the better.

204
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,209
If that happens thanks to you,
I will be sure to repay you.

205
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,588
All our Cheongsu County wants
is a Memorial Gate.

206
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,922
Do not worry about that.

207
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,426
Anyway, your daughter is amazing.

208
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:48,637
She put the effigy doll
in their room herself.

209
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,641
A mother and daughter
are of one mind, are they not?

210
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,019
Anyway,

211
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:59,273
how will you disguise it
as Ok Tae-young's suicide?

212
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,747
I have not seen him.

213
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,957
He is my master. He is tall and…

214
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,250
I have not seen him.

215
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,336
- He is tall.
- Have you seen him?

216
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,504
Please take a look.

217
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,464
Do not hit me.

218
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,092
We are looking for this man.

219
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,053
Can you help us?

220
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,138
Stop what you are doing and gather around.

221
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,140
- I have not seen him.
- No.

222
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,728
Excuse me.

223
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,855
Have you seen this man?

224
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,194
Is there a man like this staying there?

225
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,153
Just leave.

226
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,863
Gosh, that hurts.

227
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,365
Do-kki!

228
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,828
Please. Take a look at this.

229
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,246
Do you not know him?

230
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,333
Young Master, what do we do now?

231
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,335
Where will we find Master Yun-gyeom?

232
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,255
- Gosh, this is driving me mad.
- Do-kki.

233
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,304
In Qing, the roads are flat,
so the wagons can run fast.

234
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,266
They have hundreds of uses
besides hauling loads and people.

235
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,936
They say, even the people
look unbelievably good.

236
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,398
Darn it. I cannot wait to go.

237
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,899
Gosh.

238
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,444
Only the two of us are
going there for a survey?

239
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,531
Of course not.
They are sending two guards.

240
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,118
Success sure tastes sweet.

241
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,412
Enjoy the food.

242
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,705
Thank you.

243
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,083
Take off the cover.

244
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,877
Lord Song has acknowledged you
as the eldest son.

245
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,171
Stop covering that handsome face of yours

246
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,340
and live as Young Master Seo-in.

247
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,220
But you know, since I have been
wearing it for a while,

248
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,139
I feel more comfortable with it on.

249
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,181
Is that so?

250
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,477
Lost your appetite again?

251
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:04,023
Goo-deok left a while ago.
Will you go on living like this?

252
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,735
You were resolved never to see her.
You should be happy you saw her again.

253
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,782
If I knew this would happen,

254
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,578
I would have fed her more delicious foods.

255
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,997
She is not a slave anymore.

256
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,250
She is probably eating so well. Come on.

257
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,629
What?

258
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,300
Master Yun-gyeom?

259
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,015
- Me?
- Oh, my. Master Yun-gyeom.

260
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,894
- My goodness, Master Yun-gyeom!
- What is going on?

261
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,146
- Thank the heavens.
- What?

262
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,690
I was worried you had
died in an accident or drowned.

263
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,027
- What if you died without a funeral?
- What are you saying? Let go.

264
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,320
- I was so worried.
- Help.

265
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,197
- Yes.
- Master.

266
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,532
He is not your master.
He is our director. Let go!

267
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,327
Why is he so strong? Hey!

268
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,536
- Stop, Do-kki.
- Pardon?

269
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,996
My goodness.

270
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,290
He is not my brother.

271
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,208
Pardon?

272
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,835
What…

273
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,631
Are you not Lady Ok's friend

274
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,175
who helped us out seven years ago?

275
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,305
Goodness, that hurts! Hey!

276
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,224
Why did you come back so late?

277
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,184
Where on earth have you been?

278
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,770
Oh!

279
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,938
The brother-in-law!

280
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,606
Yes.

281
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,109
What did you eat to grow this big?

282
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,693
I did not recognize you at all.

283
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,821
I thought this seven years ago as well,

284
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,033
but you resemble my brother so much.

285
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,829
What is going on?
Am I the only one who does not understand?

286
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,622
Yes, you are the only one.

287
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,500
Why are you so strong?
Gosh, I broke out in a sweat.

288
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,709
Who is this?

289
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,587
Did you stop growing or are you a child,
you tiny rat?

290
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,550
Do you want to sob
after being beaten by a tiny rat?

291
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,634
Do-kki.

292
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,762
Stop it already. Never mind that.

293
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,141
So why are you looking for your brother?

294
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:06,770
My sister-in-law said
she saw my brother here before.

295
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,940
What are you talking about?

296
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,483
What do you think he means?

297
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,735
You left home seven years ago.

298
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,988
We came here to bring you back.

299
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,659
Then, he has not returned since then?

300
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,831
It was not hypothetical, it was real?

301
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,542
Yes, so let us hurry up
and return to Lady Ok.

302
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,086
She is treated like a widow.
It is a mess right now.

303
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,881
Enough, Do-kki.
I told you that it is not him.

304
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,258
Yes, it is not him.
Go look for him elsewhere.

305
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,926
Maybe look for him in Qing.

306
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,261
Qing?

307
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,764
You know something.

308
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,892
Spill it.

309
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,731
I saw him with Lady Legal Advocate.

310
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,442
From what I can recall,

311
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,445
he was on a trade ship bound for Qing.

312
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,198
Thank you. It is of great help to us.

313
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,199
Well, then.

314
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,909
- Let us go.
- Is he really not him?

315
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,827
- Let us go already.
- But it is him.

316
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,871
It really is him.

317
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,133
Director Chon.

318
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,219
I was…

319
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,971
When did you see him?

320
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,266
Was it on the way to see me
or on the way out?

321
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,518
On the way to see you.

322
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:38,320
But why did that bastard
not go home and go to Qing instead?

323
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,655
That bastard

324
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,658
saw Goo-deok but looked away.

325
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,327
<i>She cried so much.</i>

326
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,913
<i>I have never seen her cry like that.</i>

327
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>Why did she cry?</i>

328
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,625
Why did she cry over a man

329
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,253
who left her for seven years
and pretended not to see her?

330
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,837
Because she was upset.

331
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,132
She saved his family,
raised her brother-in-law without him,

332
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,551
and faithfully did her duties
as a daughter-in-law

333
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,720
despite being treated as a widow.

334
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,682
But he pretended not to see her.

335
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,059
Imagine how disappointed she was.

336
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:14,523
So after going through that,
she came to help me.

337
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,400
And I had no idea about that.

338
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,320
Why did you not tell me this?

339
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,114
Why did you not tell me?

340
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,657
I did tell you.

341
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,867
I asked what you would do
if he did not return.

342
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,744
- You said hypothetically!
- Of course!

343
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,538
What would you do if it is not?

344
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,124
Will you quit everything
to go and get her?

345
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,459
Yes! I will go now!

346
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,338
Please stop. Please come to your senses.

347
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:41,550
She is being treated as a widow.
How can I bear to hear that?

348
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,218
That is why his brother is here.

349
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,180
She has a family now.

350
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,600
She could not leave with you then
and she cannot now as well.

351
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,811
She cannot do that. Okay?

352
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,021
That is not all.

353
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,566
You are the eldest son
of the Song Family now.

354
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,901
Please.

355
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,862
You cannot do that anymore.

356
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,197
Goo-deok made her choice.

357
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,382
Lady Tae-young.

358
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,261
What brings you here at this hour?

359
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,556
I was wondering if I may join you.

360
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,058
Pardon?

361
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,145
Because of the abductors,

362
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,773
the inspector has
even been dispatched here.

363
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,858
I was worried about you sleeping alone,

364
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,568
so I came here to protect you.

365
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,613
I am all right, Tae-young.

366
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,781
I am not all right.

367
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,496
To be honest,
the abductors are just an excuse.

368
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,792
I was so lonely
as I slept alone every night.

369
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,467
Do you not resent your husband?

370
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,137
It has been seven years,
but he pretended not to see you.

371
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,806
I cannot believe that.

372
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,268
I do.

373
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,604
I resent him.

374
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,108
And I am so disappointed and upset.

375
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,153
He left everything to me,

376
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,406
but he just looked away.

377
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,588
You know,

378
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,758
whenever I resented him,

379
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,969
I wrote a lot of letters
that I could not send.

380
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,889
I wrote a bunch of insults
and left them in his room.

381
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,016
I will show you later.

382
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,860
But…

383
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,905
even though I hate him,

384
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,741
I understand him.

385
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,037
He took a lonely and righteous path…

386
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,000
that nobody understood.

387
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,336
I do not know the details,

388
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,465
but at least I should
try to understand him.

389
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,012
After all…

390
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,641
I am his wife.

391
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,307
My gosh. I am in so much pain.

392
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,480
See if you can get up, Do-kki.

393
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,983
Are you all right?

394
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,404
Try to eat something first.

395
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,531
I got some medicine, so have it and see.

396
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,203
What on earth did I eat to feel this way?

397
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,039
People like us usually die
when we do not have an appetite.

398
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,541
We should not have come this far.

399
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,503
My rash decision has brought you trouble.

400
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,004
Please do not say that.

401
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,383
Where on earth could he be?

402
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,178
Eat this and get some rest.

403
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,055
Lastly, I will search the Shetong area.

404
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,891
Please do not go there.
I hear it is dangerous.

405
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,102
Do not worry about me. Get some rest.

406
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,528
My lady.

407
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,322
I brought some steamed potatoes.

408
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,074
Have some while you work.

409
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,872
Why would a new bride sigh so deeply?

410
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,750
You have not been
eating well either, my lady.

411
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,876
That is not all.

412
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,671
She cannot sleep well
and does not look well.

413
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,339
She has become quiet as well.

414
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,260
Oh, I did not realize.

415
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,178
It is because you miss your husband.

416
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,850
He will return soon,
so do not feel so lonely.

417
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,979
Are you not lonely?

418
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,814
I have no time to be lonely.

419
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,525
There are so many people who need me.

420
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,903
What is that? What are you reading?

421
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:55,989
These are the records of the cases I took.

422
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,908
Their lives depend on it,

423
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,161
so I wanted to make sure
there were no mistakes.

424
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,079
That is why I kept records like this.

425
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,124
This may help you too.
You should read them.

426
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,375
Yes.

427
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:12,422
By the way, what made you
become a legal advocate?

428
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,051
Well,

429
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,220
I wanted to bring justice to Baek-yi…

430
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,974
and to save Mak-sim.

431
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,986
My daughter

432
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,532
died wrongfully because of
Special Inspector Baek's family.

433
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,375
How did she die wrongfully?

434
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,046
They did an unspeakable thing to her…

435
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:57,092
hung her by the road,

436
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,095
and made it look like she took her life.

437
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,061
The thought of Young Master Baek
has always troubled me.

438
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:12,232
I know. I feel so sorry for him.

439
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,068
He did nothing wrong.
Why did he have to be exiled?

440
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,945
His only sin is having bad parents.

441
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,823
What do you mean?

442
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,576
The people that ordered
the man to do that to my Baek-yi

443
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,704
were his parents.

444
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,751
Then why was Young Master Baek exiled?

445
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,545
As a son,

446
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,090
he could not expose
the crime of his parents,

447
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,844
so he made a false confession
by saying that he did it.

448
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:51,354
RECORD OF BAEK-YI'S CASE

449
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,900
<i>Did you lie to me?</i>

450
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,070
Lie to you?

451
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,239
What is this lie
that you are accusing me of?

452
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,950
My innocent son was

453
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,077
framed for murder because of Ok Tae-young.

454
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,080
A lowly slave girl wanted
to turn her life around,

455
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,708
so she seduced your brother
but ended up killing herself.

456
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,001
I have told you many times.

457
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,003
I brought the case record.

458
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,339
It says that the slave Baek-yi's death
was disguised as suicide.

459
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,384
- That is not true.
- According to the record, Do-gwang said,

460
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,305
"Baek-yi was my lover."

461
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,681
<i>Baek-yi</i>

462
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,225
was a woman I loved since I was young.

463
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,729
No!

464
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,689
It is a lie. It is all a lie!

465
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,818
Your brother never
loved that lowly wench.

466
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,196
He never fooled around with that wench!

467
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,323
Did you have Baek-yi removed
because of that?

468
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,532
Yes!

469
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,038
I ordered Dol-seok

470
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,708
to abduct Baek-yi and violate her.

471
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,963
I thought your brother would come
to his senses if he saw that himself.

472
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:04,302
But your brother made
a false confession instead.

473
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,429
He did so
to take the blame for your crime.

474
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,306
We could have gotten away with it.

475
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,351
We got rid of the coroner,
and there was no evidence.

476
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,395
But that Ok Tae-young
took Dol-seok into her custody

477
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,688
and persuaded your brother.

478
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:20,401
That sly snake ruined our family
with her lies!

479
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,618
No…

480
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,039
Have you been fooled
by her sly words as well?

481
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,751
They are investigating
the widow abduction cases.

482
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,461
We may be discovered, Mother.

483
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,507
No one will find out
as long as you do not say a thing.

484
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,013
I am going to

485
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,476
hang Ok Tae-young
by the road just like Baek-yi.

486
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,937
After being violated,

487
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,107
she will be left naked by the road

488
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,525
while still breathing.

489
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,487
Let us see her feel the pain
of being torn apart

490
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,866
in front of those lowly ones
she cares about so dearly.

491
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:11,828
Even a spiteful woman like Ok Tae-young

492
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,664
will want to die
when she goes through that.

493
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,834
Once that wench is gone,

494
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:21,004
that house and your husband

495
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,381
will all become yours.

496
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,343
We must get rid of her
before your husband returns.

497
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,904
You are the one who executed all my plans.

498
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:48,156
Do you think you can pull out of it now?

499
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,868
If Ok Tae-young finds out
what you have done until now,

500
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,662
she will not let you get away with it.

501
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,542
Be strong.

502
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,678
- Hurry up.
- Where are you going to go?

503
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,680
Thank you, my lady.

504
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,933
Buy some delicious foods
and have fun, Mak-sim.

505
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:15,892
See you later.

506
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,102
- Here.
- My lady.

507
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,439
<i>When the household leaves on Baekjung Day,</i>

508
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,858
<i>you must carry it out.</i>

509
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,701
Apologies.

510
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:23,710
Have you…

511
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,589
Have you seen this man?

512
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,592
Pardon me, have you…

513
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,442
I am good.

514
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,236
But…

515
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,908
Sorry for the intrusion.

516
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,327
Have you ever seen this man?

517
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,866
Move.

518
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,660
Oh, my. You are
a young master from Joseon.

519
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,166
How can you do this
to a fellow man from Joseon?

520
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,251
Look, Young Master. My goodness.

521
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:50,046
Who on earth are you
so desperately looking for?

522
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,507
Hand that over at once. Give it!

523
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,177
You do not seem to know where you are,
Young Master from Joseon.

524
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,025
Kick him.

525
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,323
We shall put your money to good use.

526
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:23,037
You may end up dead looking for those
who have run away from Joseon.

527
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,248
You had better go home now.

528
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,316
So it is you lot.

529
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,111
The ones who have been
abducting innocent widows.

530
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,845
Yes, thank you.

531
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,765
This is…

532
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,477
Do you know this man?

533
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,938
I think this is Kim.

534
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:15,650
Where is that man right now?

535
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,261
How did it go?

536
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,137
Is she still breathing?

537
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,733
It has been a long time, my lady.

538
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:03,239
How… How did you…

539
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,624
What brings you here so early?

540
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,631
I…

541
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,969
do not deserve this bracelet.

542
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,847
Why not?

543
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:35,062
Because you intentionally
approached our family?

544
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,568
Or is it because you are
Lady Song's daughter?

545
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,988
How…

546
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,033
Did you already know everything?

547
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:53,706
I think I saw Lady Song
at Young Master Seong's wedding.

548
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,291
Do you mean

549
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,085
Young Master Baek's mother?

550
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,297
She definitely has a grudge against you.

551
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,715
My lady.

552
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,552
Young Master Baek took his life.

553
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:11,307
- Was Lady Song at the place of exile?
- No, she said she saw her at the wedding,

554
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,351
so I searched the area just in case.

555
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:17,146
And I found her in an abandoned home
deep in Uichang County.

556
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,648
Uichang County?

557
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,444
Does Lady Song have
a daughter by any chance?

558
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,905
We kept our young daughters at home
back then,

559
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,032
so I do not remember her face or name,

560
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,993
but she did have a young daughter.
Why do you ask?

561
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,873
I think I know why Lady Song came

562
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,167
to the wedding.

563
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,924
Because it was her daughter's wedding.

564
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,222
You knew everything,

565
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,933
so why did you not do anything about me?

566
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,560
I was waiting for you
to come clean like this.

567
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,485
How long have you been scheming this?

568
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,907
Everything from the very beginning?

569
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,579
I will gladly receive any punishment.

570
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:18,707
So…

571
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,336
none of it was real?

572
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,550
I believed what my mother told me.

573
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,928
I believed that

574
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,974
my innocent brother was
wrongfully exiled because of you.

575
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,686
I had lived a life lacking nothing,

576
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,397
but all of a sudden,
my parents abandoned me

577
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,734
and I had to live as an adopted daughter
of an unfamiliar and needy family.

578
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,614
I thought it was all because of you.

579
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,075
You must have hated me so much.

580
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,039
My hate has…

581
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,252
nowhere to go now.

582
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,839
The moment I found out the truth,

583
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,757
my heart was emptied.

584
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,805
For now, you must…

585
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,267
do what your mother says.

586
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,020
Pardon?

587
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,730
And I will…

588
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,650
protect my family.

589
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,828
<i>Kkeut-dong will send a message</i>
<i>to the Inspector General nearby.</i>

590
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,583
So it is you lot.

591
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,797
The ones who have been
abducting innocent widows.

592
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,215
Come with us quietly.

593
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,346
Do you think you will get what you want?

594
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,559
Are you ready, my lord?

595
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,251
Arrest every one of them!

596
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,063
How could you…

597
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,900
make your daughter do such an awful thing?

598
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:36,655
Did you coax
my daughter as well in the end?

599
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,782
Were you not satisfied
with ruining my family

600
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,909
and making my son take his life?

601
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,204
No. You are the one
who did that to your son.

602
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,749
You are also the one that killed

603
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:48,917
Baek-yi.

604
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,210
No!

605
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,005
Your slave girl killed my son.

606
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,801
She enticed my son even in her death!

607
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,472
Do-gwang!

608
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,766
Do-gwang, no! Do-gwang.

609
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,769
Do-gwang. My son…

610
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,730
Do-gwang.

611
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,623
He did not let go of that rock…

612
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,086
until he drew his last breath.

613
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,548
I was waiting for his exile to end.

614
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,301
If only he waited…

615
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:43,138
Perhaps it is time that you let him go.

616
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,390
Can you let…

617
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,103
Young Master Baek be
by Baek-yi's side now?

618
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:50,979
Shut up, I say!

619
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:53,440
I am not saying you must
let go of your hatred of me.

620
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,819
I am asking you to stop
for your remaining child.

621
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,656
Do you not feel sorry
for Mi-ryeong who has been

622
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,324
living with hatred all her life?

623
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:08,997
Do you truly say these things,
knowing what she has done?

624
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,333
She plotted this whole thing.

625
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,127
She came up with all of it.

626
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,426
You should have hoped that I did not know.

627
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,012
You should have said you came up with it

628
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,850
and that your daughter only did
what she was told.

629
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,477
Instead of trying to protect her,

630
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,355
you try to use your only daughter
as a means for revenge?

631
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,607
Because she is my daughter! She is mine!

632
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,943
A mother and daughter are of one mind.

633
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,655
Can you not

634
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,701
live the rest of your life for Mi-ryeong?

635
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:46,869
No.

636
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,164
I will use

637
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:53,792
the rest of my life to tear you apart.

638
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,549
Do not come close

639
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,303
to me or my family ever again.

640
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,679
This is…

641
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,559
the last time I will tolerate it.

642
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,459
Abductors?
Memorial Gate for Virtuous Women?

643
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,753
What are you talking about?

644
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,463
Did you not know about this?

645
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,756
Of course not.

646
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:45,010
I was simply advising her
to be cautious, as a widow should.

647
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,930
Did you keep it a secret
from Chief Cha as well?

648
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:53,644
I simply spread a bit of a rumor.
That is all.

649
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,812
If I spread the rumor,
she promised she would

650
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,940
make her a widow
and get us the Memorial Gate.

651
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:01,568
What would Lady Song gain
by getting the Memorial Gate?

652
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,153
How can you be so foolish?

653
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,240
I did not know she would lie even to me.

654
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,909
If you knew about this,
you should have come to me first.

655
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,495
I know that
Ung-yi's civil service exam is important,

656
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,664
but how could you take part
in such a heinous act?

657
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,667
It is because you keep looking down on me.

658
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,085
Have you no fear?

659
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:21,338
I heard a royal inspector was
dispatched here because of this.

660
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,967
Do you not know that
my position as chief could be in jeopardy?

661
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,706
I thought I should say goodbye to you
before I left.

662
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,629
Are you going to return to your mother?

663
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,716
No.

664
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:10,262
Mother will not forgive me
for my betrayal.

665
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,226
Let me ask you one thing.

666
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:22,190
Why did you run in front of the wagon
to save Young Master Do-gyeom?

667
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,860
You could have died.

668
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:31,950
<i>Perhaps that was when</i>

669
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,494
<i>my resolve began to waver.</i>

670
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,542
No matter how hard I tried to hate you,

671
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,711
I kept forgetting about it.

672
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,755
Nobody…

673
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:49,718
suspected me at all
and everyone was so kind to me.

674
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,805
<i>I received such love</i>
<i>that I had never received before.</i>

675
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,682
<i>I was incredibly grateful.</i>

676
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,269
<i>It was a short time,</i>

677
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:03,899
<i>but I was truly happy</i>
<i>and I am so thankful for it.</i>

678
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:10,030
<i>And more than anything,</i>
<i>I loved myself for trying to</i>

679
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,616
<i>become like you.</i>

680
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,665
I wish you…

681
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,047
health and prosperity.

682
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,426
I am sorry, Mi-ryeong.

683
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:35,722
Pardon?

684
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,892
You were at an age
when you should have been loved.

685
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,688
But you were separated from your parents

686
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:47,442
and had to endure it
by hating and resenting me.

687
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,780
It truly breaks my heart.

688
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,286
Will you…

689
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:04,543
let me make up for your childhood?

690
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,506
If your heart is empty

691
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,883
as you no longer hate me,

692
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,135
I would like to…

693
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:17,472
fill that heart with the love
you have not received until now.

694
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:28,900
Are you saying that you forgive me?

695
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,361
It is not forgiveness.

696
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,742
If you could lead a happier life,

697
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,204
I think I would feel
less sorry for Young Master Baek.

698
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,459
In exchange,

699
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:51,673
I hope he would be nice to Baek-yi,
whom he has finally been reunited with.

700
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,932
Would you let me do that?

701
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,897
If I do not leave,

702
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,484
Mother will not let me get away with it.

703
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,331
Did I not promise you?

704
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,169
That I would look after you

705
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:33,673
like a mother and a sister?

706
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,805
Tae-young…

707
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,900
Let us keep this to ourselves. All right?

708
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,111
Welcome back. Did you have fun?

709
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,158
- Oh, my.
- My lady.

710
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,827
Kkeut-dong is here!

711
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,869
Oh, my.

712
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,872
Oh, my, ladies.
Have you been waiting for us?

713
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,916
Goodness, Kkeut-dong, you are drunk.

714
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,876
Gosh, she is more drunk than me.

715
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,671
She kept looking for Do-kki.
She kept calling for him.

716
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,630
Be quiet!

717
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,218
These are gifts for you, my ladies.

718
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:26,768
You can have one each, like sisters.

719
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,064
This one is for you, Lady Ok.

720
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:34,067
You used to be inseparable
with my dear Baek-yi.

721
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,904
Now that I see the two of you together,

722
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,323
I feel so relieved.

723
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:46,913
Mak-sim, I gave you the money to have fun.
Did you spend all of it on these?

724
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,167
Let us go inside.

725
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,086
Gosh, wait for me.

726
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:54,629
Let us go.

727
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,749
Yun-gyeom.

728
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,714
It is me, Do-gyeom.

729
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,507
Seong Do-gyeom.

730
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,022
Do you recognize me?

731
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:23,403
Yun-gyeom.

732
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,949
Let us go home now. Please.

733
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:48,344
<i>No matter how high</i>

734
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,638
Gosh. Darn it!

735
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,685
Copying the instructions for women.

736
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,105
Serves you right.

737
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,068
Now that you are stuck here,

738
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,070
there are no rumors going around anymore.

739
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:10,283
Right. Since you have been
banned from Mother's Sanctuary,

740
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,577
spiders may build webs in your mouth.

741
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:18,166
Please stop getting into trouble
and behave yourself, my lady.

742
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,960
Be thankful that
nothing came of it for us.

743
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,467
By the way, is it not strange?

744
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,094
What is?

745
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:33,306
What Lady Song asked me
is to spread the rumor.

746
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,224
That is not all.

747
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:37,602
She encouraged me and Yuhyangso
to send Young Master Seong away.

748
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:38,895
Then,

749
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:43,108
who did she convince to have the body
brought into the government office?

750
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,988
Did she tempt the magistrate
with the Memorial Gate as well?

751
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,585
What is it?

752
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:05,004
I told you not to come
unless I summoned you.

753
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,257
It is urgent, my lord.

754
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,302
Things became complicated
because of Cheongsu County.

755
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,887
What do you mean?

756
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,723
The magistrate of Cheongsu County,
where there are no widows,

757
00:57:15,807 --> 00:57:18,309
said he would make a widow
to get the Memorial Gate,

758
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:20,228
so I sent some abductors, but

759
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,022
they were all arrested by the inspector.

760
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,608
What?

761
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,861
You see,

762
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,156
that widow set a trap for them.

763
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,745
But can you guess who that widow is
who set the trap for them?

764
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,708
You said it was Cheongsu County.

765
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:44,711
Is it that legal advocate wench?

766
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:46,254
Yes, my lord.

767
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,174
It is the one
who took all of your gold away

768
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:54,345
and made me lose an eye
because of the severe beating.

769
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,724
It is none other than that Ok Tae-young.

770
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,565
Summon Magistrate Oh Dal-seong
of Cheongsu County.

771
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,492
How many students will make a trip here?

772
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:16,993
There will be six.

773
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,120
That is more than I expected.

774
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:22,081
They will have a lot of questions,
so be prepared.

775
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,167
I am a little nervous.

776
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,960
They should be here by now.

777
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,338
They must be here.

778
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,716
What?

779
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,384
What is going on?

780
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,225
This place will be closed from now.
Everyone must leave.

781
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:44,395
Why are you doing this?

782
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,813
- Take them out!
- Take them out!

783
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,650
- What is going on?
- What?

784
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,527
Why are you doing this?

785
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:51,653
What is going on?

786
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,321
Why are you doing this?

787
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,240
What are you doing right now?

788
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,506
Oh, my gosh!

789
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,175
Do not leave anything.
Take them out and burn all of them!

790
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,593
- Yes!
- Yes!

791
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,428
No.

792
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,098
No. What are you doing?

793
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,475
- What are you doing?
- No.

794
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,770
My lady.

795
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,855
No!

796
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:32,485
No!

797
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,404
- No!
- My lady!

798
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,623
On what grounds are you doing this?

799
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,584
Listen, Widow Ok Tae-young.

800
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:49,085
I am not a widow!

801
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,463
After examining the corpse again

802
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,550
with the magistrate
and provincial governor of each province,

803
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:59,220
he is Seong Yun-gyeom,
the eldest son of Seong Gyu-jin.

804
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,514
Who says he is my husband?

805
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,641
I told you that it is not him!

806
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:04,809
That man is not my husband.

807
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:09,230
How can you turn your back
on your dear husband?

808
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:13,651
That has nothing to do with our office.
Why are you destroying it?

809
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:18,239
How can a widow,
who must maintain her chastity,

810
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:20,241
work outside her house?

811
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,619
From now, Widow Ok Tae-young is

812
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:26,122
prohibited from outdoor activities
as well as leaving her house.

813
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:28,416
She must collect her husband's body

814
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,085
and respectfully mourn for three years.

815
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:34,172
- For three years? Oh, my.
- Oh, no.

816
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:43,473
If you stop now,
I will forgive you for this insolence.

817
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:46,434
What did you say?

818
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,811
You will have to pay for it if you do it!

819
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,647
I am warning you.

820
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,030
How dare you threaten a magistrate.

821
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,285
Look here. Take her to the office.

822
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,372
Let go. Let go of me!

823
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,002
No!

824
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,170
Let go.

825
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,957
Let go!

826
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,007
Yun-gyeom, your wife is
going through so much hardship.

827
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,218
<i>Are you sure you want to do this?</i>

828
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,262
<i>You can never take this back.</i>

829
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,389
Bring the breakfast again.

830
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,641
<i>She is here to seek revenge.</i>

831
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,102
<i>You will get the Memorial Gate. Just wait.</i>

832
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,063
Do you have some other scheme?

833
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,274
<i>There is no Chon Seung-hwi</i>
<i>in this world anymore.</i>

834
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,985
Director Chon died
on the boat trip to Qing.

835
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:05,364
<i>Did you try to kill my husband?</i>

836
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,743
<i>If a woman who goes mad because</i>
<i>she cannot accept her husband's death</i>

837
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:10,870
<i>and cries herself to death in prison,</i>

838
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:14,040
<i>it would be perfect for a Memorial Gate.</i>

839
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,501
<i>Will you let me out?</i>

840
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,086
I will mourn for three years
and stay a widow.

841
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:23,257
<i>You must not say anything</i>
<i>about what happened here.</i>

842
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:33,017
