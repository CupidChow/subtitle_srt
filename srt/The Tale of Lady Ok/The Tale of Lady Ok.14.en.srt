1
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,138
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,982
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,890
Why would Bak Jun Gi suddenly come
to Cheongsu County?

5
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,927
Maybe he thought we caught
the swindler Heo Soon.

6
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:01,395
That makes sense.

7
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,730
Perhaps he came to have
Kim Nak Soo's back in case of trouble

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,799
or to cover up the incident for him.

9
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,570
Whatever the reason,
he proved his involvement

10
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,872
in the eternal ginseng case himself.

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,845
I cannot believe Heo Soon
you introduced me to was a fraud.

12
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:19,313
Even I was completely fooled.

13
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:21,582
What about the eternal ginseng payment?

14
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:22,916
Yes.

15
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:25,919
Here.

16
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:28,388
Look.

17
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:31,959
I took my share in advance.

18
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,261
I'm meticulous about separating business
and personal matters.

19
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,364
But why come in person
instead of sending someone?

20
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,734
I clearly instructed you
to proceed quietly.

21
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,836
How could you involve
the Inspector General?

22
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,008
The Chief Lady kept stirring people up.

23
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,776
I am sorry.

24
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,312
About the Legal Advocate Ok Tae Young.

25
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,217
Does she really resemble
the slave Goodeoki you used to keep?

26
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,454
I haven't seen her myself.

27
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,559
And I heard you had Goodeoki captured.

28
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,794
That never happened.

29
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,764
Huh?

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,801
Lord Heo Jong Moon

31
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,472
suspects the Chief Minister
and Bak Jun Gi

32
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,607
were behind the recent
virtuous arch disguise case as well.

33
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,677
So that is
why Oh Dal Seong killed himself.

34
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:25,445
He was scared of the Chief Minister
and Bak Jun Gi.

35
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,047
The one who killed the overseer

36
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,550
must also have been Bak Jun Gi.

37
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,020
My father also couldn't name Bak Jun Gi
out of fear of repercussions.

38
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:35,822
I just got chills.

39
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,660
Bak Jun Gi will surely keep
a close watch on you, Madam.

40
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:43,130
More than that, he must be grinding
his teeth in anger.

41
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,265
You might be in danger,

42
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,234
so I will investigate secretly
from now on.

43
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,704
Most of the people borrowed money
from Hwang, who deals in usury.

44
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,607
Just like they used the overseer
in the virtuous arch case,

45
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,343
he is likely involved in this too.

46
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,715
This is truly exhausting.

47
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,451
Exactly, bringing in the wrong person.

48
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,120
Eternal ginseng doesn't even exist.

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,323
Everyone was blinded by greed.

50
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,260
You, of all people, who frequent
gambling dens, shouldn't say that.

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,127
Yes.

52
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,662
- But honey.
- Yes?

53
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:19,132
You said he wasn't a swindler,
so why bring him here?

54
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,703
I didn't bring him.
He followed me himself.

55
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,873
- There...
- Why?

56
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,574
I came to get a meal.

57
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,511
- How brazen.
- So shameless.

58
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:31,445
- What?
- What?

59
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:48,829
Three households fled last night.

60
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:53,300
My goodness, what is going to happen
to Cheongsu County?

61
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,836
Honestly, now is not the time
to worry about others.

62
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:58,872
Our granary is empty
after giving everything away.

63
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,841
Honey, why did you give him food?

64
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,843
He looked pitiful.

65
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,511
How can you eat at a time like this?

66
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,214
No, still not this.

67
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,817
It is only a matter of time
until we starve to death.

68
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,227
- Well...
- What is in this rice?

69
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:21,094
Well, here is...

70
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,163
There is something chewy inside.
What is it?

71
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,899
I mixed rice with aloe
because there was too little rice left.

72
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,134
This is...

73
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,170
Did you just say aloe?

74
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,104
Sir.

75
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,374
Let me say something too.

76
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,778
How could you mix something
as expensive as aloe with rice?

77
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,046
Huh?

78
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,280
Aloe is expensive?

79
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,892
How could such a precious plant grow
in Joseon?

80
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:53,393
I was surprised as well.

81
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,663
I knew it was a rare medicine,
but is it expensive?

82
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,001
According to the herbs section
in "Donguibogam,"

83
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,870
it helps with skin issues,
inflammation, burns,

84
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,172
and is effective
for chronic weakness and febrile fits.

85
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:08,308
According to "Bencao Gangmu," it is
also effective for wind-heat conditions,

86
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,210
oozing eczema, and clarifying the eyes.

87
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,645
- Is it expensive?
- Is it expensive?

88
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,946
- Honey, jinx.
- Honey, jinx.

89
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,214
What is this?

90
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:18,218
It is an imported herb. If grown here,

91
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,453
it is obviously costly.

92
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,621
Kkeutdongi, what are you doing?

93
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:22,789
- Go get Master and Madam now.
- Okay.

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,731
Are you saying this aloe is
truly a pricey medicine?

95
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,735
I'm not so sure about that.

96
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:36,637
To be honest, I doubt it.

97
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,972
Why would I lie about this?

98
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,777
Could you introduce a place
where we could sell this aloe?

99
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,812
If you pay a small commission.

100
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,647
Commission...

101
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:47,848
Good grief.

102
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,450
See? You cannot trust gamblers.

103
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,985
Then forget it.

104
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,389
Eat it yourself and fill the air
with farts and piles of dung.

105
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:56,957
- My goodness.
- Okay.

106
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,760
I will pay, so please arrange
for an introduction.

107
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,932
Isn't the man who is caught Heo Soon?

108
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:09,369
No, he is the real Heo Soon,
but not the swindler.

109
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,972
So, you caught a fake after all?

110
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:15,142
No, the one we caught is real, but...

111
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,045
No matter how many times I explain,
you just don't get it.

112
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,179
Are you slow?

113
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,849
Excuse me?
Whose fault is this in the first place?

114
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,184
The man they caught
is the real Heo Soon.

115
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,987
It seems someone impersonated him
to commit fraud.

116
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,891
So, you are saying
the culprit was not caught.

117
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,726
This is the end.

118
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,396
Everyone in Cheongsu County
will starve to death.

119
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,032
What should we do?

120
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,768
Chair Lady, do something, please.

121
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,873
My goodness.

122
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,308
Seriously.

123
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,677
Where were you at this hour?

124
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:54,648
To Man Seok, trying to steal his bundle.

125
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,384
Then why did you come back empty-handed?

126
00:06:57,384 --> 00:07:00,654
Well, he was using it as a pillow,

127
00:07:00,654 --> 00:07:02,523
tied up like this.

128
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,425
Leave it be. Man Seok earned it
through his hard work.

129
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,929
If he is holding onto it tightly,
he must have a pressing need.

130
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,199
But is there any time more pressing
than now?

131
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,301
We need travel expenses
to go to Hanyang too.

132
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:18,872
I thought he wouldn't give it,
so I tried to steal it.

133
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:21,508
What if Man Seok files a suit?

134
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:24,811
Theft is punishable by thirty lashes
under Penal Code 292.

135
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:30,350
It has been so long since I have seen
such peace and brightness in your face.

136
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:32,419
Indeed.

137
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,455
I think I got too excited
about selling the aloe.

138
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,830
By the way, Minister Bak Jun Gi has
called for a meeting tomorrow.

139
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,700
I suppose I should go alone?

140
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:49,002
He summoned me on purpose.

141
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,205
If I didn't go,
it will arouse more suspicion.

142
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:53,974
I admit you are bold,

143
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,209
but this is far too dangerous.

144
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,478
He likely knows we sent a fake
slave hunter to capture the fugitive.

145
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,814
If he had evidence,
he would have already acted on it.

146
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,151
I have a plan, so don't worry.

147
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,924
You are far too optimistic.

148
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,027
Why have you called for this meeting?

149
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:52,099
I learned
about Cheongsu County's difficulties

150
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,800
and I couldn't ignore them.

151
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,637
I thought I might offer
some personal assistance.

152
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,707
Thank you so much, My Lord.

153
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,349
Yes, I am truly grateful.

154
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,118
Yes, thank you.

155
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:14,821
I have a long-standing connection
to Cheongsu County

156
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,725
and especially to the people
gathered here, that is why.

157
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,296
But on another note,

158
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,831
my concubine claimed

159
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,370
the legal advocate was a runaway slave.

160
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:39,746
What an utterly ridiculous thing to say.

161
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,418
Indeed, even passing dogs wouldn't laugh
at such a jest, My Lord.

162
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,721
Are you suggesting I married a servant?

163
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:50,591
How could a nobleman like you

164
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,828
insult the mistress
of a noble household so gravely?

165
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,532
What do you think, Magistrate?

166
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,605
Does that servant resemble me that much?

167
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,716
Maybe you do a little.

168
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,352
It seems my daughter has been impolite.

169
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:24,424
Please ensure she learns
to speak more cautiously.

170
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,759
Otherwise,

171
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,262
why would you spread lies
about capturing the slave

172
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,297
and send my concubine to Hanyang?

173
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,267
Did I do that?

174
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,270
- That is...
- I did that.

175
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,606
With the people of Cheongsu County
in distress

176
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,442
and malicious rumors spreading among
the members of the Mother's Sanctuary,

177
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:45,212
as Chair Lady, I took decisive action.

178
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,749
Still,

179
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:52,085
how could you invoke
the Minister's name for such actions?

180
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:55,322
Then, should we allow a concubine
to act as the legal wife

181
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,257
and create chaos in Cheongsu County?

182
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:01,028
If we did, it would further damage
the Magistrate's fragile authority

183
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,098
and tarnish the Minister's reputation,
so I acted accordingly.

184
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:10,437
As you said, we share a deep
and meaningful connection

185
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,273
as old acquaintances.

186
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,076
How unfortunate.

187
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,246
I stayed home and knew nothing
about this matter.

188
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,149
The Magistrate's daughter
seems to have delusions.

189
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:23,584
My goodness, delusions?

190
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:25,686
Then, rumors of the concubine
being mad were actually...

191
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,790
I misspoke.

192
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,291
What do you mean by delusions?

193
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,093
I heard that hideous scar on your face

194
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,796
was also caused by that servant.

195
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:40,634
My goodness, to think you suffered
such disgrace from a servant.

196
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,804
How humiliating that must have been.

197
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,173
Let us leave now.

198
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,681
Take care as you leave.

199
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:21,141
The people of Cheongsu County
are all so rude.

200
00:12:23,277 --> 00:12:24,478
Does she resemble her?

201
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:29,183
It has been so long, so I'm not sure.
Maybe she does a little.

202
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,652
But why are you so curious?

203
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:34,855
I'm not interested
in whether she is a slave or not.

204
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,391
She is connected to the Royal Tribunal,

205
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,560
so I want to use that as leverage.

206
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,763
- Oh.
- Just to be sure,

207
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:45,265
keep a close watch on their movements.

208
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,400
And if they act?

209
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,402
Should we accuse Ok Tae Young
of being a slave?

210
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:52,105
Or should we torture her
to force a false confession?

211
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,875
Didn't I say she is connected
to the Royal Tribunal?

212
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,510
Don't recklessly cross the line.

213
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,753
This looks very peculiar.

214
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:10,991
Did you call us just to show this?

215
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,427
I see why.

216
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:16,063
They must be suggesting we eat this.

217
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:16,964
How could we?

218
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,133
We didn't know, but Heo Soon said

219
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,269
this aloe has great value.

220
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,705
Great value?

221
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:28,208
So, we plan to sell them in Hanyang.

222
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,310
You want to sell them
to help Cheongsu County?

223
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:33,113
If you do, we would be very grateful.

224
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:36,116
Cheongsu County struggles to grow crops

225
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,418
but aloe seems to thrive here.

226
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,089
Why not pick a suitable place
and cultivate it together?

227
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,291
Cultivate it together? How?

228
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:47,995
Most people cannot afford to buy aloe.

229
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,731
We will give them out.

230
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:52,266
On credit?

231
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,233
Free of charge.

232
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,801
- Free?
- Really?

233
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,037
To quickly increase yields,

234
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,606
we will distribute mature plants
and seedlings.

235
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:04,645
Don't you have something to say,
Chief Lady?

236
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,550
Cheongsu County may lack a good Chief,

237
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,985
but we have a great Special Inspector.

238
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,656
It is too early for praise.
Let us first go to Hanyang and...

239
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,092
Are you crying?

240
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:23,964
Why are you crying?

241
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,799
I just have a runny nose.

242
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,067
Why cry over this?

243
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,203
You are too sentimental.

244
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,640
Get up now.

245
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,641
Okay.

246
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,585
Look, this is the land.

247
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:49,289
Even if it is vacant, this seems
like a poor choice, doesn't it?

248
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,491
Is this really the right place?

249
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,227
You don't know it.

250
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:55,996
For growing something like aloe,
this land is perfect.

251
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:58,732
If you say so, then it must be.

252
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,569
I would believe you now even if you said
soybeans make soybean paste.

253
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,138
Soybeans do make soybean paste.

254
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,774
Right.

255
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,545
Anyway, don't forget to submit
a permit application for the clearing.

256
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:12,679
If you do not, it will be a problem.

257
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,047
Of course, I will.

258
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,818
If you hint, I will act.
If you call, I will come running.

259
00:15:17,818 --> 00:15:20,153
Running? You are silly.

260
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:23,657
Let us leave if we are done here.

261
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,659
Did I do something wrong?

262
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,362
Wait for me. Let's go together.

263
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,697
Do you have any tasks for me?

264
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:35,235
Are they really giving this away
to the villagers for free?

265
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:36,737
Yes.

266
00:15:36,737 --> 00:15:39,072
Take it now before we change our minds.

267
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,144
- Thank you.
- Take good care of it.

268
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:46,513
But those who suffered the most fraud

269
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,782
should get more.

270
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,718
That is the giver's choice to make.
If you do not want it, just leave it.

271
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,287
Thank you.

272
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:55,255
Who said I do not want it?

273
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:58,859
Will you give us some, too?

274
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:02,262
Hong Sim already took some
for the Administrator Shin's house.

275
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,534
This seems small compared
to the size of the land.

276
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,069
If you plant the mature ones firmly,

277
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,471
new seedlings will sprout quickly.

278
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,608
By replanting, it will multiply fast,
so don't worry.

279
00:16:14,608 --> 00:16:16,944
Right. Believe it or not,

280
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:19,713
this plant produces offspring very well.

281
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,584
Thank you very much, Madam.

282
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:25,619
Take good care of it.

283
00:16:25,619 --> 00:16:27,688
Giving away something
so valuable for free...

284
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,756
I cannot match your generosity.

285
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,693
I mean, we don't know
how much it will be worth yet.

286
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,797
Besides, my husband is
the Special Inspector of Cheongsu County.

287
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:37,965
So this is only natural.

288
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,502
Indeed, you are saving Cheongsu County.

289
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:46,773
No, it is the real Lady Tae Young
who is saving Cheongsu County.

290
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,609
What do you mean by that?

291
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,746
The aloe was brought here
by the lady herself.

292
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,083
I see.

293
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,587
I will return with good news.

294
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:01,922
Please be careful.

295
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:05,158
- Here.
- Yes.

296
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,728
Make sure to cover yourself well.

297
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,163
Do not let the Lord see you, okay?

298
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:13,934
If he sees his son back from the dead,
he might just follow you to the grave.

299
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:14,868
My goodness.

300
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,970
It has been so long,
this feels so suffocating now.

301
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,338
I will wear it later.

302
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:22,609
Honestly, why go all the way to Hanyang?

303
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,512
Don't worry, Miss.
No one recognized them. It is fine.

304
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,181
I thought I would never be able
to go there again.

305
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,050
Thinking about it makes me excited.

306
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,786
That excitement is
because you are going with me.

307
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,354
That might be true.

308
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,523
Are you sure you two will be okay?

309
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,025
Why not take Man Seok along?

310
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,027
Have a nice trip, just the two of you.

311
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:41,862
We do not really need Man Seok.

312
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,532
But I would like to take
Man Seok's bundle along.

313
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,466
Yes.

314
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,671
I cannot understand what you are saying.

315
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,840
- Well...
- Here.

316
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,107
Yes?

317
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,412
We are talking about this
and the money in here.

318
00:17:58,412 --> 00:17:59,913
How did you know about this?

319
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,748
Everyone knows about it.

320
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:04,084
The whole village knows.

321
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,552
Just give me a little,
since it is exposed.

322
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,288
No way. I need this
for something important.

323
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,891
Come on, just a little. So stingy.

324
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:14,528
Instead, I will give you a hug.

325
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:15,495
Have a safe trip.

326
00:18:16,897 --> 00:18:17,865
Okay, I will.

327
00:18:18,232 --> 00:18:19,433
Take care of yourself.

328
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,434
I knew it. No way.

329
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,336
No way. That is not happening.

330
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:24,972
This is really not happening.
I knew you would do this.

331
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,673
No. Why are you doing this?

332
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:27,708
We will go now.

333
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,343
Why have you become so petty lately?

334
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,879
Would giving a little
mess up your plans?

335
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:35,048
Not a single pun can be spared.
This money is perfectly allocated.

336
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:37,117
My goodness.

337
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:42,723
Everyone, it may be tough,
but let us pick up the pace.

338
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,691
Repeat after me.

339
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,394
We are the best.

340
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,863
- We are the best.
- The best.

341
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:52,266
We are amazing.

342
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,735
- We are amazing.
- Amazing.

343
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:57,204
I feel like I have heard this
somewhere before.

344
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,605
It has become quite the catchphrase.

345
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:04,077
Don't plant it too deeply.

346
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:07,281
Space them out like this.

347
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,850
Leave room for new shoots to grow.

348
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,287
The Chief Lady and her husband
are working hard.

349
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,723
Indeed, they are doing an excellent job.

350
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:19,426
But how much water
does this need, Madam?

351
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,428
Water? Well...

352
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:26,433
Mak Sim, how do we water it?

353
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,267
Yes.

354
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,071
If it is too damp, the roots will rot.

355
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:33,707
Press with your finger like this,

356
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,978
and if the surface feels dry,
that is when you water it, okay?

357
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,179
Okay.

358
00:19:39,413 --> 00:19:40,914
So, about watering...

359
00:19:41,949 --> 00:19:42,783
Like this...

360
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,118
You do it like what she just said.

361
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,253
Yes.

362
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,121
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

363
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:49,623
Seven years ago,

364
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:54,161
if you had sold me at the slave market,
what would have happened?

365
00:19:56,697 --> 00:19:58,465
She is still holding a grudge.

366
00:19:58,765 --> 00:19:59,833
Mak Sim.

367
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,302
Wait, where are you going?
You need to take responsibility.

368
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,937
Teach me properly before you go.

369
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:09,142
Mother, please step back.
You may get hurt.

370
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,412
It is my land.
Why so much talk about me tending it?

371
00:20:14,248 --> 00:20:15,549
Do you know who I am?

372
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,084
My goodness.

373
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,020
Is her senility getting worse?

374
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,955
She cannot even recognize
her own son now.

375
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:24,258
Earlier, she thought
I was her runaway husband

376
00:20:24,258 --> 00:20:25,659
and hit me.

377
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:26,627
Huh?

378
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:30,230
Grandma, this is not your land.

379
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,166
It belongs to all of us
in Cheongsu County.

380
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,702
Nonsense.

381
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:38,138
This is my land, you brat.

382
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:40,040
You foolish Chief.

383
00:20:40,274 --> 00:20:41,575
My goodness.

384
00:20:42,476 --> 00:20:44,845
Is she truly senile

385
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:46,680
or just pretending?

386
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:06,834
Tae Young.

387
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:09,603
How have you been?

388
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:11,672
I have missed you so much.

389
00:21:11,672 --> 00:21:14,107
Is the water in Hanyang better
than in Cheongsu County?

390
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,776
Your face looks so radiant.

391
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,246
Come, let me show you around the house.

392
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:22,115
Should we hug too?

393
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,283
- Shall we?
- Yes.

394
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:29,990
- My brother!
- You are heavy, let go!

395
00:21:33,327 --> 00:21:36,630
Why not send someone
instead of coming all the way yourself?

396
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:40,534
When she misses her that much,
we have to visit.

397
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:44,404
By the way, you seem to
have grown more robust.

398
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:46,707
It must be the power of authority.

399
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:50,043
I am the Special Inspector
of Cheongsu County's Yuhyangso.

400
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:52,880
How is Cheongsu County?

401
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:56,116
I am sorry for not being of any help.

402
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,284
Not at all.

403
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:59,720
Thanks to you,
we now have the Inspector General.

404
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,591
It seems Mi Ryeong feeds Do Gyeom well.

405
00:22:04,591 --> 00:22:06,126
He looks taller every time I see him.

406
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,997
It must be because of your wife's love
that you have grown so much.

407
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,966
Well then, I may grow a bit taller yet.

408
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:14,468
- Oh my.
- Let us go inside.

409
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,870
All this sweetness is making me cringe.

410
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:23,377
Oh my.

411
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,981
Was the journey here very hard on you?

412
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:29,850
Why so many sighs?

413
00:22:31,318 --> 00:22:33,220
How could I not sigh?

414
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:35,422
Two blankets?

415
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:39,426
I thought we might
actually sleep together tonight.

416
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,296
Sleeping separately helps you recover
from a long journey.

417
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:43,864
That is why they arranged it.

418
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:47,167
Yes, let us sleep separately
and rest well.

419
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,002
I am just so exhausted.

420
00:22:51,138 --> 00:22:52,706
Are you too tired?

421
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:55,709
I am not that tired.

422
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,712
Why? Do you want to do something?

423
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:01,915
It is not something to do.

424
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,718
There is somewhere I want to go.

425
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,688
Right now?

426
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,564
Mother.

427
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,834
You must have been so lonely.

428
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:25,372
I am sorry for coming after so long.

429
00:23:27,975 --> 00:23:31,345
This here is my husband.

430
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,382
I wanted to show him to you and boast.

431
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:42,923
I apologize for marrying your daughter
without permission.

432
00:23:43,323 --> 00:23:48,028
I promise to support, protect,

433
00:23:49,396 --> 00:23:50,697
and love her for life.

434
00:24:12,352 --> 00:24:15,355
Why are we heading this way?
Is it not the other path?

435
00:24:15,355 --> 00:24:16,423
Since we are here,

436
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:19,593
though we cannot meet your father,

437
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:22,529
I thought perhaps we could visit
near his home.

438
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,998
I see.

439
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:45,752
(In Mourning)

440
00:24:54,895 --> 00:24:56,330
He passed away?

441
00:24:58,432 --> 00:25:01,902
I momentarily forgot how much sacrifice

442
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,472
Yun Gyeom has endured.

443
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:06,673
For fear

444
00:25:08,075 --> 00:25:10,244
that you and I might feel guilty,

445
00:25:11,478 --> 00:25:13,914
he could not mourn properly.

446
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:18,452
I will go and offer my condolences.

447
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:35,035
I did not come to be thanked.

448
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:37,804
I came because I missed you.

449
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:42,342
I have always regretted
having been so cruel to you.

450
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,844
I hoped you would kowtow.

451
00:26:12,172 --> 00:26:14,741
(Song Byeong Geun's Spirit)

452
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,685
Let us do it together.

453
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:27,054
How could I...

454
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:35,355
What is this?

455
00:27:36,056 --> 00:27:38,025
A talisman to ward off misfortune.

456
00:27:38,892 --> 00:27:42,429
I heard rumors of a strange disease
spreading near the capital.

457
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,800
Keep it with you at all times,
just in case, Father.

458
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,701
Okay.

459
00:27:48,435 --> 00:27:51,271
You should also avoid going out.

460
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,407
And do not let Jun Beom go outside.

461
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:57,144
Starting today,

462
00:27:58,078 --> 00:27:59,813
leave meals outside my door.

463
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,948
Huh?

464
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:04,651
It is better to be cautious, right?

465
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:06,820
But...

466
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:11,124
Okay.

467
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,868
(Aloe)

468
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,806
Given Joseon's unpredictable weather,

469
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:28,509
how have you created
a stable growing environment?

470
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,777
Cheongsu County's climate and soil

471
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:33,013
seem suitable for aloe to thrive.

472
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:35,816
The product is good,

473
00:28:36,917 --> 00:28:38,352
but how much are you asking?

474
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,787
Please, state your price first.

475
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:43,957
I cannot offer more
than ten taels per jin.

476
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:49,930
That is acceptable. Let us proceed.

477
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,466
But I have one condition.

478
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,738
So, what happened?

479
00:28:57,738 --> 00:29:00,741
Do not worry about disappointing me,
just be honest.

480
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,876
No need to drag it out.

481
00:29:05,112 --> 00:29:06,213
Well then,

482
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:09,049
we settled on ten taels per jin of aloe.

483
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:09,917
Yes.

484
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:13,220
We estimated a harvest
of 2000 jin by next year.

485
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,823
Under an exclusive contract,
we received 30 percent

486
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:18,358
of 20,000 taels upfront.

487
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:21,795
So what does that mean?
Is the deal finalized or not?

488
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:24,665
So how much is it exactly?

489
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:26,400
Does that mean you got 6,000 taels?

490
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:28,335
How much?

491
00:29:28,702 --> 00:29:30,103
6000 taels, which is thirty percent.

492
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,710
The remaining 14,000 taels

493
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,079
will be paid after next year's harvest.

494
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:41,849
We plan to distribute
the 6,000 taels fairly.

495
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:45,919
This should help the villagers
pay off some of their debts.

496
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,388
Yes, and with next year's balance,

497
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:50,424
we should cover the fraud losses.

498
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:53,894
That is not all. With annual harvests,

499
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:55,762
Cheongsu County is now

500
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:58,298
on its way to prosperity.

501
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,469
Chief, then,

502
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:06,440
I will count the 6,000 taels myself
to make sure it is correct.

503
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,543
Don't. I can count it myself.

504
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:13,146
I will count it myself this time.

505
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,616
Here.

506
00:30:15,616 --> 00:30:16,750
Thank you, Master.

507
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:18,785
Here.

508
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:24,024
Use this only to
pay off your debts first.

509
00:30:24,591 --> 00:30:26,560
We must nurture
next year's crop carefully

510
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,530
as if it were your own child.
Understood?

511
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,631
Yes.

512
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:33,600
If we fail to keep the agreement,
we must repay double.

513
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,636
So take great care in cultivation.

514
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,704
Of course, don't worry.

515
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:42,075
I will put my heart
into growing this crop properly.

516
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:43,477
Good.

517
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,746
We were nearly starving
and out on the streets.

518
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:47,114
I am truly grateful.

519
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,684
Remember, this is all thanks to me.

520
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,886
Mother, why are you like this again?

521
00:30:52,886 --> 00:30:57,024
What do you mean?
It's the land I inherited from my father.

522
00:30:57,591 --> 00:30:59,526
Okay, I see.

523
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,095
Here, thank you.

524
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,931
Here you go.

525
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,799
Thank you so much.

526
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,970
If this had not worked out,
I was planning to flee in the night.

527
00:31:10,671 --> 00:31:12,506
What do you mean, flee in the night?

528
00:31:12,506 --> 00:31:15,876
I was ready to kill myself
and end it all.

529
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,478
Here, you take this too.

530
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:21,648
Thank you so much, Chief.

531
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:25,152
- Please accept our respect.
- No.

532
00:31:25,152 --> 00:31:26,486
All of this is thanks to

533
00:31:27,788 --> 00:31:29,690
- our amazing Special Inspector Seong.
- Me?

534
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:34,828
Special Inspector Seong is
the most amazing, he is the best.

535
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:36,563
Please, stop it already.

536
00:31:38,131 --> 00:31:39,166
That is right.

537
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,336
It is all thanks
to the handsome Special Inspector.

538
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,839
Now Grandma seems to
have her senses back.

539
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:46,940
What about me?

540
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,342
You are second.

541
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,879
Indeed, all of this is

542
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:54,314
thanks to our wonderful, handsome lord.

543
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,949
Stop it, everyone.

544
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:58,418
You are the best Special Inspector
of Cheongsu County.

545
00:31:58,418 --> 00:31:59,486
The best.

546
00:31:59,486 --> 00:32:01,822
Hail to the Special Inspector!

547
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:03,924
Hail!

548
00:32:03,924 --> 00:32:06,493
- Hail to the Special Inspector!
- Hail!

549
00:32:06,493 --> 00:32:08,195
That is enough. Stop.

550
00:32:31,518 --> 00:32:34,855
I have never seen my husband
so happy before.

551
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:38,792
Even when Woongyi passed the state exam,
he was not this happy.

552
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,230
I used to dream every night
of people beating me to death.

553
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,401
Now, I can finally sleep peacefully
with my legs stretched out.

554
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:54,141
I...

555
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,444
sincerely...

556
00:32:58,445 --> 00:32:59,713
thank you.

557
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:02,216
It is nothing.

558
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:06,453
It was thanks to your care
for the aloe fields.

559
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:12,326
I will never forget this kindness
and will make sure to repay it.

560
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:17,097
Now, I must tell you something.

561
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:20,167
Please take the role

562
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:23,470
of Chair Lady.

563
00:33:25,772 --> 00:33:26,673
Me?

564
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:28,876
Yes, Chair Lady.

565
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:32,913
Please take care
of the Cheongsu Academy.

566
00:33:36,283 --> 00:33:37,317
Madam.

567
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,629
Two glasses seemed fine for you.

568
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:53,767
I will drink slowly.
You may drink as much as you like.

569
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,411
It looks like you have something to say.

570
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:12,119
Shall we be honest with each other?

571
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:17,424
Are you saying you have not been honest
until now?

572
00:34:17,424 --> 00:34:18,559
Honestly,

573
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:22,429
I feel a bit regretful.

574
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,832
About what?

575
00:34:26,967 --> 00:34:29,870
About leaving the troupe.

576
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,107
My goodness.

577
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:36,610
And you pretended otherwise.

578
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,313
I just felt

579
00:34:39,313 --> 00:34:42,149
a slight regret about certain aspects.

580
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:44,251
What aspects, exactly?

581
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,354
Faces.

582
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:50,190
- Faces?
- Yes.

583
00:34:50,524 --> 00:34:54,094
Seeing my performance made people
forget their sorrows and feel happy.

584
00:34:54,695 --> 00:34:56,496
Not seeing those faces anymore.

585
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:59,099
That is the one thing I regret.

586
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:04,271
But today, I saw it.

587
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:09,877
People smiling, happy, and joyful
while looking at me.

588
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,114
It was not so different.

589
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:18,185
Chon Seung Hwi brought joy as an artist.

590
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,722
Seong Yun Gyeom brings joy
as a Special Inspector.

591
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:26,460
I now understand
why you help people so much.

592
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:31,064
I finally feel

593
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:33,901
like we are truly one, Tae Young.

594
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:40,040
Then,

595
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,612
shall we

596
00:35:48,482 --> 00:35:49,783
use

597
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,386
just one blanket now?

598
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:31,825
Have I ever told you

599
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:34,661
how much I love you?

600
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:37,798
You have never said it before.

601
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:40,300
But I already know.

602
00:39:04,378 --> 00:39:05,812
Move aside.

603
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:08,215
Move aside.

604
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:22,596
What is he doing?

605
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:25,299
Let him be.
He is deeply engrossed in his research.

606
00:39:25,933 --> 00:39:26,767
Research?

607
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:30,470
Elder Master suggested
we process aloe scraps

608
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,638
to sell.

609
00:39:31,638 --> 00:39:33,974
Stay down, or it will all fall.

610
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,311
At this rate,
Cheongsu County will become rich.

611
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,313
Just watch,

612
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:41,648
I will turn Cheongsu County
into an aloe village

613
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:44,017
- and hold annual festivals.
- Festivals?

614
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:47,054
I told you not to get up.
These Sweethearts never listen to...

615
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,555
Honey, lie down now.

616
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:50,824
My goodness, honey.
Lying down when it is not even night?

617
00:39:50,824 --> 00:39:52,693
Does it matter if it is day
or night when lying down?

618
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:58,198
Master!

619
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:00,000
Madam!

620
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,235
What is it?

621
00:40:01,635 --> 00:40:03,737
The land where we planted the aloe.

622
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:06,840
Oh, what about the land?

623
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,410
It seems someone else owns the land.

624
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,380
What should I do now?

625
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,314
What?

626
00:40:18,952 --> 00:40:22,523
This is the reclamation permit

627
00:40:22,523 --> 00:40:23,991
granted to Solgae two years ago.

628
00:40:25,192 --> 00:40:28,061
And here is the issuance record
from the office.

629
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,268
How could someone with no ties
to Cheongsu County obtain

630
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:37,404
a permit for such barren land?

631
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:40,807
Lord Bak Jun Gi's main residence is
near Chunyi County.

632
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:42,976
He must have noticed it

633
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,912
while passing by with him.

634
00:40:44,912 --> 00:40:47,214
Are you saying he is
one of Lord Bak Jun Gi's men?

635
00:40:48,148 --> 00:40:51,051
He obtained a permit two years ago.

636
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:52,786
Why didn't he develop the land?

637
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:54,121
You know the law.

638
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:57,624
You have as long as three years
to develop the land.

639
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:00,627
I was just about to check for owners

640
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:03,297
and issue a permit,

641
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:04,698
but this is unfortunate.

642
00:41:05,265 --> 00:41:08,769
Since the land is already cultivated
and planted,

643
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:10,604
you may continue growing your crops.

644
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:14,575
However, let us split the profits,
80 to 20.

645
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:17,144
Wait a moment. Who gets the 80?

646
00:41:17,144 --> 00:41:19,446
Obviously, we do.

647
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,281
Unbelievable.
I knew it would come to this.

648
00:41:21,281 --> 00:41:22,950
Look at them scheming to take advantage.

649
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,652
This is a fair offer,
so let us consider it agreed.

650
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,155
Fair? If it is so fair, you take the 20.

651
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:29,890
This is ridiculous.

652
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,073
No wonder the Magistrate
kept delaying the permit.

653
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:50,377
My husband visited every day,
asking for the permit.

654
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,446
But they kept saying there were
too many documents to handle

655
00:41:52,446 --> 00:41:53,780
and to start cultivation first.

656
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,816
They assured us the permit
would be no problem.

657
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:59,119
We began quickly
to meet the harvest deadline.

658
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,589
What do we do now?
Are we really going to lose the land?

659
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:06,727
The Magistrate has decided,
so there is no alternative.

660
00:42:07,127 --> 00:42:08,428
Just in case,

661
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,831
I asked Goo to look
for the land documents.

662
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:14,268
That old woman's claims
cannot be trusted. She is senile.

663
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:16,303
Should we consider moving the crops?

664
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:19,106
If we replant now, will it be too late?

665
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,974
If we break the contract
with the herbalist,

666
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:22,709
we will owe double the payment.
Do you realize that?

667
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:27,514
But the permit issued to Solgae
was forged, right?

668
00:42:27,714 --> 00:42:29,183
We strongly suspect so.

669
00:42:29,183 --> 00:42:32,553
I will kill that scoundrel
and die myself.

670
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:35,789
Please calm down.

671
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,593
What if we appeal
to the Provincial Governor?

672
00:42:39,593 --> 00:42:41,128
The Yuhyangso can do that.

673
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:44,231
But that would also require evidence.

674
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,332
That 20 percent.

675
00:42:45,332 --> 00:42:47,267
Wouldn't taking that 20 percent

676
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,837
help with the immediate crisis?

677
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:51,605
My goodness.

678
00:42:51,605 --> 00:42:53,407
It is there!

679
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:55,576
It is there!

680
00:42:55,576 --> 00:42:56,510
What is there?

681
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,345
The land document exists!

682
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,714
What? That old woman was
telling the truth?

683
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:02,514
Yes, she is rushing
to the government office

684
00:43:02,515 --> 00:43:03,917
with the document right now.

685
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,719
Quick, you should go too.

686
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,054
Let us go.

687
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,427
How dare you bring
a forged document here?

688
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,229
They are not forged.

689
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:18,265
The Legal Advocate asked me
to look for it.

690
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:21,668
How could a nonexistent document
suddenly appear?

691
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:22,569
Beat him up.

692
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,774
Why are you hitting my son?

693
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:28,909
This old woman!

694
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:31,111
- Mother.
- What is the meaning of this?

695
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,114
Stand back.

696
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:37,885
The Special Inspector is here.
Show proper respect.

697
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:52,833
Die! Just die!

698
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:00,941
Let go! I said let go!

699
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:01,975
Darn it.

700
00:44:02,709 --> 00:44:03,577
Let go.

701
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:12,219
The land is mine,
given to me by my father.

702
00:44:12,486 --> 00:44:16,490
I fought against enemies to protect it.

703
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,492
- Okay, calm down.
- How could you do this?

704
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:19,826
How can you be like this?

705
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:22,596
What is wrong with this?
I am the Magistrate.

706
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,799
So, are you going
to take the beating instead?

707
00:44:26,233 --> 00:44:27,868
Yun Gyeom.

708
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,483
This land is mine,
given to me by my father.

709
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:47,821
I fought against enemies to protect it.

710
00:44:49,223 --> 00:44:51,124
"Fought to protect it."

711
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:11,845
Goo cannot walk anymore.

712
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,516
He cannot even stand up now.

713
00:45:15,516 --> 00:45:17,184
That man, even back then,

714
00:45:17,651 --> 00:45:20,153
took pleasure in beating his servants.

715
00:45:20,153 --> 00:45:21,188
Then

716
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:25,158
did he also beat our Madam?

717
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:26,460
Do you think he just beat her?

718
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,629
He even pulled out all her hair.

719
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,499
And Madam's mother

720
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:36,803
was buried alive for being old and sick.

721
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:58,192
Are you okay?

722
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:02,429
We might be able to appeal
to the Provincial Governor.

723
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:03,330
Yes?

724
00:46:07,367 --> 00:46:08,969
There are rumors of an epidemic

725
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:11,338
and people are desperately seeking
herbal remedies.

726
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:16,710
How are the aloe fields
in Cheongsu County progressing?

727
00:46:17,744 --> 00:46:18,879
Well,

728
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,349
Ok Tae Young has filed an appeal

729
00:46:23,183 --> 00:46:24,918
and we have received summons.

730
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,791
Handle it as we prepared.

731
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:32,025
Yes.

732
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:58,085
Is that not the Legal Advocate Veteran?

733
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:02,422
Are they all legal advocates over there?
Why are there so many?

734
00:47:02,789 --> 00:47:05,626
It shows how valuable
the aloe must be to them.

735
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:15,169
The Civil Document will now begin.

736
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,953
I am Ok Tae Young,
representing the petitioner.

737
00:47:33,854 --> 00:47:37,858
The people of Cheongsu County
jointly reclaimed wasteland,

738
00:47:37,858 --> 00:47:39,860
but the first ruling declared it
to belong to Solgae.

739
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:43,530
We appeal this decision
and request a retrial.

740
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,432
What grounds do you have
for this appeal?

741
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:53,340
This is a division document
from 48 years ago

742
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,342
given as a dowry
when Kim here got married.

743
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:57,811
Why was this document
not presented earlier?

744
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:01,415
It was submitted late but was dismissed.

745
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:04,151
My Lord, the document's
credibility is questionable.

746
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:06,086
It lacks verification from witnesses
or records

747
00:48:06,086 --> 00:48:07,955
and dates back decades.

748
00:48:07,955 --> 00:48:10,991
They cultivated the land without a permit
and suddenly claimed ownership

749
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:13,227
producing a previously unseen document.

750
00:48:13,227 --> 00:48:16,129
I suspect forgery
and request a thorough examination.

751
00:48:21,502 --> 00:48:22,903
The land planted with aloe

752
00:48:22,903 --> 00:48:25,672
was previously undeveloped wasteland.

753
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:29,076
So even Kim couldn't
do anything with it.

754
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:32,913
But as soon as it was cultivated
and aloe was planted,

755
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,883
Solgae, who has no ties
to Cheongsu County, appeared.

756
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:38,485
Isn't that suspicious in itself?

757
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,989
Those scoundrels.

758
00:48:42,356 --> 00:48:43,557
Our legal advocate is doing well.

759
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:46,493
Are you certain the land was given
to you by your father?

760
00:48:46,493 --> 00:48:47,694
Yes.

761
00:48:47,694 --> 00:48:50,364
Absolutely, it is mine.

762
00:48:50,364 --> 00:48:53,367
No, it belongs to Cheongsu County.

763
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:55,969
We even received aloe for free.

764
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:58,772
Do you think I would let go
of this wretched land?

765
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,407
My Lord.

766
00:49:00,407 --> 00:49:03,443
Kim over there, who claims ownership
of the land, is senile.

767
00:49:03,443 --> 00:49:06,180
How can her testimony
be considered credible?

768
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,347
My Lord.

769
00:49:07,347 --> 00:49:08,715
This is a medical report

770
00:49:08,715 --> 00:49:11,752
stating that years ago,
she was diagnosed as mentally unsound

771
00:49:11,752 --> 00:49:13,353
provided by a physician.

772
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,596
I have additional evidence to verify

773
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:25,632
the credibility
of the division document.

774
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,609
My Lord, I request a brief recess.

775
00:49:42,249 --> 00:49:45,219
Even if we lose this time,
we will take it to the Supreme Court.

776
00:49:45,552 --> 00:49:48,789
That way, the land will be frozen,
and no one can use it.

777
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:52,826
Are you proposing a settlement?

778
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:54,595
Let us go with a 50 to 50 split.

779
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,099
Give us 20 more instead.

780
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:03,837
Or add ten to make it 60 to 40.

781
00:50:06,974 --> 00:50:08,008
Well, I...

782
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,977
I trust you will make a wise decision

783
00:50:09,977 --> 00:50:12,012
for the best interest of the people.

784
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:25,526
Submit additional evidence to verify
the testimony of Kim Kyung Sim

785
00:50:25,526 --> 00:50:26,827
and the credibility
of the division document.

786
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:32,900
This is a ruling document

787
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,235
acknowledging ownership of the land

788
00:50:35,235 --> 00:50:37,604
won by Kim in a lawsuit
with her siblings.

789
00:50:40,574 --> 00:50:43,477
It predates the permit
granted to Solgae.

790
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:47,514
Are there existing lawsuit records
for this land?

791
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:50,450
Yes.

792
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,652
But even if that is true,

793
00:50:51,652 --> 00:50:54,788
how does the legal advocate possess
this ruling document?

794
00:50:54,788 --> 00:50:58,659
It was transcribed
by my late father-in-law,

795
00:50:59,426 --> 00:51:01,528
Seong Gyu Jin, who was the Magistrate
of Cheongsu County.

796
00:51:05,265 --> 00:51:08,769
While serving as Magistrate
of Cheongsu County,

797
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:10,137
Seong Gyu Jin feared

798
00:51:10,571 --> 00:51:13,240
that court rulings might be destroyed
by fire or otherwise damaged.

799
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,675
So even while performing his duties,

800
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:17,044
he took time to transcribe
older court rulings.

801
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,517
When Kim said she fought
to protect the land,

802
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:25,819
I wondered if any heirlooms might remain

803
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:29,056
and fortunately,
I found this in the study.

804
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,626
My Lord.

805
00:51:32,893 --> 00:51:34,328
The original document

806
00:51:34,328 --> 00:51:37,064
should be stored
in the Cheongsu County archives.

807
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:38,098
Please compare them.

808
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:42,636
Go to Cheongsu County now

809
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,072
and bring back
the original court record.

810
00:51:51,712 --> 00:51:55,382
The opposing party acknowledges
the evidence's credibility and concedes.

811
00:51:55,382 --> 00:51:56,517
What? Are you out of your...

812
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,285
Cheongsu County's former Magistrate

813
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,787
appears unaware
and issued the cultivation permit.

814
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:03,790
The opposing party, Solgae,
relinquishes the land

815
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:04,992
and withdraws.

816
00:52:05,792 --> 00:52:06,727
That is right.

817
00:52:07,661 --> 00:52:10,731
Since the opposing party
has withdrawn the lawsuit,

818
00:52:10,731 --> 00:52:12,432
the aloe field of Cheongsu County

819
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,234
is ruled to belong to Kim Kyung Sim.

820
00:52:15,002 --> 00:52:17,037
That's great.

821
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,410
We won.

822
00:52:29,616 --> 00:52:31,051
We won.

823
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:40,761
The next concerns the impeachment

824
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:43,397
of Magistrate Kim Nak Soo
of Cheongsu County.

825
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,267
Me?

826
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,021
Cha Chun Sik, the Chief
of Cheongsu County's Yuhyangso

827
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:10,858
and Special Inspector Seong Yun Gyeom,
along with 19 others

828
00:53:11,592 --> 00:53:14,528
formally accuse Kim Nak Soo
of illegal acts

829
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:19,466
and petition for strict
disciplinary action under the law.

830
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:23,637
On what grounds is he being impeached?

831
00:53:23,804 --> 00:53:24,872
Kim Nak Soo

832
00:53:25,772 --> 00:53:28,041
ignored the plight of the people,

833
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:30,811
turned a blind eye to their suffering,

834
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:33,780
and engaged in relentless exploitation.

835
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,018
That is all a misunderstanding.

836
00:53:39,486 --> 00:53:40,654
Continue.

837
00:53:44,091 --> 00:53:46,636
This is a sample
of Kim Nak Soo's handwriting

838
00:53:46,637 --> 00:53:47,895
provided by the government office.

839
00:53:48,562 --> 00:53:52,132
Please compare it to Solgae's documents.

840
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:09,683
Not only were Solgae's documents forged

841
00:54:09,683 --> 00:54:12,252
but even the issuance records
were falsified.

842
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:17,090
Officers from the government office
are prepared to testify to this.

843
00:54:18,759 --> 00:54:19,826
You scoundrels.

844
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:21,562
My Lord.

845
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:25,265
This is baseless slander and fabrication

846
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:27,668
daring to accuse a Magistrate!

847
00:54:27,668 --> 00:54:28,902
As a Magistrate,

848
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:32,039
you should fear, care for,

849
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:34,007
and love the people.

850
00:54:34,007 --> 00:54:37,144
Instead, you cut off tongues, broke legs

851
00:54:37,144 --> 00:54:38,378
and buried people alive.

852
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,385
Kim Nak Soo has subjected
even the people

853
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:47,888
of Cheongsu County
to violence and cruelty.

854
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:51,558
Goo, beaten nearly to death
in front of his mother

855
00:54:55,596 --> 00:54:56,964
will now spend his life

856
00:54:57,898 --> 00:55:00,234
limping forever.

857
00:55:04,538 --> 00:55:06,974
Thus, for abusing his authority

858
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:09,376
and punishing innocent people,

859
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:12,279
as well as forging official documents,

860
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:16,149
in accordance with the "Gyeongguk Statute"
and the Great Ming Code,

861
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:17,885
we petition not only for his removal

862
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:21,388
but also 100 lashes.

863
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:25,058
We petition.

864
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:27,427
We petition!

865
00:55:28,161 --> 00:55:29,830
We petition!

866
00:55:30,063 --> 00:55:31,098
Silence.

867
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:33,400
You pests.

868
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,768
In response to Yuhyangso's petition,

869
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:38,105
arrest Magistrate Kim Nak Soo
immediately

870
00:55:38,105 --> 00:55:39,439
and conduct a thorough investigation.

871
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:41,575
My Lord, this is all misunderstanding.

872
00:55:41,808 --> 00:55:44,178
Please hear me out.

873
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:46,380
Listen to my side, not just theirs...

874
00:55:47,247 --> 00:55:48,282
It is over.

875
00:55:48,615 --> 00:55:52,186
As expected, our Special Inspector Seong
is the most amazing.

876
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:53,987
He is the best.

877
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:55,622
Hail to Special Inspector Seong.

878
00:55:55,622 --> 00:55:56,823
Hail.

879
00:55:56,823 --> 00:55:59,092
- Hail.
- Hail.

880
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:03,330
- Hail.
- Hail.

881
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,335
When did you prepare all this?

882
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:12,272
Did I not say, revenge is mine?

883
00:56:26,386 --> 00:56:28,856
They could not even meet my eyes before.

884
00:56:28,856 --> 00:56:30,757
I will send a word to the Lord.

885
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:33,160
Wait.

886
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:35,896
You!

887
00:56:50,444 --> 00:56:51,712
And this is for

888
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:54,948
my mother's revenge.

889
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:07,928
Goodeoki, you wench!

890
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,866
Spare me please!

891
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,371
A sentence of 100 lashes is
like a death sentence to me.

892
00:57:17,638 --> 00:57:20,340
How could you do this to me?

893
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:46,300
Dear.

894
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:49,303
Dear.

895
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:50,804
Kim Nak Soo...

896
00:57:52,005 --> 00:57:53,607
our Master

897
00:57:54,675 --> 00:57:56,476
was arrested by the Royal Tribunal

898
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,645
and died under the lash.

899
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:00,414
Died?

900
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:01,782
Goodeoki...

901
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:05,552
Goodeoki avenged us, I guess.

902
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,805
How...

903
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:30,177
How could you just let my father
be left to die like this?

904
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,345
How could you!

905
00:58:32,713 --> 00:58:34,548
Your father brought this upon himself.

906
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:36,884
What did you say?

907
00:58:37,985 --> 00:58:39,686
Because of Ok Tae Young,
we lost the aloe

908
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,989
and the losses are immense.

909
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:47,828
You should have killed
that wench Goodeoki.

910
00:58:48,562 --> 00:58:51,532
Why do you let her live
when the evidence is clear?

911
00:58:52,232 --> 00:58:55,736
Everything must happen
at the right time.

912
00:59:13,487 --> 00:59:18,025
Why are you so worried?

913
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:22,196
It is not good for the baby
in your belly.

914
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:24,731
We should tell Do Gyeom, right?

915
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:27,201
Of course, he should hear
such happy news.

916
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:30,170
For now, keep it a secret.

917
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:33,740
Do not worry about unnecessary things.

918
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:38,245
No matter what anyone says,
you are the eldest daughter-in-law here

919
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:40,581
and Special Inspector Seong is
the Elder Master of this house.

920
00:59:47,154 --> 00:59:50,691
Think of it as receiving blessings
after all your hardships.

921
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:55,495
Go with the Elder Master and the baby,
and take a good rest.

922
00:59:55,696 --> 00:59:56,730
Understood?

923
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:09,743
You are humming. Are you that happy?

924
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:10,711
Of course.

925
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:13,747
Can you believe
I am going to be a father?

926
01:00:15,015 --> 01:00:16,683
The baby should take after their mother.

927
01:00:17,217 --> 01:00:20,954
But they say pregnant women
crave sour things.

928
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:22,990
- Yes.
- Yet all she eats is

929
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:26,894
things that I buy, peel, and roast.

930
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:31,498
It must be because our baby wants
snacks tied to family memories.

931
01:00:31,498 --> 01:00:32,733
How adorable.

932
01:00:32,733 --> 01:00:34,501
Yes, you are right.

933
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:36,403
But why did you buy this?

934
01:00:36,403 --> 01:00:39,540
People who cannot fish
always prepare their equipment first.

935
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,708
Why not just buy a boat
while you are at it?

936
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:44,945
Where would I get the money for a boat
when I cannot even afford a seaside home?

937
01:00:53,353 --> 01:00:54,254
Why?

938
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:00,427
Here.

939
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:03,463
Why? What?

940
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,932
Take it.

941
01:01:05,365 --> 01:01:06,967
- Is it for me?
- Yes.

942
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:11,138
You are giving this to me?

943
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:14,575
It is for you to buy that house.

944
01:01:17,578 --> 01:01:18,445
Wait.

945
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:22,850
So when you said you needed the money,
was it to buy me a house?

946
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:24,518
Yes.

947
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:27,087
The money you made was shared
among the performers

948
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:29,256
and your share
went to the slave hunters.

949
01:01:29,256 --> 01:01:31,024
I know you are penniless.

950
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:33,627
You.

951
01:01:35,996 --> 01:01:37,464
Inside there,

952
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:40,601
you will also find the Gat Ornaments
you entrusted to me

953
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:42,269
when you feared Madam might find out.

954
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:45,138
What? You...

955
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:48,642
- Why?
- Thank you.

956
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:49,543
Don't be like this.

957
01:01:49,543 --> 01:01:51,478
You are so sweet.
Let me give you a kiss.

958
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:52,579
What are you saying?

959
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:54,348
- I will do it more often now.
- Give it back, then.

960
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:57,851
What kiss? Give it back.
People are watching.

961
01:01:57,851 --> 01:01:59,219
Huh?

962
01:02:04,992 --> 01:02:06,927
- What is it?
- What is happening?

963
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:09,630
You must write the petition
for Scholar Jo today.

964
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,865
Then go to Deokbae's house
about Chunbong from next door...

965
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:15,969
Oh, you are supposed to be resting.
Why nag as if you are not coming back?

966
01:02:16,703 --> 01:02:19,973
I can handle office work myself.

967
01:02:19,973 --> 01:02:20,874
Don't worry.

968
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:25,212
That is right.
You have been preparing for trials,

969
01:02:25,212 --> 01:02:27,915
so why not represent as a legal advocate
for the next case?

970
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:30,584
Really? Me?

971
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,687
Of course. You will do well.

972
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:35,789
But who am I to...

973
01:02:38,225 --> 01:02:39,526
It seems Yun Gyeom has returned.

974
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:41,595
He went to buy peanuts,
but he is a bit late.

975
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:45,032
Criminals Song Seo In and Goodeoki,
get out and receive your summons.

976
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:48,936
- What are they saying?
- What do we do?

977
01:02:51,572 --> 01:02:52,973
- Kkeutdongi.
- Yes?

978
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,776
Go out through the back door
and find Yun Gyeom.

979
01:02:55,776 --> 01:02:57,177
- Huh?
- And

980
01:02:58,478 --> 01:02:59,546
show him this.

981
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:02,716
Like this?

982
01:03:02,716 --> 01:03:04,318
- Hurry.
- Yes.

983
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:17,598
I have told you already,
no such people live here.

984
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:20,434
Then are Seong Yun Gyeom
and Ok Tae Young inside?

985
01:03:21,368 --> 01:03:23,604
Why are you doing this?

986
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:27,741
Search the house immediately.

987
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:34,915
What is the meaning of this?

988
01:03:42,823 --> 01:03:44,224
Where is Song Seo In?

989
01:03:45,626 --> 01:03:47,060
Who are you referring to?

990
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:48,829
Take this woman first.

991
01:03:49,062 --> 01:03:50,797
We will find Song Seo In.

992
01:03:50,797 --> 01:03:51,832
- Yes.
- Huh?

993
01:03:51,832 --> 01:03:52,733
Take her away.

994
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,636
No. What should we do?

995
01:03:56,103 --> 01:03:57,304
- Madam.
- No.

996
01:03:57,304 --> 01:03:59,306
- Madam, wait a moment.
- Madam.

997
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:02,042
Madam.

998
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,546
- Madam.
- Madam.

999
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:22,129
Wait, what is the meaning of this?

1000
01:04:22,129 --> 01:04:23,997
On what grounds are you taking her away?

1001
01:04:23,997 --> 01:04:26,333
This is a matter of the Royal Tribunal.
Step aside.

1002
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,869
What is going on?

1003
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:31,104
Legal Advocate Ok.

1004
01:04:31,672 --> 01:04:33,040
Legal...

1005
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:38,645
Elder Master, no.

1006
01:04:38,645 --> 01:04:40,180
You promised.

1007
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,125
No.

1008
01:04:55,963 --> 01:04:57,531
If I send this signal,

1009
01:04:58,265 --> 01:05:02,035
you must escape with Man Seok
without looking back, Yun Gyeom.

1010
01:05:03,003 --> 01:05:05,205
How can I leave without you?

1011
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,876
That is the only way for me to live
and for everyone to survive.

1012
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:13,547
What must you do when you see this?

1013
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:09,069
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1014
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:12,172
When a band of thieves killed everyone,

1015
01:06:12,172 --> 01:06:14,341
she decided to assume the identity
of Ok Tae Young.

1016
01:06:14,341 --> 01:06:16,143
She came to Cheongsu County

1017
01:06:16,143 --> 01:06:18,011
and lived as Ok Tae Young
for nine years.

1018
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:21,048
He won't get caught, right?

1019
01:06:21,381 --> 01:06:24,084
What happens if he does?

1020
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:24,918
He dies.

1021
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:28,455
After the investigation is complete,
you bring new evidence?

1022
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:31,959
Your every word has lost credibility
with me.

1023
01:06:32,893 --> 01:06:36,496
The slave Goodeoki is clearly guilty
of harming her master and fleeing.

1024
01:06:37,097 --> 01:06:40,300
And she is guilty of impersonating
the noble Ok Tae Young.

1025
01:06:41,134 --> 01:06:43,003
Welcome home, Goodeoki.
