1
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:03,063
Are you sure that was your husband?
Are you sure you were not mistaken?

2
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,149
<i>Dearest!</i>

3
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,281
<i>Our eyes met, and he recognized me.</i>

4
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,536
<i>Then why…</i>

5
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,997
Why that bastard.

6
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,543
How could he do that?

7
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,464
He is clearly doing just fine.

8
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,427
How could he not write me a single letter?

9
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,514
Listen, Goo-deok.

10
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,391
Although he always put the great cause
before his family,

11
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,894
saying it was
more important than just a family,

12
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,729
so I endured through it all.

13
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,275
Because I am nothing but a lowly slave…

14
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,280
I felt like I had no right.

15
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,202
So I did not look for him and just waited.

16
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,000
But he left me again.

17
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,527
What is it?

18
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,281
Do I look all right?

19
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,741
Yes.

20
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,536
Can you do me a favor, Man-seok?

21
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,955
Please do not tell him
about what happened today.

22
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,791
Unbelievable.

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,501
All right.

24
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,753
Let us go.

25
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,240
Director Chon.

26
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,327
Why did you come here?
I told you to just leave me alone.

27
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,040
Hey, you should speak to him.
I will leave.

28
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,840
It is me.

29
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,402
I thought I was dreaming.

30
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,865
Are you doing well? Are you happy?

31
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:05,578
Yes.

32
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,665
I am glad to hear that.

33
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,333
So…

34
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,922
Right, I should not act like this.

35
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,426
I apologize for my bad manners, my lady.

36
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,011
Man-seok.

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,221
Man-seok, come here!

38
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,685
You should spend some quality time alone.
Why did you call me?

39
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,144
Men and women must be separate.

40
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,689
How can I speak face to face
with a nobleman's wife?

41
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,276
Then what do you want me to do?
Put a blind between you two?

42
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,903
Want an introduction?
Please say hello.

43
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,323
This is Director Chon
of the Yudam Artist Group.

44
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,910
This is Lady Legal Advocate
who came here from Cheongsu County

45
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,537
to save you, Director.

46
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,919
So, did you bring her here?

47
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:58,339
This place is close to Hanyang,
so it could put her in danger.

48
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,508
So why did you have to
stay locked up and act so stubborn?

49
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,220
In a few days comes
our first performance in two years.

50
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,014
We cannot let that go to waste.

51
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,100
You money crazy scoundrel.

52
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,728
Then what? Do you plan on
staying there your whole life?

53
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,146
And in this state?

54
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,565
- This state?
- Yes, this state. This ugly state.

55
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,692
Come here. Why you…

56
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,944
They said they would let it go

57
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,739
if you compensated for it
and begged on your knees.

58
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,657
Why are you being so stubborn?

59
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,200
Why should I kneel?

60
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,745
He is the one who stole my soul!

61
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,039
Stole it? What does he mean?

62
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,583
He is saying
that the man stole the book he wrote.

63
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,460
<i>A Government Officer And A Woman.</i>

64
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,587
<i>A Government Officer And A Woman?</i>

65
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,006
The book written
by the new novelist Seol-rang?

66
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,299
That…

67
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,427
I wrote that book.

68
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,721
I wrote that book seven years ago.

69
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,892
So tell her that means
<i>A Government Officer And A Woman </i>is mine.

70
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,144
You heard him.

71
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:57,774
But according to the book seller,
that book is really bad.

72
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,108
That is because…

73
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,652
I did not write it.

74
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,363
I did write
<i>A Government Officer And A Woman,</i>

75
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,907
but I did not write that book.

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,327
So it is true that I wrote it,
but I did not write that book.

77
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,580
Anyway, tell her that is how things are.

78
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,583
So this is what he is saying.
There is a man called Seol-rang.

79
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,294
He stole the book that Director Chon wrote

80
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:22,131
and made it very sensual and dirty.

81
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,343
Anyway, he changed the story like that.
That is what he is saying.

82
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,513
How sensual could it be?

83
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,556
Tell her she does not need to know.

84
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,141
- Let me explain.
- Do not.

85
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,184
- You see…
- Do not.

86
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,228
Hey!

87
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,068
Hush.

88
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,696
This guy used to be a butcher
who chopped meat at the market.

89
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,407
And Director imparted his writing
and other talents to him

90
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,784
and made him his understudy.

91
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,621
But his greed made him steal the book
and caused this whole mess.

92
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,631
I am a married woman.

93
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,803
If you cross this line,
I will report you to the office.

94
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:12,432
Come now. You no longer have a husband.

95
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,102
How about I fill you with my heat?

96
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,481
All right.

97
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,151
I too have missed the touch of a man.

98
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:28,823
I would rather let you take me one night.

99
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,618
- That is it.
- Tonight, I will…

100
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,203
- Make you hot.
- …make you hot.

101
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,122
Make you hot.

102
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,919
Is he insane?

103
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,629
Wait for it.
He is about to make his appearance.

104
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,007
You crazy bastard!

105
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,763
You ungrateful bastard.

106
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,349
How dare you insult my woman?

107
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,270
That is how he ended up like this.

108
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,646
Well done.

109
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,482
I would have killed him.

110
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,947
I will find a solution.

111
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
Tell her that there is no solution.

112
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,370
Can you stop asking me
to pass things onto her?

113
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,458
How about you speak comfortably alone
while keeping your distance?

114
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,627
Why do you say there is no solution?

115
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,420
Did he steal the original copy?

116
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,131
That is right.

117
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,592
He most likely already discarded it
after stealing it.

118
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,344
So what solution could there be?

119
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,306
So you should just go back.

120
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,808
You have wasted your time, my lady.

121
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:41,771
Then, will you stay in prison
and receive your punishment?

122
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:47,443
Well, I did risk my life to help you
when you were in trouble,

123
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,904
but you do not have to
try to repay me for it.

124
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,406
Consider it repaid.

125
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,035
Since you make such a big deal about it,
I must pay you back this time.

126
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,205
It is not for your sake
but for the sake of your wife and child.

127
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,040
You have a family.

128
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,209
How can you be so irresponsible?

129
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:09,298
I have a wife and a child?

130
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,719
That is what Man-seok said…

131
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,141
Come here.

132
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,518
Come here! You little…

133
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,353
You are in prison right now.

134
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,481
Tell her the truth this instant!

135
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,817
All right. It was all a lie.

136
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,944
That was the only way you would come.

137
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,238
What you said after is a lie too?

138
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,158
That he considered Goo-deok dead,
he mourned for three years,

139
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,536
and would not even urinate
in that direction?

140
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,620
That is all a lie.

141
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,293
He has only been thinking about you,

142
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,711
and missing you.

143
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:49,755
He always talks
as though you were by his side.

144
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,257
That is enough already!

145
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,973
Why did you write a book

146
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,684
that you were not going to publish?

147
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:08,274
I wrote it to keep it in my memory.

148
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,990
I was worried that I would
forget all about it when I got old.

149
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,619
I wanted to remember it
and reminisce about it.

150
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,373
I wrote it to cherish
that memory for myself.

151
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,846
A noblewoman is a legal advocate?

152
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,015
Where did she say she was from?

153
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:45,728
I think it was some faraway countryside
called Cheongsu County.

154
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,774
By the way, are you in some kind of
relationship with that lowly storyteller?

155
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,776
Is it not obvious?

156
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,864
Did you not check his identification tag
when you arrested him?

157
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,910
You must have found out
that the imprisoned person was

158
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,871
Young Master Seo-in who is the son
of Lord Song Byeong-geun,

159
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,165
a former Gyeonggi Provincial Governor.

160
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,834
Oh, right. I did see that,

161
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,212
but he said he was not Song Seo-in.

162
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,589
He says it is not him,
so what can we do about it?

163
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,883
That identification tag
could have been forged.

164
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,387
Do you not know
what a serious offense that is?

165
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,846
If you were doubtful,

166
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,933
you should have immediately checked
whether it was forged or not.

167
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,268
Moreover, since it is
not murder or robbery,

168
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,354
he could have been bailed out.

169
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:32,149
Are you neglecting him in prison
and delaying his trial

170
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:36,529
so as to match the date in your report
to the Ministry of Punishments?

171
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,535
If Lord Song finds out that
his eldest son is suffering like this,

172
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:48,416
I am not quite sure if he will
overlook Magistrate's…

173
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,669
neglect of duty.

174
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,882
Then, how may I help him out, my lady?

175
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,725
What on earth did I do to be arrested?

176
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,812
You have been reported
for stealing Chon Seung-hwi's novel

177
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,980
and plagiarizing it.

178
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,150
What? Plagiarize? Who is this woman?

179
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,902
What on earth did I steal?

180
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,946
I present the evidence.
Please compare them.

181
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,992
This is the novel that he wrote.

182
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,869
And this is the original novel.

183
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,747
What? The original?

184
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,000
Where did you get that?

185
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:35,379
Magistrate!
That is definitely not the original!

186
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,549
How can you be sure
that it is not the original one?

187
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,884
Is it because you stole it?

188
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,970
Or is it because you got rid of it
after you stole it?

189
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,182
Well, that is…

190
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,728
After roughly comparing the evidence,

191
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:55,024
judging by the quantity and quality,
this one is the original.

192
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,360
I wrote both of those!

193
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,780
I simply adapted
the original for the stage.

194
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,242
Magistrate, I request that you make
the two of them write it again.

195
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:09,788
You may compare the newly written one
with the original copy you have.

196
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,126
Bring brush pens and paper
to these two men.

197
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,419
Yes, my lord.

198
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,173
How am I supposed to remember all of that?

199
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,091
What do you mean, how?

200
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,052
You should remember if you truly wrote it.

201
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,805
After you polished it up so much,
you must have easily memorized it.

202
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,058
Did I not teach you that

203
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,144
you must be able to
write it countless times

204
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,064
without any mistakes to make it your own?

205
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,330
If you can write it down
exactly as it is written,

206
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,958
I will apologize to you right here

207
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,919
and give you the rights to this novel.

208
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,823
How can I write this? How can I?

209
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,784
You scoundrel! You did steal his book!

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,662
Give him 30 lashes right now!

211
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,372
- Yes, my lord.
- No.

212
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,041
No!

213
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,836
No!

214
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,755
No!

215
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,469
No!

216
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,058
Gosh, I had no idea

217
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,021
that he remembered
everything in that book.

218
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,773
You know, this means
that his feelings for you

219
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,443
are what helped him save himself.

220
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,405
I know I said it,
but it sounds so romantic.

221
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,075
I will take my leave
when he comes out, Man-seok.

222
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,785
Are you really going to go back?

223
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,455
Your husband is not there anyway.

224
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,874
I have my family.

225
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,918
I am the eldest person in the family.

226
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,461
But you do not have a husband.

227
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,880
You raised your brother-in-law well.

228
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,925
Until when will you live
your sad and fake life by yourself?

229
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,427
Do I seem sad?

230
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,678
Of course.

231
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,889
Instead of the man
who did not care about you,

232
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,350
ignored you, and abandoned you
for seven years,

233
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,937
you should be with the man
who only pined for you during that time.

234
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,690
- He is coming.
- What?

235
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,900
Director.

236
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,610
You have been through so much.

237
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,029
My gosh. Are you all right?
Wait. Here you go.

238
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,198
- What is it?
- Have some of this.

239
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,743
- Tofu?
- Yes, have some.

240
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,621
Good. Take your time eating it.

241
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,124
- What is the tofu for?
- What?

242
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,460
I do not know. I felt like
people will do this one day.

243
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,544
Just have some.

244
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,965
They will collect the plagiarized copies
including the manuscripts

245
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,883
and stop them from performing it.

246
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,843
Thank you.

247
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,347
I can see the sun again
thanks to you, Lady Legal Advocate.

248
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,142
Actually, it is not just my efforts.

249
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,602
Pardon?

250
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,856
His lordship confirmed your identity.

251
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,108
Which lord…

252
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,486
Hey!

253
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,530
I told you not to do that, did I not?

254
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,574
I am Chon Seung-hwi, not Song Seo-in.
How many times must I tell you?

255
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,829
I sent him a message
before leaving Cheongsu County.

256
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,457
I was wondering
why the magistrate was groveling.

257
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,751
You are the best legal advocate.
Was that the only solution?

258
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,963
You do not have to be so upset about it.

259
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,798
All you have to do is thank Lord Song.

260
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,884
He slapped me for humiliating the family.

261
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,470
He had me released
because I might shame him again.

262
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,055
Yes, maybe I should be thankful.

263
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,932
He came here in person.

264
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,020
Do you remember Lord Cho
who is close to Lord Song?

265
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,064
His parents' home is near here,
so he is staying there.

266
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,649
So what?

267
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,613
You should visit him
and thank him. Do you not think so?

268
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,074
No, thank you.
He will have nothing nice to say to me.

269
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:17,578
He has grown old
since her ladyship passed away.

270
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,205
I do not want to go.
I will only get slapped if I go.

271
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,709
Even so, it is right
for you to go see him.

272
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:27,337
You can do what is right, my lady.
I do not want to do that.

273
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,593
I will take my leave now.

274
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,845
See her off.

275
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,639
Wait. Will you really
let her go like this?

276
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,225
- What should I do then?
- It has been seven years.

277
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,853
Then, why do you not
do something about it?

278
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,813
My gosh. Hey, you cannot leave!

279
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,732
Why not?

280
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,650
The boat has broken down.

281
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,905
It is true. The boats
that are going south are leaking,

282
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,907
so it will take a few days to fix them.

283
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,159
I know that is a lie.

284
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,535
What? I was…

285
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,166
That is what happened, apparently.

286
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,879
Come on. You must reconcile with him.

287
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,633
Nothing will happen in that countryside
because you are a couple days late.

288
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,344
Director Chon will
have a performance in a few days.

289
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,679
At least stay for that.
Just a few more days?

290
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:21,016
He is just acting out like a baby.

291
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,019
Come on. Come already.

292
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,493
Mak-sim, where did her ladyship go?

293
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:43,122
I have never seen her
leave Chungcheong Province.

294
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,873
No matter how important the case is,

295
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,917
she would send
Legal Advocate Jang instead.

296
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,961
It is none of your business.

297
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,339
It will only frustrate you
if you know about her sorrowful life.

298
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,633
Are you showing concern for my feelings?

299
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,343
My goodness. Thank you.

300
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,471
Hey, are you on a picnic or what?

301
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,682
Why did you come along
and make a fuss like this?

302
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,100
I am not making a fuss.

303
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,103
It is so dangerous these days.
How can I leave a woman alone?

304
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,730
- One is alone in life.
- Life is meant to be together.

305
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,649
Enough with the nonsense. Go home.

306
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,234
She will return in time.

307
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,153
Why do you wait for her here each day?

308
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,532
I would happily wait for her
for the rest of my life.

309
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,034
So perhaps it would be better
if she did not return.

310
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,911
What? Why would that be better?

311
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,374
Because she would only be
a lonesome widow when she returns.

312
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,418
Just like me.

313
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,879
You have me. Come over here.

314
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,797
What are you saying?

315
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,557
All right.

316
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,816
What is this?

317
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,695
You said you wanted to feel the troubles
of the people before you were appointed.

318
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,656
I gathered some lawsuits
that might help you.

319
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,326
Yes, thank you.

320
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,331
- I did not do it.
- Come. Let us see if you can lie here too.

321
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,917
Shut that mouth of yours. Quiet!

322
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,127
Can you write a written complaint for me?

323
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,379
I want to report him
to the office right now.

324
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,797
I am truly wronged.

325
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,008
Can you please be my legal advocate?

326
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,012
You see, Hong-sik here
tried to jump my sister.

327
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,973
How can you have
such a gross misunderstanding?

328
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,143
You thought she would be easy
as she is a widow.

329
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,396
How are you different
from the men who abduct widows?

330
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,234
How could you link me
with those terrible men?

331
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,027
You should speak to me.

332
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,404
Continue.

333
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,739
Last night,

334
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,617
I came home around daybreak
after helping my uncle's work.

335
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,038
That is when I saw Hong-sik
snoring next to my sister.

336
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,374
I had some rice wine, so I got confused.

337
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:53,627
If you were so honorable,
why did you climb the wall

338
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,420
instead of coming through the door?

339
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,340
That is because my wife
locks the bolt all the time.

340
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,883
That is why I climbed the wall.

341
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,760
Come now. Be quiet.

342
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,055
I will write up a complaint.
Take it to the office.

343
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,682
One moment, Young Master.

344
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,978
They seem to have a misunderstanding.
Let us show some flexibility.

345
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,605
I did not know that flexibility
preceded the law.

346
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,609
Let us proceed
after doing some investigation.

347
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,861
I am conducting
an investigation right now.

348
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,907
My…

349
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,746
Would you follow me out, please?

350
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,840
But…

351
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,843
What are you doing, my lady?

352
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,889
What are we doing
in the middle of the day--

353
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,974
Here.

354
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,478
Innkeeper, give us another rice wine.

355
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,147
Yes, my lady.

356
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,067
My goodness. What a lively young lady.

357
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,362
I hear that the <i>jeon</i> here
are so delicious.

358
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,906
Eat it up already.

359
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,702
I heard that Hong-sik is a regular here.

360
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,078
Oh, Hong-sik?

361
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,790
He practically lives here.

362
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,208
I see.

363
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,253
Since it is during the day
and there are not many customers,

364
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,881
would you have a drink and tell us more?

365
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,549
Will you buy me a drink too?

366
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,178
Of course. He will buy you a drink.
Will you not, Young Master?

367
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,890
- Thank you.
- Have as much as you want.

368
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,392
About Hong-sik…

369
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,644
Did he come here
for a drink the other night?

370
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,813
My goodness. He sure did.

371
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,107
He had four bottles that day.

372
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,817
Four bottles?

373
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,111
Would he not have trouble
finding his way home then?

374
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,822
- Open up.
- I suppose so.

375
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,324
Yes, it would have been tough.

376
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,910
- Some of this too.
- This too?

377
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,292
She is all right.

378
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,336
So…

379
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,257
You are drunk.
Where are you going at this hour?

380
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,346
We can only find out
if we come at night while we are drunk.

381
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,389
Find what out?

382
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,933
Here, take a look.

383
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,602
This is Hong-sik's,

384
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,022
and that is Deok-sam's wall.

385
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:22,025
Yes, I suppose
it is hard to tell them apart.

386
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,029
What?

387
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:28,990
Why would you…

388
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,748
What…

389
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,135
What are you doing, my lady?

390
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,597
Now that I have sat on them,
the two walls are of the same height.

391
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,351
If he drank four bottles of rice wine,
could he not have been confused?

392
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,688
But he climbed the wall
instead of using the door though.

393
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,399
Since he drinks all the time,

394
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,818
Hong-sik's wife had locked the door.

395
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,571
They have been neighbors
their whole lives.

396
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,448
We should not resolve
something so trivial with a lawsuit.

397
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:15,078
I am certain that Lady Legal Advocate
would have come to this conclusion.

398
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,454
Do you not think so?

399
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,999
Yes.

400
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,128
Glad you changed your mind.
You are the best.

401
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:34,222
Here.

402
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,948
Where did they go? Do it together.

403
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,707
Bring that over here. Yes.

404
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,923
What is it?

405
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,717
I was wondering where Man-seok was.

406
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,427
Oh, Man-seok?

407
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,931
He will be late as he must
set up the stage. May I ask why?

408
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,517
May I borrow a face cover?

409
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,146
I would like to look around
for some gifts for my household.

410
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,942
If so, I know a place
that sells many interesting things.

411
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,278
Would you like to go…

412
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,196
together?

413
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,158
Oh, no. If you tell me where it is,
I can go by myself.

414
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,744
But it is kind of a complicated place.

415
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,663
It is hard to explain.

416
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,456
I am smart, so I will figure it out.

417
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,751
I am not smart enough to explain.

418
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,693
Come this way.

419
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,916
There.

420
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,507
How is it? Is it too tight?

421
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,176
Is it uncomfortable, my lady?

422
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,597
I am uncomfortable,

423
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,141
as you speak so formally to me.

424
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:26,644
You are a noblewoman.
Of course, I must speak to you formally.

425
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:30,607
Then, I will not go out with you.

426
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,275
It is too uncomfortable.

427
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,403
I do not know what you want me to do.

428
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,655
Let us say

429
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,826
that Goo-deok briefly came back to life.

430
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,747
All right.

431
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:50,251
I will think of this
as me seeing you in my dreams.

432
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,011
It is so liberating to roam about freely

433
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,305
without the headpiece skirt.

434
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,018
When I was searching for Goo-deok,

435
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,145
I came up with the name "Yun-jo" for her.

436
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,022
If we met again,

437
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:15,693
I wanted to give her a new name
instead of that sad name, Goo-deok.

438
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,365
Does it mean "a bird flying high"?

439
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,449
That is correct.

440
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,077
It means you are not tied
or locked up anywhere

441
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,956
and you can fly as high as you want.

442
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:32,669
It has been seven years already
since Goo-deok died.

443
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:36,965
Why have you not gotten married
all this time?

444
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,633
I do not know.

445
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,263
Goo-deok is enough for me.

446
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,933
Other women do not have any meaning to me.

447
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,611
What?

448
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,947
Why are you looking at me like that?

449
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,866
To keep this moment

450
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,786
in my eyes and in my heart.

451
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:55,335
That way, I will remember it
after I wake up from this dream.

452
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,563
I have somewhere to stop by around here.

453
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,689
You should go ahead.

454
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,234
All of a sudden? Where are you…

455
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,737
Can you put my luggage in my room?

456
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,031
All right,

457
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,117
but you do not know this area.
I am a little worried.

458
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,453
Do not be concerned.

459
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,791
I am not going anywhere. Do not worry.

460
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,253
All right.

461
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,597
Hello, Lord Song.

462
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,183
Who may you be?

463
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:57,605
I am Director Song Seo-in's
legal advocate.

464
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,375
Do not write just any wish.

465
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,545
Wish for some good fortune
in Cheongsu County.

466
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,629
Do you understand?

467
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,131
Yes.

468
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,674
What did you wish for?

469
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,637
I wished for
Lady Legal Advocate's safe return.

470
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,433
You wrote the same wish as me.

471
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,074
Excuse me.

472
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,160
Oh, my goodness.

473
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,706
That woman is
not even from Cheongsu County.

474
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,957
Why is she attending this?

475
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,293
If she is working in Cheongsu County,

476
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,921
I suppose she can
be considered as a local.

477
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,548
Since they seem to be inseparable,

478
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,301
I think you should give up on him.

479
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,720
Give up? It is not like they are married.

480
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,181
You give up so quickly all the time.

481
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,476
I suppose that is why
Young Master Ung-yi always fails.

482
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,187
What? How dare she…

483
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,230
What has gotten into you?

484
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,192
It seems you have changed your mind.

485
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,530
Change my mind? My goodness.

486
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,997
Why did you come to me?

487
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,626
Why do you think? Are we not family?

488
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:43,795
That is why we are sticking together.

489
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,882
It will make me uncomfortable
if you behave like this.

490
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,761
Do I make you uncomfortable?

491
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,221
My goodness.

492
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,766
I knew you were inflexible,
but you are also clueless.

493
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,477
I did not know I was lacking so much.

494
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,313
I thought I had everything.

495
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,774
Please, move away from me.

496
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:20,915
You know, I think
Young Master likes Lady Mi-ryeong.

497
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,585
What? Did you just figure that out?

498
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,212
At least, I figured it out now.

499
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,172
Yes, you are remarkable.

500
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:32,010
If Do-kki picked up on it,
everyone in this county probably did too.

501
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,553
I know.

502
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:37,056
All the ladies stare at her so much
that it may poke a hole in her face.

503
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,196
Goodbye.

504
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,364
I will return.

505
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,907
- Thank you.
- Sure.

506
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,166
- Young Master.
- Young Master.

507
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,502
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

508
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,422
Uk-dong.

509
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,032
My lady!

510
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,036
My lady.

511
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,705
Please wake up, my lady!

512
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,832
Young Master, what happened?

513
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,584
Put her on my back.

514
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,544
- Clear the way.
- I will carry her.

515
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,299
- Put her on my back already.
- Young Master.

516
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,838
How is it that
you can drink alcohol so well?

517
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,216
Did you forget that
I am good at everything?

518
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,092
Good for you. Eat this.

519
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,598
All right. Attention, everyone!

520
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,352
Well, I would like to share the news

521
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,772
that we already have
our next performance booked.

522
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,649
- What?
- What?

523
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,778
We just finished our performance.
How can there be news of the next one?

524
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:23,115
None other than the Vice Minister of Rites

525
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,035
happened to see our performance today,

526
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,830
and he wants us
to be the cultural delegation.

527
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,290
- What?
- Cultural delegation?

528
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,292
Drummer, drum up some suspense.

529
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,755
He wants us<i>…</i>

530
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,719
to perform in Qing.

531
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,971
Make some noise.

532
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,641
What are you saying? What?

533
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,534
Find Chon Seung-hwi!

534
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,582
This one!

535
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,543
She is something else, is she not?

536
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,382
Then<i>…</i>

537
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,466
Hey.

538
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,262
You got it right. Why did you drink it?

539
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,472
- Because I got it right!
- Gosh.

540
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,891
How much can she drink? She is…

541
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,603
Are you really not going to drink?

542
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:35,688
I do not like alcohol.

543
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,897
Do not bother.

544
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,650
He will pass out with just one glass.

545
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,654
You know, you are
even worse than a maggot.

546
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,906
Goo-deok.

547
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,201
You should go to Qing with us.

548
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,663
My gosh, you are drunk, Man-seok.

549
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,540
What? I am not drunk.

550
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,502
You look just like
a member of our group right now.

551
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,505
If you join us, you will never get caught.

552
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,342
Do not go back, and just live with us.

553
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,345
Even if you go back, your husband--

554
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,180
Have some food, Soe-ddung.

555
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,973
What?

556
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,268
- Did you do this?
- Is it not good, Soe-ddung?

557
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,770
I told you not to call me that.

558
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,939
I am going to
tell Director Chon everything.

559
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,649
- What is it?
- Nothing.

560
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,360
I saw that you left

561
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,904
the newly made
original copy of your book in my room.

562
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,947
Thank you.
I will enjoy reading it, Director.

563
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,157
I see.

564
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,575
I do not think that is it.

565
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,744
- What if<i>…</i>
- Hey!

566
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,372
What if her husband left seven years ago

567
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,248
and has not returned? What would you do?

568
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,666
What?

569
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,922
- What are you talking about?
- I know.

570
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,216
Are you crazy? Stop talking nonsense.

571
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,260
I was just wondering.

572
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,013
It was only hypothetical.
We can do that, can we not?

573
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,890
Hypothetically speaking.

574
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,110
Father.

575
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,197
How did he find us here?

576
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,212
Father.

577
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,296
No.

578
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,507
Lord Song.

579
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,136
What brings you here?

580
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,807
Oh, I apologize for asking you
to confirm my identity

581
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,226
when I am nothing
but an ousted son of a concubine.

582
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,774
I changed my name and covered my face
so as not to bring shame to the family.

583
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,653
But I cannot do anything
about your blood within me.

584
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:51,031
I did not come here to hear your thanks.

585
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,116
Then, why?

586
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:55,911
Oh, are you here to slap me? Go ahead.

587
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,788
I came as I missed you.

588
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,131
I have felt so bad
for treating you harshly.

589
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:13,429
I did not have the courage to see you
even after coming all the way here.

590
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,018
But your legal advocate came
and asked me to watch you perform.

591
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,652
I truly enjoyed it.

592
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:35,117
You truly resemble your mother a lot.

593
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:46,587
Seo-in, stop wandering about
and return home.

594
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,006
Stop covering your face

595
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,135
and use your own name now.

596
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,431
Why…

597
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:02,937
Why are you doing this now
after all this time?

598
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,107
Because you are my son.

599
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:14,365
No matter what anyone says,
you are the eldest son of the Song Family.

600
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,006
I am so glad.

601
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:47,982
Are you in there?

602
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,192
Yes.

603
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,619
Are you packing already?

604
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,916
What about Lord Song?

605
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,501
Did you see him home?

606
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:13,257
My gosh. He has
become senile in his old age.

607
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,552
Have you had a drink?

608
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,722
I only had a couple of glasses.

609
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,143
Are you happy?

610
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,270
Not really.

611
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,024
Even if he has gone senile,

612
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,985
I would give anything…

613
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,113
to be able to see my father one more time.

614
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:47,374
Did you stay behind because you wanted
to reunite me with my father?

615
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,210
You did not want that.

616
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,631
I am sorry to have overstepped.

617
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,258
You used to frequent my house.

618
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,677
What if he recognized you?
That was dangerous.

619
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,764
I wanted to see you

620
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,600
happy like this.

621
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,314
Gosh.

622
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:18,447
I wish that Man-seok's hypothetical story
were not just hypothetical.

623
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,699
Pardon?

624
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:25,537
I wish that your husband
had not returned this whole time.

625
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,464
What if he did not?

626
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,884
I would not let you go.

627
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,889
What would you do after that?

628
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,059
Would you make me your concubine?

629
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,103
Why would you be my concubine?

630
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,147
Outside of Cheongsu County,

631
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,401
I am Goo-deok, the runaway slave.

632
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:02,491
And you are now
the eldest son of the Song Family.

633
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:08,038
Moreover, my master Lady So-hye

634
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,833
lives near your home in Hanyang.

635
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,462
No, thank you.
Who says I will be Song Seo-in?

636
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,922
I will not do it.

637
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,925
And you can live as Yun-jo
instead of Goo-deok.

638
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,720
What could I do by your side?

639
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,100
Must you do something?

640
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:33,063
Can you not just be by my side?

641
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,444
No,

642
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,114
I like being a legal advocate.

643
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,621
Whatever. Forget it.

644
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,835
I can…

645
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,631
give everything up if I could be with you.

646
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:02,843
I would not like that though.

647
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:11,351
I will return
and do my best to live as Ok Tae-young.

648
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,812
So I hope you become

649
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,192
the best professional storyteller
and bring honor to Joseon.

650
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,069
Wait.

651
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,865
Let us stay like this for a moment.

652
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:17,709
<i>It was a dreamy moment…</i>

653
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,629
<i>that would never return.</i>

654
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,052
<i>Once I wake up from this dream,</i>
<i>I will be alone again.</i>

655
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:35,352
<i>Fate will separate us again.</i>

656
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,941
<i>And you will go on living as yourself</i>
<i>and I will live as myself.</i>

657
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,901
A GOVERNMENT OFFICER AND A WOMAN

658
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,113
<i>But I will hold on to this memory</i>

659
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,825
<i>and try to endure this long darkness</i>

660
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,994
<i>as I pine for you for the rest of my life…</i>

661
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,206
<i>as my sun has set now.</i>

662
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,885
My lady!

663
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,804
Why did you make that journey by yourself?

664
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,014
Give it to me.

665
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,765
My goodness. I should have gone with you.

666
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,310
Why are these so heavy? Gosh.

667
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:23,066
Why were you waiting for me?
What if I did not return?

668
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,361
I would have been happy
even if you did not return.

669
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:27,988
Of course, I would return.

670
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,115
I have nowhere else to go.

671
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,827
What is wrong? Did something happen?

672
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,038
No, nothing happened.

673
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,164
Just happy to see you.

674
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,542
Come on. Let us go.

675
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,424
Gosh, I thought

676
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:51,011
something might have happened
between you and your old friend

677
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,430
that looks just like Yun-gyeom.

678
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,848
I was rather hoping for it.

679
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,268
Am I…

680
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,899
not useful to this family anymore?

681
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,151
What?

682
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,195
Your brother is no longer here,

683
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,989
and you are all grown up.

684
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,159
Perhaps I am not needed.

685
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:18,914
Maybe that was why you were hoping
something had happened…

686
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,127
so that I would not return.

687
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,880
I was speaking in jest, my lady.

688
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:31,843
How could you take it so seriously?
Are you upset with me about something?

689
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,139
I was also speaking in jest.

690
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,266
How will you
ever get married at this rate?

691
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,685
Pardon?

692
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,729
Do you not want to? You have been
frequenting a young lady's house.

693
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,567
Gosh, Mak-sim. I told her
that I would tell you.

694
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,407
What brings you to my humble home?

695
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,201
Let me see your arm.

696
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:58,453
It is truly nothing.

697
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,996
It is simply a scratch.

698
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:04,876
As it was scraped against the ground,

699
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,964
the blood gathered in the wounds
and the infection became severe.

700
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,717
We must find a physician
that is skilled in external wounds.

701
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,177
Your wounds must heal
so that we can have a wedding.

702
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,930
A wedding, my lady?

703
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:21,059
Do you not have any feelings for him?

704
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,686
That is not so.

705
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,980
That is definitely not so.

706
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,774
That settles it, then.
You will only have happy days from now.

707
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,151
Is that not right?

708
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,569
Yes, of course.

709
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,453
Thank you.

710
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,664
You did not have to.

711
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,333
It is so nice to see you.
It has been too long.

712
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,835
Did your journey go well?

713
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,879
Yes, thanks to your concern.

714
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,590
I brought back some souvenirs.

715
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:57,596
My goodness.
What am I supposed to do with this?

716
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,598
My goodness.

717
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,977
Since when did the two hit it off?

718
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,189
Lady Kim and Lady Hong.

719
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:11,443
Young Master Do-gyeom
will be getting married soon.

720
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,237
She is the adopted daughter
of a single father

721
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,781
of Uichang County's Cha Family.

722
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,909
Adopted daughter?

723
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,119
She is not from a reputable family,

724
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,372
but she has great character
and Do-gyeom has affection for her.

725
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,542
But marriage is a major life event.

726
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:31,588
Should you not find out
what kind of family she comes from?

727
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,049
Oh, my. If I had said such a thing,

728
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:37,093
you would have said that was vulgar.

729
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,846
Forget what I said.
I should not have said that.

730
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,809
You have said something right for once.

731
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,687
You have praised me for once. Thank you.

732
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,302
We have set the wedding date, Mother.

733
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,763
Why did you run in front of that cart?

734
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,974
You were lucky it was not worse.

735
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,767
What if you were injured badly?

736
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:29,521
I thought if Young Master was injured,
that would be an even bigger problem.

737
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,064
How foolish.

738
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,193
He has no shortage of offers of marriage
after scoring first in the state exam.

739
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,695
If he became a cripple,

740
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,531
you would have
a better chance of marrying him.

741
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,452
Once you marry into the family,

742
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:47,998
you must be far more cautious than now.

743
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,210
Until we punish Ok Tae-young,

744
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,422
no one can find out
you are the daughter of the Baek Family.

745
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,341
Yes, do not worry.

746
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,803
I am counting on you.

747
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,264
You are our family's only hope.

748
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,682
Yes, Mother.

749
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,976
I promise

750
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:12,856
I will get revenge on Ok Tae-young
for what she did to our family.

751
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,399
Never grow fond of her.

752
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,776
Do not trust anything she says.

753
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,363
You must be most careful with

754
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,407
that wench's snake-like tongue.

755
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,666
Oh, my. You look so pretty.

756
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,502
She looks like a fairy from above.

757
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,171
I know.

758
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,175
Let me see.

759
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,101
We are going to fix
your father's south room, the gatehouse…

760
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:52,854
- The lavatory.
- And the lavatory.

761
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,981
You only have one servant,

762
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,608
so two of ours will go there.

763
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,570
The clothes we sent your father,
do they fit him well?

764
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,490
You did not have to
send him silk clothes you made yourself.

765
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,368
He sent the daughter
he raised so well to us.

766
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,786
We should repay him for that.

767
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,538
I do not know what to say, my lady.

768
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,290
My lady?

769
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:14,501
I am your sister-in-law from today.

770
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,046
Yes, indeed.

771
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,341
All done. How beautiful.

772
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,218
Thank you.

773
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:24,636
One moment.

774
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,388
Here.

775
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,814
I made it.

776
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,817
I have one too.

777
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,445
What is this?

778
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:45,991
We may not be sisters by blood,

779
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,827
but sisters-in-law are like sisters too,

780
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,455
so you may rely on me for anything.

781
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:56,918
I will look after you
like your mother and your sister.

782
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,421
Let us cherish and lean on one another

783
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,423
and get along well.

784
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,111
The bride and groom
may bow to one another.

785
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,369
How beautiful.

786
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,752
The groom is handsome too.

787
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,051
Two truly beautiful people have united.

788
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,636
Is she not beautiful?

789
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,104
What is it?

790
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,775
I thought I saw
Special Inspector Baek's wife.

791
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,239
You must be mistaken.
Why would that woman come here?

792
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,762
Why are you in Master's room
in the middle of the night?

793
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:32,013
What am I saying?

794
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,307
He is not the only Master now, is he?

795
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,269
It would have been nice
if he was here for the wedding today.

796
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:43,399
I was thinking of clearing out this room.

797
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,777
Why?

798
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:54,077
I do not think he will return anymore.

799
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,871
Why would you suddenly think that way?

800
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,583
After marrying off Young Master
who was like a son to you,

801
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,793
do you feel empty?

802
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,838
No reason.

803
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,271
I am going to speak with my sister-in-law.

804
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,399
Why do we not go together, dearest?

805
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,775
Just today.

806
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,653
We can go together from tomorrow on,
my dear.

807
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,706
<i>After the wedding,</i>

808
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,042
<i>you must tell me</i>
<i>everything that goes on in that house.</i>

809
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,381
Why are you doing this
right after your wedding night?

810
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,175
You promised me.

811
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:53,094
You must keep it, my lady.

812
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:58,641
Please tell me why and for what
Yun-gyeom left home.

813
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,522
I do not know where to begin.

814
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,734
It is rather complicated.

815
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,823
He was quite different
from other men, was he not?

816
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,707
As expected, my guess was right.

817
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,584
I had my doubts.

818
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,964
Yes, you may start from there.

819
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,617
I feel the same way as Father.

820
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,204
His situation or great cause,

821
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,625
I cannot understand him or forgive him
for any of it.

822
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,086
Even so, he should have come back.

823
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,464
If he could not,
he should have written you, at least.

824
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,134
If he did not die…

825
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,514
that is what he should have done.

826
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,059
Young Master.

827
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:24,477
How could you…

828
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:28,731
How could you choose to live
such a lonely life?

829
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,405
I do not have any time to be lonely.

830
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,700
I am so busy.

831
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:46,082
Do you think…

832
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:49,460
he will really not return home?

833
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,674
Yes.

834
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,224
Who is there?

835
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,564
What was that?

836
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,780
Discuss with your sons and let me know
the subject of their civil service exam.

837
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,241
I will prepare a trip
to places that can be of help.

838
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,202
- Thank you, Lady Kim.
- Thank you, Lady Kim.

839
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:27,165
Have you heard of
the news from Chuni County?

840
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,166
What happened?

841
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:30,793
A widow took her own life and
a Memorial Gate was erected in her honor.

842
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,420
MEMORIAL GATE: A GATE COMMEMORATING
A WIDOW WHO KEPT HER FIDELITY

843
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:36,341
But it turned out that
someone made her take her life.

844
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,425
Oh, my.

845
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,345
People do not talk about it,
but it is quite common, is it not?

846
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,930
Anyway, which method did they use?

847
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,308
They had the abductors
do an unspeakable thing to her

848
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,477
so that she would
kill herself out of shame.

849
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,645
Oh, my goodness.

850
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,938
Which family would do such a thing?

851
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,525
It was not a family.
The whole Chuni County was in on it.

852
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,611
But why would they do that?

853
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,488
According to my husband,

854
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,239
when a village has a virtuous woman,

855
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:03,868
the whole village benefits from it
from now on, apparently.

856
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,621
The whole village benefits
from the Memorial Gate?

857
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:07,914
Yes, everyone.

858
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,999
Not only will there be tax exemptions,

859
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,961
but there will be good marital candidates,
the magistrate's merits will increase,

860
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:18,299
and extra points will be given
to those who take the civil service exam.

861
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,760
Then, you would need

862
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:24,639
the Memorial Gate the most in our village.

863
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:29,227
Young Master Ung-yi may not
come in first like Young Master Seong,

864
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:33,648
but would he not have to pass at least?

865
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:37,568
How can noblewomen laugh

866
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,904
over something so horrific?

867
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,198
Please show some respect.

868
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,121
You startled me.

869
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:50,248
My goodness.

870
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:55,378
Please walk more quietly.
You have no dignity as the chief's wife.

871
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,255
What if I am the chief's wife?

872
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,548
I am always looked down on.

873
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,174
That is true.

874
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:04,887
Should not the chief's wife
lead Mother's Sanctuary?

875
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,641
Why does she control it
when she is not the chief's wife?

876
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,561
Lady Kim is the one who established it.
Is that not so?

877
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,312
I know that.

878
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,940
I simply answered your question.

879
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,159
Rather than wasting your time being upset,

880
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,411
you should focus on Ung-yi's studies.

881
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:30,872
You are looked down on

882
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,958
because Ung-yi has not passed
the civil service exam

883
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,169
and is good-for-nothing, are you not?

884
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,296
Stop stating the obvious!

885
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,258
Why did Young Master Seong
have to come in first?

886
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:45,136
The comparison is killing me.

887
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,725
Why does this godforsaken
Cheongsu County not have a widow?

888
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:54,312
If we did, we could have
done something to get a Memorial Gate.

889
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:57,273
All you know how to do
is come up with a scheme.

890
01:02:57,356 --> 01:03:00,443
How is this a scheme?
It was determined by the state.

891
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,654
Wake up.

892
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,990
There are no widows here,

893
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,326
so there will be no Memorial Gate.

894
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,607
Who is it? Who are you?

895
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,951
I trust that you have been doing well.

896
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,664
Lady Song?

897
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:03,673
How have you been doing?

898
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,218
After Young Master Baek
was sentenced to be exiled,

899
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:10,847
I only heard that
you ran away with him during the night.

900
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:15,685
Oh, have you returned
as his exile has ended?

901
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,563
My dear Do-gwang has…

902
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:22,024
passed away not too long ago.

903
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,110
Oh, my.

904
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:29,198
Then, how is Special Inspector Baek doing?

905
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,160
He has passed away a few years ago too.

906
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,538
I see.

907
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:42,712
Then, why did you come to see me
so late in the night?

908
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:48,009
Without her husband, Ok Tae-young has
helped her brother-in-law come in first.

909
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:51,679
How is it that Young Master Ung-yi
cannot do so well?

910
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,017
Your son died and your family is ruined.
How dare you say that?

911
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,352
I will get you the Memorial Gate

912
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,730
if you help me get my revenge.

913
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,568
Did you come back
to seek revenge on Ok Tae-young?

914
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,405
That is

915
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:14,118
the only reason I am still alive.

916
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,978
What is the matter, dearest?

917
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,785
This is meant
to ruin a couple's relationship

918
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,329
and curse them to be childless.

919
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,997
Who on earth would…

920
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:02,083
Who would do this to you?

921
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:04,961
My lady! Young Master!

922
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:07,672
Oh, no. Something has happened!

923
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,925
What is wrong?

924
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,468
Oh, my goodness.

925
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,972
What is wrong, Kkeut-dong?

926
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:19,141
Well… Oh, my gosh. How could this be?

927
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:20,559
Master Yun-gyeom has…

928
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,770
What about him? Is there news of him?

929
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:25,147
This is so frustrating. Spit it out.

930
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,774
Gosh.

931
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:29,026
Master Yun-gyeom's body has been found.

932
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:32,279
Oh, my goodness. How could this be?

933
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,624
Did you hear?

934
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:47,962
Young Master Seong's brother,
who is Ok Tae-young's husband, is dead.

935
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,088
Oh, my gosh.

936
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,090
She waited for him for seven years.

937
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,050
He returned as a corpse?

938
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,095
Yes, she has gone to identify the body.

939
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,638
She has surely become a widow.

940
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,328
Brother.

941
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:36,635
<i>Do you know why I am helping you, my lady?</i>

942
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:41,390
I only thought women were meant
to be protected by men.

943
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:46,103
But I saw a spirit in you
that could even protect a man.

944
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:50,316
<i>If anyone could do it,</i>
<i>I thought it would be you, my lady.</i>

945
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,069
<i>That is why I decided to help you.</i>

946
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:57,073
<i>I cannot do nothing</i>

947
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,450
<i>while children die</i>
<i>simply for being different.</i>

948
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,702
<i>I will create…</i>

949
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:06,207
a world where being different is accepted.

950
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,045
<i>I will send word as soon as I arrive.</i>

951
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,421
<i>I promise you.</i>

952
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,661
<i>Why did you not tell me this?</i>

953
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,788
<i>Why did you not tell me?</i>

954
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:30,499
Will you quit everything
to go and get her?

955
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,044
<i>I heard she put</i>

956
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,422
<i>an effigy doll in the newlyweds' room!</i>

957
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,925
<i>How can a widow</i>
<i>who must maintain her chastity</i>

958
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,927
<i>work at an office?</i>

959
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,888
From now, Widow Ok Tae-young

960
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,265
<i>must collect her husband's body</i>

961
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,434
<i>and respectfully mourn for three years.</i>

962
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:53,606
<i>I will use the rest of my life</i>
<i>to tear you apart.</i>

963
01:09:58,068 --> 01:10:03,073
