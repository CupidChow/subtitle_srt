00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,035
(Lim Ji Yeon)

2
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,138
(Choo Young Woo)

3
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,049
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

4
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,197
This is

5
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:04,798
for my mother's revenge.

6
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,084
Wait a minute.

7
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:27,821
Are you not Goodeoki?

8
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,104
It is so good to see you, Goodeoki.

9
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,441
To think you are alive.

10
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,110
I searched all over Joseon,
but could not find you.

11
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,445
So I thought you had died somewhere.

12
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,920
Are you talking to me?

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,958
Yes, this shamelessness is just like you.

14
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:07,361
By the way,

15
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,365
you look so much better now.

16
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:12,933
I almost did not recognize you.

17
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,102
Whoever you confuse me with,

18
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,938
this is my first time meeting you.

19
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,341
You may fool everyone,
but you cannot fool me.

20
00:02:21,775 --> 00:02:23,477
Did you think I would not recognize you?

21
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,415
Did you just laugh?

22
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:32,753
I am the eldest daughter-in-law
of the Cheongsu County's Seong family.

23
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,154
My name is Ok Tae Young.

24
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:36,790
So, please stop this rudeness.

25
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,396
Look at her. Is that not Goodeoki?

26
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,264
No, Madam, she is not.

27
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,033
Are you blind? Look properly.

28
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:48,936
I looked closely, Madam.

29
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,773
In Cheongsu County,

30
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,577
we do not mistreat
even the house servants.

31
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,011
What?

32
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,814
You seem to be the Magistrate's wife.

33
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,650
Show some dignity appropriate
to your status.

34
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:06,453
No! The Magistrate is my father.

35
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,255
I see.

36
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,458
I am the wife
of the Minister of Taxation, Bak Jun Gi.

37
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,861
Bak Jun Gi.

38
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,867
I am the father-in-law of Bak Jun Gi,
the Minister of Taxation.

39
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,237
What? Bak Jun...

40
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,342
- My goodness.
- My apologies.

41
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,645
Why the sudden apology?

42
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,652
By the way, I heard it was you
who introduced Heo Soon.

43
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,088
What do you want me to do?
I am looking for him now.

44
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,990
Why are you raising your voice?

45
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,058
You are not in a position
to raise your voice, are you?

46
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,560
What did you say?

47
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,430
Come on, let us head back
and discuss this calmly.

48
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,266
No, finish what you were saying first.

49
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:54,902
- No, let us discuss it back home.
- Why?

50
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,903
My apologies.

51
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,871
Why are you acting like this?
Who is Bak Jun Gi?

52
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,006
Calm down.

53
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,313
You really look like Goodeoki.

54
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,149
I will not tolerate further rudeness.

55
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:14,021
Please, let us head back.
The Magistrate is waiting for you.

56
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,691
Let go! Look at her!
That is Goodeoki, I am sure!

57
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,260
I remembered that face for ten years,
as clear as day.

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,130
Every day,
I imagined how I would tear her apart.

59
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,097
But

60
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,500
who is Goodeoki?

61
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,669
What?

62
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,839
I am curious who resembles me so much.

63
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,146
My runaway slave.

64
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:44,785
I see. I hope you find her.

65
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,991
Well then, I have urgent business,
so I will take my leave.

66
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,736
Father, arrest her immediately.

67
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,538
My goodness.

68
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,307
Who?

69
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:08,942
Goodeoki.

70
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,310
Where is she this time?

71
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,545
Here in Cheongsu County.

72
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,580
She is living pretending to be a noble.

73
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,284
Drag her here, torture her,
brand her if needed.

74
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,420
Do whatever it takes to make her confess,
right now!

75
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,132
What happened? Did she recognize you?

76
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:36,270
I think she thought I looked similar.

77
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,441
How can you be so calm about this?

78
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:45,379
Because I have imagined this
hundreds, thousands of times.

79
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,082
I was always prepared for

80
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,451
what to do if we met.

81
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,655
You two are here...

82
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,356
I went to the office,
but you were not there.

83
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,824
I was on my way to the government office
and I heard you were here.

84
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,826
Hurry, we need to run, Madam.

85
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,695
Kim Nak Soo is here!

86
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,163
- I know.
- Come.

87
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,432
You know? Then why are you standing here?
We need to run.

88
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,668
What if Dung So Hye comes here? Let us go.

89
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:08,802
She is already here.

90
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:09,937
Already?

91
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,773
Dung So Hye is here? What do we do?

92
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:13,874
What do we do?

93
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,109
Keep your voice down.

94
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,911
Let us go. Quickly.

95
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,813
Why did she come down here? Why?

96
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,818
So, how much did you borrow?

97
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,286
Fifty nyangs.

98
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,857
Even selling the house will not cover it.
What now?

99
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:30,991
Hold on.

100
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,660
Wait a moment.

101
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,863
Speak one at a time.
My head is about to burst.

102
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,131
Where are you going, Mother?

103
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,334
Catch that scoundrel right now.

104
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,802
He is the swindler.

105
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:44,204
Mother, why did you follow me here?

106
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:47,174
So, everyone here borrowed money

107
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,109
from Hwang, the moneylender,
near the provincial office?

108
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,052
Yes.

109
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:53,347
He sent thugsthugs to threaten us
for repayment.

110
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:55,649
They say they will kill us.

111
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,384
My goodness, wait a moment.

112
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,689
That is clearly
an illegal collection tactic.

113
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,493
Please, help us. Will you?

114
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:10,030
Soon Deok's father even hanged himself.

115
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,500
Do not think of doing anything rash.
Hold out for now.

116
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,037
I will figure out a solution.
Do you understand?

117
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,276
My goodness, Sweetheart.
Do not carry heavy things.

118
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,077
- Give it here.
- Do not run, Sweetheart.

119
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,647
If you fall and hurt your back,
it will be a big problem.

120
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,416
Do not worry. You know me.

121
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,252
Sweetheart, have you heard?

122
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,921
The village is in total chaos.

123
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,922
I know.

124
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:37,724
What is this eternal ginseng
that caused everyone to get scammed?

125
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:39,560
Cheongsu County is in big trouble.

126
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,330
I even heard Administrator Shin
will sell servants to pay off debts.

127
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,166
The noble families can
at least pay back their debts.

128
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,101
But what about the poor?

129
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,971
Exactly. They have nothing left to sell.

130
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,540
They will lose their land and homes,

131
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,509
and end up on the streets.

132
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,447
What do we do, Sweetheart?

133
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,117
Sweethearts, do not let anyone
into the house.

134
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,853
If anyone asks questions,
say you know nothing.

135
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:08,055
- What are you talking about?
- What is going on?

136
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,425
Do you think we got scammed too?

137
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,126
Are we going to be sold off too?

138
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,728
- That cannot happen.
- Sweetheart.

139
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,832
Please no.
Just let us love each other in peace.

140
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:24,605
What is this? Why are you all meditating?

141
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:27,074
Is this the time for that?

142
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,977
Come on, start packing your things.

143
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,512
We need to run away right now.

144
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,914
Hurry up.

145
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:38,485
Goodeoki, it is Lady So Hye, your master.

146
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,854
Listen here, late Master Song Seo In.

147
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,923
Get a grip right now.

148
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:44,825
Okay?

149
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:48,795
Do you want to get caught and go hand
in hand to the afterlife together?

150
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,400
Look at this. She does not look
like she plans to leave at all.

151
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:56,470
Excuse me, are you not listening to me?

152
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,672
Why are you frozen like a stone?

153
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,340
Lady So Hye saw me.

154
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,377
If I disappear now,

155
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:07,648
it will confirm that I am Goodeoki.

156
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,017
That makes sense.

157
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:13,720
Besides, Cheongsu County is in chaos.
How could I leave now?

158
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,691
Do not nod. This is not the time to nod.

159
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,826
Fine, let us say Cheongsu County matters.

160
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:21,628
But does it matter more than your life?

161
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:23,163
Man Seok is right.

162
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,233
You should leave with Man Seok.

163
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,901
- Come on, let us go quickly.
- Just me?

164
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,469
Wait.

165
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,904
Hold on.

166
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,141
- What is that?
- What is this about?

167
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:38,645
It is something I prepared since the day
you arrived in Cheongsu County.

168
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:40,380
Let us go.

169
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,549
Wait a second.

170
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,218
You want only me to leave?

171
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:47,054
If it were just me,
I could deny everything.

172
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,590
But if Lady So Hye sees us together,

173
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,891
then it is truly over.

174
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,826
Exactly. Stand up now. Let us go.

175
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:54,061
Wait, just hold on.

176
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,829
That is the only way
for both of you to survive.

177
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,763
I cannot do that.

178
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,566
I took the state examination

179
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,202
to become the Yuhyangso Special Inspector
of Cheongsu County

180
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:04,271
just to stay by your side.

181
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,507
How could I leave Cheongsu County?
I cannot.

182
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:07,841
Yun Gyeom.

183
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,078
And also, Bak Jun Gi.

184
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,247
The Minister of Taxation, Bak Jun Gi.

185
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,781
Do you remember him?

186
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:17,117
How did someone like him become
Minister of Taxation?

187
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,685
It seems Kim Nak Soo

188
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:21,455
bought the Magistrate position
from Bak Jun Gi.

189
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,191
So he might have scammed others
to make up his costs?

190
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,694
First, we need to find that Heo Soon
or whatever his name is.

191
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,797
- My goodness.
- Why? What?

192
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,599
If you are that scared, just leave.

193
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,101
I will not stop you. Just go.

194
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,236
I love Cheongsu County too.

195
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:38,138
This is my home.

196
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,073
When I die, my bones will be buried here.

197
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,878
You are really not leaving?

198
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:45,879
No.

199
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:49,483
Kim Nak Soo has never seen me before,
so he will never recognize me.

200
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:50,984
And as for Kim So Hye...

201
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:53,220
Would she even imagine we are together?

202
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,054
What if you meet her?

203
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,124
Would she look at my face
that closely, really?

204
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:00,093
Honestly, I am disappointed.

205
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,296
I mean Kim So Hye.

206
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:04,031
She had a marriage proposal with me.

207
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:06,133
But associating with you led to this mess.

208
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,935
- And so?
- I am saying

209
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:09,436
if she truly longs for someone,

210
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:12,306
should she not recognize me
even from afar?

211
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:13,473
Is it not so?

212
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,577
Who would recognize someone running away
like a startled bird?

213
00:11:16,577 --> 00:11:17,945
How could anyone notice?

214
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,646
Your point is...

215
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,652
You ran so fast.

216
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,491
This is crazy.

217
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,228
You are jesting and laughing?

218
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:37,764
Living together makes you alike,
even in madness, it seems.

219
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:39,766
Come on, stop it.

220
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,540
Are you really not going
to arrest Goodeoki?

221
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:49,977
Send officers immediately
before she escapes.

222
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,546
On what grounds?
Arrest her just because she looks similar?

223
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,781
That is why you should interrogate her.

224
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,183
Only then will she confess.

225
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,452
How do you interrogate a noblewoman?

226
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,287
She is not a noblewoman.

227
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,258
Go. You are being noisy.
I am going to sleep.

228
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,160
Focus on serving the Minister well,
or you will be cast aside.

229
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,300
What about you, Father?

230
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,636
What have you done
right after taking office?

231
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,306
Did you scam people again,
trying to pocket money?

232
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:21,542
Do you want to lose the position you got
by selling your daughter,

233
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:22,809
and end up in prison in your old age?

234
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:25,412
Quiet.

235
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:28,715
If the Minister finds out,
you are the one in real trouble.

236
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,984
I said be quiet!

237
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,088
What?

238
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,491
The Magistrate's son-in-law
is Minister Bak Jun Gi?

239
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:39,059
That same Bak Jun Gi

240
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,161
who ruined our fortune
with the mine scandal seven years ago?

241
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:43,330
Yes, and I had no idea.

242
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,900
But I have seen
Minister Bak Jun Gi's wife.

243
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,603
She seemed about the Magistrate's age.

244
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,306
My goodness.

245
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,142
She is a concubine, right?

246
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,845
It must be that the Magistrate's daughter
is Minister Bak Jun Gi's concubine.

247
00:12:57,845 --> 00:12:58,879
In this situation...

248
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,415
Seriously, is that what matters now?

249
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,251
Are you not curious?

250
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:06,854
Even if my life were at stake,
I would still want to know.

251
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,389
That curiosity of yours!

252
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,458
Must I tie your ankles to keep you still?

253
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:16,163
Even without tying me down,
I truly cannot go outside anymore.

254
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:20,133
People are dying to tear me apart
out there.

255
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:21,935
What did the Magistrate say?

256
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:23,871
He claimed he is also looking
for Heo Soon

257
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,706
and told us to wait.

258
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:26,974
You went to confront him,

259
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,877
but when you heard Bak Jun Gi is
the son-in-law, you fled back right away.

260
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,579
Keep that mouth of yours shut.

261
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,648
I cannot stay quiet.

262
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,017
This is unfair.

263
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:40,254
Who could have imagined
that the new Magistrate

264
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,756
would scam his own people?

265
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:45,392
We cannot yet confirm that he is involved.

266
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:46,860
What do you mean?

267
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,029
It is obvious
the Magistrate colluded with Heo Soon

268
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,598
and used me as a pawn!

269
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,234
Without evidence,
provoking the Magistrate

270
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,837
could result in retaliation
from Bak Jun Gi.

271
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:00,274
Then what do we do?

272
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,976
What should we do?

273
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:07,447
We have no choice
but to trust Legal Advocate Ok.

274
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:10,150
Do you think she will find a way for us?

275
00:14:10,784 --> 00:14:14,254
Honestly, she was irritating as an enemy,

276
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:17,424
but thinking of her as an ally is

277
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,826
surprisingly reassuring.

278
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:38,979
What is wrong? Another nightmare?

279
00:14:39,847 --> 00:14:41,148
It seems

280
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,151
I need to meet someone.

281
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,222
Who?

282
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:29,029
You are the Madam I met earlier today.

283
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:34,168
Earlier, Madam So Hye seemed to mistake...

284
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,469
Aunt Geumbok.

285
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,742
It is me.

286
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,645
It is Goodeoki.

287
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:00,194
Is it really you, Goodeoki?

288
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:02,996
My goodness, I was unsure...

289
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,732
Dear, look at Goodeoki.

290
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:08,168
This Madam is our Goodeoki.

291
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:14,141
Goodeoki, we worried so much for you.

292
00:16:14,842 --> 00:16:16,310
You have been well here.

293
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,511
But

294
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,715
what about my father?

295
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,584
Is he not with you?

296
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,154
We were separated while escaping.

297
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,923
So that is what happened.

298
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,394
But, Aunt, why is your leg like this?

299
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,763
And Uncle, your face?

300
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,099
What happened to you?

301
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:42,903
Nothing happened.

302
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,473
Uncle, can you not talk? What happened?

303
00:16:49,243 --> 00:16:52,145
Do not tell me...

304
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:56,517
Is it all because of me?

305
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,255
What do I do?

306
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,258
It is fine. We are fine.

307
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:05,425
Really.

308
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,867
Seeing you living well like this

309
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,536
puts his heart at ease.

310
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:17,671
I am sorry.

311
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:19,940
I am sorry.

312
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:22,042
No, do not be.

313
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,178
It is really fine.

314
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:26,580
It is okay.

315
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,349
I am sorry.

316
00:17:31,652 --> 00:17:32,819
I am sorry.

317
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,788
No, it is fine.

318
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,827
Goodeoki.

319
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:54,141
Are you sure that woman is not Goodeoki?

320
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:57,811
No, definitely not.

321
00:18:00,814 --> 00:18:01,715
By the way,

322
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,319
you saw the Magistrate at his position.

323
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:06,787
So you should head back, Madam.

324
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:12,025
His Lord must be waiting.

325
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,996
Our house is nothing
but the Minister's secret storage, anyway.

326
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:21,502
I am just a pretty guard dog
for the Minister's treasure.

327
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:22,836
Woof.

328
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:27,708
I wonder if Goodeoki's scalp healed
after I tore her hair out.

329
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,777
But I cannot just go digging
into a noblewoman's hair.

330
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,412
Of course not.

331
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:36,283
What a shame.

332
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,319
If only I had broken her leg completely,

333
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,455
she would be limping like you.

334
00:18:41,855 --> 00:18:44,525
That would have made her easier
to spot, right?

335
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:47,127
Yes.

336
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,202
You must never run into Kim So Hye.

337
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,072
And you must never face Kim Nak Soo.

338
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,644
- Yun Gyeom.
- You being like that makes me sad.

339
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,313
You say you cannot live without me,
but you keep telling me to leave.

340
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:09,650
It is because I am worried.

341
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,985
Let us see it as something inevitable.

342
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:16,056
Life cannot always be joyful and easy.

343
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,225
Sometimes hardships like this

344
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,594
give life its flavor.

345
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,665
Anyway, we are one in body and soul now.

346
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:26,500
So we do everything together.

347
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:29,336
Understood.

348
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,904
In that spirit...

349
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:33,740
Right now?

350
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,843
For men, any time is the right time.

351
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,616
I am terrified. Please give me courage.

352
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,103
Great.

353
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:11,044
What is this? Poison?

354
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:12,880
This...

355
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,450
It is Ssanghwatang,
good for fatigue recovery.

356
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,785
You have been looking pale recently.

357
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:21,755
I still look handsome, though.

358
00:20:23,457 --> 00:20:27,060
Ever since the news of Cheongsu County,
your complexion has not been great.

359
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,196
The whole county has been scammed.

360
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:32,699
I have been losing sleep
because I am so worried.

361
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,637
Still, try to take naps at least.

362
00:20:37,838 --> 00:20:41,975
Also, avoid going out as much as possible.

363
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,477
Why?

364
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:45,045
Well,

365
00:20:47,481 --> 00:20:49,016
someone might try to steal you away.

366
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,984
I am leaving now.

367
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:54,321
Remember to eat well too.

368
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:04,898
Listen, Special Inspector Seong.

369
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:09,236
What is the point
of seeing the Magistrate? What can we do?

370
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,039
He is Bak Jun Gi's father-in-law.

371
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,408
Besides, did I not grab him
by the collar last time?

372
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,977
- I am scared.
- My goodness.

373
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,646
I will handle the Magistrate.

374
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,815
You just stay put, Chief.

375
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:23,584
Maybe I should just quit while I am here.

376
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,119
Where are you going?

377
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,056
That is right. Yes.

378
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,858
You should be the Chief.

379
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:32,759
Do not be like this.

380
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,362
I only got this position
because my in-law got fired

381
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,531
thanks to your wife.

382
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:39,233
I am just a pathetic, incompetent man.

383
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,435
How can someone like me
who cannot handle crises

384
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:45,939
overcome such a massive situation?

385
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:49,042
Listen. Is this the time to be weak?

386
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:50,677
Remember this.

387
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:52,412
The true leader of Cheongsu County

388
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,781
is not the Magistrate, but you, Chief.

389
00:21:55,215 --> 00:21:58,151
Nonsense. Me, a leader?

390
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,888
This is not working. Repeat after me.

391
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:04,057
I am amazing. I am the best.

392
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:07,127
- What are you doing?
- Just repeat. Come on.

393
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,429
I am amazing. I am the best.

394
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:13,400
I am amazing. I am the best.

395
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,269
Louder, with confidence.

396
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:16,637
I am...

397
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:20,207
amazing.

398
00:22:20,941 --> 00:22:22,009
I am

399
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:24,311
the best.

400
00:22:28,282 --> 00:22:30,784
I am amazing.

401
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:35,022
I am the best.

402
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:36,423
Yes, that is it.

403
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,691
I am the best.

404
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,195
Yes, I am the leader.

405
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:44,631
I care the most for Cheongsu County.

406
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,333
I will overcome this crisis

407
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,203
and restore everything to its place.
Understood?

408
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,640
Yes, I can do this.

409
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,543
You really are a reliable man.

410
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,382
Thank you.

411
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,752
I truly have no one else to depend on
but you and your wife.

412
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:08,021
I...

413
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:14,928
I am the best.

414
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,331
On my way here,

415
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:20,133
I almost got my hair grabbed
countless times.

416
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:21,635
State your purpose.

417
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,170
Yes.

418
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:25,038
I...

419
00:23:26,106 --> 00:23:29,676
I have done so many awful things

420
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:34,915
to you before, but please...

421
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,686
would you help me?

422
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,589
What would that be?

423
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:43,924
Pardon?

424
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:49,596
What awful things have you done to me?

425
00:23:52,332 --> 00:23:54,334
How petty.

426
00:23:57,404 --> 00:24:01,241
How could I possibly recount
all of them

427
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:04,578
when there are so many?

428
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:05,913
So you do know.

429
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,682
But is that not all in the past?

430
00:24:08,682 --> 00:24:11,518
Everyone makes mistakes, do they not?

431
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,055
And we are neighbors

432
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,757
and friends in Cheongsu County, right?

433
00:24:18,392 --> 00:24:20,260
No.

434
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,896
I am not asking for you to help me.

435
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:26,133
I am asking you
to help the scammed villagers.

436
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,101
If I do not assist you,

437
00:24:29,102 --> 00:24:31,305
you will be accused as an accomplice

438
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:34,107
and will have to pay
and even face imprisonment.

439
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,008
What?

440
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:40,647
Tell me everything from the beginning.

441
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:43,116
Yes.

442
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,954
The Magistrate introduced that man to me.

443
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:49,823
He claimed that eternal ginseng

444
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:54,795
is resistant to pests, drought,

445
00:24:54,795 --> 00:24:56,363
and has a growth period
of only three months,

446
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:58,732
making it a treasure-like crop.

447
00:25:00,801 --> 00:25:03,003
Selling such a valuable thing
to Cheongsu County.

448
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,905
How generous of him.

449
00:25:04,905 --> 00:25:07,841
I only suggested it
because Cheongsu County

450
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:09,676
was facing a farming crisis.

451
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,311
I have not been sleeping well lately.

452
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:14,014
The cries of those poor souls reach
over the walls

453
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:16,049
and it is truly heartbreaking.

454
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,985
So heartbreaking

455
00:25:17,985 --> 00:25:20,821
that you would cut tongues, break legs,
and bury alive?

456
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,655
What?

457
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:24,091
Did you not hear me?

458
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:25,926
Your hearing seems poor.

459
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:30,497
How exactly do you know this Heo Soon?

460
00:25:31,164 --> 00:25:33,267
Do rural folks not know even this?

461
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:36,003
Heo Soon is a well-known figure.

462
00:25:36,003 --> 00:25:38,639
He used to be a famous doctor in Hanyang.

463
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:40,507
If you doubt me, go investigate.

464
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:43,710
Why should we investigate?
You should be the one looking into it.

465
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,180
You must think I am a swindler,
so I am suggesting you investigate.

466
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,750
No one said you were a swindler.

467
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:53,353
But if you insist, we can look into it.

468
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:56,023
While we are at it,
we will also investigate the damages.

469
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,324
You should submit a report,

470
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:00,194
request assistance from the Magistrate
of Hamcheong County, and conduct a search.

471
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:01,195
And...

472
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,698
He is the father-in-law
of the Minister of Taxation.

473
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,233
Please tread lightly.

474
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:12,306
Since you introduced Heo Soon,

475
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:14,208
you know this makes you
an accomplice, right?

476
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:17,377
So, are you going to sue me?

477
00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:21,181
Well, possibly?

478
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:22,182
No.

479
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:26,320
Commoners cannot sue the high class.
You should know this.

480
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,723
Local officials or commoners
cannot sue Magistrates.

481
00:26:30,224 --> 00:26:31,892
Let us stop here.

482
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,729
Magistrate, you seem misinformed.

483
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,783
If a governor commits
corruption or illegal acts,

484
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:39,733
the victim can report it

485
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,002
to the provincial office.

486
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:43,203
Really?

487
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:46,340
Our Special Inspector Seong's wife is
a legal advocate.

488
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:51,178
Are you threatening me
when you are merely a Special Inspector?

489
00:26:51,812 --> 00:26:53,714
What is there to feel threatened about?

490
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:55,849
Do you have a guilty conscience?

491
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,618
What would I have to feel guilty about?

492
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,889
- Let us leave, Chief.
- Yes.

493
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:03,724
I am still speaking here.

494
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:05,626
Apologies.

495
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:09,763
He has lost his memory,
and also his manners. Please excuse him.

496
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:12,165
Insolent little brat.

497
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,636
What? Brat?

498
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:19,573
Did you hear that?
It was just a mumble to myself.

499
00:27:20,374 --> 00:27:22,509
Yes, my hearing is quite sharp.

500
00:27:24,178 --> 00:27:26,146
Then, we will take our leave.

501
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:31,418
Does he think Cheongsu County is
his backyard?

502
00:27:31,418 --> 00:27:33,620
Why is he acting like this?

503
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:35,289
Is he a dog?

504
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,658
Yes, I am a dog.

505
00:27:37,658 --> 00:27:38,992
- Why?
- I am a dog.

506
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,427
I was just mumbling to myself.

507
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:42,663
He cannot hear well anyway, right?

508
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:43,931
You did not hear, did you?

509
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:45,799
We will take our leave.

510
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:53,907
The Magistrate is only pretending
to search for him.

511
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:56,510
It seems he will drag it out
until everyone gives up.

512
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,945
From what I found,

513
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:00,781
Heo Soon was indeed
a renowned doctor in Hanyang.

514
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:03,617
Even the people at the pharmacy
in Cheongsu County know his name.

515
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,354
Still, I cannot trust Kim Nak Soo,

516
00:28:07,354 --> 00:28:10,324
so I will send someone
to find Heo Soon myself.

517
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:13,694
Meanwhile, I will meet the usurer
who loaned money

518
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,362
to the villagers.

519
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:18,632
They demanded immediate repayment
after hearing about the scam.

520
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:19,933
I will try to negotiate to buy some time.

521
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:22,169
Will they agree?

522
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:25,572
The law caps interest rates
at 20 percent per year.

523
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,141
It seems most victims borrowed
at higher rates.

524
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:29,910
So

525
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,813
you plan to use that illegality
to buy some time?

526
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:36,450
- Yes.
- What a clever wife you are.

527
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,721
Are you joking again? I am serious.

528
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,391
What good is being serious
about something already done?

529
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:45,259
Come here.

530
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,093
What?

531
00:28:48,362 --> 00:28:49,496
Stop.

532
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:56,103
What are you doing there?

533
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:59,873
Have you never seen
a loving couple before?

534
00:28:59,873 --> 00:29:02,309
Of course, I have.

535
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,844
We have the Sweethearts at home.

536
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:07,214
Did you collect all the damage reports,
Kkeutdongi?

537
00:29:07,214 --> 00:29:09,516
Yes, but not all.

538
00:29:09,516 --> 00:29:11,518
But most are gathered.

539
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:16,356
But there are strange rumors spreading
in the marketplace.

540
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,091
Strange rumors?

541
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,593
What rumors?

542
00:29:21,728 --> 00:29:23,063
(Closed Temporarily)

543
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,364
My goodness.

544
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:27,100
Look at the empty streets.

545
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,502
Even the pharmacy is shut.

546
00:29:29,036 --> 00:29:31,104
Cheongsu County is really in trouble.

547
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:34,341
How can there be sellers without buyers?

548
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:35,275
Exactly.

549
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:37,744
- Guys.
- Yes?

550
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,781
I heard something strange.

551
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,616
- About your Madam.
- Yes.

552
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:43,917
They say she was a servant like us.

553
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,354
What? What nonsense is this now?

554
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:48,856
- Our Madam?
- Yes.

555
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:51,892
The Magistrate's daughter
was asking people earlier.

556
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,627
Is she out of her mind?

557
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,963
Where is this nonsense coming from?

558
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,331
I am not the one who started it.

559
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:00,968
- You should leave now.
- What?

560
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,736
Listen up.

561
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,072
If you go around spreading this nonsense,

562
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:08,308
I will sew your mouth shut.
Do you hear me?

563
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,377
Baseless rumors are nothing new.

564
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:12,279
Do not get so worked up, Sweetheart.

565
00:30:12,579 --> 00:30:15,182
Just go. See you next time.

566
00:30:15,182 --> 00:30:17,584
How did the Magistrate's daughter
find out?

567
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:25,559
What brings you to drink with me today?

568
00:30:28,128 --> 00:30:31,331
How long has it been
since you came to Cheongsu County?

569
00:30:37,004 --> 00:30:38,839
Did you hear the rumors

570
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,808
that I was once a servant?

571
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:45,012
Yes.

572
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,515
The Magistrate's daughter came by.

573
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:51,852
She said your name was Goodeoki.

574
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:54,421
She proudly claimed she named you that

575
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,223
to make you live like a maggot.

576
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,062
When did she appear here?

577
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,965
When exactly did she return from Qing?

578
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:09,870
They say you are the most respected woman
in this village.

579
00:31:10,437 --> 00:31:13,006
A runaway slave guilty of high treason

580
00:31:13,006 --> 00:31:15,008
pretending to be nobility must be caught.

581
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:17,277
High treason?

582
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:19,479
She almost killed my father.

583
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,350
The scar on his face. She caused it.

584
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:28,021
What reason would a servant have
to attempt killing her master?

585
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:31,425
She refused and fled when I ordered her
to serve him in his chamber.

586
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,193
What?

587
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,530
She should have been grateful
to be made a concubine

588
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,898
since she is a mere servant.

589
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:43,504
Instead of dragging this on,
investigate immediately.

590
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,006
She ran away ten years ago, yes?

591
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,407
Yes.

592
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:51,178
Legal Advocate Ok came here
long before that.

593
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,480
Is that true?

594
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,250
Based on a mere resemblance,
you roamed Cheongsu County

595
00:31:56,517 --> 00:31:58,852
slandering Legal Advocate Ok?

596
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:01,388
It is not slander. It is the truth.

597
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:04,958
Legal Advocate Ok is the daughter
of Lord Ok Pil Seung

598
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,194
and the eldest daughter-in-law
of the esteemed Magistrate Seong.

599
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:09,663
Her husband aced the state exam,
and her brother-in-law was

600
00:32:09,663 --> 00:32:11,265
the top scholar on the national exam.

601
00:32:12,232 --> 00:32:14,935
The most respected woman
in Cheongsu County is not me,

602
00:32:15,536 --> 00:32:16,970
but Legal Advocate Ok.

603
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,372
You are being deceived.

604
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:21,041
Everyone in Cheongsu County
is being deceived.

605
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:24,511
Do you suffer from delusions?

606
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:25,646
How dare you

607
00:32:26,413 --> 00:32:29,082
insult the wife
of the Minister of Taxation?

608
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:30,984
Does the Minister's lawful wife know

609
00:32:31,685 --> 00:32:33,921
that his concubine parades
as the legal wife?

610
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,925
You want to protect the Magistrate
who has become involved in a fraud case

611
00:32:37,925 --> 00:32:41,061
by smearing the victims' legal advocate.
I get that.

612
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:45,299
But if you continue, the legal wife
will pull out your hair and punish you.

613
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,836
So restrain yourself. Do you understand?

614
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:57,644
I mimicked the Chief Lady.

615
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,615
I did not realize provoking people
could be so entertaining.

616
00:33:01,615 --> 00:33:02,950
I should have tried this often.

617
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,355
But

618
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,159
why did you lie?

619
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,029
I came to Cheongsu County

620
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:19,032
nine years ago.

621
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:24,505
I just wanted to avoid

622
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:26,607
scandals.

623
00:33:32,946 --> 00:33:35,349
- Chair Lady.
- The Magistrate's scarred face.

624
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:41,255
Was it truly your doing?

625
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,194
It was a sickle,

626
00:33:49,396 --> 00:33:50,430
not a knife.

627
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:01,842
I hoped it was not true.

628
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,247
I am sorry.

629
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:13,820
Since when were you not Goodeoki

630
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,290
but Ok Tae Young?

631
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,930
When Lord Ok Pil Seung
was on his way to Cheongsu County,

632
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:28,335
he was killed by bandits
at an inn near a mountain.

633
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,006
Lady Tae Young died there too.

634
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,376
How...

635
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,979
Only I, a worker at the inn, survived.

636
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:43,750
When I regained consciousness,

637
00:34:46,353 --> 00:34:47,988
I was in Cheongsu County.

638
00:34:48,655 --> 00:34:50,791
Does your late grandmother know?

639
00:34:51,058 --> 00:34:52,593
My grandmother...

640
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,930
knew everything,

641
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,568
but still accepted me as Lady Tae Young.

642
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,738
What an audacious woman...

643
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,609
to send a runaway slave
as a Magistrate's daughter-in-law.

644
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,785
Your master has appeared.

645
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:22,389
Why do you not flee?

646
00:35:23,824 --> 00:35:25,959
If they find evidence amidst the uproar,

647
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:27,694
you will be killed.

648
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,998
Magistrate Kim Nak Soo...

649
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:36,570
buried my sick mother...

650
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:41,808
alive in the ground.

651
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:44,811
What?

652
00:35:44,811 --> 00:35:46,046
Such a man

653
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,716
is threatening Cheongsu County,
a place akin to my hometown.

654
00:35:51,685 --> 00:35:53,820
How can I possibly run away?

655
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,758
Moreover,

656
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:02,563
as penance for living in the lady's stead,

657
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,633
I must live as a legal advocate,
Lady Tae Young's dream,

658
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,471
and help people.

659
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,557
Once I drink this,

660
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,596
I will forget everything I heard today.

661
00:36:55,682 --> 00:36:58,118
What kind of wretched events are these?

662
00:36:58,118 --> 00:36:59,019
Exactly.

663
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:01,121
Just when life seemed
to settle down for you two,

664
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:03,690
those crazies came
to Cheongsu County again.

665
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,692
Should we really
just sit around like this?

666
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:10,197
Right, you cannot leave
while Cheongsu County is in turmoil.

667
00:37:10,197 --> 00:37:14,301
But with that Magistrate's insane daughter
digging around everywhere,

668
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:16,370
we need to come up with a plan.

669
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,337
Just wait.

670
00:37:18,372 --> 00:37:20,107
It seems he is scheming something.

671
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,178
Scheming what?

672
00:37:27,281 --> 00:37:29,716
The setup is perfect,

673
00:37:30,984 --> 00:37:33,987
but I need actors.

674
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,597
Why are you people looking for me?

675
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:46,400
Lord Bak Jun Gi sent us with a message.

676
00:37:47,234 --> 00:37:48,902
The Lord? What for?

677
00:37:48,902 --> 00:37:49,870
It is Goodeoki.

678
00:37:50,237 --> 00:37:51,905
We have captured her.

679
00:37:52,172 --> 00:37:53,140
What?

680
00:37:53,707 --> 00:37:55,676
Will she really fall for it?

681
00:37:59,213 --> 00:38:00,781
It will not be easy.

682
00:38:00,914 --> 00:38:01,882
Of course.

683
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:05,118
She is greedy, calculating,
and mean-spirited.

684
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,520
She is not an easy one.

685
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,088
That is why you need to do well.

686
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:10,524
I have searched all over Joseon for...

687
00:38:10,524 --> 00:38:11,758
No, this is wrong.

688
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:15,863
There. You have the perfect face
for disguise, Dokki.

689
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:18,799
Honestly, I have no idea
what is going on right now.

690
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,868
You do not need to know anything.

691
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:22,836
Really? Then I will know nothing.

692
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:24,438
It is better than getting a headache.

693
00:38:24,872 --> 00:38:27,274
Are you sure this will work?
Would Kkeutdongi not be better?

694
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:29,142
No. He is too clever.

695
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:31,111
If he finds out, his head will explode.

696
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,480
Are you sure you can handle it?

697
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,650
Of course. I was in a troupe for years.

698
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,820
Honestly, I am the best at acting.
I even memorized the lines.

699
00:38:40,053 --> 00:38:41,488
How many times must I say this?

700
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:45,058
Lines are not memorized,
they come naturally.

701
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:47,628
Just immerse yourself.
Imagine you are in this moment.

702
00:38:47,628 --> 00:38:49,029
Become one with it.

703
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,030
You wench!

704
00:38:50,731 --> 00:38:52,900
I am sorry, I just got into it.

705
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,301
- Well done.
- Right.

706
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:55,969
Yes, immerse yourself like that.

707
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:57,871
He is already acting like a bounty hunter.
Try it yourself.

708
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,072
Immerse.

709
00:38:59,806 --> 00:39:03,076
I was there.

710
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:04,011
No...

711
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:10,851
I was actually there.

712
00:39:12,786 --> 00:39:13,820
Are you sure?

713
00:39:15,656 --> 00:39:17,591
Did you really capture Goodeoki?

714
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:21,261
Yes. Even after searching all over Joseon,
we could not find her.

715
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:23,997
But she was in Soonpyeong near Hanyang.

716
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:26,667
She is truly a clever woman.

717
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:30,838
Where exactly in Soonpyeong?

718
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,173
Haengrigol.

719
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:36,310
A village filled with ginkgo trees
at the entrance, just like its name.

720
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,212
We stopped at a guesthouse briefly,

721
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,147
and we found her by chance.

722
00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:43,217
She fell in love with the innkeeper,

723
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:45,986
got married, and even had kids.

724
00:39:47,988 --> 00:39:48,856
Really?

725
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:50,624
She was so fierce,

726
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:53,160
wielding a sickle and charging at us.

727
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,128
We nearly died.

728
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,564
She has not changed.

729
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:01,134
She scaled walls like a professional
and ran faster than ever.

730
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:03,136
We barely caught her

731
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:05,138
and came here right after.

732
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:23,891
Geumbok, pack up.

733
00:40:24,157 --> 00:40:25,726
We are heading to Hanyang tomorrow.

734
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:33,567
This is exhausting. My goodness.

735
00:40:38,005 --> 00:40:40,574
Finding Goodeoki truly proves
Lord Bak's prowess.

736
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:41,909
Indeed, it does.

737
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:43,577
Are you happy now?

738
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:48,248
Get going and tell the Lord
everything here is under control.

739
00:40:48,248 --> 00:40:49,349
Yes, Father.

740
00:41:00,894 --> 00:41:01,728
Excuse me.

741
00:41:04,231 --> 00:41:06,433
Madam asked me to deliver this.

742
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:09,970
She packed medicine and money.

743
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,441
I am taking good care of her,
so do not worry.

744
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,111
Thank you.

745
00:41:19,513 --> 00:41:21,582
Take care.

746
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:37,998
We are collecting data on suspected cases
of a strange disease,

747
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:41,468
but we have yet to determine
the transmission routes or cause.

748
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:44,605
It is spreading faster than anticipated.

749
00:41:44,605 --> 00:41:46,773
We are preparing quarantine spaces
outside the capital.

750
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:50,077
His Majesty is concerned

751
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,512
about public unrest.

752
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:55,816
I heard you reported Cheongsu County's
affairs to His Majesty yourself.

753
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,752
I apologize.

754
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:01,221
I received a letter from my sister-in-law,

755
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,790
and when His Majesty inquired
about my pale complexion,

756
00:42:04,258 --> 00:42:06,059
I explained the matter myself.

757
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:10,030
His Majesty has ordered
recommending an Inspector General.

758
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:13,367
Would I be suitable?

759
00:42:14,568 --> 00:42:15,969
We have the right candidate.

760
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:18,772
Come in.

761
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:29,116
To be appointed as an Inspector General

762
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:31,251
right after joining
the Ministry of Constitution.

763
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:34,555
It is truly an honorable return.

764
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:38,325
Will you not accompany me?

765
00:42:38,325 --> 00:42:39,526
No.

766
00:42:39,526 --> 00:42:42,062
How could I shamelessly go
to Cheongsu County?

767
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:45,532
If your mother ever asks about me,

768
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:48,635
just say I am doing fine.

769
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:52,272
You are unwell. I hope you return
to your hometown to rest.

770
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:53,307
I...

771
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:56,543
I cannot bring myself
to pass the gates of the Seong family.

772
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:59,613
How angry would
the late Magistrate Seong be with me?

773
00:42:59,613 --> 00:43:01,281
Is that not all in the past?

774
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,617
Perhaps weakening health brings
a weakened heart.

775
00:43:04,518 --> 00:43:07,054
I cannot stop thinking of my wrongdoings.

776
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:11,325
How are your symptoms?

777
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:14,361
- Let me examine you.
- Do not come closer.

778
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:15,896
I need to check.

779
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,030
Stay there.

780
00:43:29,142 --> 00:43:30,210
That is...

781
00:43:34,214 --> 00:43:37,885
I am being punished.

782
00:43:42,155 --> 00:43:45,359
I should have mentioned
Bak Jun Gi's name then.

783
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:53,367
Put it here.

784
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,776
Gather all the finest
medicinal ingredients available.

785
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:03,677
Yes.

786
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:05,646
Spread rumors of a strange disease.

787
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:07,948
Once quarantine is enforced,

788
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:10,450
the value will skyrocket.

789
00:44:10,884 --> 00:44:12,019
Understood.

790
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:29,803
Sending an Inspector General?

791
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:32,606
But no formal report must have been filed.
Where was it requested?

792
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,374
Cheongsu County.

793
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,110
It seems Ok Tae Young contacted
her brother-in-law

794
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,012
to reach His Majesty directly.

795
00:44:39,546 --> 00:44:40,714
Ok Tae Young.

796
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:45,419
Where is Goodeoki?
Where is she being held?

797
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:47,321
Where is she? Answer me!

798
00:44:47,321 --> 00:44:49,256
Are you ignoring me?

799
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:50,557
What is this commotion?

800
00:44:51,625 --> 00:44:52,926
Where is Goodeoki?

801
00:44:55,095 --> 00:44:57,431
You claimed to have captured her.
Do you not know?

802
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:59,166
What on earth are you talking about?

803
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:15,582
Goodeoki deceived me.

804
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:16,950
She deceived me.

805
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:19,019
Go fetch water.

806
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:21,822
You said you would give me a wedding gift.
Why are you not keeping your promise?

807
00:45:22,956 --> 00:45:24,458
Are you not listening to me?

808
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:28,629
I said, be quiet.

809
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,698
Why do you not listen to me?

810
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,039
From now on, obey the first time I say so.
Understood?

811
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:52,219
- My goodness.
- He was not there.

812
00:45:53,187 --> 00:45:56,490
Then let us conclude the search
of Daepung County.

813
00:45:57,424 --> 00:46:01,495
And as team one headed
to Chilgok County today,

814
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:05,399
team two shall proceed
to Sinreung County now.

815
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:07,868
What? Now?

816
00:46:07,868 --> 00:46:09,369
But we just got back.

817
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:11,305
Everyone has worked hard.

818
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:14,074
Can we not rest a bit, Special Inspector?

819
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:16,643
- Is that so?
- Yes.

820
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,545
Then let us rest today.

821
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:21,014
Let us reconvene refreshed in the morning.

822
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:22,749
- You are dismissed.
- Rest well.

823
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:28,021
Deokje County is in Jeolla-do, is it not?

824
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:30,924
It seems the scam
with eternal ginseng here

825
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:33,293
resembles what happened in our village.

826
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:44,538
But by now,
Kim So Hye should have reached Hanyang.

827
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:47,541
Why is it still so quiet?

828
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:50,377
I told you we have countermeasures.
Do not worry.

829
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:54,715
For someone telling me not to worry,
you seem awfully worried.

830
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:57,784
The affected areas are not just
in Chungcheong-do.

831
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,486
There are victims in Jeolla-do too.

832
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:02,990
So you mean this Heo Soon sold
eternal ginseng seeds there as well?

833
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,225
Neither Heo Soon nor Eternal ginseng.

834
00:47:05,526 --> 00:47:06,927
But there is a commonality.

835
00:47:08,228 --> 00:47:09,329
What is it?

836
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,265
They target impoverished regions

837
00:47:11,598 --> 00:47:13,500
and lure the villagers to invest.

838
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:20,707
If we wait, will we get ours too?

839
00:47:21,308 --> 00:47:22,976
Why is the line not moving?

840
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,019
Thank you very much.

841
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,455
How could I not?
We must help during tough times.

842
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:39,092
We are not in a position
to worry about others.

843
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:40,627
Thank you.

844
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:43,964
But what business does
the Chair Lady have here?

845
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:45,666
What about the Chief Lady?

846
00:47:45,666 --> 00:47:47,501
How could she come out?

847
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:49,303
After committing such a crime,

848
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:51,271
she is fortunate not to be exiled.

849
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:54,474
The Chief is taking responsibility
as you can see.

850
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:57,344
He sold his household and slaves,

851
00:47:57,644 --> 00:48:01,181
yet he is distributing it all
instead of repaying his debts.

852
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:07,287
We ran out of rice long ago.

853
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:10,524
The fall barley and wheat are gone too.
What will we do now?

854
00:48:10,524 --> 00:48:11,592
You are right.

855
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:14,995
Even the unripe grains seem
to have been steamed and eaten.

856
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:16,430
We will all perish

857
00:48:17,264 --> 00:48:19,533
and will not make it to next year.

858
00:48:23,871 --> 00:48:24,838
My goodness.

859
00:48:25,138 --> 00:48:26,206
Good heavens.

860
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,475
What is all this? My goodness.

861
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:30,844
Be careful.

862
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:34,147
I asked for just a little,
but she sent so much.

863
00:48:34,147 --> 00:48:37,084
Do not worry.
We kept enough for ourselves.

864
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:40,187
This precious aid,
not even granted by the King...

865
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:41,555
What else can we do?

866
00:48:41,555 --> 00:48:44,057
People have stripped the bark
and roots of trees.

867
00:48:44,057 --> 00:48:46,059
Mt. Unbong is now bare.

868
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,362
I even heard

869
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:51,164
someone boiled pinecones
and they tore their bottoms apart.

870
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:54,101
Is that already a rumor?

871
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:55,502
I heard it is leaking.

872
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:06,747
Mother.

873
00:49:06,747 --> 00:49:07,748
Deok Hun.

874
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:10,851
Deok Hun?

875
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:21,695
Do you truly not recognize me?

876
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:24,998
You are too good-looking to forget
even after a glance.

877
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:26,366
But I cannot remember.

878
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:29,570
Memory loss is this terrifying.

879
00:49:29,803 --> 00:49:33,373
You are jesting. It is not like you.

880
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:38,111
Is it?

881
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:42,583
But why seek this place
before visiting the office?

882
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:46,787
Lord Heo Jong Moon
of the Royal Tribunal sent me.

883
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:49,456
Lord Heo Jong Moon?

884
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,192
Minister of Taxation Bak Jun Gi

885
00:49:52,192 --> 00:49:54,361
moves through offices
with the Chief Minister's support.

886
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:56,897
He leads in exploiting citizens
for personal gain.

887
00:49:57,698 --> 00:49:59,833
He is a loyal treasurer
for the Chief Minister.

888
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:03,837
The way to undermine the Chief Minister's
grip on the nation is

889
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,473
to stop Bak Jun Gi
and cut off his financial resources.

890
00:50:08,242 --> 00:50:11,278
We must investigate whether the fraud
cases in the southern provinces

891
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:13,313
are connected to Bak Jun Gi.

892
00:50:14,581 --> 00:50:16,383
This must be done discreetly.

893
00:50:17,084 --> 00:50:19,653
Kim Nak Soo, Bak Jun Gi's father-in-law,

894
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:22,256
was assigned to Cheongsu County,
and this trouble began right away.

895
00:50:22,256 --> 00:50:24,358
It is harder
to believe it is not connected.

896
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:26,093
But for now, these are mere suspicions.

897
00:50:26,593 --> 00:50:30,597
We were also becoming aware
this is not limited to Cheongsu County.

898
00:50:30,597 --> 00:50:31,798
Is that so?

899
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:34,701
I will share our investigation process
and gathered information.

900
00:50:54,188 --> 00:50:55,122
Wait.

901
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:56,623
My goodness, what are you doing?

902
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:01,562
Chun Sik.

903
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,097
Chun Sik.

904
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:09,369
Why is this still here? Did you pocket it?

905
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,905
Pocket it? This has always been mine.

906
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,675
No.

907
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:18,912
There is nothing of ours left.
We have nothing.

908
00:51:19,646 --> 00:51:20,781
Hand it over.

909
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:23,984
This is for Woongyi's trip to Hanyang
for his higher examination.

910
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:26,987
That does not matter at the moment.

911
00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:29,823
What could matter more than this?

912
00:51:29,823 --> 00:51:31,525
How could you be so heartless?

913
00:51:31,525 --> 00:51:33,160
You are the one
who brought Cheongsu County to ruin.

914
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,263
That is why we sold the servants,
the land,

915
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:39,066
the cattle, the chickens, and everything.

916
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:42,836
Let us at least use this for Woongyi.

917
00:51:42,836 --> 00:51:44,371
Please, I beg you.

918
00:51:47,574 --> 00:51:48,642
We cannot.

919
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:52,179
Selling this could help everyone survive
for a few more days.

920
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:55,415
Since when have you cared about others?
Who do you think you are?

921
00:51:55,682 --> 00:51:56,683
I am the Chief.

922
00:51:56,683 --> 00:51:59,887
I am Cha Chun Sik,
Chief of the Cheongsu County's Yuhyangso.

923
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:01,221
What is good about being a Chief?

924
00:52:02,222 --> 00:52:03,690
You got that title by default.

925
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:07,394
Madam.

926
00:52:10,397 --> 00:52:13,534
Let us end this now.

927
00:52:16,603 --> 00:52:17,437
What?

928
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:23,010
When everyone demanded I cast you out,

929
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,112
I pretended not to hear.

930
00:52:25,913 --> 00:52:28,615
I thought you did what you did
to raise the children to success.

931
00:52:28,615 --> 00:52:30,384
I tried to understand.

932
00:52:30,684 --> 00:52:33,987
I defended you,
no matter what anyone said.

933
00:52:33,987 --> 00:52:34,955
Why?

934
00:52:35,722 --> 00:52:39,326
Because I still found you beautiful.

935
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,461
But now?

936
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:46,066
I can no longer bear to watch
how you behave.

937
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,302
Chun Sik.

938
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,338
Leave this house.

939
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:55,142
I no longer see you
as the Madam of this home.

940
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:57,044
I...

941
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,679
I will change.

942
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:00,447
Here, take this.

943
00:53:06,086 --> 00:53:07,487
Chun Sik.

944
00:53:07,487 --> 00:53:09,089
I will change.

945
00:53:09,923 --> 00:53:11,124
It is too late.

946
00:53:11,124 --> 00:53:12,826
Chun Sik.

947
00:53:13,126 --> 00:53:16,029
Please, I will do whatever you say.

948
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:18,765
Why are you doing this to me?

949
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:24,671
Then will you go to the Yuhyangso
and assist the Chair Lady from tomorrow?

950
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:26,206
No, I cannot.

951
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:29,676
If I go there, people will eat me alive.

952
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:33,547
Then will you go to Mt. Unbong
to gather greens?

953
00:53:34,615 --> 00:53:37,484
Fine, I will go.

954
00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:54,234
A tour of Jeolla-do performances

955
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:56,403
could earn us funds
to hold out for months.

956
00:53:57,037 --> 00:53:59,006
What happened
to the money you earned so far?

957
00:53:59,273 --> 00:54:03,510
I split it fairly
when the troupe disbanded.

958
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:05,379
And your share?

959
00:54:05,379 --> 00:54:07,014
Could you bring that out?

960
00:54:07,514 --> 00:54:08,649
I spent it all

961
00:54:09,516 --> 00:54:11,351
looking for your father.

962
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:13,387
I see.

963
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:15,055
Wait.

964
00:54:16,256 --> 00:54:17,090
Why?

965
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:19,493
Man Seok probably has money.

966
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:22,095
I surely gave him his share as well.

967
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:26,033
That is why he is always clutching
that small bundle of his.

968
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:28,001
Even during searches,
he clutches it tightly...

969
00:54:28,001 --> 00:54:30,671
Wait a second.
How do we get it out of him?

970
00:54:31,905 --> 00:54:35,642
My goodness, what a pitiful sight.

971
00:54:35,642 --> 00:54:38,946
Exactly. They look just like beggars.

972
00:54:38,946 --> 00:54:39,880
You are back.

973
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:43,116
How far did you go?

974
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:45,219
Take off your bundle.

975
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:46,286
No, it is fine.

976
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:48,222
- It must be heavy. Take it off.
- It is not heavy. I am fine.

977
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:50,691
So, what happened? Did you find him?

978
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,392
- We could not find him,
- Yes.

979
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:53,894
but we gathered some information.

980
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,062
What is it?

981
00:54:55,762 --> 00:54:59,700
Apparently, Heo Soon was cast out
by his family in Hanyang

982
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,934
due to gambling.

983
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:02,636
- Gambling?
- Yes.

984
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,606
He lost all his money
at gambling dens in Jongno.

985
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:07,674
And what are we supposed to do
with that information?

986
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:10,611
We should set a trap.

987
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:13,914
- A trap?
- We bait him.

988
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:15,215
Bait him?

989
00:55:16,216 --> 00:55:17,618
We will set up a gambling den.

990
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,053
What do you mean?

991
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:22,923
How frustrating.
How did you even pass the state exam?

992
00:55:23,957 --> 00:55:25,859
- I may look clueless, but
- Come here.

993
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:37,070
(Change your life.
A chance at instant fortune)

994
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:38,972
(The greatest gambling den
at Geumbawigol, at five)

995
00:55:39,673 --> 00:55:43,110
- Geumbawigol, at five.
- Yes, only at five.

996
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,511
Geumbawigol does not open every day.

997
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:47,915
High payouts, fast games, clean players.

998
00:55:48,248 --> 00:55:50,250
If you want to be rich, come visit.

999
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,988
Change your life. You can be rich too.

1000
00:55:55,222 --> 00:55:57,391
Yes, let us all become rich.

1001
00:55:57,824 --> 00:55:58,926
At five.

1002
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:09,636
Come on, step right up.

1003
00:56:09,636 --> 00:56:11,538
Let the guests in.

1004
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:13,173
You just wait.

1005
00:56:14,107 --> 00:56:15,609
I will pay you back soon.

1006
00:56:15,609 --> 00:56:17,044
Hurry up, just give it to me.

1007
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:20,547
You are really something.

1008
00:56:21,315 --> 00:56:22,850
This amount should do just fine.

1009
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,785
This is an heirloom of my family.

1010
00:56:24,785 --> 00:56:26,286
Well, take it or leave it.

1011
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:28,989
Why waste time complaining?
Go inside and win more.

1012
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:30,657
- Take it.
- Fine.

1013
00:56:32,092 --> 00:56:34,094
Spin it quickly, hurry up.

1014
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:38,999
My goodness, this is my first time
visiting a place like this.

1015
00:56:38,999 --> 00:56:41,034
Could you stay with me? I am scared.

1016
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:42,836
Stop making it obvious.

1017
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:43,871
Where do we go now?

1018
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,539
Just go.

1019
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:53,247
- Show me your cards.
- Half.

1020
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:55,482
Six.

1021
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:59,386
Is that Heo Soon?

1022
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,490
Where did he go?

1023
00:57:15,502 --> 00:57:18,138
Did your wife not find out?

1024
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:20,174
- Please, deal properly.
- Sure.

1025
00:57:20,174 --> 00:57:22,943
This should be about right.

1026
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,344
But what is your family name?

1027
00:57:24,344 --> 00:57:25,245
Heo.

1028
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:27,314
Heo? And your name?

1029
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:28,448
Soeddung.

1030
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,484
Enjoy your time, Heo Soeddung.

1031
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,956
What? They went to look for Heo Soon?
Where to?

1032
00:57:36,156 --> 00:57:37,457
I am not sure about that.

1033
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:42,763
What if they find him?

1034
00:57:43,897 --> 00:57:45,132
Are we not supposed to find him?

1035
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:49,970
Do you have a death wish?
You took those drinks happily before.

1036
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,773
It was you who drank, Magistrate.
We did not touch any of it...

1037
00:57:56,276 --> 00:57:59,780
Keep talking nonsense,
and I will cut your tongue out.

1038
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,381
- Got it?
- Got it.

1039
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:05,018
Get lost.

1040
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:07,487
Get lost!

1041
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:23,504
Here we go now.

1042
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:27,641
Pick your cards.

1043
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,745
Be bold, pick your cards.

1044
00:58:32,946 --> 00:58:34,248
Let us see.

1045
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:38,585
- My goodness.
- I am going all in.

1046
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:39,953
Throwing money around?

1047
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,055
Then die.

1048
00:58:42,055 --> 00:58:43,390
What a bluff.

1049
00:58:45,058 --> 00:58:47,828
Are you all just bluffing?

1050
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,330
My card is bad, I will die.

1051
00:58:51,665 --> 00:58:52,766
What about you?

1052
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,234
Me?

1053
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,738
I...

1054
00:59:01,175 --> 00:59:02,609
No retractions.

1055
00:59:02,609 --> 00:59:03,877
No takebacks.

1056
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,513
Make your choice.

1057
00:59:08,015 --> 00:59:09,516
How could he bet everything?

1058
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:10,851
I have four pairs.

1059
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:12,853
I have seven pairs.

1060
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:13,954
What?

1061
00:59:13,954 --> 00:59:15,422
He will take everything.

1062
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:18,892
I have nine pairs.

1063
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:29,069
Today is not my day.
The mighty Heo Soon is out of luck.

1064
00:59:32,005 --> 00:59:33,040
Are you Heo Soon?

1065
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:34,708
Yes, why?

1066
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:37,477
- Are you Heo Soon?
- Do you know me?

1067
00:59:38,445 --> 00:59:41,248
The Heo Soon from Hamcheong County?
Is it you?

1068
00:59:41,248 --> 00:59:42,549
How do you know me?

1069
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:43,784
Everyone knows me?

1070
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:45,519
Nice to meet you.

1071
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:46,486
Yes.

1072
00:59:46,486 --> 00:59:48,856
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1073
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:51,325
Everyone seems happy to see me.

1074
00:59:54,061 --> 00:59:54,995
What is this?

1075
00:59:54,995 --> 00:59:56,830
We got him!

1076
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:59,233
- Let us go!
- What is going on here?

1077
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:04,705
Money!

1078
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:22,556
We caught the culprit.

1079
01:00:31,532 --> 01:00:33,400
Heo Soon, you scoundrel.

1080
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,003
Give me my money back!

1081
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:37,571
- Hold on.
- What is this?

1082
01:00:37,571 --> 01:00:41,175
Why are you acting like this?
Will you untie me?

1083
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:43,944
Why would we untie you?
So you can run away?

1084
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:46,747
Where? Where is Heo Soon?

1085
01:00:46,747 --> 01:00:47,614
You said you caught him.

1086
01:00:47,614 --> 01:00:49,149
Why are you looking around?

1087
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:51,318
Heo Soon is right here.

1088
01:00:52,452 --> 01:00:54,054
- That is not him.
- What?

1089
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,757
This man is not Heo Soon.

1090
01:00:56,757 --> 01:01:00,861
Yes, I am. I am Heo Soon.

1091
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:02,663
He says he is.

1092
01:01:02,663 --> 01:01:04,665
Something seems off.

1093
01:01:04,665 --> 01:01:06,466
He must be someone with the same name.

1094
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:08,569
The gambling addict,

1095
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:11,438
Heo Soon. Are you him?

1096
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:14,341
I keep telling you I am!
How many times must I say it?

1097
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:17,744
- Then...
- What nonsense is this?

1098
01:01:17,744 --> 01:01:19,646
Did I not describe him clearly?

1099
01:01:19,646 --> 01:01:23,016
Cheekbones sticking out,
a big mole right here...

1100
01:01:23,517 --> 01:01:26,420
Did you even check the composite sketch?

1101
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,622
Maybe your memory is mistaken.

1102
01:01:29,122 --> 01:01:32,526
He said he was Heo Soon,
so I believed him.

1103
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:34,661
He is not.

1104
01:01:36,663 --> 01:01:37,631
He is not Heo Soon?

1105
01:01:38,065 --> 01:01:39,066
My goodness.

1106
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:41,702
Do you know Kim Nak Soo?

1107
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:47,074
I do not. It is my first time here.

1108
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:48,342
First time?

1109
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:50,777
Someone must be impersonating Heo Soon
to scam people.

1110
01:01:51,612 --> 01:01:53,981
My goodness. Chun Sik.

1111
01:01:53,981 --> 01:01:56,350
Chun Sik.

1112
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,820
What is all this commotion?

1113
01:02:09,796 --> 01:02:10,797
Bak Jun Gi.

1114
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:12,699
The Minister of Taxation.

1115
01:02:21,308 --> 01:02:24,044
What brings you to Cheongsu County,
Lord Bak?

1116
01:02:24,811 --> 01:02:27,080
My family home is nearby.

1117
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:29,650
While I am nearby,
I thought I should pay a visit.

1118
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:32,753
And since you came
as an Inspector General, I had to see you.

1119
01:02:33,687 --> 01:02:35,856
How is your father doing?

1120
01:03:07,221 --> 01:03:08,255
That wench

1121
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:10,724
was pretending to be a noble.

1122
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:14,394
She was shamelessly working
as a legal advocate in Cheongsu County.

1123
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:19,066
A legal advocate in Cheongsu County?
Do you mean Ok Tae Young?

1124
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:22,402
How do you know that woman's name?

1125
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:26,440
Are you saying
Ok Tae Young is a runaway slave?

1126
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:31,078
She deceived me and sent me here.
It is undeniable.

1127
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:35,315
Ok Tae Young, the legal advocate?

1128
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:40,420
Do you know me?

1129
01:04:32,372 --> 01:04:36,977
=The Tale of Lady Ok=

1130
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:40,848
This land is perfect for growing aloe.

1131
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:44,151
It is amazing how precious aloe can thrive
here in Joseon.

1132
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:46,987
Elder Master suggested
we process aloe scraps

1133
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:48,488
to sell.

1134
01:04:48,488 --> 01:04:52,025
We should focus
on reclaiming Cheongsu County's lands.

1135
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:55,729
Even Bak Jun Gi cannot bend the law
at will.

1136
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:57,364
Follow the plans we prepared
and handle this well.

1137
01:04:57,764 --> 01:04:59,933
Should we accuse Ok Tae Young
of being a slave or...

1138
01:05:01,368 --> 01:05:03,237
I hoped you would bow.

1139
01:05:03,837 --> 01:05:08,642
I finally feel
like we are truly one, Tae Young.

1140
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:11,845
It is there. The land document exists.

1141
01:05:11,845 --> 01:05:13,514
Why are you acting like this?

1142
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:16,517
How could a nonexistent document
suddenly appear?
