00:13:55,373 --> 00:13:56,958
This is a witch hunt.

186
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,168
Sir.

187
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:01,922
I'm not doing this
over one broken arm.

188
00:14:02,047 --> 00:14:06,302
(October 24, 8 a.m.)

189
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:10,181
He jumped out of nowhere.

190
00:14:14,101 --> 00:14:15,812
I followed the speed limit.

191
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,314
And there was no crosswalk.

192
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,984
Do you know what he said

193
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:22,694
after what he's done?

194
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,447
You look fine.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

195
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,657
Did you just say fine?

196
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,117
Hey, this car.

197
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:30,577
And this porcelain.

198
00:14:30,702 --> 00:14:32,246
So you want $100,000
in return?

199
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,123
For this porcelain?

200
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,375
It's not just a porcelain.

201
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,045
It was Moon Porcelain
by Artist Lee Eun-sang.

202
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,422
Oh, the bone.

203
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,300
The bone will heal over time,
but that's...

204
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,803
- When's the perpetrator arriving?
- He'll be here soon.

205
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,304
Mr. Joo Jung-gi.

206
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,598
Thanks for your testimony today.

207
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,351
I'll talk to the perpetrator
about it later.

208
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,146
Bye for now.

209
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:58,106
Prosecutor Seo.

210
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,525
Even if he appeals to pity,

211
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,818
- don't forget.
- Mr. Joo.

212
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:03,821
- Or I'll be dead.
- You can go now.

213
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,490
- Please.
- I heard you.

214
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:07,741
- Bye.
- Bye.

215
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:12,621
But the perpetrator wouldn't do
such thing.

216
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:15,333
That diner is pretty famous
in the area.

217
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,417
Lee Kyung-hak?

218
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,919
Is the food that good?

219
00:15:18,878 --> 00:15:20,088
Sir.

220
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:22,465
If you don't mind,
can I take a look at the file?

221
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,466
Sure.

222
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:26,136
I have no money to give you.

223
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:29,639
Did you just hit me?

224
00:15:29,764 --> 00:15:30,974
What's going on?

225
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:32,809
Hit me again in front of everyone.

226
00:15:32,934 --> 00:15:34,686
I barely pushed him.

227
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:37,356
Your car and the porcelain.
They're all a scam, aren't they?

228
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,945
I think we need an insider.

229
00:15:43,446 --> 00:15:44,655
For a free ride?

230
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,282
Are you sure he's reliable?

231
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:51,704
The chief prosecutor is
paying attention to this case.

232
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:53,998
Both you and I have to be careful.

233
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:55,333
You know I'm good.

234
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,128
Breaking the car and porcelain
wasn't enough, are you hitting me?

235
00:15:58,253 --> 00:16:00,213
- Here.
- Did I break your porcelain?

236
00:16:00,338 --> 00:16:02,716
Do you have the evidence?
Bring me the evidence.

237
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:03,800
What's going on?

238
00:16:05,886 --> 00:16:07,596
It's nothing serious.
It's just a car accident.

239
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:10,599
It's not. Do you know
how much that porcelain's worth?

240
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:12,977
He always likes to cause a ruckus.

241
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,771
People will think this hallway is
where the accident occurred.

242
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:17,440
I'll take care of it quickly.

243
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:19,442
Did you receive the case?

244
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,902
Did you send it to him?

245
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:25,657
Keep up the good work.

246
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:28,368
Why did you have to do that to the
porcelain and cause this ruckus?

247
00:16:28,493 --> 00:16:30,412
What did I do?
I'm the victim here.

248
00:16:30,537 --> 00:16:32,205
- Aren't you coming?
- I am.

249
00:16:33,373 --> 00:16:35,751
Watch your mouth.

250
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:38,045
Prosecutor Seo, you need to add
assault to his--

251
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,129
Damn it.

252
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:41,799
Disturbance and nuisance
in the public office.

253
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:43,217
Both of you.

254
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:50,349
You may begin.

255
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:12,623
I told you to speak.
Why are you so quiet?

256
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,333
You looked like you had
so much to say earlier.

257
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:17,586
I'm

258
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:21,215
sorry. I admit it.

259
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,508
That settles it.

260
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:23,634
But

261
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:26,804
how did I know he had
something so expensive in his car?

262
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:30,225
Even if there was nothing,
you shouldn't jump into the road.

263
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,643
It wasn't a crosswalk.

264
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:33,186
It's 100 percent your fault.

265
00:17:33,311 --> 00:17:35,021
Are you telling me to pay him
$100,000?

266
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:37,649
You should've made an effort
to resolve it.

267
00:17:37,774 --> 00:17:39,943
'I can't pay you.
It's your fault.'

268
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:41,862
That will only upset him
even more and make things worse.

269
00:17:41,987 --> 00:17:43,030
Sir.

270
00:17:43,864 --> 00:17:46,033
I barely make a living every day.

271
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:48,619
He drives a fancy car
and buys fancy stuff.

272
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:51,163
You should be on my side at least.

273
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:53,541
Look.

274
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,836
If you want anyone on your side,
get yourself an attorney.

275
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,672
You think it's okay to blow up 100
million if he drives a fancy car?

276
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:01,674
You think your money is precious,
but not for others?

277
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:05,929
Are you sure that porcelain is
really worth $100,000?

278
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:08,890
Who knows if he broke it somewhere
else and blamed it on me?

279
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,101
Who are you trying to frame here?

280
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:12,895
Who's at fault here?

281
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,855
The police got the appraisal
statement from the gallery

282
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,190
and confirmed it was authentic.

283
00:18:16,315 --> 00:18:18,776
The victim purchased it
just an hour before the accident.

284
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,778
He didn't break it anywhere else.

285
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:23,197
Don't you

286
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:25,324
think about saying that
to the victim, okay?

287
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,368
- What then?
- Do you want to work it off?

288
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:28,995
- How?
- Go to prison.

289
00:18:29,787 --> 00:18:32,123
Are you crazy? Why would I...

290
00:18:32,248 --> 00:18:33,917
If you can't work it off
or pay him,

291
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:35,502
what do you want to do?

292
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:37,796
Then

293
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:39,923
what about those old people?

294
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,598
How many old people
do you have at home?

295
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,892
My customers.

296
00:18:52,311 --> 00:18:55,189
(Happiness Diner)

297
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,026
(Be happy with $1)

298
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:59,652
I charge $1 for a meal.

299
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:03,031
The food may look humble,

300
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:06,326
but I make everything myself.

301
00:19:06,451 --> 00:19:08,870
So that I can give them more.

302
00:19:08,995 --> 00:19:10,580
If I hire anyone,
I can never afford it.

303
00:19:10,706 --> 00:19:11,832
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

304
00:19:11,957 --> 00:19:12,958
- See you.
- Bye.

305
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,627
To keep that price,
I have no time to sleep.

306
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:17,504
To save every cost,

307
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:19,381
I've been attending
the morning market

308
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,175
every Tuesday
for how many years now.

309
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:45,158
- Are you okay?
- Move.

310
00:19:53,334 --> 00:19:54,377
Shoot.

311
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,337
Damn it!

312
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,880
No!

313
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:01,092
Hey. How are you going to
make up for that?

314
00:20:01,217 --> 00:20:03,553
Why did you jump out of nowhere?

315
00:20:03,678 --> 00:20:05,138
This is crazy.

316
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:07,140
You got money?
How are you going to pay for it?

317
00:20:15,732 --> 00:20:17,693
$1 for $10's worth of happiness.

318
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:20,863
Happiness Diner that protects
the neglected people.

319
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:22,448
That's what most articles said.

320
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:24,283
Mr. Lee Kyung-hak's...

321
00:20:24,408 --> 00:20:26,661
I mean, the perpetrator's diner

322
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:28,120
almost received
the Minister's award,

323
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:29,914
but one article said
he refused it.

324
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:31,082
The Minister?

325
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,876
He refused all TV show offers.

326
00:20:34,002 --> 00:20:35,670
Why refuse TV...

327
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:40,842
He's still a perpetrator.

328
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,135
And the victim is firm.

329
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:45,347
What are you doing?

330
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:46,807
Okay.

331
00:20:51,937 --> 00:20:55,691
This could be real good.

332
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:59,153
But he's the perpetrator.

333
00:21:00,196 --> 00:21:01,781
Keep up the good work.

334
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:04,409
Why did you have to do that to the
porcelain and cause this ruckus?

335
00:21:04,534 --> 00:21:06,619
What did I do?
I'm the victim here.

336
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,332
'Do that?'

337
00:21:11,166 --> 00:21:12,626
What did he do?

338
00:21:14,044 --> 00:21:15,295
That pain in the ass.

339
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:25,139
I thought you were
buying me coffee.

340
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:26,807
Isn't it brilliant?

341
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,810
No one gets you the vending
machine coffee aside from me.

342
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:38,987
About the Happiness Diner
incident.

343
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,239
Was that yours at first?

344
00:21:41,364 --> 00:21:43,199
There's no yours or mine.

345
00:21:43,325 --> 00:21:45,744
I'm busy dealing
with drug dealers.

346
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,996
Kiss my ass.

347
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:52,292
But I think it's weird.

348
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:53,794
Why did he take
such an expensive porcelain

349
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:55,671
like that?

350
00:21:58,674 --> 00:22:00,092
Why didn't he do that?

351
00:22:06,182 --> 00:22:07,809
Something funny in there?

352
00:22:08,518 --> 00:22:09,477
Prosecutor Seo.

353
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,105
It's not wrong to be ignorant.

354
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:16,109
If I were him, I would've gotten
it delivered. It's expensive.

355
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:21,323
Don't be like that.

356
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:23,659
It's okay to ask your junior
if you're not competent.

357
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:26,495
I did.

358
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,876
And you answered my question.

359
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:35,546
If I asked you straight up,

360
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:36,672
would you have answered me?

361
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:40,593
Change your attitude depending
on who you're dealing with.

362
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,680
For example, our boss.

363
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,765
She hates cheap lip service.

364
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:48,894
Some don't know that's him.

365
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:57,528
- Prosecutor Seo, you're...
- Prosecutor Seo.

366
00:22:58,445 --> 00:23:01,240
I found that expensive artworks
are normally delivered,

367
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:03,743
so I printed it for you.

368
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,620
That way,
the insurance is applied...

369
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,291
- Hey, Sung Si-woon.
- Yes.

370
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:13,294
Did you think I didn't know
about the special delivery?

371
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:15,422
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:15,547 --> 00:23:16,840
Want a piece of advice?

373
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:19,426
These days, the wobbling poppy
gets cut down,

374
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,470
not the tall poppy. Got it?

375
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:22,763
What?

376
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:27,935
What are you doing?

377
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,395
Okay.

378
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:37,778
He should've told me earlier.

379
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:59,885
(Silver Theater)

380
00:24:24,661 --> 00:24:26,330
Not sure when they'll be
moving yet?

381
00:24:27,122 --> 00:24:28,665
We can't move without a supply.

382
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,210
If you're avoiding the answer
on purpose,

383
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:32,544
you'll be the first to go down.

384
00:24:35,506 --> 00:24:36,966
If I was going to avoid it,

385
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:38,884
you think I would've called you
in the first place?

386
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,663
Look at this.

387
00:25:06,997 --> 00:25:10,585
It expressed the quality of lights
in an extreme way.

388
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,878
That's right.

389
00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:13,171
The artist said

390
00:25:13,296 --> 00:25:15,465
he was inspired by impressionism.

391
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,258
Impressionism.

392
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:26,935
(PARK YEONG HYI,
'God bless you', $54,000)

393
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:29,479
Wow.

394
00:25:31,899 --> 00:25:33,442
This

395
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,611
calms me down.

396
00:25:36,195 --> 00:25:37,154
It feels

397
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,199
somewhat lonely though.

398
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:42,869
What an insight.

399
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:46,706
The artist expressed
hope and happiness

400
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:50,877
comes from his children
despite the loss of his wife

401
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:53,922
by painting layers.

402
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:56,967
Is this still available
for purchase?

403
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:05,059
Here is the contract.

404
00:26:05,893 --> 00:26:07,603
The price is 54,000 dollars.

405
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:10,272
That is equivalent
to 71,000,000 won.

406
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,817
Can I take the artwork
with me right away?

407
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:15,611
I'm sorry, but artworks are

408
00:26:15,737 --> 00:26:17,071
affected by the environment,

409
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:18,865
and due to the damage risk,

410
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,868
is it okay for us to deliver it?

411
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:24,704
You're well aware
of the damage risk

412
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:26,581
while moving.

413
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:29,710
Even a single painting is moved
like treasure.

414
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:31,962
I'm sure you care more
for porcelain?

415
00:26:33,046 --> 00:26:34,339
Of course.

416
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:37,384
On October 24, Joo Jung-gi
purchased

417
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:39,595
Moon Porcelain by Lee Eun Sang
from this gallery.

418
00:26:40,387 --> 00:26:43,808
Why wasn't it delivered
via special logistics service?

419
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:44,767
Pardon me?

420
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:46,394
Do you want to sign the--

421
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,104
Why did you tell your regular

422
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:50,607
to take the artwork that was
worth $100,000 himself?

423
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:51,816
What if it breaks?

424
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:56,404
We'd never tell him
to take it himself.

425
00:26:56,529 --> 00:26:58,573
Mr. Joo Jung-gi requested

426
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:00,575
to take it himself that day.

427
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:04,371
That day?
What about his previous purchases?

428
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:07,082
We delivered everything else
via special logistics service.

429
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:09,668
But he signed the contract
that he wouldn't blame us

430
00:27:09,793 --> 00:27:12,129
for any damage on Moon Porcelain.

431
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,175
You can ask him yourself.

432
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,818
It's not that I refused
the special delivery.

433
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,737
It wasn't that far anyway.

434
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,406
It was a hassle.

435
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,741
If that was a hassle,

436
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,910
how did you receive all the other
ones via delivery before that?

437
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,954
You've always been thorough,
but you happened to be

438
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,331
stubborn that day
and got into an accident.

439
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,042
What a coincidence.

440
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:54,591
I'll tell you everything
since you're a prosecutor.

441
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,093
Actually

442
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,012
I'm a lawyer.

443
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:01,973
We're called lawyers,
but you know,

444
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,059
we're basically businessmen.

445
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,437
It's all about serving customers
and finding a good connection.

446
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,857
You don't need to worry
about it

447
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:12,651
because you're a public official.

448
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,740
I do this to win their favor.

449
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,618
I should give it to them
in person.

450
00:28:20,743 --> 00:28:23,037
Who goes through a delivery?

451
00:28:23,162 --> 00:28:25,415
Who were you trying to give it to?

452
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,501
I'm not obligated
to tell you that.

453
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:31,087
It's nothing against the law.

454
00:28:31,213 --> 00:28:33,215
I didn't get to deliver it anyway.

455
00:28:33,882 --> 00:28:35,050
Anyway,

456
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:38,053
what are you doing here?

457
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:41,515
Do you think I got into
an accident on purpose?

458
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,808
I was here to see the arts.

459
00:28:45,352 --> 00:28:46,604
Come on.

460
00:28:46,937 --> 00:28:50,316
I lost faith in my customer,
lost my money,

461
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:51,484
and that wasn't enough,

462
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:54,112
my prosecutor is suspecting me?

463
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:57,490
If you have time for that,

464
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:01,786
go tell that jerk to pay me,
please.

465
00:29:34,154 --> 00:29:35,155
Sir.

466
00:29:35,822 --> 00:29:39,618
About the new prosecutor
in charge.

467
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:41,578
Did he smell it too?

468
00:29:41,703 --> 00:29:44,415
Not that, but he keeps
getting on my nerves.

469
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,125
His name is Seo Dong-jae
from Criminal Department 1.

470
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:48,169
(Ehong Construction)

471
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:49,879
- I know him.
- You do?

472
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:53,466
I'll handle him.

473
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:54,801
Focus on your job.

474
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:04,978
(Happiness Diner)

475
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,108
No food today.

476
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:11,485
No water.

477
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,778
But I'm hungry.

478
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:14,738
If you get no water, no food.

479
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,076
Why aren't you

480
00:30:20,911 --> 00:30:21,954
open today?

481
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:24,624
You need to work to pay me back.

482
00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:40,974
Are you inside?

483
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,687
He tried to kill me.

484
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:49,024
Don't come any closer.

485
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,985
Do you know who I am?

486
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,653
- Mr. Joo Jung-gi.
- You'll regret it.

487
00:30:52,778 --> 00:30:53,863
You'll regret it big time.

488
00:30:58,576 --> 00:30:59,577
Kiss my ass.

489
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:04,749
What happened?

490
00:31:08,587 --> 00:31:09,713
It's been out since this morning.

491
00:31:10,672 --> 00:31:13,258
I'm already upset to send
old people back home.

492
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:14,801
Why did he have to
get on my nerves?

493
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:16,345
What? The water outage?

494
00:31:17,096 --> 00:31:18,430
Is it out for the whole area?

495
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,808
I'm not sure.

496
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,518
There are only a few places left.

497
00:31:26,564 --> 00:31:27,940
Not easy running a business, huh?

498
00:31:28,858 --> 00:31:30,109
Especially for you.

499
00:31:33,196 --> 00:31:35,782
Still, I owe this place.

500
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:40,620
Everyone else left

501
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:43,457
because of their landlords.

502
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:46,418
You see my wife.

503
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,633
She supported everyone in need
around here.

504
00:31:54,301 --> 00:31:55,636
But she's gone now.

505
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:59,056
She got sick
of the smell of the rice

506
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:01,434
- and left me.
- Oh, no.

507
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:04,771
I should've quit back then.

508
00:32:04,896 --> 00:32:05,814
But

509
00:32:06,689 --> 00:32:08,483
people kept coming.

510
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:10,193
What could I do?
They were asking me for food.

511
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:12,362
I decided to do it
for just one more day,

512
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:14,239
and here I am.

513
00:32:15,282 --> 00:32:16,241
Right.

514
00:32:16,825 --> 00:32:19,411
Just one more day.

515
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,790
And that continued until today.

516
00:32:27,461 --> 00:32:31,924
You're probably not here
for a meal.

517
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:36,387
I've thought about it.

518
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:37,639
You should settle.

519
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:39,307
Sir.

520
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:44,187
That jerk insisted
on driving a fancy car

521
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:48,317
while his car's getting fixed.

522
00:32:48,442 --> 00:32:49,735
So I'm paying for the rental.

523
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,030
And you're telling me to pay him?

524
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:54,114
Still,

525
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,076
it's better than wasting
your precious money every day...

526
00:32:57,993 --> 00:32:58,953
Or

527
00:32:59,579 --> 00:33:01,038
how about going on TV?

528
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:03,499
As a kind diner?

529
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:06,878
No, just as how you look
right now.

530
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:09,339
If you talk on TV

531
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:11,508
and solve a quiz,

532
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:14,469
you'll get a lot of sponsors.

533
00:33:14,594 --> 00:33:15,470
Forget it.

534
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,973
You wish.

535
00:33:23,729 --> 00:33:24,647
Hello?

536
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:26,774
Oh, yes.

537
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:29,193
Right. My investigator called you.

538
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:31,070
Yes.

539
00:33:32,572 --> 00:33:34,365
It's Happiness Diner
in Jangsung-dong.

540
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:37,952
The water is out.

541
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:39,412
He's unable to open.

542
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,456
Please hurry up.

543
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:43,875
Tomorrow morning?

544
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,335
Thank you.

545
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,378
Bye.

546
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,548
Who was that?

547
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:52,176
The Water Revenue Bureau.

548
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:56,847
If you called them,
it would've taken days.

549
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:58,265
But they're coming tomorrow.

550
00:33:59,642 --> 00:34:01,435
They said it must be something
about the drain.

551
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:04,188
- Is it in the yard?
- Dra...

552
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:06,733
What drain?

553
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:11,446
It's been fine for decades.

554
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:13,615
This occurred
because it's decades old.

555
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,824
Anyway,

556
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:17,744
what do you say about going on TV?

557
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:18,912
I said no!

558
00:34:20,706 --> 00:34:23,333
Going to the police station
and the prosecutor's office

559
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:24,752
was enough for me.

560
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:28,505
Sir?

561
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:32,176
If you're too shy to be on TV,
alone, I'll join you.

562
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:34,595
Sir?

563
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:36,305
Sir?

564
00:34:43,396 --> 00:34:45,482
Should I buy a grinder?

565
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:50,028
I should've ground it a long ago.

566
00:34:56,452 --> 00:34:58,662
Why is he refusing to be on TV?

567
00:34:58,787 --> 00:35:00,247
Geez, he's not helpful at all.

568
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,459
Geez.

569
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:06,295
I'm going.

570
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:10,717
Hey.

571
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:13,928
What a temper.

572
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:55,931
Huh? 3975.

573
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,437
Hey, the porcelain accident.

574
00:36:01,562 --> 00:36:03,397
- I have the file--
- Still working on it?

575
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:06,359
What was the license plate number?

576
00:36:06,484 --> 00:36:08,152
300 D 3975.

577
00:36:08,653 --> 00:36:10,279
300 D 3975.

578
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:19,998
Right.

579
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,920
He almost ran into me
at 8:02 a.m..

580
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:25,796
But the accident--

581
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:27,714
The accident occurred
at 8:10 a.m..

582
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,175
It took place in the same spot.

583
00:36:31,677 --> 00:36:33,554
That's in front
of Happiness Diner.

584
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:37,350
He went around in a circle
for 8 minutes.

585
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:41,979
Hey, check the surveillance camera
before the accident occurred.

586
00:36:42,105 --> 00:36:43,272
I'm on it.

587
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:48,737
(Happiness Diner)

588
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:58,121
Hold on.

589
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:02,000
(Conference Hall)

590
00:37:08,549 --> 00:37:09,592
Ma'am.

591
00:37:09,717 --> 00:37:10,635
Wait.

592
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:15,014
It's a new kind of ecstasy
called Purple.

593
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:18,142
It began spreading fast
about a year or two ago

594
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:20,687
and disappeared recently.

595
00:37:21,563 --> 00:37:22,731
Did they smell it?

596
00:37:22,856 --> 00:37:23,899
No, it's a simple supply issue.

597
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,318
Not because they were worried
about us.

598
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,030
How are you sure?

599
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,119
Ma'am.

600
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:37,788
Remember Happiness Diner?
The good price diner?

601
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:39,081
Are you still holding onto that?

602
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:41,500
It's just a simple accident.
Make them settle.

603
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,211
It wasn't an accident.

604
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,129
It's a case.

605
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,465
Something came out?

606
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,843
Oh, no. I found it.

607
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,220
- I found it.
- So what did you find?

608
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:59,895
I'll tell you when it's certain.

609
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,029
Did you find a free rider?

610
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:10,531
Is someone on a free ride?

611
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:11,866
Oh, yes.

612
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,495
It's not that there seems
to be a supply issue,

613
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,747
but declare that it is
a supply issue.

614
00:38:17,872 --> 00:38:19,374
To see you certain after a while,

615
00:38:19,499 --> 00:38:22,168
your informant must be reliable.

616
00:38:23,044 --> 00:38:24,754
You've seen too many movies.

617
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:27,507
Have you ever been in charge
of a drug case before?

618
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,843
Why not?

619
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:32,721
Violence, gang, drug

620
00:38:33,347 --> 00:38:34,556
are my specialty.

621
00:38:35,557 --> 00:38:36,725
Sure.

622
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:39,728
'Sure.' You'll see.

623
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:43,482
3975.

624
00:38:43,608 --> 00:38:45,484
Oh, 3975. Right here.

625
00:38:54,536 --> 00:38:55,662
- Thank you.
- Yes.

626
00:38:58,623 --> 00:39:00,333
I boasted it to everyone.

627
00:39:00,459 --> 00:39:01,793
It's got to be there.

628
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:04,421
(Recent)

629
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:07,299
Yes.

630
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:10,928
(Recent Destination,
Happiness Diner)

631
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,100
What am I doing here?

632
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:27,570
Sit down.

633
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:41,252
- Mr. Joo Jung-gi.
- Yes?

634
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:43,546
Why did you leave the fine car
in the body shop?

635
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:45,423
What? My car?

636
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,216
What do you mean?

637
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:49,135
It was all dented
when I hit the guardrail,

638
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,179
and the tow truck towed it
in the scene.

639
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:53,890
You haven't driven that car
since the accident

640
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,558
on October 24, have you?

641
00:39:55,683 --> 00:39:56,851
No.

642
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:58,728
Okay.

643
00:39:59,396 --> 00:40:00,605
Watch this.

644
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:05,736
1, 2, 3.

645
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:13,953
Do you recognize your car?

646
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,955
What about it?

647
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,666
It's not illegal to take
the right turn and no accident.

648
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,251
No problem.

649
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,045
I know. What's the problem?

650
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,179
The same road 4 minutes later.

651
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,514
8:06 a.m..

652
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:36,602
Then 4 minutes later at 8:10 a.m..

653
00:40:36,727 --> 00:40:38,478
What does that mean?

654
00:40:39,438 --> 00:40:40,773
It means you circled the road

655
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:42,608
for 8 minutes.

656
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:43,692
Oh.

657
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:48,948
Because I was lost.

658
00:40:49,073 --> 00:40:51,284
It was my first time going there.

659
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:52,869
You later testified to him

660
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:54,746
that you were on your way
to deliver a gift.

661
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:57,373
- He did.
- Oh, yes.

662
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:00,710
I was, but it was my first time
going there.

663
00:41:01,753 --> 00:41:02,837
Was it

664
00:41:03,213 --> 00:41:05,257
the owner of Happiness Diner

665
00:41:05,382 --> 00:41:06,800
you were trying to deliver
the gift to?

666
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:10,929
The final destination in your GPS
just before the accident

667
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,431
was Happiness Diner.

668
00:41:13,974 --> 00:41:18,562
(The day of the accident)

669
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:21,482
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

670
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,569
You knew he unloads
the ingredients he bought

671
00:41:24,694 --> 00:41:26,946
from the morning market
at the same time every Tuesday.

672
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:28,489
So you waited for your chance and

673
00:41:28,615 --> 00:41:29,616
boom.

674
00:41:31,743 --> 00:41:33,161
What? I can't even stop by
at a diner

675
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:36,039
on my way to deliver
the porcelain?

676
00:41:36,164 --> 00:41:37,416
Mr. Joo Jung-gi.

677
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:38,875
This is a fraud.

678
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:40,586
And an aggressive deception.

679
00:41:43,046 --> 00:41:45,341
Fraud, my ass. I'm the victim.

680
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,469
If this is how you want it,

681
00:41:48,594 --> 00:41:50,596
I'm taking it to court.

682
00:41:51,472 --> 00:41:53,891
Go ahead. So I can conduct
an official investigation.

683
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,061
Prosecutor Seo.

684
00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:58,146
Now,

685
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:01,274
it's up to you.

686
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:04,736
A smooth settlement
with the diner owner

687
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:06,112
or stand

688
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:08,156
against the prosecutors.

689
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:13,120
In fact, I've witnessed it myself.

690
00:42:16,874 --> 00:42:17,666
What?

691
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:18,918
You almost got into an accident
while waiting for your chance.

692
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:20,753
The car that was going straight.

693
00:42:22,088 --> 00:42:23,172
That was me.

694
00:42:24,882 --> 00:42:25,883
What are you...

695
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,262
Think carefully.

696
00:42:42,651 --> 00:42:43,485
Prosecutor Seo.

697
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,154
You're absolutely amazing.

698
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:48,115
The way you cornered him.

699
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,825
I really want to learn it.

700
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,161
It's been so long

701
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,455
since I've been
a temperamental senior.

702
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,749
I'd forgotten about it

703
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,167
surrounded by juniors
that showed no reactions.

704
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:01,880
(Boss)

705
00:43:03,506 --> 00:43:04,924
Yes, boss.

706
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,885
Now?

707
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,844
Yes.

708
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:10,972
Sure. Yes.

709
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:30,201
Ma'am.

710
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,869
It's me.

711
00:43:50,347 --> 00:43:52,141
You had a guest.

712
00:43:52,808 --> 00:43:55,019
You seem drunk.

713
00:43:55,144 --> 00:43:56,270
Are you okay?

714
00:43:56,395 --> 00:43:57,939
Oh, shoot.

715
00:43:58,064 --> 00:43:59,315
My head.

716
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,067
You look good.

717
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:03,278
Oh, ma'am.

718
00:44:03,403 --> 00:44:04,904
Ma'am, you should lie down.

719
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:06,948
Or are you

720
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,409
paying less attention than before?

721
00:44:11,244 --> 00:44:12,162
Oh.

722
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,748
You don't have my new
business card.

723
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,251
Not your old one either.

724
00:44:20,254 --> 00:44:21,547
I'm from Ehong Construction.

725
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:24,717
(Ehong Construction,
Nam Wan-seong)

726
00:44:26,302 --> 00:44:27,845
How do you know my boss?

727
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:32,058
You know what happens
when you run a business.

728
00:44:33,184 --> 00:44:35,853
Don't act like it's anything new.

00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:40,817
(Ehong Construction,
Nam Wan-seong)

730
00:44:47,658 --> 00:44:51,203
Don't waste your energy
on a mere car accident.

731
00:44:51,328 --> 00:44:52,830
That diner will shut down anyway.

732
00:44:56,667 --> 00:45:00,379
And we'll no longer be
some rural construction company.

733
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:03,049
(VIP CARD, Ehong Construction)

734
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:10,807
What's the limit?

735
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:12,350
How much do you expect?

736
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,061
When the diner soon shuts down,

737
00:45:15,187 --> 00:45:18,148
you'll no longer be
some rural construction company?

738
00:45:18,941 --> 00:45:20,567
I can't wait.

739
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:21,819
I knew you'd understand.

740
00:45:23,195 --> 00:45:24,697
I didn't touch anything here.

741
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:26,740
We can talk about
the good old days with this--

742
00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:28,325
So what if it has no limit?

743
00:45:28,451 --> 00:45:29,869
It's expired.

744
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,913
I wouldn't give you
what's expired.

745
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:34,582
This is old-fashioned.

746
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,126
This is from a decade ago.

747
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:39,754
Is this how you still play?

748
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:44,718
Sorry for being old-fashioned.

749
00:45:44,843 --> 00:45:46,094
Please let off your steam

750
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:49,556
and take it as delicious dinner
with your old brother.

751
00:45:53,894 --> 00:45:55,396
I'll see you tomorrow, ma'am.

752
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:08,117
Shoot. It never dies away.

753
00:46:10,453 --> 00:46:12,872
What did your wife say?
Did she like it?

754
00:46:13,873 --> 00:46:15,083
Who is it today?

755
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:16,960
I don't play a round
with just anyone.

756
00:46:17,085 --> 00:46:19,046
He's my good old friend.

757
00:46:19,171 --> 00:46:20,672
You can't take more than 10 steps

758
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:22,132
without stepping on his land
in Chungcheong Province.

759
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:23,801
He has no issues or anything.

760
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:26,261
I just wanted to show off
with you next to me.

761
00:46:27,262 --> 00:46:30,307
You're nothing without boasting.

762
00:46:30,808 --> 00:46:33,185
Help me show off, will you?

763
00:46:33,311 --> 00:46:34,270
I don't know if I'm any good.

764
00:46:34,395 --> 00:46:35,354
You're here.

765
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:39,192
This is Prosecutor Seo Dong-jae
I've told you about.

766
00:46:39,943 --> 00:46:40,902
Hi.

767
00:46:41,528 --> 00:46:42,779
I've heard a lot about you.

768
00:46:43,238 --> 00:46:44,364
My name is Nam Wan-seong.

769
00:46:45,031 --> 00:46:48,451
Did you drop my name again?

770
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:52,664
You have a good friend.

771
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:03,342
So? What's the trend these days?

772
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,098
How do they serve you these days?

773
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:11,643
I'm darn curious.

774
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:13,728
Forget about serving me.

775
00:47:13,853 --> 00:47:16,231
Why are you doing that
to Happiness Diner?

776
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:17,440
Do you have a grudge against him?

777
00:47:20,569 --> 00:47:21,945
Now we're talking.

778
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:25,199
Were you pretending earlier
in front of your boss?

779
00:47:28,035 --> 00:47:29,578
It's the profound secret.

780
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:32,957
Guess who told me the secret.

781
00:47:34,208 --> 00:47:35,084
My boss?

782
00:47:35,209 --> 00:47:36,919
Legislation, jurisdiction,
and administration.

783
00:47:37,044 --> 00:47:39,297
For businessmen,

784
00:47:39,422 --> 00:47:41,799
secrets bring them money,
and that money

785
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:43,676
comes from the legislation.

786
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:45,428
- The national assembly?
- Do you want to go?

787
00:47:45,553 --> 00:47:46,596
To where?

788
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:47,722
To the national assembly.

789
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:50,350
I can send you there.

790
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:52,811
Whatever.

791
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,023
Because I'm going to redevelop
that area.

792
00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:57,608
The diner site.

793
00:47:57,733 --> 00:48:00,778
No one knows that yet.
No one should.

794
00:48:00,903 --> 00:48:02,905
Because I'm going to buy
everything.

795
00:48:03,656 --> 00:48:05,074
But

796
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,578
that poor old man won't sell
his house.

797
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,954
No matter how much I offered.

798
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,206
He refused it to death.

799
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:15,793
I wondered if he heard something.

800
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,632
You talk too much now.

801
00:48:20,757 --> 00:48:22,676
You had no guts to open
your mouth in front of me before.

802
00:48:27,514 --> 00:48:29,016
Because of that single place,

803
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:31,143
it's causing me a great loss.

804
00:48:31,268 --> 00:48:32,019
Get off my car.

805
00:48:32,144 --> 00:48:35,314
I can make billions easy
once it gets redeveloped.

806
00:48:35,439 --> 00:48:37,984
The national assembly
isn't 'whatever.'

807
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:39,777
You think the jurisdiction is?

808
00:48:39,902 --> 00:48:40,945
You want me to show you?

809
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,697
Ms. Jeon!

810
00:48:44,824 --> 00:48:47,285
Why do you think
you got that case?

811
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,412
Afraid of the stubborn junior
smelling it,

812
00:48:49,537 --> 00:48:50,747
Ms. Jeon sent it

813
00:48:50,872 --> 00:48:53,250
to the biggest softie.

814
00:48:53,708 --> 00:48:54,709
But

815
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:59,047
she got backstabbed
by the soft axe.

816
00:48:59,172 --> 00:49:01,133
Since when did
Cheongju Prosecutors' Office

817
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:03,761
have so many sharp talents?

818
00:49:03,886 --> 00:49:06,263
I'm about to get disappointed
in Ms. Jeon.

819
00:49:06,388 --> 00:49:09,809
That won't do anything good
to her.

820
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:11,727
Go deal with her yourself.

821
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,734
How did I meet Ms. Jeon?

822
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:20,403
By paying her!

823
00:49:20,528 --> 00:49:22,113
If I just run my mouth...

824
00:49:28,704 --> 00:49:30,122
I'm not taking it for free.

825
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:33,208
I'll pay him a lot of sum for it.

826
00:49:35,836 --> 00:49:37,129
Only if

827
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:39,757
you help me buy that house,

828
00:49:41,092 --> 00:49:42,969
Ms. Jeon wouldn't neglect you.

829
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:45,471
The same goes for me.

830
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:46,514
Then we will all be

831
00:49:48,308 --> 00:49:50,143
happy, right?

832
00:49:51,561 --> 00:49:53,563
Your boss will be happy.

833
00:49:53,688 --> 00:49:55,190
I'll be happy.

834
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:57,109
You'll be happy.

835
00:49:57,234 --> 00:49:59,569
And that old man will
be happy too.

836
00:50:00,862 --> 00:50:02,030
Good shot.

837
00:50:04,908 --> 00:50:06,910
Dive in for a good shot, will you?

838
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:12,333
That lunatic.

839
00:50:25,263 --> 00:50:28,558
Because I'm going to redevelop
that area. The diner site.

840
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,688
I can make billions easy
once it gets redeveloped.

841
00:50:32,813 --> 00:50:34,314
I'm not taking it for free.

842
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:37,192
I'll pay him a lot of sum for it.

843
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:39,028
Only if you help me
buy that house,

844
00:50:41,697 --> 00:50:43,532
Ms. Jeon wouldn't neglect you.

845
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:44,825
Are you still holding onto that?

846
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:47,036
It's just a simple accident.
Make them settle.

847
00:50:57,005 --> 00:50:58,715
(Happiness Diner)

848
00:51:01,176 --> 00:51:02,386
Did he go home?

849
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:12,396
I have to do what I have to do.

850
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:22,156
Huh?

851
00:51:22,782 --> 00:51:25,368
Why is he fixing it when
the water bureau is coming?

852
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:29,497
I knew he was too nice.

853
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:58,174
Sorry about that.

854
00:52:58,299 --> 00:52:59,217
But

855
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,263
you asked for it.

856
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,974
Why did you call
the Water Revenue Bureau?

857
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,148
No one can hear you.

858
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,942
I told you everyone moved out.

859
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:53,900
You don't need to pay him.
It wasn't a car accident.

860
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:54,775
It was a fraud.

861
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:56,527
The victim caused the accident
on purpose.

862
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:59,113
But who's going to resolve it
without me?

863
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,782
You can't help but fall for it.

864
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:02,951
Look, prosecutor.

865
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:06,454
Why do I need to resolve anything?
What's the purpose of this?

866
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,873
Are you taking off?

867
00:54:07,998 --> 00:54:09,416
You think that will be
the end of it?

868
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:11,543
All that sneer and insult
you suffered from the victim.

869
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:12,377
You think you can forget that?

870
00:54:12,502 --> 00:54:14,379
He had no idea about who you were.

871
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:15,547
You need to teach him a lesson.

872
00:54:15,672 --> 00:54:18,133
- I'll kill him too.
- Why didn't you?

873
00:54:18,259 --> 00:54:19,343
You could've, but why not?

874
00:54:19,927 --> 00:54:21,512
Because you were stuck.

875
00:54:21,637 --> 00:54:23,806
The whole world knows
about the ruckus Joo Jung-gi made.

876
00:54:23,931 --> 00:54:25,808
If you kill him now,
you'll go straight to prison.

877
00:54:25,933 --> 00:54:27,977
But there is a way
to get back at him

878
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:30,104
without killing him.
So why bother?

879
00:54:30,229 --> 00:54:31,147
I have evidence.

880
00:54:31,272 --> 00:54:33,566
Let's put him in prison for good
with fraud.

881
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:34,484
Aren't you curious?

882
00:54:34,609 --> 00:54:36,528
That porcelain was really worth
$100,000.

883
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:39,781
What matters is why he did it.

884
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,459
Well...

885
00:54:51,293 --> 00:54:52,128
Yes.

886
00:54:52,795 --> 00:54:54,380
- Whatever.
- What?

887
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,049
No, sir.

888
00:54:57,175 --> 00:54:59,635
Where are you going to go
with this?

889
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:01,095
Are you going to work
your ass off somewhere again?

890
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:03,848
The office knows that I'm here.

891
00:55:03,973 --> 00:55:05,892
Are you going to wander around
with no home at that age?

892
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:07,686
If you worked your ass off
running a diner against your will,

893
00:55:07,811 --> 00:55:10,188
you should be compensated.

894
00:55:11,231 --> 00:55:12,524
I can help you hit a jackpot.

895
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:15,694
I'll help you make billions.

896
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,113
That's what I'm here for.

897
00:55:19,448 --> 00:55:21,575
I'll make you a billionaire.
