that cover the sky.

196
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,730
Lord Tao, have you

197
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,730
heard about that

198
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,560
the Hidden Fox

199
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,520
only kills villains.

200
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,110
Only kills villains?

201
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,230
Then how come you are still alive?

202
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,360
-Lord Tao. -Old man.

203
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,730
What are you doing?

204
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,390
You want to kill your peers?

205
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,480
Hand over the key.

206
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,680
What key?

207
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,350
Didn't you say

208
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,640
it's useless to have just the map?

209
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,110
To excavate the treasure,

210
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,020
we still need a key.

211
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,270
It's marked on the map

212
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,100
that the key is in this inn.

213
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,240
You planned

214
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,730
well.

215
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
I...

216
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,680
I really don't know anything

217
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,400
about the key.

218
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,730
Since you know who I am,

219
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:38,110
you should know my capability.

220
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,020
You should also know

221
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,520
you can't stop me.

222
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,020
Tao Baisui.

223
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,970
If you kill him,

224
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,350
where can we find the key?

225
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,850
Go find the key.

226
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,640
The map is in our hands.

227
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,520
We mustn't allow Bao Shu

228
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,440
to get the key

229
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,440
to put limits on us.

230
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,350
Let's go.

231
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,770
Let's split.

232
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,020
Sexagenary Cycle Lock.

233
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,440
Junior.

234
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,890
We found

235
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,730
the key.

236
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,390
Senior.

237
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,560
After finding the treasures,

238
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,860
what do you plan to do?

239
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,890
After Master achieve first-class merit

240
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,810
and is made a duke,

241
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,390
our power

242
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,980
will be much stronger.

243
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,980
By then,

244
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,520
I must taste all delicious food in the world.

245
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,560
Senior, you don't think

246
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,820
villains

247
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,770
will get retribution,

248
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,860
do you?

249
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,450
[Yin Ji, One of Eight Villains, Died]

250
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,940
[Five Years Ago]

251
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,570
Hurry up.

252
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,820
Hurry up.

253
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,310
Hurry up.

254
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,770
Kneel.

255
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,890
Stop looking.

256
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,820
Get to work!

257
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,310
Get to work!

258
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,270
Stop.

259
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,440
Hand it over.

260
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,020
Hand it over.

261
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,940
You know what would happen

262
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,940
if you didn't follow the rules.

263
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,020
If it hadn't been for my help,

264
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,730
you would have been dead long ago.

265
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,190
Even you dared to steal my stuff.

266
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,230
After a day of work,

267
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,230
if we dig out gold,

268
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,520
we can get some rice.

269
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,970
If we can't, we'll be whipped.

270
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,600
There's no more gold in this mountain.

271
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,850
I'm gonna die anyway.

272
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,690
You son of a gun!

273
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,770
Who gave you the name

274
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,230
Gui Yu?

275
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,650
Who are you?

276
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,060
I've been looking for you for a long time.

277
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:29,940
There's a flow of energy

278
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,140
in your body.

279
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,400
You're smart.

280
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,520
My adoptive father needs someone to help him.

281
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,150
I thought

282
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,320
it could be an opportunity.

283
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,930
Who's your adoptive father?

284
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,890
Bao Shu.

285
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,150
Have you heard of

286
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,570
this name?

287
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,440
You villains

288
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,270
made people on the north border suffer.

289
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,440
You made me

290
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,440
end up like this.

291
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,480
I'd rather die

292
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,530
than work for him.

293
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,020
It's easy to die.

294
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,850
You can die right away

295
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,020
without doing anything.

296
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,440
I just thought

297
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,980
you're worth

298
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,190
more than nothing.

299
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,440
You can only get opportunities

300
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,810
when you're alive.

301
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,730
Think about your dead parents.

302
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,400
What would they want you to do?

303
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,900
Who are you?

304
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,140
You have to make a decision now.

305
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,280
I'm gonna go with you.

306
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,100
Gui Yu has progressed a lot

307
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,150
this year.

308
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,770
He's more talented

309
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,350
than I expected.

310
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,860
Once upon a time,

311
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:37,860
there was a hunter

312
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,400
who found a baby tiger

313
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,980
in a cave.

314
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,140
that he liked so much.

315
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,890
He was so happy

316
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,480
that he took the baby tiger back home.

317
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,850
The baby tiger

318
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,560
behaved so well.

319
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,270
It grew up

320
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,440
little by little

321
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,770
and took the place of the hound.

322
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,020
The hunter was happy

323
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,480
but also worried

324
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,070
whether the baby tiger

325
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,610
would catch himself

326
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,900
in the end.

327
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,900
Even you

328
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,980
are afraid of a tiger?

329
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,770
I'm afraid

330
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,980
that the tiger is not cruel enough.

331
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,320
Kill Qing Wen.

332
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,060
Qing Wen once helped you.

333
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,480
Killing her is paying back evil for good.

334
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,110
Not killing her is being disloyal.

335
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,930
Do you think

336
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,730
you can be a real villain

337
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,190
with what you've got?

338
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,980
Get over there.

339
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,940
Cure him

340
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,270
and take him to Tao Baisui.

341
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,900
It hit home.

342
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,810
Exactly on target.

343
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,270
You're questioning me.

344
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,730
The owner is dead.

345
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,520
There are only our own people.

346
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
It was Gui Yu

347
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,320
who found him.

348
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,310
He had been dead when I found him.

349
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,810
I didn't see anyone else.

350
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,060
It's a shame

351
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,560
that your apprentice was killed.

352
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,730
However,

353
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,020
I've found

354
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,650
the key.

355
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:10,650
Shall we keep

356
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,770
looking for the treasures?

357
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,520
Of course.

358
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,530
We'll go to the mountains tomorrow.

359
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,520
A secret weapon.

360
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,020
I don't believe

361
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,600
Yin Ji would have been killed by this little trick.

362
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,270
Take care of yourselves.

363
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,190
Gui Yu, stay here.

364
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,060
Master.

365
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,350
How long have you been with me?

366
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,810
Four years.

367
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,020
Do you think

368
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,070
your senior could get rid of this trick

369
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,810
with his kung fu?

370
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,730
I don't know.

371
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,810
But I do doubt

372
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,680
the cause of his death.

373
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,770
The owner once mentioned something about the Hidden Fox.

374
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,860
I'm not sure

375
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,860
whether he has something to do with this.

376
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,350
The Hidden Fox?

377
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,980
There are rumours about him.

378
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,020
Do you believe

379
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,350
the rumours?

380
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,980
I'm not sure about that.

381
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,770
Now Bao Shu

382
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,690
has got the key.

383
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,770
We've lost one more person.

384
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,570
I don't know

385
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,720
what we should do now.

386
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,310
It must be you who should take the credit.

387
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,520
Let's find an opportunity

388
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,270
to get back the key.

389
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,560
All of us

390
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,310
have our own unique skills

391
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,020
except you.

392
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,360
Bao Shu and I

393
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,810
have been at peace with each other for all those years

394
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,940
because we're all afraid of

395
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,310
the other's unique skills.

396
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,270
Go get some rest.

397
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,110
Yes.

398
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,060
[An Hour Ago]

399
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,600
I heard noises.

400
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,810
Senior!

401
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,110
Nice trick.

402
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,230
Right on time.

403
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,730
I learned that from Yin Ji.

404
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,980
What did Tao Baisui

405
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,350
tell you

406
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,650
just now?

407
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,100
He said you two don't fight each other

408
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,770
because of your unique skills.

409
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,390
But it's different this time.

410
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,190
He asked me to get prepared for the fight.

411
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:09,650
I thought

412
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,890
he's planning to get the key from you.

413
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,360
Is he?

414
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,970
Don't worry.

415
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,020
I'm good at

416
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,980
hiding my identity.

417
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,230
Then hurry up.

418
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,150
Who's got the map now?

419
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,270
Zhou Yunyang.

420
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,480
Kill him.

421
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,480
Help me get the map.

422
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,140
Zhou Yunyan is very sensitive.

423
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,820
He's not as easy as Yin Ji to deal with.

424
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,190
I don't know his unique skills either.

425
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,230
Since when can the hound

426
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,900
negotiate with the hunter?

427
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,140
This is what my father gave me.

428
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:55,680
It blesses you.

429
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,020
I was the one who asked you to join.

430
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,600
I'll let you live

431
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,070
no matter what happens.

432
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,070
[The Second Day]

433
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:18,110
Let's get through the woods first.

434
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,180
If we get lost,

435
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,400
we just walk towards the sun.

436
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:58,360
Tao,

437
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,690
there's something wrong with the woods.

438
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:26,690
It's an illusion.

439
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:54,400
Gui Yu.

440
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:55,810
Zhou Yunyang.

441
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,440
Gui Yu.

442
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:57,440
Sanniang.

443
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,190
Zhou Yunyang.

444
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,390
Zheng Sanniang.

445
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:08,180
Sanniang.

446
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,600
Zhou Yunyang.

447
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:15,890
Sanniang.

448
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:31,480
Sanniang.

449
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:33,230
Zhou Yunyang.

450
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,560
Zhou Yunyang.

451
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,110
Zhou Yunyang.

452
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:10,480
Gui Yu.

453
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:13,520
Where are others?

454
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,270
Did you see them?

455
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,980
No.

456
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,560
It's weird.

457
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,150
Why can't we get out of the woods?

458
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,520
Because you walked in at the wrong time.

459
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,980
The fog is the thickest in the woods

460
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:29,940
every morning.

461
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,150
Illusions are everywhere.

462
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,480
It's like a maze.

463
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,970
You can't get out of here with only a map.

464
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,310
After this period of time,

465
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,820
it'll be rather easy

466
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,640
to get out of the woods.

467
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:45,980
How do you know that?

468
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:51,890
The fog will be gone soon.

469
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:57,810
I need to hurry up.

470
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,060
It was really you

471
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,900
who killed Yin Ji.

472
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,400
Why did you kill him?

473
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,100
Give me the map

474
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:40,190
so we can both live.

475
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,640
I don't think

476
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:43,980
you can live.

477
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,390
Interesting.

478
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,810
You killed Yin Ji?

479
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,680
That's what you've got?

480
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,360
Bring it on.

481
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,230
You brat.

482
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:16,820
Come over.

483
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:19,480
Why are you scared?

484
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,180
Come on.

485
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,440
Is this your unique skill,

486
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,100
icing?

487
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,770
Water

488
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,560
is my secret weapon.

489
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,310
No one is living

490
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:15,600
who ever saw this skill.

491
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,320
Is that so?

492
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,060
There's no alcohol in your kettle, right?

493
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,360
Zhou Yunyang is dead.

494
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:33,150
I've got this map

495
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,770
at the expense of my life.

496
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:40,980
Go.

497
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,100
I'm poisoned by Zhou Yunyang.

498
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,390
I can't live more than four hours.

499
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:47,780
Only Tao Baisui has the antidote.

500
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Really?

501
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,430
Go ask him for it.

502
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,180
What do you mean?

503
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,650
I just killed Zhou Yunyang.

504
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:02,060
You asked me to go to him.

505
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,940
Do you want me to be killed by him?

506
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,730
Father.

507
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,600
Is it the right way?

508
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,430
It should be here.

509
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:15,480
Gui Yu.

510
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:18,980
What's wrong

511
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,610
with this map?

512
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,020
Gui Yu.

513
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:36,600
Gui Yu.

514
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,900
What are you doing?

515
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,140
My plan did not work out,

516
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:41,980
but I have to be alive.

517
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,350
Gui Yu wants to take back the key, being alive.

518
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,570
It is impossible.

519
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,020
A quarrel which benefits only a third party.

520
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:56,140
We just wait to see what will happen.

521
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,840
[An hour ago]

522
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,480
My apprentice,

523
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,650
it's absolutely you.

524
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:37,480
You do think

525
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,400
you can play tricks on me.

526
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:42,860
When did you

527
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:44,190
start to be suspicious of me?

528
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:46,980
The bamboo cup

529
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,350
was overturned negligently by you

530
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:52,940
when you deployed your scheme, is that right?

531
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,020
I don't have children.

532
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,680
I have always taken you and Yin Ji

533
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,230
as my biological sons.

534
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:10,730
Now, I've lost my two sons.

535
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,810
How do you pay for that?

536
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
Since I was caught by you,

537
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,430
I have nothing to say.

538
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,110
But all the tricks are designed by Bao Shu.

539
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,790
From the very beginning, he has not thought about seeking treasure with you.

540
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,310
He wants to kill you all.

541
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,110
When was you bought over?

542
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:35,890
He didn't buy over me.

543
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:38,980
From the beginning, I was with him.

544
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,600
These years,

545
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,390
your actions,

546
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:46,980
all have been observed by him.

547
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,020
Have he?

548
00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:05,900
You can kill me,

549
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:07,060
but now,

550
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,440
you have the map

551
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,350
while he has the key.

552
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,520
There is no advantage for you two.

553
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,640
Either both of you

554
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,150
can not find the treasure,

555
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:14,020
or

556
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,230
one kill the other,

557
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:16,480
leaving nobody alive.

558
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:17,770
Keep me alive

559
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:18,650
because I'm still helpful.

560
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:21,770
It is said that

561
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,020
if the knife stabs into eyes,

562
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,110
people will not die at the moment.

563
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,560
Today,

564
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,190
let me have a try.

565
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,270
Wait.

566
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,310
Force his mouth to be open.

567
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,560
The poison

568
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:58,100
will attack in two hours.

569
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:00,690
After that,

570
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,650
you are bound to die.

571
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,640
Now here's a chance for you.

572
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,390
You give the fake map to Bao Shu,

573
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,650
and you return with his key

574
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,520
for the cure.

575
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:17,230
They are inseparable.

576
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,480
How can I take actions?

577
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,940
Haven't you been good at hiding?

578
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,360
Where is the destination of the map?

It is been taken away.

Let's take actions separately.

592
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,350
Kill them all.

is the death of you.

636

What do you think?

I never wanted to oppose you.

647
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,520

01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:53,270
to live like a dog.

771
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:55,150
Right?

772
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,020
Hu Fei.

773
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,270
Shut up.

774
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,810
Your kungfu

775
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:20,020
was all taught by me.

776
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,520
Every move of you

777
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,770
was seen clearly by me.

778
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:27,850
Don't you remember

779
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:31,310
I'm your father?

780
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:32,440
Shut up!

781
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:34,680
My father is

782
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,900
Hu Yidao!

783
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:05,400
Your technique of using sword

784
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,360
is not even half of Hu Yidao's.

785
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,560
A top master

786
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,650
just gave birth to

787
01:22:15,650 --> 01:22:17,270
a waste like you.

788
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,270
He could not die in peace.

789
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,100
As your father,

790
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,020
I will teach you one last move.

791
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,110
Win

792
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:35,230
from real danger.

793
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,650
Die

794
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:39,680
and live later.

795
01:22:42,020 --> 01:22:43,390
Learn it.

796
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:48,440
Qing Wen.

797
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,860
You lied to me.

798
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:51,680
For all these years.

799
01:22:52,690 --> 01:22:54,520
You have been lying to me.

800
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,520
Do you even want to kill me as well?

801
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,440
My father,

802
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,890
my mother,

803
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,310
and the enormous revenge of

804
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,110
the whole Hu Village.

805
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,980
I cannot take the revenge.

806
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:13,230
For all these years,

807
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:18,690
I have been living like a dog.

808
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:24,100
I just intended to live.

809
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:28,520
But you just found me.

810
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:31,390
From that moment,

811
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:33,400
I knew

812
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:37,060
this was a chance given by the God.

813
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:43,350
You cannot blame me.

814
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,440
I will kill you.

815
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:52,180
I will kill you.

816
01:23:52,230 --> 01:23:53,480
The stuff is in his hands.

817
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,230
Wait.

818
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,400
Qing Wen.

819
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,050
I was tricked

820
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:26,770
and put you

821
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:28,190
in danger.

822
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,060
Please kill me.

823
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:46,810
Leave.

824
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:13,690
Why

825
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,190
is here nothing?

826
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,480
Where's the treasure?

827
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:27,980
Qian is the heaven.

828
01:26:28,900 --> 01:26:30,100
Kan is the water.

829
01:26:31,610 --> 01:26:33,230
The red gas caused it.

830
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:36,900
Qian is the heaven.

831
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:39,980
Kan is the water.

832
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:44,270
The red gas caused it.

833
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,780
At midnight,

834
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,770
in the northeast,

835
01:28:51,930 --> 01:28:53,070
there will be the entrance.

836
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,730
There will be the entrance.

837
01:28:57,610 --> 01:28:59,970
Go find it quickly.

838
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:03,070
Qing Wen.

839
01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:04,860
Qing Wen.

840
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:13,320
There is no entrance here.

841
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:19,940
The treasure

842
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,110
is frozen by the firm ice.

843
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:24,690
If you really want to break the ice by force,

844
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:29,890
you must fall to the abyss with it.

845
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:35,600
This is the only way

846
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:37,650
to get the treasure.

847
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,100
How did you know it?

848
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:45,020
I came here before.

849
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:55,730
Qing Wen.

850
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:57,650
Are you crazy?

851
01:30:40,350 --> 01:30:41,520
My daughter.

852
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,310
There is poison

853
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:06,770
on the blade.

854
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,820
Bohun upas.

855
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:11,360
Do you still

856
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:13,930
remember this poison?

857
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:25,900
You followed me so many years.

858
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,940
And you want to kill me

859
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:33,180
with my poison.

860
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:00,860
He's come.

861
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:08,020
You...

862
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:11,200
You are still alive.

863
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,730
Win from real danger.

864
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:15,860
Die and live later.

865
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:18,350
I learned it.

866
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,270
Hu Fei.

867
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:25,650
Qing Wen.

868
01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:26,480
Without this,

869
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:30,070
I will see how you can come back to life.

870
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:36,060
Bastard.

871
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,730
You two bastards.

872
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:40,650
I will kill you. Kill you!

873
01:33:57,640 --> 01:33:58,850
Why?

874
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:01,230
Why?

875
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:02,980
Qing Wen.

876
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:06,400
Why do you even betray me?

877
01:34:07,150 --> 01:34:08,360
You are about to die

878
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:10,650
and you know nothing.

879
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:13,190
Idiot.

880
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:28,360
Who gave you the name

881
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:29,940
Gui Yu?

882
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:32,140
I've been searching for you for a long time.

883
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:33,930
Who are you?

884
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:35,610
I'm Miao Ruolan,

885
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,270
daughter of Miao Renfeng.

886
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:46,770
Guide them up the mountain

887
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:47,940
and attack them one by one.

888
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,400
This is our only chance.

889
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,390
The key and the map.

890
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:54,270
We cannot let one of them have both at the same time.

891
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:00,630
[Inn]

892
01:35:35,430 --> 01:35:36,810
My father gave this to me.

893
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:38,270
It can protect you safe.

894
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,070
You came because of me.

895
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:42,560
No matter what happens,

896
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:44,850
I have to let you live.

897
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,310
The plan has changed. Be careful.

898
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:01,520
Qing Wen.

899
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:02,230
Leave.

900
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:04,140
Swap the cure with the key.

901
01:36:04,270 --> 01:36:05,100
Save yourself first.

902
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:06,400
They still have four left.

903
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:08,020
We have to take a risky move.

904
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:09,060
Promise me.

905
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:10,020
Live till the end.

906
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:11,350
Let's go.

907
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,020
Do you even want to kill me as well?

908
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:18,520
This was a chance given by the God.

909
01:36:19,390 --> 01:36:20,520
You cannot blame me.

910
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:21,940
I will kill you!

911
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:23,600
I will kill you!

912
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:54,230
The treasure

913
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,110
is yours.

914
01:37:12,450 --> 01:37:16,900
[Bao Shu, One of Eight Evils, Died]

915

[The 30th Day]

916
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:13,180
There's no need.

917
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:18,020
Allow Gui Yu to enter the palace with the blade.

918
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:26,860
You

919
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:30,150
found the treasure first?

920
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:31,730
Yes.

921
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:33,570
There are numerous treasures.

922
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,350
You can get it any time.

923
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:37,140
It's just a small part in the box.

924
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:38,940
For you to admire.

925
01:38:40,350 --> 01:38:42,940
You are indeed a teenager hero.
