CHO HAEWON INTERVIEW

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,525
{\an8}NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

4
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,319
{\an8}CHECK

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,696
Ms. Oh Soryong…

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,824
are you different…

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,994
from Koo Hyeongtae?

8
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,875
Hanju's history…

9
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,299
is far more bloodthirsty,

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,052
twisted, and ruthless…

11
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,390
than you can imagine.

12
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,353
I've been watching you for a long time…

13
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,398
to see what kind of person you are.

14
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,360
And to see how far…

15
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,737
you're willing to go.

16
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,450
If your morals are stronger…

17
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,662
than Koo Hyeongtae's convictions.

18
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,707
At least till the end…

19
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,751
don't abandon me.

20
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,674
I need your help, Ms. Oh Soryong.

21
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,594
Will you?

22
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:37,055
What are you saying?

23
00:01:39,391 --> 00:01:41,351
I wish you'd stop speaking in riddles.

24
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,062
Tell me what you mean.

25
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,778
If in the near future…

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,115
anything happens to me…

27
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:06,126
…don't believe what they tell you.

28
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,004
'Cause they did it.

29
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,344
Soryong!

30
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,523
Cho Haewon!

31
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,776
Soryong! Soryong!

32
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,027
Haewon!

33
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,570
Please! No, don't!

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,155
- Cho Haewon!
- You can't go in there!

35
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:45,499
"EP10: OH, SORYONG"

36
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,477
HANJU CENTRAL HOSPITAL

37
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,443
I can't tell who's security
and who's police.

38
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:56,570
- It's that way.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,247
- Ma'am. Stay back. No, no, no.
- Stop them, stop them!

40
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,373
- Get back. Get back!
- Move away, please.

41
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,584
- Ma'am, step away.
- Don't touch me.

42
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,419
Back up, please. This way.

43
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,671
Step aside.

44
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,480
You're prettier in person.

45
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,068
I'm so sorry about your sister.

46
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,617
I never thought that our first meeting
would be somewhere…

47
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,619
…like this.

48
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,788
I guess our meeting was destiny.

49
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,332
I wonder if this is the last time?

50
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,421
You're surprisingly composed
for someone who just lost his sister.

51
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,469
Will you be…

52
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,429
requesting an autopsy?

53
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,320
Well, come on.

54
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,707
IN MOURNING

55
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,712
Open.

56
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,214
- Sir?
- Open!

57
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,383
Yes, sir.

58
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,484
I want you to get a good look
at what you did to her.

59
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,444
Autopsy?

60
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,281
What are you, a psychopath?

61
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,532
Huh?

62
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,702
You will not be desecrating
my sister's remains.

63
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,453
You've already done quite enough to her.

64
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,373
No, she'll be buried as she is.

65
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,837
What if it wasn't suicide?

66
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,051
You have evidence?

67
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,221
Well, do you?

68
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,682
So…

69
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,684
this was murder.

70
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,185
I'd wager you killed her.

71
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,232
You people smeared my sister's good name
and you drove her to suicide. Huh?

72
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,862
You enjoying this?

73
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,572
Aren't you bodyguards?

74
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,240
You're just gonna stand there?

75
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,743
The goddamn media vultures
are trying to take photos

76
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,911
of my sister for profit, what the fuck?

77
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,125
I assume in the past when you've written

78
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,502
your little stories on my peers,

79
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:00,837
in order to keep their honor,

80
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,214
they requested
that you withhold their names.

81
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,634
I'm prepared to defend my honor.

82
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:06,718
So…

83
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,471
you better come ready to fight.

84
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,727
CHO JINMAN

85
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,312
The bitch is gone!

86
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,259
Guess it was all…

87
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,471
…just fate.

88
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,060
She had to go!

89
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,353
She had to go!

90
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,821
You hear that, Dad? It's finally my time!

91
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,009
Slap, slap.

92
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,679
When should I tell them
he finally croaked?

93
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,349
When was my lucky day again?

94
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,518
Hmm?

95
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,909
What's this about?

96
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,245
Hmm…

97
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,830
Well, so…

98
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,209
When do we
tell everyone my father is dead?

99
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,922
I'll be in touch when we're ready for it,
I already told you.

100
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,257
Stop calling me,

101
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,010
and for the love of God,
please try to lay low.

102
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,303
Got it?

103
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,434
Do I look like a manservant?

104
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,937
He thinks he can call whenever.

105
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,732
Things will change around here.

106
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,986
Let's see how long
you keep talking that shit.

107
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,363
I'm Koo Hyeongtae.

108
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,244
Man, you're practically dry by now.

109
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,997
Yeah… Well,
the call dragged on for a while.

110
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,208
You know what I think
the real issue is here?

111
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,501
It's the damn media.

112
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,963
I mean, just think about it.

113
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,216
You brought a criminal element
into the media,

114
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,135
and that's where
all your problems started.

115
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,012
The constant thorn in my side.

116
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,224
Well, this whole thing was avoidable.

117
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,311
You couldn't even take
that one show off the air, could you?

118
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,439
The thing about weeds,

119
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,776
they'll always keep cropping up
no matter how much poison you use.

120
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,986
So what?

121
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,531
You're gonna keep letting these people
muddy our affairs?

122
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,908
Not at all, no.

123
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,872
What I'm trying to say is
we need to find the root cause of it all.

124
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,667
That's why I'm gonna tell you this…

125
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,717
Are you sure Cho Haewon's dead?

126
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,927
I keep looking,
but I can't find any reports.

127
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,762
There's one article.

128
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,598
"Woman, forties, dies in a villa fire".

129
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,100
Wow, those Hanju bastards are scary.

130
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,186
I mean, this kind of censorship?
In this day and age?

131
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,188
- They're suppressing the media.
- I'm actually relieved.

132
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,400
If news of her death got out,
they'd be blaming Oh Soryong right away.

133
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,527
Silence is a relief.

134
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,989
Hey, this is the calm before the storm,
the silence won't last.

135
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,791
Apparently, they pushed
Lee Yumi's second trial date to next week.

136
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,836
Looks like the prosecutor's calling
for a death sentence.

137
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,467
Mr. Yoon, I think
we'll have to push back your episode,

138
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,260
so we can air the Lee Yumi episode first.

139
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,678
That okay with you?

140
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,139
I know that our coverage
could have an impact on the trial.

141
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,474
I'd be a monster if I said no.

142
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,184
Okay, let's do that then.

143
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,520
Did you get any sleep last night?

144
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,939
You!

145
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,274
Who do you think you are?

146
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,278
A detective?

147
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,739
Or you just like killing people
with your interviews?

148
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,824
SUMMONS

149
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,409
FOR OH SORYONG'S DEFAMATION OF CHO HAEWON

150
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,037
Come with me.

151
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,256
You think
you can interrogate people like a cop?

152
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,174
All I did was conduct a simple interview.

153
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,759
She didn't kill herself
after talking to you?

154
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:44,138
I'm sick of hearing about Oh Soryong
driving another person to suicide!

155
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,557
Don't you get
that once Hanju goes after you,

156
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,268
your days as a producer are numbered?

157
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,104
She confessed to me
that she killed Cha Seongwook.

158
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,481
Cho Haewon…

159
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,317
told me that herself.

160
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,612
She said that 20 years ago,

161
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,781
the cops, and even a certain producer…

162
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,617
were all paid off with bribes.

163
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,912
You said you dropped the case
'cause it was a dead end.

164
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,914
I guess that must have all been a lie?

165
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,252
So you're trying to interrogate me now,
Oh Soryong?

166
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,379
Producers are allowed to make mistakes.

167
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,006
They're fallible like everyone.

168
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,258
Sure.

169
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,721
If what Haewon said is true though,
then you committed a crime.

170
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,808
You stood to benefit from Haewon's death,

171
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,811
without her, it's like
your irredeemable past is erased.

172
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,355
You thought you'd eliminate Trigger too.

173
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,402
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Ms. Oh,

174
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,362
but it wasn't me.

175
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,200
You really think someone in my position
would be stupid enough to do such a thing?

176
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,202
All I know is…

177
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,496
it wouldn't be the first time
you covered up a murder…

178
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,624
without getting your own hands dirty.

179
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,544
You got evidence?

180
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,297
Can you prove that he was really killed?

181
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:04,260
Why are you treating his death as a fact
based on the claims of Ms. Cho?

182
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,599
You know, I've noticed a trend
in stories like this.

183
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,310
Sometimes it's blatantly obvious
the suspect did it,

184
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,813
but even when they're in custody,
prosecutors can't make the charges stick.

185
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,065
Once they finally get to court,

186
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,692
the accused is always able
to escape punishment.

187
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,945
You think the police, judges,
and prosecutors are all idiots?

188
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,530
It's not about personal connections,

189
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,240
flaws in the system,
or anything like that.

190
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,159
It's just… lack of proof!

191
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,581
Concrete evidence is the only thing
that proves guilt.

192
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,960
When I first heard her confession,
I was as naive as you.

193
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,837
"So she's the culprit."

194
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,215
"He's not missing, it's murder."

195
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,801
I didn't realize until afterwards

196
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,429
that her testimony alone
wasn't enough to prove her guilt.

197
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,768
So, did she give you
any solid evidence this time?

198
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,105
Just as I thought.

199
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,815
Back then and now,

200
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,108
Cho Haewon got her kicks

201
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:02,443
by holding the media
in the palm of her hand

202
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,738
and toying with us,
always with total impunity.

203
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,949
Her suicide was her final maneuver.

204
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,911
She ruined your perfect episode,
and she won her little game forever.

205
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,541
And you…

206
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,544
walked right into it.

207
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,516
I've been informed
that Chairman Cho Taesu of Hanju has died.

208
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,105
I heard a rumor…

209
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,566
the Chairman was actually...

210
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,025
He'd been bedridden.

211
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,154
He must have heard the news
that his only daughter

212
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,823
had committed suicide
after your interview,

213
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,450
and it was too much
for his fragile body to handle.

214
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,162
Here's what you need to understand.

215
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,372
Because of your involvement
in Haewon's death,

216
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:01,002
and in those of Choi Hoseong,
his father, and Chairman Cho,

217
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,838
the public perceives you as a killer.

218
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,261
So, might I suggest you start
rethinking your interview methods

219
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,973
because your body count's now at four.

220
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,113
Cho Jinman,
son of the late Cho Taesu,

221
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:33,034
alleges that his sister died the day
she was set to meet with Oh Soryong.

222
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:36,537
He claims her suicide resulted
from the producer's interview methods.

223
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,248
The police have obtained
evidence of other instances

224
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,750
where Ms. Oh's interviews
have caused harm…

225
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,087
- Hello, Ms. Oh.
- Hey.

226
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,263
- Morning, Ms. Oh.
- Ms. Oh, there you are.

227
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,015
Hey, Ms. Oh!

228
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,019
You all right?

229
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,604
What do you think?

230
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,481
I'm surprised you came in.

231
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,524
Today's your summons,
and it's the air date.

232
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,693
You make us proud, Oh Soryong.
You make us proud.

233
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,365
Thanks for helping,
even with such late notice.

234
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,035
You and Park Daeyong can make sure
the episode wraps up without a hitch.

235
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,454
Hey, don't think about that,
you have enough on your plate for now.

236
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,664
God.

237
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,416
Let's get started.

238
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,265
The president asked me
to pass along a message.

239
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:40,851
And what's that?

240
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,895
When you go to the police later,

241
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,981
don't say anything
to the reporters out front.

242
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,441
What do you mean?

243
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,360
He says if you say one word to them,

244
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,238
he'll have no choice
but to cancel your episode.

245
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,698
Mr. Son, that's absurd!

246
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,908
Don't get snippy with me,
I'm only a messenger.

247
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,994
That's all.

248
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,879
Shit.

249
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,724
Let's roll.

250
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,108
NAMBU POLICE STATION

251
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,444
Oh, she's here.

252
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,654
- She's here.
- Ms. Oh! Quick question!

253
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,990
Is it true?
Are you a sadistic interviewer?

254
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,575
Care to respond to Hanju's claim
of "murder-by-interview"?

255
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,410
Are your inhumane
interview tactics just for the ratings?

256
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,663
How'd it feel to stand where
one of your criminal subjects once stood?

257
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,332
It was suicide,
you people need to shut up!

258
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,791
You can't keep dodging our questions!

259
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,627
- Is it true?
- Give us a comment!

260
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,379
Care to comment, Ms. Oh?

261
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,006
- Ms. Oh, anything to say?
- Ms. Oh, please respond!

262
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,592
- Please, give us a comment!
- Tell us how you're feeling!

263
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,096
We understand
why you called an emergency meeting,

264
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,725
but we can't just remove the show outright
due to broadcast programming law.

265
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,022
I didn't mean
it has to get removed right away.

266
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:12,652
My point is that the situation is dire,
and this needs to be addressed.

267
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,613
You seem to have comprehension problems.

268
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,990
President.

269
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,158
Whether the show gets canceled or not,

270
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,452
shouldn't this talk of cancellation
follow a full discussion

271
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:22,787
of the situation at hand?

272
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,705
That's what this meeting's for.

273
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,457
It's a place for me
and our department heads

274
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,376
to share opinions on the matter.

275
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,252
Anyway, that concludes today's session.

276
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,047
As for you, Director of Programming,
meet me in my office right now.

277
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,840
President.

278
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,133
President!

279
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,809
What do you want?

280
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,856
Well, I just spoke with your secretary,

281
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,360
she told me you had a meeting
to discuss the cancellation of Trigger.

282
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,237
So I waited for you.

283
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,116
There is something I need to tell you
about Dr. Trigger, sir.

284
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,619
I've heard that you and Ms. Oh…

285
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,747
have a bet on to see
who unmasks Dr. Trigger first,

286
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,791
and the show's continuation
is on the line.

287
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,960
Could that be true?

288
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,213
Huh? Uh… well, yes. Yes.

289
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,382
You were there too, Mr. Son. Remember?

290
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,801
Regarding the good doctor…

291
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,846
Oh Soryong
happens to have already caught him.

292
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,854
There's actually two of them.

293
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,231
You know that?

294
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,025
Why is the Trigger staff
the most insubordinate?

295
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,069
Even producer rookies

296
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,989
have the gall to address the president
with such disrespect.

297
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,741
This is a serious matter
you're discussing here.

298
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,745
Do you mind if I tell you
who it is right now?

299
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,872
How dare you pull this in the hallway?

300
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,749
Go wait inside, Mr. Han.

301
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,918
Okay.

302
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,549
Who is it then?

303
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,634
Who the hell is Dr. Trigger?

304
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,852
I am, sir.

305
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,524
I can show you the VPN provider
that I subscribed to,

306
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,486
and I can tell you in full detail
where I made my post.

307
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,198
However, I only made the first post,
and then the rest…

308
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,200
were someone else.

309
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,204
- So what?
- Since our team's caught Dr. Trigger,

310
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,623
I'd like you to revoke the cancellation.

311
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,836
As for me,
I'll accept whatever punishment.

312
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,507
Why… would you post
something like that? Huh?

313
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,467
I thought I was doing the right thing.

314
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,638
I had no idea that it would get
so distorted and out of control.

315
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,224
I apologize.

316
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,438
The other guy used my account
to spread disinformation.

317
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,610
After everything he did,
I am requesting a formal investigation

318
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,153
into the fake Dr. Trigger.

319
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,781
Please help us catch him,

320
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,784
so that we can finally
get all the facts straight.

321
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,246
Will you do that, sir?

322
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,164
Mr. Han…

323
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:17,002
since when have you been
so dutiful and self-sacrificing?

324
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,717
Taking responsibility for my actions
is the least I can do.

325
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,178
If you tell me to leave,
I'll leave.

326
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,139
And I'll accept…

327
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,225
the punishment you see fit.

328
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,351
Really?

329
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,897
No amount of punishment will compare
to the absolute ridicule you'll face

330
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,066
when your team hears your confession.

331
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,069
You'll be an outcast again.
What could be worse than that?

332
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,029
I heard that when you worked on Soaps,

333
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,157
you used to eat your gimbap
in a bathroom stall.

334
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,493
Once a loser, always a loser.

335
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,495
Good luck with that.

336
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,294
Did you ever intend to honor
your end of the deal?

337
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,260
I guess that leaves me
with no choice but to…

338
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,681
…tell everyone about this,
and release the recording I took.

339
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,518
You know about this too, Mr. Son,

340
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,353
don't you?

341
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,066
I wonder why…

342
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,485
you chose…

343
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,988
such a loser…

344
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,782
for this charade.

345
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,706
Looks like
the public's turned against you.

346
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,125
It's so easy to fall out of favor,
you know?

347
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,835
Is this a part of your investigation?

348
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,505
All right.

349
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,302
Your name is Oh Soryong.

350
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,639
You're here
because of your suspected involvement, uh,

351
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:55,225
in the defamation of Ms. Cho Haewon,
namely, an interview.

352
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,561
Uh, you…

353
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,480
- Oh, you're here, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,525
Wow, here you are,

355
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,986
sitting right where Cho Haewon sat
20 years ago,

356
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,363
when she came in for questioning.

357
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,325
Pretty funny how things turn out, huh?

358
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:13,661
See how it is?

359
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,914
Everything always comes full circle.
Just the way things work, eh?

360
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,250
So…

361
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,004
I take that to mean
we'll be meeting again soon.

362
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:28,884
This detective here,

363
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,012
he came all the way here from HQ.

364
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,180
Be nice to him.

365
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,516
If you don't wanna meet again,

366
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,852
you'll have to smooth things over
with this one, got it?

367
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:40,104
Good luck.

368
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,649
What's with this coffee?
It's horrible.

369
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,448
Ms. Oh Soryong.

370
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,783
"BlueBeard" ring a bell?

371
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:58,288
{\an8}"BLUEBEARD: GIVE ME A FEW DAYS
TO BRING CHO HAEWON TO KOREA."

372
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,373
{\an8}"YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME HERE."

373
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,625
Yes.

374
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,086
That was the name of our source.

375
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,131
Were you aware
he was Cho Haewon's husband?

376
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,884
Yes.

377
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,430
They found his severed head

378
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,182
in a self-storage unit in Virginia,
in the US.

379
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,312
They found what?

380
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:25,566
What I'm saying is he was decapitated,
and his remains were recovered.

381
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,027
Interpol issued a Red Notice,

382
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,362
so we were just about to get on the case,

383
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,073
but then our suspect,
Ms. Cho Haewon, passed away.

384
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:38,662
So did they determine
an estimated time of death?

385
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:41,999
Aren't you listening to me?

386
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,043
We can't prosecute a dead woman!

387
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,294
It's all over!

388
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,839
What's important right now,
is that the number of dead people

389
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:53,135
associated with you…
is now a whopping five.

390
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,974
Now I wanna know…

391
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:03,604
when, where, and how you contacted her.

392
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:07,232
Now then, let's review each of those.

393
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,511
I'm here as a delegate from Trigger.

394
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,806
Let's get outta here.

395
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,185
Tofu cracker?

396
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,770
Not hungry?

397
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,984
Remember the guy
who put us in touch with Cho Haewon?

398
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,363
Well, he's dead.

399
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:55,531
Wait, BlueBeard?

400
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,618
They really are dying off.

401
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,331
I gave myself up to President Koo.

402
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,834
I told him I'm Dr. Trigger.

403
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,380
We can't get canceled

404
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,924
if we wanna do anything
about Haewon and Seongwook.

405
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,427
I told him
while Chief and Mr. Son were there,

406
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,138
so he can't make a move right away.

407
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,430
We didn't even talk about…

408
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:21,682
You think he…

409
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,185
God, Lunatic Han.

410
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,230
Empty-headed. My God.

411
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,942
Due to technical issues, the documentary
"Earth in Peril" will be aired instead.

412
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,235
Wait… what?

413
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,695
- Huh?
- Did…

414
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,240
What the hell happened?

415
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,994
What the hell's going on?
What even…

416
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,413
- Come on, pick up the damn phone!
- Dude, look… Look! Hey!

417
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,707
They canceled our episode
without any warning,

418
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,709
and I can't get in touch
with anyone in the control room.

419
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,793
Are you kidding me right now?

420
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,795
As I just told you,
these are the president's orders!

421
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,422
- Oh, get out of my way, okay?
- Sir, stop it!

422
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,133
- Goddamn it, don't touch me!
- Sir, stop!

423
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,635
Hey! Hey, wait!

424
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,802
- Let me in!
- You can't.

425
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,513
What are you doing?
Open the door! Open it!

426
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,933
Let me go! Open the door!

427
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,938
There you are.

428
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,818
You know it's against the law
to change programming on a whim.

429
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,030
The point of law isn't to follow it,
it's to use it.

430
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,868
It was a necessary cancellation
due to technical difficulties.

431
00:29:05,786 --> 00:29:08,705
Broadcasting Act, Article 4, Section 2.

432
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,374
"Unless prescribed by this Act,

433
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,876
nobody shall interfere
with broadcast programming."

434
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,130
Three. "A broadcast entity
shall name a head of programming,

435
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,926
maintaining complete autonomy for them
and announcing their name at least once."

436
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,012
Not even you have the authority
to do this, sir.

437
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,057
I'll report you for violating
the Broadcasting Act.

438
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,019
Do you have any idea of the significance

439
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,647
of the episode you just canceled?

440
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,942
You just robbed a young woman
of what might've been

441
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,654
her final chance at salvation
before a death sentence.

442
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:43,740
Can you grasp the severity
of what you've done? Huh?

443
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:47,911
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

444
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:52,499
Crimes need to be answered for,
regardless of who your father is.

445
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,169
Did you enjoy the investigation?

446
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,380
Huh, wasn't to your liking.

447
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,050
How low can you sink?

448
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,635
You're the reason…

449
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,430
I’ve had to sink this low.

450
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,267
Your pigheaded self-righteousness
is what caused this.

451
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,352
We're just getting started though.

452
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,980
I'm gonna put your staff
in front of the camera,

453
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,732
one after the other,

454
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,609
and they'll undergo
the same type of interrogation

455
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,820
that you underwent today.

456
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:25,115
Apparently, one of your own
turned out to be Dr. Trigger,

457
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,408
and another one defaced a wall

458
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,661
with nonsense
about Cha Seongwook still being alive.

459
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,788
And oh, did you know,

460
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,499
that last year,
Mr. Seo was caught driving drunk?

461
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,586
So you really were spying on us.

462
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,837
And Mr. Choi…

463
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,465
he enjoys the company of men.

464
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,716
Are you…

465
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,556
Are you blackmailing us?

466
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,725
Plain facts.

467
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,435
You love a good fact.

468
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,563
Go set up a press conference

469
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:59,524
and admit that you went overboard
with those interviews.

470
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,611
Admit you're to blame for everything,
and leave this all behind.

471
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:10,327
Soryong… this is your last chance,
it's not about our bet any longer.

472
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,082
You can take the fall to save your team,

473
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:17,209
or take everyone down with you.

474
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,725
The Internal Auditing Team just left.

475
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,895
I tried everything to stop them.

476
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,481
Soryong.

477
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:23,150
This is just unacceptable.

478
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,986
This is completely insane.

479
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,113
Is it true? Are you Dr. Trigger?

480
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,492
- Was it really you?
- Huh?

481
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,580
I just heard it from Mr. Son. Is it true?

482
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,332
Yes, it's true.

483
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,042
What?

484
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,462
You knew about this?

485
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:48,800
I don't approve of it,

486
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,511
but he didn't make any of that up.

487
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,098
As for the photos and footage,
someone else uploaded those.

488
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:58,310
Wow… so you…

489
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,936
knew all about this.

490
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,565
You were the first one who posted,
at the very least.

491
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,026
Who was it then? Huh?

492
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:07,944
Who was it?

493
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:10,322
Who was this mystery cheater? Was it you?

494
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,573
What?

495
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,618
Or, uh, was it you, Byeonggeun?

496
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,454
- What, have you lost your mind?
- What's the matter?

497
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,124
I don't see why we should have to tell you
anything right now.

498
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:23,460
Why?

499
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,963
When everybody else said you were weird,
I stood up for you. You know that?

500
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,257
And I get that nobody's perfect.

501
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,843
Name one person
who hasn't committed a minor infraction.

502
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,054
But God,
hiding behind a keyboard like a coward,

503
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,097
and exposing people
for their shortcomings?

504
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,391
Only a fucking loser would do that!

505
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,686
Who are you calling a loser?

506
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,438
Then just tell me who the cheater was.

507
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,732
See? You can't.

508
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,193
Because you're a liar.

509
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,447
It was shameful of me
to make a post like that.

510
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,532
I can admit it, trust me, I know!

511
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,619
I didn't make it up though.

512
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:02,624
I had no idea I would end up on Trigger,
I never even asked to be placed here!

513
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,585
I did it before I was hired.

514
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,922
Please.

515
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,343
You're the reason
our team is in this mess now.

516
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,511
Know that?

517
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,639
If you hadn't started
that bullshit with Dr. Trigger,

518
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,225
the real producers
wouldn't be getting fucked over.

519
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,311
"Real"?

520
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,356
Yeah. Real.

521
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,290
That's really flattering.

522
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,886
Real nice, everyone.
Gotta love the in-fighting.

523
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,638
- What a great look.
- You betrayed our trust.

524
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,266
We trusted you without question, Ms. Oh.

525
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,690
I'm sorry I kept it all to myself.

526
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,319
I just saw it as…

527
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,573
a secret weapon
that might help in a crisis.

528
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,951
Like a get-out-of-jail card.

529
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,371
I'm really so sorry…

530
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,627
- things ended up this way.
- Hey, Soryong.

531
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,713
Do you really think
saying "sorry" is gonna cut it?

532
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:46,102
Shit.

533
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,914
Ms. Oh. Ms. Oh.

534
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,333
I need you to…

535
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,709
I…

536
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:12,087
I gotta know why you went out of your way

537
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,255
to cover for Han Do like that.

538
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,675
I'm just hurt.

539
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,594
You hurt me, you know?

540
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,599
Remember what you said

541
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,018
about no one being perfect?

542
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,813
His methods were wrong,

543
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,524
but it happened before he joined,
and he was stating facts.

544
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,650
How could…

545
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:37,862
He was worried about the misconduct
in a publicly funded network.

546
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,909
When you sacrificed your integrity
and deleted the interview with Mr. Lee

547
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,327
so the president would promote you,

548
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,247
and everybody proceeded to judge you…

549
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,877
Mr. Han was the only one
who stood up for you.

550
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,587
Did you know that?

551
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,965
You, me, Mr. Han…

552
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,800
We're all just human.

553
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,385
No one's better or worse.

554
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:47,515
Cheer up, Oh Soryong!

555
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,542
THE LATE CHO TAESU

556
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,761
Father…

557
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,349
Father…

558
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,111
THE LATE CHO HAEWON

559
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,322
Haewon!

560
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:49,536
Haewon! Why!

561
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,094
Cut.

562
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,471
Great work, sir.

563
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,223
- Very moving, sir.
- Thank you.

564
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:25,572
A friend of mine…
opened a year-old bottle of snake wine,

565
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:29,409
but the snake was still alive,
and it jumped out at him.

566
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,915
You sealed the bottle?

567
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,589
My goodness.

568
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,925
Director Jang?

569
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,427
Hello, Ms. Hong!

570
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:51,431
This is great!
This right here is a script, huh?

571
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,099
You sat down
and you cranked out great work.

572
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,059
This is why you gotta forget your pride
and focus.

573
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,937
I know how to make a hit show,
so just follow my lead.

574
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,857
You do that, and you'll be a star writer
from the moment you debut.

575
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,775
Looking forward to it.

576
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,490
Gosh, I'm so happy
to see you two shaking hands.

577
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,950
- So glad to see it.
- Same here.

578
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,869
Smooth sailing from now on.

579
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,871
- All right, shall we start?
- Yes.

580
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,166
Oh, right. Did you see the news today?

581
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,251
Oh Soryong's got more drama
than Soaps lately.

582
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,836
I haven't been keeping up.

583
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,713
You're telling me
you haven't even read the news?

584
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,091
You don't know about
today's press conference?

585
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,635
Hmm, the what?

586
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:32,305
Looks like it'll be a one-woman
confession show starring Oh Soryong,

587
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,765
so let's get started!

588
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,851
{\an8}"TO KOO HYEONGTAE:
I'LL DO THE PRESS CONFERENCE."

589
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:37,936
{\an8}"THE BUILDING LOBBY AT 7."

590
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,232
You do realize
that agreeing to this conference…

591
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,151
Do you get how this makes us all look?

592
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,529
This isn't just about us, Soryong.

593
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,115
If you give in, you're putting
investigative journalism at risk!

594
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,784
They're gonna keep harassing us
from now on!

595
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,203
Just be true to yourself
and fight this like you always do!

596
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,750
For the millionth time,
if you go out there,

597
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,752
I will no longer see you as my leader.

598
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,297
Please move, Jeongseok.

599
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,091
I have to go.

600
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,136
She says she's gotta go, just let her.

601
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,477
Come on, Ms. Oh!

602
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,638
Not getting cold feet, are you?

603
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,269
Don't be scared. I support you.

604
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,621
I support you too.

605
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,956
There she is.

606
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,625
Ms. Oh, please!

607
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,336
Ms. Oh!

608
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,427
My name is Oh Soryong.

609
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,597
This is my first time doing this,

610
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,265
so I'll be reading from my notes.

611
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:24,811
I'm here today…

612
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,899
on behalf of the show Trigger,
to address certain issues,

613
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:36,030
many of which concern the way
in which our show conducts interviews.

614
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,034
I'll admit that issues have arisen

615
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:43,871
as a result of our show's
extreme interview methods…

616
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,292
which reflect our commitment

617
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:54,298
to reporting the absolute truth
to our viewers.

618
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,385
For this, I am sorry.

619
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,369
I assume full responsibility…

620
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,290
and as a result…

621
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:34,589
I intend to resign…

622
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,425
as Trigger's show runner…

623
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,635
beginning today.

624
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,695
What I just said…

625
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,114
was the formal statement

626
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,283
- President Koo asked me to deliver.
- Formal statement?

627
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,997
Hanju's history…

628
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,250
is far more bloodthirsty,

629
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,461
twisted, and ruthless…

630
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,630
than you can imagine.

631
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,424
I've been watching you for a long time.

632
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,510
To see what kind of person you are.

633
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:25,056
And to see how far you're willing to go.

634
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,521
If in the near future,

635
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,815
anything happens to me…

636
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,568
don't believe what they tell you.

637
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,320
'Cause they did it.

638
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,200
What you just heard

639
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,535
was part of my conversation
with Cho Haewon…

640
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,288
who visited me before she died.

641
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,042
Now if…

642
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,003
following this press conference,

643
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:57,755
anyone…

644
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,967
tries to pull our show off the air…

645
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,594
then that person

646
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:06,055
will most likely be…

647
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,100
a criminal accomplice trying to cover up…

648
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,895
the suspicious death of Cho Haewon.

649
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,482
Even if

650
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,651
our show ends up canceled…

651
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:22,405
we…

652
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,991
…proud investigative journalism producers…

653
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,954
we'll continue to fight
for free journalism,

654
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,581
and we'll seek out other outlets
if necessary,

655
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:34,417
to share the truth…

656
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,880
with our fellow citizens
and the whole world.

657
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,353
Oh Soryong really…

658
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,272
Oh Soryonged it.

659
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,900
Nothing can change a person's true nature.

660
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,910
Secret recording revealed,
suggesting possible murder of Cho Haewon

661
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,924
Yes, from the president.

662
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:35,019
If you'll excuse me.

663
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,363
This doesn't change a thing.

664
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:47,239
You've been demoted starting today.

665
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,119
Trigger will no longer have
their beloved champion of justice.

666
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:53,996
Yeah, well,

667
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,499
Trigger's still Trigger, even without me.

668
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,294
If you think you have the nerve,
try canceling it now.

669
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,215
Aw…

670
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,093
Looks like you came to the gunfight
with only your two fists.

671
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,389
Here's a complaint
about your breach of the Broadcasting Act.

672
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,859
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

673
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,454
Whose decision was it
to remove Oh Soryong from the show?

674
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:37,123
Is it true
you're being pressured to remove her?

675
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:19,957
Secret recording revealed,
suggesting possible murder of Cho Haewon

676
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,336
…will most likely be…
a criminal accomplice trying to cover up…

677
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,631
"OH SORYONG DID WHAT SHE DOES BEST!"

678
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,300
"SORRY FOR EVER DOUBTING YOU."

679
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,677
"OH SORYONG KEEPS JUSTICE ALIVE."

680
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,805
Why bother attempting
to court public opinion

681
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,432
when it changes daily?

682
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,397
I only care what dogs think.

683
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,908
Hey, um, see the episode
about Ms. Yumi yesterday?

684
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,367
It turned out great.

685
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,037
And I'm guessing
it's thanks to the press conference,

686
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,246
but the ratings were great too.

687
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,956
What a relief, huh?

688
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,043
Hey, hey, wait…

689
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,003
Now that Ms. Oh's gone…

690
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,005
we really need to stick together
as a team.

691
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,467
Are you gonna keep avoiding
the office like this?

692
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,512
Didn't you watch the conference?

693
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,015
I haven't been avoiding the office.
I've been investigating.

694
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,017
Like she would've wanted.

695
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,686
To honor her will.
Of course you are, as you should. Yeah…

696
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:25,981
Uh, wait, wait, wait. Hang on…

697
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,903
Um, I got… a whole lotta candy here.

698
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,239
Have a lollipop?

699
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,577
You got any sugar-free ones?

700
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,374
Wait, didn't you see the episode we did?

701
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,376
"The dangers of sugar-free products"?

702
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,087
Hey, listen, that's...

703
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,423
The idea they're healthier
is a fallacy invented by corporations.

704
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,133
Those sugar substitutes…

705
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:55,761
and no disrespect
for people who really enjoy them…

706
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,888
anyway, that stuff's terrible
for your stomach lining.

707
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,061
There he is, man of the hour.

708
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,146
I've been traveling,
so maybe I'm just out of the loop,

709
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,065
but I haven't seen you around here
in a while.

710
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,029
Mm-hmm!

711
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,115
Uh, hang on, Giho.

712
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,577
Do you have any thoughts
on who should take over for Oh Soryong?

713
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,538
Well, I'd assume
that Ms. Oh would want us to pick someone

714
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,249
who's a strong leader,
someone who's devoted.

715
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,627
Man, I just can't believe
they actually sent her to that place.

716
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:29,712
It's crazy stuff.

717
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,760
DISCIPLINARY ACTION REPORT

718
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:45,185
RATIONALE FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION

719
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,272
Flower delivery for Ms. Oh Soryong.

720
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,775
Oh… I'm afraid she's not here right now.

721
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,528
Uh… who's it from, by the way?

722
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:58,616
Um… it's been a little while,
she came by and scheduled in advance.

723
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,242
Oh, here it is.

724
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,327
"Cho Haewon."

725
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,079
Ms. Cho Haewon.

726
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,333
Huh?

727
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,173
Cho Haewon…
