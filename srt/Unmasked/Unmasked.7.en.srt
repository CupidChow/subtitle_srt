1
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,845
There's something I wanna tell you.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,681
What?

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,517
I'm Dr. Trigger.

4
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,946
Can you repeat that?

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,614
I saw them together.

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,575
I saw them having an affair.

7
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,994
- What in the world are you…
- All I did was post

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,787
that I saw it,
that I spotted them together.

9
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,123
That's literally all I did.

10
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,292
As for what happened after,

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,169
some crazy asshole hacked my account and...

12
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,685
I came clean knowing
you'd respond like this.

13
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,148
I wanted to be honest.
I owed you that much.

14
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,234
I know we're only human

15
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,403
and we've all got
a skeleton or two in our closets,

16
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,864
but this is Trigger.

17
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,911
I figured of all people,
they should be held to a certain standard.

18
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,496
- That's why I posted that...
- Stop.

19
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,582
Stop talking.

20
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,834
Let's not do this now.

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,296
We'll finish this later.

22
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,508
Good Lord, I can't believe this.

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,926
You crazy bastard.

24
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,061
How was I supposed to know
I'd end up at Trigger of all places?

25
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,481
EP07: INERTIA

26
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,941
Somebody get help!

27
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,109
Somebody get help!

28
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,033
- Move it.
- What?

29
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,910
So you caught the guy,
but you can't say who it is?

30
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,954
Those are the rules. We just can't, okay?

31
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,707
We'd like to tell you, but the suspect
won't allow it. Our hands are tied.

32
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,334
Do you think any criminal will agree
to sharing their identity?

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,752
It's not just some law-breaker.

34
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,130
This guy is under investigation
for stalking and he's free to go?

35
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,215
He wasn't stalking anybody.

36
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,719
According to him, he was hired by someone
on the internet to run an errand.

37
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,554
We've looked into this guy,

38
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,723
and he had absolutely nothing to do
with the teacher.

39
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,558
So who paid him to run the errand?

40
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,059
Who was it if not Choi Hoseong?

41
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,895
As I said, we're looking into it.

42
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,230
We've even looked
into the psychiatric hospital,

43
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,065
there's nothing implicating Choi Hoseong.

44
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,775
So don't accuse innocent people, okay?

45
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,111
At least tell me
why they suspended his sentence.

46
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,779
Show me the medical report

47
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,574
that confirms
he really does suffer a mental disorder.

48
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,702
It's the only way to give
the victims and us some peace of mind.

49
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,625
Your Trigger success
is going to your head, huh?

50
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,918
You think we're some kind of a joke?

51
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,212
You're asking me to break confidentiality.

52
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,756
- Watch out.
- All right,

53
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,842
if I can't know the errand punk,
at least give me the name of the doctor

54
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,594
who issued the medical report.

55
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,054
Give me a name, Detective, please.

56
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,556
- Help me out. Give me a name.
- All right, just move aside. Excuse me.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,808
Detective. Detective!

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,393
Hey! Detec...

59
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,647
You little…

60
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,273
"My wife disappeared six months ago

61
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,442
- with our five-year-old daughter…"
- Pass.

62
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,196
"Divorced husband climbed 11 floors

63
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,822
- to steal mother-in-law's jewelry…"
- Pass.

64
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,494
Nope. Boring as hell. It's been overdone.

65
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,167
This shaman won't stop emailing us.

66
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,252
Shaman?

67
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,462
- Some dumb report.
- About what?

68
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,717
Apparently, there was a recent incident
while the shaman was performing a gut,

69
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,053
says her deity keeps showing her
a Trigger logo

70
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,305
- begging her to post on the forum.
- I'm interested.

71
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,641
Oh, my God. Really?

72
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,477
You are looking for a story, aren't you?

73
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,022
I guess I should at least act
like I have something to do here.

74
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,607
That doesn't sound like you,
Han Do.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,694
If you need something to do,
help me with my story.

76
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,112
You're the most reliable source
that I've got.

77
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,781
You can't investigate my personal life
just because you need a story.

78
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,492
Me coming to find you during the cat case?
That was destiny.

79
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,911
Okay? You know your landlord?

80
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,539
Just in that area,
they've got some 400 properties

81
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,332
in their sons' names. It's incredible.

82
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,918
It's like a real-life Monopoly game,
you know?

83
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,461
They bought everything off the hard work

84
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,921
- of young people like us.
- Huh.

85
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,131
Huh?

86
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,635
So you're saying
that people in fancy sports cars

87
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,512
would understand
how people like us feel at all?

88
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,014
- Good morning.
- Morning.

89
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,598
- Good morning, Ms. Oh.
- Huh?

90
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,933
- Hello, Ms. Oh.
- Good morning.

91
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,227
- How are you today?
- Great. Good morning.

92
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,022
Hey, you know,
a simple no would have been fine.

93
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,024
I've had some struggles in my life too.

94
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,359
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings,

95
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,278
but you should ask someone else.

96
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,529
They got 400 properties?

97
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,781
You've got 399 more then.

98
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,368
Amoeba's changed since he got promoted.

99
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,871
He's angry.
And the referee's just ignoring them.

100
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,290
Giho's been taking his stress out
on people,

101
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,876
including me,
since his story isn't going well.

102
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,002
He's changed.

103
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:39,047
He's got some nerve bossing us around
when he's just barely made staff.

104
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,008
Oh, um… No, it's…
It's not that bad, really, it's cool.

105
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,468
Ms. Jiyun.

106
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,594
Yes?

107
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,096
Are you kidding me?
How many times am I gonna have to ask you

108
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,307
to CC me when you email the interviewees?

109
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,225
- Oh…
- Get your head in the game, okay?

110
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,852
You do this way too often.

111
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,315
How about that, huh?

112
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,861
Violinist Choi Geon To Hold
Charity Concert on March 22

113
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,199
Hello?

114
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,242
This is Choi Hoseong.

115
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,996
Uh…

116
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,456
Sorry, who is this?

117
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,500
I'd like to…

118
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,045
give you a gift.
You mind coming to see me?

119
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,718
THE FIRST INFORMANT

120
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,846
What the hell does that crazy prick
wanna give you anyway?

121
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,849
I guess word's out about my hospital visit
and Ms. Nam's whole thing.

122
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,186
The boys did do their homework.

123
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,271
We can't be certain if he's faking or not.

124
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,607
We should be glad
we can see for ourselves.

125
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,359
We've seen stalker cases play out.

126
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,819
It's always the same thing.

127
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
They stalk victims till they die

128
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,864
or… they switch targets.

129
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,741
Wear a mask at least. A big one.

130
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,827
Why? You can find my face anywhere.

131
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,161
Well…

132
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,872
You'll find more than just my face.

133
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,208
Then at least, take a bodyguard.

134
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,085
Take Han Do with you.

135
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,423
- Kang Giho.
- Huh? Me?

136
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,757
Why don't you come along?

137
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,842
Come get some air.

138
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,886
Sitting there with writer's block
won't do much good.

139
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,221
Come on, let's go.

140
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,849
- Uh… what about Do?
- I asked you!

141
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,308
Are you coming or not?

142
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,853
Uh… I-I'm coming,
I'm not even scared, okay?

143
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,900
Ms. Oh!
Make sure to wear a mask!

144
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:28,865
OSEONG NATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

145
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,706
The patient understands
his disease very well,

146
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,583
so please don't say
or do anything

147
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,876
that could make him too agitated.

148
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,587
And please limit your visit to 30 minutes.

149
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,161
Uh…

150
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,650
Oh Soryong.

151
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,613
It seems like you like gifts, right?

152
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,950
Am I speaking to…

153
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,619
Choi Hoseong…

154
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,788
right now?

155
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,998
What do you think?

156
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,917
Can you…

157
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,296
let us talk to your…

158
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,967
other personalities as well?

159
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,675
Ever since I arrived here…

160
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,137
I've been learning
how best to control myself.

161
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,681
I wasn't even aware

162
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,726
of these other identities I had
inside my own head.

163
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,936
Ah.

164
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,372
A gift for you.

165
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,211
MEDICAL REPORT
CHOI HOSEONG, MALE

166
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,005
{\an8}MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER, DELIRIUM

167
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,883
DR. AN MYEONGSEOK,
PYEONGIL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

168
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,176
Is this…

169
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,179
your official diagnosis?

170
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,139
If I was lying about my disease,

171
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:43,142
I wouldn't very well have this report,
would I, Soryong?

172
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,228
So, with the incident that just happened,

173
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,730
looks like you're claiming innocence.

174
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,566
You seem like the kind of person

175
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,610
who refuses to quit till they see

176
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,654
the real truth for themselves.

177
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,906
Now that…

178
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,660
I've shown you,
I'm sure you can see the truth.

179
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,497
I don't actually know
what happened out there.

180
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,505
I don't even… think I can recall
what the woman looked like, at this point.

181
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,092
I would just like to remain in here,
in peace…

182
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,678
receiving my treatment.

183
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,661
You need to go right now.

184
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,037
Visitation is over.

185
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,831
Sir, we got official clearance
to be here...

186
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,207
I couldn't care less how you got in here.

187
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,085
This man is seriously ill. Show them out!

188
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,170
- Uh, wait, no, that's not… Hey…
- Please get up, Mr. Choi.

189
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,247
That quack who issued
the medical report for the lunatic…

190
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,208
is nowhere to be seen.

191
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,003
That little act of his deserves
an Academy Award, don't you think?

192
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,087
He should go to Cannes.

193
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,256
He could have easily bitten one of us.

194
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,341
I did great in there.

195
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,426
Good thing I had my phone.

196
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:41,886
It's like you don't get a traffic ticket

197
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,304
if you don't know
that you ran the red light.

198
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,474
- Ah, jeez, we need a signal or something!
- Doctor.

199
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,851
Doctor! Dr. An?

200
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,271
You're Dr. An, aren't you?

201
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,192
- Who are you?
- KNS, we're Trigger reporters.

202
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,402
You know Choi Hoseong, don't you?

203
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,073
You saw Choi Hoseong
while he was serving a life sentence,

204
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,659
and diagnosed him
with dissociative identity disorder.

205
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,329
- I don't know him.
- He got a suspended sentence

206
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,705
because of your diagnosis,

207
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,457
so I doubt you're unaware.

208
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,584
And then you were named
director of this facility

209
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,336
right after Choi was released.

210
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,298
Then Choi's father just so happens
to donate six billion to the facility.

211
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,841
Who the hell do you think…

212
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:23,594
Oh!

213
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,679
- Doctor!
- Hey! Whoa!

214
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,182
- Doctor!
- Hey!

215
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,892
Dr. An! Doctor!

216
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,977
Wait, Doctor!

217
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,814
You sure there was nothing wrong
with Choi Hoseong's medical report?

218
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,690
Are you sure
his release had nothing to do with…

219
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,150
- Move, damn it!
- …you becoming a director here?

220
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,277
- Whoa, whoa!
- Doctor, if you could just…

221
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,780
Doctor!

222
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,285
You're supposed to save lives,
not… run them over!

223
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,080
They think we do this out of duty
or sense of justice or whatever,

224
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,414
but look at that.

225
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,791
His response was insane.

226
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,209
You don't do that if you're innocent.

227
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,002
It's all the more reason to keep going.

228
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,170
Let's say we nail the prick.

229
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,421
What if he claims ignorance,

230
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,298
saying he didn't know
what his alter egos were doing?

231
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,383
What else can we do?

232
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,844
We expose him now
saying he's faking his illness

233
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,262
and send him back to prison.

234
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:07,930
Trigger awaits your call
about the Choi Hoseong Case

235
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,016
Do we really have to put these banners up
on our website too?

236
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,643
You got a better idea?

237
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,895
To put Choi back in jail
without airing an episode?

238
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,605
I'm all ears.

239
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,318
You sent his report
to the Medical Association?

240
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,779
If they say the diagnosis was forged,

241
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,698
I'll take it
to the prosecutor immediately.

242
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,492
If Choi Hoseong was the one
behind the recent incident,

243
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,995
then there must have been
a middleman between him

244
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,705
and whoever it is they caught just now.

245
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,081
What's your feeling?

246
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,875
Hoseong's mother moved abroad
after the incident.

247
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,959
She's been gone for a while.

248
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,336
So, I'd say his dad's a likely confidant.

249
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,838
Murder or not, he's still the man's son.

250
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,424
Nice, I'm planning on meeting him first.

251
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,301
Why the hell'd you ask me
if you had a plan already?

252
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,305
You and I are on the same page
on most things.

253
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,391
Let's work together
and air this episode.

254
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,399
What the?

255
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,947
- Oh, God…
- Just do it again.

256
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,282
Fighting!

257
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,713
That's not how you do it, Moka.

258
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,758
Every idiot will respond to a post
with that title, it'd take forever

259
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,051
- to filter through them all.
- Hands to yourself.

260
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,054
A little piece of wisdom
I learned from Sangmok.

261
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,640
"Time invested reporting
is proportional to the cash spent."

262
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,726
Again, "Time invested reporting
is proportional to the cash spent."

263
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,686
Check online, I made a post about it.

264
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,982
He's being such a douche.

265
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,568
That slipped out.

266
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,861
He's a complete douche.

267
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,073
Trigger awaits calls from tire-slashing
witness at Sandol Swimming Pool

268
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,491
#KNS #Trigger #PaidTipOff

269
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,409
Okay.

270
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,668
Pack your bag,
follow me outside.

271
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,835
Huh?

272
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,546
Hey, dude.

273
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,298
Where are you going though?

274
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,549
Out-of-town training.

275
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,052
Training?

276
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,998
CHOI GEON ON TOUR FOR CHARITY CONCERTS

277
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,505
All right, that's enough waving.

278
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,844
Are you guys close?

279
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,138
No.

280
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,474
I was just waving
to see what it felt like.

281
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,728
Listen up.

282
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,443
Are you aware of the gravity
of what you've done, Han?

283
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,820
I am telling you, someone else uploaded

284
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,280
- the video and photos, all right?
- It doesn't matter,

285
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,948
you were the person
who started this thing.

286
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,283
That's the problem here.

287
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,036
What if they decide to pin it on you?
What then?

288
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,621
You think you can handle
what comes next?

289
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,914
Even if I forgive you.

290
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,835
Do you think the team will be
as forgiving and accepting?

291
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,005
Hearing how reckless you were, huh?

292
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,803
I shouldn't have come here.

293
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,930
Exactly, you could have just
kept your mouth shut.

294
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,348
Why say anything?

295
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,602
Like I told you, I wanted to be
totally honest with you, Ms. Oh.

296
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,442
Going forward, I'm gonna be working
with you on the Cha Seongwook case.

297
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,570
All of a sudden,
you're willing to do something?

298
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,614
President Koo said

299
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,033
I had to, to keep the company card.

300
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,995
And does he happen to know
that you're Dr. Trigger?

301
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,081
No, I'm not totally insane.

302
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,041
I got a bet going with him.

303
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,544
The show will be shut down…

304
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,421
We're racing to find Dr. Trigger first.

305
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,844
Well, I'll assume
you'll sell me out soon then.

306
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,229
Swear to me…

307
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,024
that I'm the only one
who gets to divulge… this information

308
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,195
and that you'll never reveal
who you are unless I say so.

309
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,156
It's the only way I'll forgive you.

310
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,497
I had no idea
someone would upload that stuff.

311
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,833
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,960
I want you to swear.

313
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,591
Fine, I swear.

314
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,677
Satisfied?

315
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,019
So, who'd you see having the affair, huh?
Who was it?

316
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,397
The couple split up, it doesn't matter.

317
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,566
The end.

318
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,447
It's too windy out here.

319
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,599
VIOLINIST CHOI GEON'S
CLASSIC HEALING CONCERT

320
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,565
It's not just a charity event.

321
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,066
More like a PR stunt.

322
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,738
I've seen worse,
but that's capitalism for you.

323
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,368
One, two, three!

324
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,288
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, that was lovely.

325
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,332
- Come on, Mom, let's go.
- Thank you for coming.

326
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,917
- Ah, yes, thank you.
- Thanks for coming.

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,126
One, two, three!

328
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,503
Thank you. Have a safe trip back.

329
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,215
Goodness. Thank you.

330
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,591
Are you Choi Hoseong's father?

331
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,761
KNS, we're Trigger reporters.

332
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,555
- Hold on a minute.
- No, it's fine. It's okay.

333
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,897
Uh, as you can see,
my legs aren't what they used to be.

334
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,649
So let's make this quick, okay?

335
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,858
Ah, right.

336
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,570
I want to ask about your son's claim
of dissociative identity disorder,

337
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,782
more commonly known
as multiple personality disorder.

338
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,492
Do you really believe his claims?

339
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:46,912
That's what the doctor said.

340
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,372
Do I have another option here?

341
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,917
I noticed the doctor
who diagnosed your son, Dr. An Myeongseok,

342
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,255
was appointed the director of a facility
to which you made a generous donation.

343
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,800
Was that also just… pure coincidence?

344
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,471
I was providing

345
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,974
an environment to help my son get better.

346
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,268
Now if you'll…

347
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,144
And the prison where your son is...

348
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,272
Oh, right, hospital, not prison.

349
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,441
Anyway, do you visit often?

350
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,777
Of course.

351
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,447
He's my only kid,
and conceiving him wasn't easy.

352
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,866
There was a recent stalking incident

353
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,869
eerily similar to your son's
stalking patterns from 10 years ago.

354
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:31,331
The same victim, in fact.
Can you imagine reliving those horrors?

355
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,710
She's someone's flesh and blood,
just like your son.

356
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,836
Right?

357
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,423
Seeing you has actually
made me feel grateful to my father

358
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,508
for the first time in my entire life.

359
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,429
There's always a price to pay,
that's the one thing I learned from him.

360
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,140
Pay for your wrongdoings.

361
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,063
We'll end the interview here.

362
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,523
Let's go, sir.

363
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:57,733
Right.

364
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,824
I'm hoping…

365
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,620
that no more innocent lives
are claimed this time around.

366
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,165
As long as I live,

367
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,374
I will not…

368
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,252
allow that to happen ever again.

369
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,671
That's enough.

370
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,348
You think it's him?

371
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,766
Is he helping Hoseong?

372
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,936
I'm not sure,
but he does seem to have some confidence.

373
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,481
He wants to save face as well.

374
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,067
He never raised his voice

375
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,986
even after we goaded him on,
'cause we were in public, I guess.

376
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,446
His type's the scariest of all.

377
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,365
They don't even hide
who they are deep down.

378
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,574
Hmm.

379
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,703
Well, someone's got an abundance
of fatherly love and forgiveness.

380
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,247
I'm envious of that.

381
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,916
Let's go.

382
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,626
Listen.

383
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,588
Atonement comes
from a place of reflection.

384
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,010
You got it.

385
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,721
- Bye. Great job, guys.
- All right, see you.

386
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,265
It's weird that our sweet Mr. Lee
would take two whole days off.

387
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,893
That's unusual. I wonder if he's sick?

388
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,189
You leaving on time today too?

389
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,732
Got plans?

390
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,609
I do actually. See you tomorrow.

391
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,029
- See you.
- Bye.

392
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,841
- Hmm.
- Thanks so much.

393
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,180
How's work?

394
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,391
Everything okay?

395
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,101
Mm.

396
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,400
I decided that Mr. Lee and I
shouldn't see each other for a while.

397
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,279
I'm not sure I should be dating anybody.

398
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,991
Not until I've gained
more confidence in myself.

399
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:20,000
Without contacting me
for 10 years after what happened…

400
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,086
you managed to get by,
you got some fight in you.

401
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,963
That's not a bad thing though.

402
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:29,801
That's how I knew
that you were gonna keep yourself safe.

403
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,428
I was quite relieved.

404
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,514
You did great.

405
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,391
Really great.

406
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,693
I think it's punishment
for abandoning my kid.

407
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,114
Do you…

408
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,453
wish you wouldn't have given away…
your child?

409
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,667
I'm a bad person, aren't I?

410
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,213
It's shameless looking for love
after what I did.

411
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,675
Who can say?

412
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:15,639
That child might have ended up…
as someone's miracle child.

413
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,940
{\an8}TRIGGER: PROJECT PROPOSAL TEAM 5, KANG GIHO

414
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,203
You're with Trigger, right? I have a tip.

415
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,874
We're only taking specific tips
at the moment.

416
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,460
Do you have any proof to back it up?

417
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,631
I did it.

418
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,341
How much are you paying?

419
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,264
Hey.

420
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:06,189
THE SECOND INFORMANT

421
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,609
You're filming me while saying
you won't be taking me to court,

422
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,570
so I'll leave some evidence for insurance.

423
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,697
We're just shooting
to have this on record.

424
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,824
We'll keep your identity hidden,
you have nothing to worry about.

425
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,826
Right. Well, look…

426
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,828
wearing the same clothes
from when I slashed the tire.

427
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,788
You'll find 100% match.

428
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,123
All right.

429
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,500
Is this who set you up
to stalk the woman?

430
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,169
Oh… Same thing the cops showed me.

431
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,339
Never seen him.

432
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,342
Besides, I don't know their face.

433
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,011
So you don't know
what your client look like?

434
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,554
I got paid, son!

435
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,180
I slashed the tire,

436
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,349
and then they handed me a GPS tracker
and a retainer fee.

437
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,518
Five million won.

438
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,479
That lady lost her ring
in the parking lot too, right?

439
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,030
They asked me
to give them that too, so I did.

440
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,742
So you met with them after?

441
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,952
I waited in a bathroom stall
until they texted.

442
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,955
When Wukong gets paid, he keeps his word.

443
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,375
And you said all of this to the cops
when they questioned you, right?

444
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,085
I did, yeah.

445
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,714
He knew the woman's account ID
and her password as well.

446
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,467
I just used that password
to log in to a Find My Phone app,

447
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,178
- and tracked her down to this location.
- You must be proud of yourself.

448
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,387
Whoa, I ain't bragging.

449
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,098
I'm just saying
I took a picture of this building as proof

450
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,308
and sent him the photo.

451
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,852
If you do forensic analysis
on the prick's cell phone,

452
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,481
you'll find the photo that I sent.
That's what I'm saying.

453
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,150
What a pervert, right?

454
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,027
I'd kill to see that civil servant's face.

455
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,111
You said you knew nothing.

456
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,988
But they're a civil servant?

457
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,156
No, no, that's not it.

458
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,242
He just checks his phone
certain times during the day.

459
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,286
He can't be reached
between 8:00 and 5:00.

460
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,749
I just know civil servants are uptight
about that weird-ass rule.

461
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,876
You can wire the money now.

462
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,503
That's really all I've got for you.

463
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,132
NEW DEPOSIT: 350,000 WON

464
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,301
That's public broadcasting for you.

465
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,970
Wow, you guys are stingy. Ooh!

466
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,139
Didn't even wanna round it up.

467
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,392
Man, y'all did me dirty.

468
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,271
What a dildo.

469
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,276
Eight o'clock in the morning
till five in the afternoon…

470
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,988
That's a little long for a piano lesson.

471
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,337
Choi Hoseong

472
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,178
I'm sure you've been…
waiting for my call.

473
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,764
It's quite late.

474
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,100
Why are you calling?

475
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,810
I may be a patient…

476
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,771
but I'm rather popular, you see.

477
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:58,069
One of Ms. Nam's close acquaintances
just so happens to be an old fan of mine.

478
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,406
I was going to keep it secret at first,

479
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,660
but I know you value honesty,
so I decided to tell you myself, Soryong.

480
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,121
Ah, no, wait…

481
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,419
I'm just saying I took a picture

482
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,129
of this building as proof,
and sent him the photo.

483
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,673
He just checks his phone
certain times during the day.

484
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,425
He can't be reached between 8:00 and 5:00.

485
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,387
I just know civil servants are uptight
about that weird-ass rule.

486
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,183
I'm sorry for coming here unannounced.

487
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,772
How'd he know…

488
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,984
that Gayeon was staying here?

489
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,112
Ms. Nam, you there?

490
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,697
Come on, please.

491
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,491
Please.

492
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,410
Come on, can you reconsider?

493
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,703
Gayeon!

494
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,292
Ms. Oh.

495
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,921
I just checked, Ms. Nam is safe.

496
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,590
Police are patrolling the area as well.

497
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,218
And she never revealed to Mr. Lee
that she was staying at the network?

498
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,305
Not just him, but anyone.
She didn't tell a single person.

499
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,766
Didn't want word getting out.

500
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,562
Choi Hoseong
could just be messing with us,

501
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,147
but something's off.

502
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,025
Soryong.

503
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,986
Can't you reconsider… airing this episode?

504
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,906
Seeing Ms. Nam has made me think

505
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,450
there are just some things
that'll never end.

506
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,743
Even if we cover this story.

507
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,165
Is this the Nahee I've always known?

508
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,168
You seem completely different,
not just as a person,

509
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,795
but as a colleague as well.

510
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,672
I know you have a connection

511
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,757
'cause Ms. Nam was
the first victim you covered

512
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,259
after becoming head writer.

513
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,844
But this is wrong.

514
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,930
Or…

515
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,391
is there something I'm not aware of?

516
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,601
Is that it?

517
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,564
If I do tell you,

518
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,108
do you think it'll change your mind?

519
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,114
She's my daughter.

520
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,491
But you're not married.

521
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,577
Or…

522
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,373
How'd you end up with a child this old
without a guy around?

523
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,833
I adopted her.

524
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,668
Three years ago.

525
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,255
I'd been visiting the orphanage
since she was a baby

526
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,590
to take care of her.

527
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,427
Once she was old enough to go to school,
the directors came to me.

528
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,805
They needed my address
for her school registration.

529
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,849
They asked if I'd adopt her.

530
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,936
It was my first case and I…

531
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,397
ended up with a daughter.

532
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,274
Huh?

533
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,987
This child…

534
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,071
Before the wedding,

535
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,825
Choi Hoseong did something terrible
to Ms. Nam.

536
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,204
Her fiancé at the time heard the news
and was very supportive and understanding.

537
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,123
But then the incident happened.

538
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,668
Ms. Nam realized
that she was pregnant with her

539
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,296
and was already too far along
for an abortion.

540
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,548
They told her
that if she wanted an abortion,

541
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,092
they'd have to cut her open
and kill the living child.

542
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,304
She simply didn't have it in her
to go through with it.

543
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,557
And you know,

544
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:18,603
it's why I never get attached
to any victims we help out

545
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,273
in any of our cases since that one.

546
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,276
Actually, I didn't wanna get attached.

547
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,321
It was better for me emotionally
to be a heartless bitch.

548
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,157
Does Ms. Nam know?

549
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,622
Why are you telling me this right now?

550
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,208
Well, I'm worried
that psychopath will get out.

551
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,669
I'm worried that he'll find out
that this child exists

552
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,462
and he might try to do something awful.

553
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,257
We've seen it. It happens way too often.

554
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,468
So many women have come to us,

555
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,054
afraid, and wind up being killed.

556
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,266
And you know something?

557
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,061
I've completely changed.
I'm a coldhearted bitch.

558
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,188
I don't let these cases affect me anymore…

559
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,360
if it means
I can guarantee my daughter's safety.

560
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,195
Okay?

561
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,492
If I ever doubted myself…

562
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,620
you taught me to weigh two options,

563
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,206
whether to save one person alone,

564
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,085
or allow their story to save everybody.

565
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,212
Soryong, please.

566
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,467
That's…

567
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,014
all the more reason to air this thing

568
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,599
to protect your child as well.

569
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,728
He never would've
gotten out of prison if we…

570
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,771
if we lived in a world with common sense.

571
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,315
If we just let this case go,

572
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,361
then we can expect to see
a second and third coming of Choi Hoseong.

573
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,823
If we can end
this horrific cycle of murder…

574
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,993
then we gotta do it.

575
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,287
We have to do it.

576
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,042
That's you.

577
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,127
I wouldn't have expected any less.

578
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,687
Damn it.

579
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,409
Oh. Hello.

580
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,494
Hello.

581
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,370
Have a seat.

582
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,333
I'm sorry for contacting you
so early this morning.

583
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,293
It's okay.

584
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,378
Uh…

585
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,839
to be honest, I was kind of hoping…

586
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:56,219
uh, that you'd be… able to help with, uh…

587
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,347
with me and Gayeon getting back together.

588
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,391
I don't like
beating around the bush, okay?

589
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,645
So let me come right out and say it.

590
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,189
Sure. Please, whatever you need.

591
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,983
You remember
coming to our office with flowers?

592
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,778
It was the day
after Gayeon's stalker incident.

593
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,530
Yeah.

594
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,284
She revealed to us…
that she never informed you

595
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,203
where exactly she might be staying.

596
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,664
How'd you know she was there?

597
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,791
Uh…

598
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,501
Uh, well…

599
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,504
Uh…

600
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,592
The, uh… the truth is…

601
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,390
Oh, sorry, give me a minute.

602
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,394
Hey, let me call you back
in a little while.

603
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,770
You're gonna wanna hear this.

604
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,606
It's about receiving the retainer fee.
I just remembered something.

605
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,691
What is it?

606
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,569
I remembered something
coming back to the stall.

607
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,821
That day, when they took the ring back,

608
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,116
I was curious, so I took a little peek.

609
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,256
Hi, Ms. Hong.

610
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,302
Aren't you gonna go in?
For the Choi Hoseong case meeting?

611
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,804
Nope. Got to finish up tomorrow's episode.

612
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,056
Okay.

613
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,351
We'll interview his old classmates…

614
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,854
Guess the out-of-town training
worked for them.

615
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,356
Uh, Ms. Oh,
are you and Ms. Hong fighting?

616
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,192
She says she's not coming.

617
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
I think her work's just an excuse.

618
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,446
The writers and I stayed up,
doing some digging,

619
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,366
and it appears that Choi Hoseong's lawyer
was a classmate of the prosecutor

620
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,827
who approved
the suspension of his sentence.

621
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,913
In fact, they passed the bar together,

622
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,247
completed their education

623
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,708
at the Judicial Research
and Training Institute.

624
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,084
Wow, so they must be close then.

625
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,462
This type of preferential treatment
is common,

626
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,005
according to our in-house council.

627
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,840
Lots of former officials do it.

628
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,925
So…

629
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,636
why are they doing
secret arrangements if Hoseong…

630
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,472
really does have this disorder?

631
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,391
It's gonna take forever
for the Medical Association to write back.

632
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,976
How do we speed that up?

633
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,020
You're now on a call
with a University of California doctor

634
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,355
who wasn't cheap.

635
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,690
Can you hear me? Hello, Doctor.

636
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,525
It's Oh Soryong from Trigger.

637
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,069
Right. So…

638
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,947
I'm looking over
the medical record you emailed.

639
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,991
So what do you think?
Is he faking everything?

640
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,953
You should know
that diagnosing an individual with DID

641
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,621
is a very controversial issue.

642
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,166
Normally, expert psychoanalysts
or clinical psychologists

643
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,836
would monitor the patient as a team
for an extended period of time.

644
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,422
Since everything about the patient
undergoes a total shift,

645
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,510
their conduct, voice, intonation, as well
as their drawing and writing styles,

646
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,762
it's crucial
that we check for consistencies

647
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,931
between the patients' personalities.

648
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,725
Uh, however, concerning this patient,

649
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,144
he was diagnosed by one doctor

650
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,729
after just a short time.

651
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,441
That was the one accepted
for grounds of suspension of sentence.

652
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,236
And honestly,
I find that rather irregular.

653
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,989
What do you suggest we do
if Choi Hoseong

654
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,449
continues to pretend…
to have this disorder?

655
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,159
My honest opinion…

656
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,245
If he does that…

657
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,789
…there's no real way to be sure.

658
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,209
First of all, the court approving
to suspend his sentence

659
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,587
on such flimsy evidence
is complete madness.

660
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,800
If you have no way to prove his crime
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

661
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,969
it will take a lot
to send him back to prison.

662
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,733
Oh… uh, I should go.

663
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,901
Ms. Hong's asking for me. Excuse me.

664
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,029
Good luck.

665
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,073
We'll be adding a Choi Hoseong tipline
at the end of tomorrow's episode

666
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,908
and air Choi's episode next week.

667
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,286
Giho, keep bugging
the Medical Association for an update.

668
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,412
And Do,

669
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,539
go find the prosecutor doing this.

670
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,083
Let it slip we're reporting the case,
no matter what.

671
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,461
We're gonna scare these guys
into making a move.

672
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,130
Okay.

673
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,423
{\an8}FRAUD REALTOR

674
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,717
All right, I'm leaving as well,
since I'm busy too.

675
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,570
That's what I like about you, Ms. Oh.

676
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,531
You're up there on a cliff, all alone…

677
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,408
and you keep at it,

678
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,286
you don't waver from your conviction,
all cool-like.

679
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,163
As if it doesn't bother you at all.

680
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,499
That's what I like.

681
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,757
{\an8}OSEONG NATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

682
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,020
Have you sniffed out my admirer yet?

683
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:01,273
Actually,

684
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,984
I'm only here to deliver some good news.

685
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,738
Let's hear it. Tell me what you got.

686
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,950
Get this…

687
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,415
You should know…

688
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,501
Nam Gayeon married her coworker.

689
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,878
The wedding was today.

690
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,424
He's a good guy, Mr. Lee Muo.

691
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,263
That's odd.

692
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,224
Didn't you say
you barely even remember her face?

693
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,770
It seems that… has upset you.

694
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,234
That prick is the guy,

695
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:47,570
he's my secret admirer.

696
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,907
Lee Muo.

697
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,492
Ah…

698
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,204
Are you suggesting to me…

699
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,042
that you schemed for Mr. Lee
to pretend to fall in love with her,

700
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,337
and he ended up falling for her for real?

701
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,343
Damn her, that Gayeon.

702
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,891
That dumb bitch is a horrible judge
of the men who pursue her.

703
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:21,353
The girl is nothing
but a fucking whore! Goddammit!

704
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,023
Sluts like her can only blame themselves

705
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,859
for stupidly falling
for assholes like that! It's true!

706
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,653
The bitch deserves to be beaten
for the rest of her fucking life!

707
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,491
Lee Muo seemed like a nice man though.

708
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,368
You sure this isn't…

709
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,205
just all in your head?

710
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,833
You've made some outlandish claims,
you know what I mean?

711
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,838
Look what I got, huh?

712
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,673
Damn it, you got to look!

713
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,468
It's just in my head, huh?

714
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,976
That right there…
is an offering from that fucker.

715
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,771
So hurry up
and go tell that bitch, all right?

716
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,273
Tell her she needs to break it off
with that dangerous shithead!

717
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,699
Miss…

718
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,037
…can I have that ring?

719
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,915
If I don't get it back,

720
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,416
your friend will yell at me.

721
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,338
Do you…

722
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,592
know what this is?

723
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,262
That ring belongs to my friend.

724
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,724
Please give it back. Please…

725
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,142
You're wrong.

726
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,565
No, this ring right here
belongs to a teacher.

727
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,526
I promised I'd get it back to her.

728
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,403
No…

729
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:55,781
Can you please give it back to me?
Oh, please?

730
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,074
Then…

731
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,287
you want to give it to her?

732
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,498
Give it to Ms. Nam.

733
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,586
I'm sure she'd love that.

734
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,421
Mm-hmm.

735
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,464
I'll give it to her.

736
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,634
I'll make sure she gets it.

737
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,269
Yeah, right.

738
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,733
That was some pitiful acting.

739
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,652
You should've honed your craft more.

740
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,280
If this is someone else,

741
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,991
how would you have Hoseong's memories?

742
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,163
I don't know what you're saying.

743
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,082
What happened, ma'am?

744
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,835
Whenever one personality comes out,

745
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:53,380
the other ones lose their memory,

746
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,134
and remain unaware of anything happening.

747
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,386
Oh, I guess
there's one thing you can look out for.

748
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,888
Which is?

749
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,264
DID is always…

750
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,060
accompanied by symptoms of amnesia.

751
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,812
Isn't that the card you played
to get placed here?

752
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,732
So you could receive treatment in custody?

753
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,984
So what now?

754
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,779
You seem to…

755
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,281
know Ms. Nam,

756
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,241
little boy.

757
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,713
I'm impressed.

758
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,549
Considering I fooled the doctors,
it's that obvious?

759
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,801
Cut.

760
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,178
Enough of the charade.

761
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,556
Skip to the part where I say…

762
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,600
I look forward
to seeing you back in prison.

763
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,894
You're already in custody…

764
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,690
Now I just take care of the accomplice
you got out there.

765
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:57,736
Damn it!

766
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,697
Give it back! Damn it!

767
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,916
It's already in the cloud by now.

768
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,836
So breaking that's pointless.

769
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,130
- You!
- Go ahead though.

770
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,423
A little present.

771
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,342
I'm gonna…

772
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,137
I'm gonna follow that bitch
till the day I die!

773
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,014
She'll never be rid of me,
not even in fucking death!

774
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,099
No.

775
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,311
You're mistaken.

776
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,982
Nam Gayeon was rid of you
the moment you walked in here.

777
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,652
Shitty stalkers
and wannabe killers like you…

778
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,113
belong in prison.

779
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,533
Your perverted admirer is all you deserve.

780
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,412
Maybe you two…

781
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,289
can be reunited.

782
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,957
Maybe a conjugal can be arranged?

783
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,208
Let go!

784
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,178
You just had to go and make enemies.

785
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,596
I'm gonna kill you!

786
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,938
You're gonna wanna hear this.
It's about receiving the retainer fee.

787
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,857
That day, when they took the ring back,

788
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,151
I was curious, so I took a little peek.

789
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,444
But get this.

790
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:24,072
Their shoes were like
a men's size six, at most.

791
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,160
They had… super tiny feet.

792
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,791
The truth is…

793
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,465
I got advice from Ms. Kim on this…

794
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,761
since I barely…
have any dating experience.

795
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,263
Hi, everyone, my name's Nam Gayeon.

796
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,681
I'll be teaching Korean, 3rd grade.

797
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,975
- Looking forward to working here.
- Welcome!

798
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,437
You know Ms. Nam,
the new teacher?

799
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,439
- Yeah.
- You remember that wedding shooting?

800
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,816
Apparently, she was the bride.

801
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,275
Wow! No way.

802
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,902
What if he wasn't stalking her,

803
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,779
but there was something going on
between them?

804
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,449
NAM EUNGYEONG

805
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,077
CHOI HOSEONG MASS SHOOTING

806
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,790
STUDENT MURDERS TEACHER'S HUSBAND-TO-BE
STALKING ENDS WITH 30-YEAR SENTENCE

807
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,841
That day, I also received a call

808
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,969
telling me that something horrible
had happened to Ms. Nam.

809
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,971
And that I should hurry over
to the network,

810
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,514
since that's where she was.

811
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,807
That's why I went over.

812
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:33,767
- Hi, Ms. Kim.
- Oh, hi.

813
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,060
VISITOR NAME: KIM BOMIN
PATIENT NAME: CHOI HOSEONG

814
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,396
VISIT REQUEST COMPLETE

815
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,714
What's going on?

816
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,597
How'd you know
I went to the network that day?

817
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,433
What are you talking about? What is this?

818
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,560
Want me to show you what you texted me…

819
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,562
Ms. Kim?

820
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,397
How could you do that to a coworker?

821
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,399
One you considered a friend?

822
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,484
You're a monster.

823
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,612
That's not true.

824
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,282
I swear it's not true.

825
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,036
I…

826
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,664
Come on, we all talked behind her back.

827
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,710
You all talked about going online…
to see what she did 10 years ago.

828
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,421
You all agreed how cold-hearted she was,

829
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,924
and couldn't believe
she was going back into teaching.

830
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,134
I shouldn't be getting singled out
like this!

831
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,386
It's bad enough gossiping…

832
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,639
it's despicable.

833
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,641
But what you did…

834
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,602
you put my life in danger!

835
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,857
I pity you.

836
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,070
How you were so deprived of love…

837
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:10,948
that you worshiped a murderer.

838
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,326
The rest of your disgusting fangirl act,

839
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,203
do that from prison…

840
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,790
once the school fires you.

841
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:26,672
I'm looking for a Ms. Kim Bomi?

842
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:59,705
Choi Hoseong will be… going back to prison

843
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:04,251
as soon as… tomorrow morning,
the police said.

844
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,671
A thought occurred to me
back in the office…

845
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,091
Whether or not the man's in prison,

846
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,802
I don't think I'll ever find…

847
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,305
a place
where I can remain hidden for good.

848
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,644
Sometimes I do miss…

849
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,856
days before the internet.

850
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,067
Strange, considering what I do.

851
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,738
Ms. Hong said you're airing an episode
about what happened.

852
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,614
Uh…

853
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:39,077
Please treat it carefully,
with the honor it deserves,

854
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,039
so we don't have any more…

855
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,541
victims like me.

856
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,835
I'll do that.

857
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:02,684
Can you believe how many psychos
just look like normal people?

858
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,562
Apparently, they exchanged tons of letters
while he was in prison.

859
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:09,024
When he went to the hospital,
she acted like his cousin to gain access.

860
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,484
- Bitch is nuts.
- I bet she'll write

861
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,735
a book about it one day.

862
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,904
"Our Love Story,"
something like that.

863
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,947
Ew, gross, that creeps me out.

864
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,617
The producers,
they get compensated regularly

865
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:22,329
and once they're burned out,
they get rotated to different shows.

866
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,623
So, what about us writers, huh?

867
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,917
We work our asses off
and make hardly anything.

868
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,044
It just drains our health.

869
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,128
I know, right?

870
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,880
I haven't had a nice meal in so long

871
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:33,715
because of all these
Choi Hoseong calls we get.

872
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,426
How much longer… till we're promoted?

873
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,929
This life is over. Over.

874
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,519
Ms. Hong will have to go somewhere else,
if we're gonna get head writer,

875
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,146
- which will never happen.
- She and Ms. Oh aren't getting along.

876
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,233
If things get worse… who knows, right?

877
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:01,159
The informant…

878
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,583
Ugh, that guy.
Can we ever take a break?

879
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,918
Jeez.

880
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,338
Watch and learn.

881
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:16,716
He'll never ask me for a story ever again.
Watch me.

882
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,010
Hey, Mr. Han.

883
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,095
Yes?

884
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,180
I set up a meeting for you.

885
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,308
- What meeting?
- The shaman from earlier.

886
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,601
You were interested, right?

887
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,562
- Sort of, I guess.
- Right.

888
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,230
- Didn't say I'd do it.
- Mm…

889
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,732
Well, you should have been
a little more clear then.

890
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,695
We only have two more hours to go.
This shaman is tenacious.

891
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:37,863
If you cancel the meeting,

892
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,824
she might come over to the office
to perform a sword dance.

893
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,827
Why don't you just…
go and meet her for now?

894
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,706
That's how it's done.

895
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,835
You should use it on the amoeba.
Ugh, he is such an eyesore.

896
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,632
- Let's go together.
- Where to?

897
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,342
- The meeting.
- Huh?

898
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,137
Let's… go together.

899
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,473
- Let's all go.
- Huh?

900
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,310
Wait, what?

901
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,228
Together?

902
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:26,077
THE THIRD INFORMANT

903
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,003
You're gonna be a producer.

904
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,047
I'm a writer though.

905
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,134
Producing is for you,
writing just causes you headaches.

906
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,055
- That's why I've been struggling.
- Oh…

907
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,765
Hmm… eldest son.

908
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:47,891
No, second out of two.

909
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,561
But you play the role of the eldest son.

910
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,688
Whatever.

911
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,399
You were contacting us nonstop
because of your guardian spirit,

912
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,817
so just tell us already.

913
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,156
There's a Tasalgunung Gut ritual.

914
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,742
It's to appease
the spirits of the wrongfully killed

915
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,578
as to prevent misfortunes
among the living.

916
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,665
I performed it recently…

917
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:15,961
I witnessed a presence
which seemed to be burning in fire.

918
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,715
What exactly do you want us to know?

919
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,759
Us shamans also have a community.

920
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,470
They all visited me in the hospital
saying the same thing,

921
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:28,932
that they too had performed this ritual
for that family.

922
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,017
For 10 years, they sought out

923
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,645
the best shamans in the nation
to perform the exact same gut

924
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,063
for their child's well-being.

925
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,441
And something bad happened
to every shaman,

926
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,151
just like me.

927
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,570
Don't you find that strange?

928
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,657
Well, who's the client?

929
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,741
No one knows.

930
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,000
All we've heard is he's the head
of an incredibly wealthy family,

931
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:58,336
but no one knows which company he owns,
or who he is.

932
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,464
- And you want us to find that out?
- That's right.

933
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,426
I'm worried that we could be involved
in something criminal.

934
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,178
He could be mafia.

935
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,930
And your guardian spirit doesn't know?

936
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,432
Oh, I didn't ask.

937
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,352
I kept seeing visions

938
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,646
of this show with the logo…

939
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,898
You know,
the one with the gun scope on it.

940
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,446
The guardian spirit's trying to warn us
is what I'd guess.

941
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,282
If anyone is holding a grudge against you,
you must take care.

942
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,743
Watch out for fires in particular.

943
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:33,663
Just make sure you don't…
get yourself burned, okay?

944
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,334
Lots of people have a grudge against us.

945
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,961
CHO HAEWON

946
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,049
- I better get going now.
- Us too.

947
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,760
You should make an offering

948
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,636
to the guardian spirit
before you go, at least.

949
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,013
What offering?

950
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:52,807
1,000 won should do it
to change your fortunes for the better.

951
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,897
You.

952
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,524
Me?

953
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,777
Looks like
your lover's had a change of heart.

954
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,696
- Huh?
- There's a breakup coming soon.

955
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,406
Uh… uh…

956
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,742
- Let's go.
- Uh, right. Goodbye.

957
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,793
{\an8}HAN DO, PRODUCER AT TRIGGER

958
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:26,383
OSEONG NATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

959
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:50,990
Stop it!

960
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,082
Oh, my God, Dad?

961
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:02,210
Uh… how'd you get in here?

962
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,462
Oh.

963
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,631
I was able to get in as...

964
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,758
It's your last day here.

965
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,302
The director…

966
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,763
you paid him off again, right?

967
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:16,975
Just don't be friends with him, Dad.

968
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,895
Dad, please.

969
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,398
Dad, please help me.

970
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,069
I don't wanna go back
to prison tomorrow, Dad.

971
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,905
I don't want to, please.

972
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,991
Please… Pretty please.

973
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,702
- Help me, Dad. Please help me, Dad.
- Hoseong.

974
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,580
You remember our deal?

975
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,373
You would stay out of jail,

976
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,333
as long as you were committed here,

977
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,294
and you promised
to keep yourself out of trouble.

978
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:47,172
This is all 'cause of that damn bitch.

979
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,674
It's her fault.

980
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,011
Ah…

981
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,345
I got a plan.

982
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,892
Just bring that stupid bitch over here.

983
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,102
Let's do that. Right?

984
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,896
That'll solve everything.

985
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,732
And Dad,
if you can't bring her to me alive,

986
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,152
then just chop off the bitch's head
and bring me that instead, huh?

987
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,737
I'll make sure to scoop out her eyeballs

988
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:13,615
so she'll never lay her eyes
on any other fucker! Huh?

989
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:21,289
That is the least fucking thing
you can do for me! Huh?

990
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,333
Get that bitch in here!

991
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,876
At least keep the cops away!

992
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,170
Damn it! Do something, you piece of shit!

993
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,845
All right, Hoseong. I'll do that for you.

994
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,056
It's okay, Hoseong. I'll bring her.

995
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,892
I'm gonna take care of it.

996
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:45,688
Dad, are you really gonna do
all that for me?

997
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,525
Of course I will. I'm gonna do it.

998
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,320
I'm gonna do everything you want.

999
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,334
At first,

1000
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,003
I couldn't admit the fact
that you were broken.

1001
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,174
So I did everything I could
to try to fix you.

1002
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,053
Just the way you would a broken violin.

1003
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,806
I tried tightening the nut,

1004
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,894
I tried replacing the bridge
that had come loose,

1005
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,355
but…

1006
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,567
no more.

1007
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,444
If we keep this up,

1008
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:37,448
too many people will suffer because of us.

1009
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,582
Hoseong,

1010
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:48,084
one nap is all it'll take

1011
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:51,296
to fix you for good.

1012
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,881
No more noises out of tune.

1013
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:59,137
Instead, you'll sound beautiful again
like a new instrument.

1014
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,706
Baek Songi, we need to talk.

1015
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,250
Yes.

1016
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,419
The wall graffiti.

1017
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,670
Got any leads?

1018
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,174
Uh, no, I've got nothing.

1019
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,844
That's surprising.

1020
01:00:39,927 --> 01:00:41,596
If anyone could find them…

1021
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,515
I thought you'd be able to.

1022
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,895
I actually found them.

1023
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,615
We obtained this
from a friendly cabbie's dash cam.

1024
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,335
I gave you an opportunity
to come clean with the truth,

1025
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,920
and you squandered it.

1026
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,464
So tell me…

1027
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,966
why'd you do it?

1028
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,473
I only did it…

1029
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,727
…just because
I was worried about you, Ms. Oh.

1030
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,356
I've also heard
the urban legend about Cha Seongwook.

1031
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:37,318
That everyone who investigates him
is killed or disappears.

1032
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,155
To make things worse,
Cho Haewon actually showed up,

1033
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,741
and President Koo's dead set
on getting rid of you.

1034
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,786
Even if the rest of the media's
with Hanju,

1035
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,955
I wanted what I wrote to cause some buzz

1036
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,959
so that someone else would end up
taking on the Cha Seongwook case.

1037
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,087
It's just that I'm so scared
something might happen.

1038
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,299
I don't want you getting hurt.

1039
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,427
I'm so sorry.

1040
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,891
You still don't know me at all.

1041
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,477
I'll see this case through till the end.

1042
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,813
If someone else ends up
taking on this case,

1043
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,233
I wouldn't give up,
I'd use the opportunity to work together.

1044
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,111
I feel like
you're an older sister to me, Ms. Oh.

1045
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,988
Or even a mother.

1046
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,241
You're my family.

1047
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,909
If something happened to you

1048
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,745
while you were covering
the Cha Seongwook case,

1049
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,830
- then I could not...
- Baek Songi.

1050
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,624
Have you learned nothing
from working here?

1051
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,588
Have I not gotten through to you
this entire time?

1052
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,767
You're relieved of your role here,
effective immediately.

1053
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,235
That shaman we talked to earlier,
it's obvious she's lying.

1054
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,237
None of her guesses were correct, right?

1055
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:08,034
Who… Who knows?
Maybe they'll come true soon.

1056
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,786
I see you've got some faith.

1057
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,460
What's with the pee-bomber?

1058
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:21,255
- What?
- I think he has a crush on me.

1059
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,757
Huh?

1060
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,091
I can't even…

1061
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,309
TAEHWADANG SHAMAN:
BEWARE OF WOMEN THIS MONTH

1062
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,269
THEY COULD CAUSE YOU GREAT TROUBLE

1063
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,105
ESPECIALLY ONES WITH AN O IN THEIR NAMES

1064
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:44,821
Oh Soryong?

1065
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,214
CHO HAEWON

1066
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:35,746
THE FINAL INFORMANT

1067
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,237
Ugh, he is such an eyesore.

1068
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,823
Kang Giho was born to be an assistant.

1069
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,992
For sure!
He's like a crazy chicken.

1070
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,703
Running around with his head cut off
when working on his own story.

1071
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,164
But as soon as Ms. Oh needs him
for backup, he's in the zone.

1072
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,083
Giho simply doesn't have
what it takes to be a main producer.

1073
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,460
I totally agree.

1074
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,712
He should just… stay an assistant.

1075
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,594
Let's go together.

1076
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,763
- Where to?
- The meeting.
