I wouldn't very well have this report,
would I, Soryong?

211

You know Choi Hoseong, don't you?

255
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,073
You saw Choi Hoseong
while he was serving a life sentence,

256
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,659
and diagnosed him
with dissociative identity disorder.

257
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,329
-I don't know him.
-He got a suspended sentence

258
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,705
because of your diagnosis,

259
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,457
so I doubt you're unaware.

260
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,584
And then you were named
director of this facility

261
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,336
right after Choi was released.

262
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,298

to donate six billion to the facility.

00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,814
You sure there was nothing wrong
with Choi Hoseong's medical report?

270
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,690
Are you sure
his release had nothing to do with…

271
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,150

-…you becoming a director here?

You're supposed to save lives,
not… run them over!

275
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,080
They think we do this out of duty
or sense of justice or whatever,

276
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,414
but look at that.

277
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,791
His response was insane.

278
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,209
You don't do that if you're innocent.

279
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,002
It's all the more reason to keep going.

280
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,170
Let's say we nail the prick.

281
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,421
What if he claims ignorance,

282
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,298
saying he didn't know
what his alter egos were doing?

283
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,383
What else can we do?

284
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,844
We expose him now
saying he's faking his illness

285
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,262
and send him back to prison.

Do we really have to put these banners up
on our website too?

288
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,643
You got a better idea?

289
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,895
To put Choi back in jail
without airing an episode?

290
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,605
[Soryong] I'm all ears.

291
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,318
You sent his report
to the Medical Association?

292
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,779
If they say the diagnosis was forged,

293
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,698
I'll take it
to the prosecutor immediately.

294
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,492
If Choi Hoseong was the one
behind the recent incident,

295
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,995
then there must have been
a middleman between him

296
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,705
and whoever it is they caught just now.

297
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,081
What's your feeling?

298
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,875
Hoseong's mother moved abroad
after the incident.

299
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:36,959
She's been gone for a while.

300
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,336
So, I'd say his dad's a likely confidant.

301
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,838
Murder or not, he's still the man's son.

302

Nice, I'm planning on meeting him first.

if you had a plan already?

is proportional to the cash spent."

323

Again, "Time invested reporting
is proportional to the cash spent."

324
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,686

Do I have another option here?

I noticed the doctor
who diagnosed your son, Dr. An Myeongseok,

was appointed the director of a facility

Of course.

He's my only kid,

You'll find 100% match.

520
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,123
All right.

521
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,500
Is this who set you up
to stalk the woman?

522
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,169
Oh… Same thing the cops showed me.

523
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,339
[sighs] Never seen him.

524
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,342
Besides, I don't know their face.

525
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,011
So you don't know
what your client look like?

526
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,554
I got paid, son!

527
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,180
I slashed the tire,

528
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,349
and then they handed me a GPS tracker
and a retainer fee.

529
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,518
-[whirring]
-Five million won. [gasps]

530
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,479
That lady lost her ring
in the parking lot too, right?

531
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,814
[grunts]

532
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,025
-[panicked panting]
-[car tires screeching]

533
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,234
[car horn honking]

534
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,030
[informant] They asked me
to give them that too, so I did.

535
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:58,742
So you met with them after?

536
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,952
I waited in a bathroom stall
until they texted.

537
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,955
When Wukong gets paid, he keeps his word.

538
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,375
And you said all of this to the cops
when they questioned you, right?

539
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,085
I did, yeah.

540
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,714
He knew the woman's account ID
and her password as well.

541
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,467
I just used that password
to log in to a Find My Phone app,

542
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,178
-and tracked her down to this location.
-You must be proud of yourself.

543
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,387
Whoa, I ain't bragging.

544
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,098
I'm just saying
I took a picture of this building as proof

545
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,308
and sent him the photo.

546
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,852
If you do forensic analysis
on the prick's cell phone,

547
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,481
you'll find the photo that I sent.
That's what I'm saying.

548
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,150
[sighs] What a pervert, right?

549
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,027
[Wukong]
I'd kill to see that civil servant's face.

550
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,111
You said you knew nothing.

551
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,988
But they're a civil servant?

552
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,156
No, no, that's not it.

553
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,242
He just checks his phone
certain times during the day.

554
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,286
He can't be reached
between 8:00 and 5:00.

555
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,749
I just know civil servants are uptight
about that weird-ass rule.

556
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:49,876
You can wire the money now.

557
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,503
That's really all I've got for you.

558
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,132
New Deposit: 350,000 won

559
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,301
That's public broadcasting for you.

560
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,970
Wow, you guys are stingy. Ooh!

561
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,139
[Wukong] Didn't even wanna round it up.

562
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,392
-Man, y'all did me dirty.
-[door opens]

563

[door closes]

564
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,271
What a dildo. [sighs]

565
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,276
Eight o'clock in the morning
till five in the afternoon…

566
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,988
That's a little long for a piano lesson.

567
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,621
[phone vibrating]

568
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,919
[vibrating continues]

569
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,337
Choi Hoseong (Hospital)

570
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,758
[deep breath]

571
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,178
[Hoseong over phone] I'm sure you've been…
waiting for my call.

572
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,764
It's quite late.

573
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,100
Why are you calling?

574
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,810
I may be a patient…

575
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,771
but I'm rather popular, you see.

576
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:58,069
One of Ms. Nam's close acquaintances
just so happens to be an old fan of mine.

577
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,406
I was going to keep it secret at first,

578
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:05,660
but I know you value honesty,
so I decided to tell you myself, Soryong.

579
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,121
-[Hoseong's handset clacks]
-Ah, no, wait…

580
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,541
[♪ mysterious music playing]

581
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,419
[Wukong] I'm just saying I took a picture

582
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,129
of this building as proof,
and sent him the photo.

583
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,673
He just checks his phone
certain times during the day.

584
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,425
He can't be reached between 8:00 and 5:00.

585
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,387
I just know civil servants are uptight
about that weird-ass rule.

586
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,183
I'm sorry for coming here unannounced.

587
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,772
How'd he know…

588
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,984
that Gayeon was staying here?

589
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,112
-[doorbell chimes]
-Ms. Nam, you there?

590
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,697
Come on, please.

591
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,491
-[banging on door]
-Please.

00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,410
-[bangs on door]
-Come on, can you reconsider?

593
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,703
Gayeon!

00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,582
[sighs]

595
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,292
[Ms. Hong] Ms. Oh.

596
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,921
I just checked, Ms. Nam is safe.

597
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,590
Police are patrolling the area as well.

598
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,218
And she never revealed to Mr. Lee
that she was staying at the network?

599
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,305
Not just him, but anyone.
She didn't tell a single person.

600
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,766
-Didn't want word getting out.
-[sighs]

601
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,562
Choi Hoseong
could just be messing with us,

602
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,147
but something's off.

603
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,025
Soryong.

604
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,986
Can't you reconsider… airing this episode?

605
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,906
Seeing Ms. Nam has made me think

606
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,450
there are just some things
that'll never end.

607
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,743
Even if we cover this story.

608
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,165
Is this the Nahee I've always known?

609
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,168
You seem completely different,
not just as a person,

610
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,795
but as a colleague as well.

611
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,672
I know you have a connection

612
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,757
'cause Ms. Nam was
the first victim you covered

613
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,259
after becoming head writer.

614
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:45,844
But this is wrong.

615
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,930
Or…

616
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,391
is there something I'm not aware of?

617
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,601
-[sighs]
-Is that it?

618
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,564
If I do tell you,

619
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,108
do you think it'll change your mind?

620
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,114
She's my daughter.

621
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,491
But you're not married.

622
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,577
Or…

623
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:15,373
How'd you end up with a child this old
without a guy around?

624
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,833
I adopted her.

625
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,668
Three years ago.

626
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,255
I'd been visiting the orphanage
since she was a baby

627
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,590
to take care of her.

628
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,427
Once she was old enough to go to school,
the directors came to me.

629
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,805
They needed my address
for her school registration.

630
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,849
They asked if I'd adopt her.

631
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,936
It was my first case and I…

632
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,397
ended up with a daughter.

633
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,274
Huh?

634
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,987
[Soryong] This child…

635
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,071
[Ms. Hong] Before the wedding,

636
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,825
Choi Hoseong did something terrible
to Ms. Nam.

637
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,204
Her fiancé at the time heard the news
and was very supportive and understanding.

638
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,123
But then the incident happened.

639
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,668
Ms. Nam realized
that she was pregnant with her

640
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,296
and was already too far along
for an abortion.

641
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,548
They told her
that if she wanted an abortion,

642
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,092
they'd have to cut her open
and kill the living child.

643
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,304
She simply didn't have it in her
to go through with it.

644
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,557
And you know,

645
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:18,603
it's why I never get attached
to any victims we help out

646
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,273
in any of our cases since that one.

647
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,276
Actually, I didn't wanna get attached.

648
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,321
It was better for me emotionally
to be a heartless bitch.

649
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,157
Does Ms. Nam know?

650
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,622
Why are you telling me this right now?

651
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,208
Well, I'm worried
that psychopath will get out.

652
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,669
I'm worried that he'll find out
that this child exists

653
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,462
and he might try to do something awful.

654
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,257
We've seen it. It happens way too often.

655
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,468
So many women have come to us,

656
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:53,054
afraid, and wind up being killed.

657
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,266
-[Ms. Hong] And you know something?
-[sighs]

658
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,061
I've completely changed.
I'm a coldhearted bitch.

659
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,188
I don't let these cases affect me anymore…

660
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,360
if it means
I can guarantee my daughter's safety.

661
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,195
Okay?

662
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,492
If I ever doubted myself…

663
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,620
you taught me to weigh two options,

664
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,206
whether to save one person alone,

665
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,085
or allow their story to save everybody.

666
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,212
Soryong, please.

667
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,467
[sighs] That's…

668
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,014
all the more reason to air this thing

669
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,599
to protect your child as well.

670
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,728
[sighs] He never would've
gotten out of prison if we…

671
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,771
if we lived in a world with common sense.

672
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,315
If we just let this case go,

673
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,361
then we can expect to see
a second and third coming of Choi Hoseong.

674
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,823
If we can end
this horrific cycle of murder…

675
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,993
then we gotta do it.

676
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,287
We have to do it.

00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,127
I wouldn't have expected any less.

00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,347
with me and Gayeon getting back together.

692
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,391
I don't like
beating around the bush, okay?

693
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,645
So let me come right out and say it.

694
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,189
Sure. Please, whatever you need.

695
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,983
You remember
coming to our office with flowers?

696
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,778
It was the day
after Gayeon's stalker incident.

697
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,530
Yeah.

698
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,284
She revealed to us…
that she never informed you

699
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,203
where exactly she might be staying.

700
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,664
How'd you know she was there?

701
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,791
-[♪ soft tense music playing]
-Uh…

702
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,501
Uh, well…

703
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,504
Uh… [sighs]

704
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,592
The, uh… the truth is…

705
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,636
[phone vibrating]

706
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,390
Oh, sorry, give me a minute.

707
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,394
Hey, let me call you back
in a little while.

708
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,770
[Wukong over phone]
You're gonna wanna hear this.

709
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,606
It's about receiving the retainer fee.
I just remembered something.

710
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,691
What is it?

711
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,569
I remembered something
coming back to the stall.

712
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,821
That day, when they took the ring back,

713
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,116
I was curious, so I took a little peek.

714
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,256
Hi, Ms. Hong.

715
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,302
Aren't you gonna go in?
For the Choi Hoseong case meeting?

716
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,804
Nope. Got to finish up tomorrow's episode.

717
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,056
Okay.

718
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,351
We'll interview his old classmates…

719
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,854
Guess the out-of-town training
worked for them.

720
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,356
[Giho] Uh, Ms. Oh,
are you and Ms. Hong fighting?

721
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,192
She says she's not coming.

722
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,902
I think her work's just an excuse.

723
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,446
The writers and I stayed up,
doing some digging,

724
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,366
and it appears that Choi Hoseong's lawyer
was a classmate of the prosecutor

725
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,827
who approved
the suspension of his sentence.

726
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,913
In fact, they passed the bar together,

727
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,247
completed their education

728
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,708
at the Judicial Research
and Training Institute.

729
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,084
Wow, so they must be close then.

730
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:54,462
This type of preferential treatment
is common,

731
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:56,005
according to our in-house council.

732
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,840
Lots of former officials do it.

733
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,925
So…

734
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,636
why are they doing
secret arrangements if Hoseong…

735
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,472
-really does have this disorder?
-[Giho sighs]

736
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,391
It's gonna take forever
for the Medical Association to write back.

737
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,976
How do we speed that up?

738
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,020
You're now on a call
with a University of California doctor

739
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,355
who wasn't cheap.

740
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,690
Can you hear me? Hello, Doctor.

741
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,525
It's Oh Soryong from Trigger.

742
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,069
[doctor] Right. So…

743
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,947
I'm looking over
the medical record you emailed.

744
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,991
So what do you think?
Is he faking everything?

745
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,953
You should know
that diagnosing an individual with DID

746
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,621
is a very controversial issue.

747
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,166
Normally, expert psychoanalysts
or clinical psychologists

748
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,836
would monitor the patient as a team
for an extended period of time.

749
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,422
Since everything about the patient
undergoes a total shift,

750
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,510
their conduct, voice, intonation, as well
as their drawing and writing styles,

751
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,762
it's crucial
that we check for consistencies

752
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,931
between the patients' personalities.

753
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,725
Uh, however, concerning this patient,

754
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,144
he was diagnosed by one doctor

755
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,729
after just a short time.

756
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:57,441
That was the one accepted
for grounds of suspension of sentence.

757
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,236
And honestly,
I find that rather irregular.

758
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,989
What do you suggest we do
if Choi Hoseong

759
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,449
continues to pretend…
to have this disorder?

760
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,159
[doctor] My honest opinion…

761
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,245
If he does that… [sighs]

762
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,789
…there's no real way to be sure.

763
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,209
First of all, the court approving
to suspend his sentence

764
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:18,587
on such flimsy evidence
is complete madness.

765
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,800
If you have no way to prove his crime
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

766
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,969
it will take a lot
to send him back to prison.

767
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,264
[Soryong sighs]

768
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,599
[sighs]

769
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,061
[sighs]

770
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,733
[Jiyun] Oh… uh, I should go.

771
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,901
Ms. Hong's asking for me. Excuse me.

772
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,029
[clears throat] Good luck.

773
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,073
We'll be adding a Choi Hoseong tipline
at the end of tomorrow's episode

774
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,908
and air Choi's episode next week.

775
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,286
Giho, keep bugging
the Medical Association for an update.

776
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,412
And Do,

777
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,539
go find the prosecutor doing this.

778
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,083
Let it slip we're reporting the case,
no matter what.

779
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,461
We're gonna scare these guys
into making a move.

780
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,130
-Okay.

782
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,717
All right, I'm leaving as well,
since I'm busy too.

786
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,570
That's what I like about you, Ms. Oh.

787
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,531
You're up there on a cliff, all alone…

788
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:29,408
and you keep at it,

789
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,286
you don't waver from your conviction,
all cool-like.

790
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,163
As if it doesn't bother you at all.

791

That's what I like.

I'm only here to deliver some good news.

Let's hear it. Tell me what you got.

Get this…

[♪ uneasy music playing]

799
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,415
You should know…

800
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,501
Nam Gayeon married her coworker.

801
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,878
The wedding was today.

802
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,424
He's a good guy, Mr. Lee Muo.

803
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,263
That's odd.

804
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:35,224
Didn't you say
you barely even remember her face?

805
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,770
It seems that… has upset you.

he's my secret admirer.

Lee Muo.

809
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,492
Ah…

810
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,204
Are you suggesting to me…

811
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,042
that you schemed for Mr. Lee
to pretend to fall in love with her,

812
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,337
and he ended up falling for her for real?

813

Damn her, that Gayeon.

814
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:16,891
That dumb bitch is a horrible judge
of the men who pursue her.

The girl is nothing
but a fucking whore! Goddammit!

816
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,023
Sluts like her can only blame themselves

817
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:26,859
for stupidly falling
for assholes like that! It's true!

818
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,653

for the rest of her fucking life!

No, this ring right here
belongs to a teacher.

866
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,386
[doctor] Oh, I guess
there's one thing you can look out for.

867
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,888
Which is?

868
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,264
[doctor] DID is always…

869

accompanied by symptoms of amnesia.

870
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,812
Isn't that the card you played
to get placed here?

871
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,732
So you could receive treatment in custody?

872
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,984
So what now?

873
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,779
You seem to…

874
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,281
know Ms. Nam,

I'm impressed.

Considering I fooled the doctors,
it's that obvious?

Nam Gayeon was rid of you
the moment you walked in here.

I was curious, so I took a little peek.

[Wukong] But get this.

Their shoes were like
a men's size six, at most.

They had… super tiny feet.

925
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,465
I got advice from Ms. Kim on this…

926
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,761
since I barely…
have any dating experience.

-[teacher 2] Yeah.
-You remember that wedding shooting?

Apparently, she was the bride.

What if he wasn't stalking her,

936
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,779

she was going back into teaching.

that they too had performed this ritual
for that family.

1076
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,017
For 10 years, they sought out

1077

to perform the exact same gut

To make things worse,
Cho Haewon actually showed up,

1211
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,741
and President Koo's dead set
on getting rid of you.

1212
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,786
Even if the rest of the media's
with Hanju,

1213
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,955
I wanted what I wrote to cause some buzz

1214
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:52,959
so that someone else would end up
taking on the Cha Seongwook case.

1215
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:56,087
It's just that I'm so scared
something might happen. [sobs]

1216
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,256
[♪ pensive music playing]

1217
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:00,299
I don't want you getting hurt.

1218
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,427
[shaky breathing] I'm so sorry.

1219
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,891
You still don't know me at all. [sighs]

1220
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,477
I'll see this case through till the end.

1221
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,813
If someone else ends up
taking on this case,

1222
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,233
I wouldn't give up,
I'd use the opportunity to work together.

1223
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,111
I feel like
you're an older sister to me, Ms. Oh.

1224
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:21,988
Or even a mother.

1225
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,241
You're my family. [sobs, sniffles]

1226
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,909
If something happened to you

1227
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,745
while you were covering
the Cha Seongwook case,

1228
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,830
-then I could not--
-Baek Songi.

1229
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,624
Have you learned nothing
from working here?

1230
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,588
Have I not gotten through to you
this entire time?

1231
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:40,923
[sniffles]

1232
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:46,554
[deep breath]

1233
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,767
You're relieved of your role here,
effective immediately.

1234
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,938
[shaky breathing]

1235
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:58,399
-[door opens, closes]
-[sniffles]

1236
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:01,235
[Han Do] That shaman we talked to earlier,
it's obvious she's lying.

1237
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,237
None of her guesses were correct, right?

1238
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:08,034
Who… Who knows?
Maybe they'll come true soon.

1239
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,786
I see you've got some faith.

1240
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,413
[Jiyun clears throat]

1241
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,875
[scoffs, snickers]

1242
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,460
What's with the pee-bomber?

1243
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:21,255
-What?
-I think he has a crush on me.

1244
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,757
-Huh?
-[sighs]

1245
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,091
I can't even…

1246

[♪ upbeat music playing]

1247
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,347
[phone vibrates]

1248
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,309
Taehwadang Shaman:
Beware of women this month

1249
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,269
They could cause you great trouble

1250
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:38,105
Especially ones with an O in their names

1251
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:44,821
Oh Soryong?

1252
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,323
[scoffs]

1253
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,458
[♪ upbeat music continues playing
through earphones]

1254

[phone vibrating]

1255
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,214
Cho Haewon

1256
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:06,968
[sighs]

[♪ uneasy music playing]

1258
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:35,746
The Final Informant

1259

[♪ suspenseful music playing]

[♪ closing theme music playing]

1261
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,237
[Jiyun] Ugh, he is such an eyesore.

1262
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,823
[sighs]
Kang Giho was born to be an assistant.

1263
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,992
[Moka] For sure!
He's like a crazy chicken.

1264
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,703
Running around with his head cut off
when working on his own story.

1265
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:18,164
But as soon as Ms. Oh needs him
for backup, he's in the zone.

1266
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,083
[Jiyun] Giho simply doesn't have
what it takes to be a main producer.

1267
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,460
[Moka] I totally agree.

1268
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:24,712
He should just… stay an assistant.

1269
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,594
-[knocking on door]
-[Han Do] Let's go together.

1270
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:33,763
-[Jiyun] Where to?
-[Han Do] The meeting.

1271
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,142
[sniffles, exhales heavily]

1272
