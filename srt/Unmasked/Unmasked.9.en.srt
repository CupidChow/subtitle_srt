1
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,729
Let's go for a cig.

2
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:35,326
Sculpted in 2005

3
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:29,631
EP09: Cho Haewon

4
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,140
Trigger: Looking for Cha Seongwook
We await your call

5
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,725
- I really hope you find him.
- Oh my, yes…

6
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,060
- Stay strong, sir.
- Thank you!

7
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,312
-Here you go, sir. Just a gift from us.
-Oh, goodness, no…

8
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,272
- Please.
- Here, sir.

9
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,399
-I hope you find your son.
-Thank you so much, ladies.

10
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,236
- Oh, I almost forgot. Right, here you go.
- Oh, okay. Of course.

11
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,571
- You got here early, sir.
- Oh, hey, you're here!

12
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,408
Look what someone gave me,
supporting the search for Seongwook.

13
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,994
- We've started receiving tips as well.
- Ah…

14
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,163
So, media coverage does help, I guess.

15
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,749
Sir, Mr. Han's gonna be filming today.

16
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,668
I've got some things to attend to.

17
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,212
He's gonna be here with you
while you pass out flyers,

18
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,048
so if you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.

19
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,633
Right.

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,224
Your father must be so… very proud of you.

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,894
What a blessing
having a son as reliable as you are.

22
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,689
Actually, my father passed away.

23
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,482
Uh, oh…

24
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,234
I'm so sorry, I don't know why I…

25
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,318
That's quite all right, sir.

26
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,488
He wasn't exactly
the world's most loving father.

27
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,535
Oh… Yeah, I see. I got it.

28
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,079
-Yeah, um… goodness, uh…
-All right.

29
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,958
I'll bet…

30
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,793
you have a camera hidden somewhere, huh?

31
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,962
Trigger, huh?

32
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,465
You smart-aleck … Hmm?

33
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,301
How dare you quote the law
to a prosecutor?

34
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,385
And cut.

35
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,015
The exact wording was "sons of bitches".

36
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,309
-Good Lord, this is just…
-We can't use profanity.

37
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,561
That's why I told you
to insert something close to it.

38
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,146
Something similar.

39
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,149
How else would our viewers know
how much of a son of a bitch that guy is?

40
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,401
It's key to the story that we're telling,
you know?

41
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,361
Let's just go with the previous version.

42
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,487
Let's try that again.

43
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,119
Here you are,
busy working on the final edits.

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,662
Uh, hello, sir.

45
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,664
You got a minute, Mr. Kang?

46
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:45,350
Uh, sir… I'm sure you're aware,
we're airing this today, so…

47
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,144
That's precisely
why you should be relaxing a little.

48
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,687
So you can see the bigger picture

49
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,147
-at play here.
-Right.

50
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:55,526
So, I noticed you added
an interview with Lee Jeonggeun.

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,736
Uh, yes, sir.

52
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,197
We followed him
to an unofficial event and…

53
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,158
I'm sorry
that I have to inform you so late, but…

54
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,410
the prosecutor seems uncomfortable
with the episode.

55
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,248
How about you leave in everything
except the interview with Lee?

56
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,959
Uh, it's our biggest gotcha moment,
if we leave it out--

57
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,127
This is a direct order from the president.

58
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,545
Uh, sir, if I may,

59
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,131
if the prosecutor hadn't suspended
Choi Hoseong's sentence,

60
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,258
this wouldn't have happened.

61
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,511
Well, I don't know all the details here.
I'm just relaying the message.

62
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,888
As I said,
this comes directly from the president.

63
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,932
Sir, I'm sorry
I have to pretend I didn't hear that.

64
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,934
You're a contract worker, don't forget.

65
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,645
You won't have a job tomorrow

66
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,730
if you air the episode
the way it is right now.

67
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,359
-Uh, sir, wait, are you threatening to--
-But…

68
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,947
assuming everything goes well
with this episode…

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,368
I believe this'll be the first time
KNS has ever done this.

70
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,703
"Regular Hire Evaluation Report
Current Affairs Department, Kang Giho"

71
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,955
You're gonna…

72
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,457
gonna make me full-time?

73
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,294
It just needs the president's stamp
and then you're in.

74
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,298
We're not asking you to reshoot
the entire episode from scratch.

75
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,218
Just… leave out the interview,
so that one person can't be singled out.

76
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,762
Learn to be a little flexible.

77
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,277
Shit…

78
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,290
I never would have
pegged you for a man of faith.

79
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,500
I couldn't be in politics
without His grace,

80
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,170
considering all the sinning I've done.

81
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,506
You said I'm the only one
who should be mayor.

82
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,759
They announce primary candidates tomorrow,

83
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,261
but you're here praying,
I've heard nothing from you.

84
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,971
How am I supposed to know
what's on your mind?

85
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,515
Should we ask for a divine revelation…

86
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,601
Assemblyman Cho Jinman?

87
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,899
What were you thinking
enmeshing yourself with so many women?

88
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,944
Do you know how many complaints we got
about you after that Primaries article?

89
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,116
So keep it up and deal with the fallout…

90
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,329
or play it safe
and make it out with your current job.

91
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,039
It's your choice, President Koo.

92
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,375
The Hanju Group…

93
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,877
are they spotless?

94
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,969
Why do you think I pray here every day?

95
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,726
Humility, President Koo!

96
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,813
Since you owe us your success.

97
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,274
You watch your ego.

98
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,245
Just be more careful moving forward.

99
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,665
We'll bide our time
for the next four years.

100
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,877
Hmm?

101
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,469
Humility.

102
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,697
He's got a foreign car?
In the National Assembly?

103
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,782
Doesn't he know
how great Korean cars are?

104
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,162
Damn it!

105
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,875
Goddamnit!

106
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,922
See what they can take?

107
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,023
Uh, we do have cafes in this country,
you know?

108
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,275
This place is charming too.

109
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,153
Hwang Jinwoo.

110
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,238
How'd you get hired at Hanju?

111
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,573
Oh, you know…

112
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,575
I used my journalistic experience to--

113
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,993
Did Koo get you in?

114
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:19,624
Has it never occurred to you
that President Koo may be Dr. Trigger?

115
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,334
The guy that you're taking the fall for.

116
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,794
What? No way.

117
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,088
Why would he do… something like that?

118
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,799
He could have a good reason
to get rid of me…

119
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,761
or Trigger at all costs.

120
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,472
You think that happened?

121
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,059
I'll find out if it did.
I will get the truth somehow.

122
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,562
Sweetheart,

123
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,982
losers like me have to go out
with intelligent women like you.

124
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,568
I can do more
than just record things for you if…

125
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,737
if it means I can make up for my--

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,031
Don't call me "sweetheart,"
we're not dating.

127
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,492
All right, Soryong.

128
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,494
I won't call you "sweetheart" anymore.

129
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,162
I don't even want to.

130
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,040
-I can't. Oh, wait…
-So what's this important tip for me?

131
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,167
I-It's not important right now.

132
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,505
Have you, uh,
heard the latest rumor about Hanju?

133
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,633
There's always rumors going around,
what's new?

134
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,389
So… apparently, our chairman, Cho Taesu,

135
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,307
is dead.

136
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,354
Wait, your chairman…

137
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,731
he's dead?

138
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,692
They say he collapsed
after a heart attack a while back,

139
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,278
and they're keeping it under wraps
due to money issues,

140
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,613
inheritance, company stock, all that.

141
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,491
I also heard that some drunk
smashed things up a few days ago

142
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,909
and stole something.

143
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,746
And most people think
that it was actually Cho Haewon,

144
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,956
which makes sense.

145
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,040
I mean, think about it.

146
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,917
Why else would you cover for someone

147
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,211
breaking in and stealing a sculpture…

148
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,214
unless the person who did it was family?

149
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,549
A sculpture?

150
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,802
You know the one,
it's the one in the lobby of our building.

151
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:55,970
I guess they took it.

152
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,183
Hey, Soryong, I really want
that Cha Seongwook episode

153
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,603
you're working on to turn out well.

154
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,732
That's why I'm drawing on the affection
I still have for you to tell you all this.

155
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,617
What in the world are you planning here…

156
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,788
Cho Haewon?

157
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,378
Here, have one.

158
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,672
For the way back.

159
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,968
-Ooh…
-You must be exhausted.

160
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,386
Go home and get some rest.

161
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,639
Right. Goodness.

162
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,476
Sir, do you… do you remember
the dog your son used to have?

163
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,810
Seongwook's dog?

164
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,437
Its name was Bom, I think.

165
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,689
Oh, Bom, yes!

166
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,940
I remember.

167
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,526
I didn't ever see it in person.

168
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,321
He sent a photo of the dog
to my phone once though.

169
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:57,406
Would you still happen to have that phone?

170
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,450
It's the darndest thing.

171
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,453
I could've sworn
that I put it somewhere safe,

172
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,288
and now I can't find it.

173
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,667
I went over every inch of my house
looking for it with Ms. Oh…

174
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,795
-I never could find it though.
-Well, could you try looking for it again?

175
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,881
There could be something useful on it,

176
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,966
and since you were using it back then,

177
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,968
it could have that photo.

178
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,887
Mm-hmm, right.

179
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,306
I'm gonna look for it again
now that you've mentioned it.

180
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,352
It might be… somewhere so obvious,
you haven't looked.

181
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,605
So if you could, look some more
where you haven't looked yet.

182
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,898
See if it turns up.

183
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,650
Okay.

184
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,697
Hanju Daily January man sculpture

185
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,913
This beautiful, yet grotesque piece
is currently on display at Hanju Daily.

186
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,710
Where are those notes?

187
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,509
What Bom told me was quite shocking.

188
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,302
I still remember everything.

189
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,806
"It looked like a ball."

190
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:08,018
"It looked like a ball."

191
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,896
The dog claimed
its owner looked like a ball.

192
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,773
What if Bom saw the man's head

193
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,442
after he was decapitated?

194
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:28,038
To Bom, his head…

195
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,207
must have looked like a ball.

196
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,786
Why are you looking at that?

197
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,469
Whoa, no way.

198
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,972
What kind of psycho makes
something like that with a skull?

199
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,808
It's not just a crazy theory.

200
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,310
There's one artist I suspect.

201
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,355
"Love Lee". Who's that?

202
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,482
She's a sculptor based in the States.

203
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,735
She even hosted
a solo exhibition, one time.

204
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,697
Cho Haewon, her other name.

205
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,825
Love Lee's her American name.

206
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,910
She took her husband's last name.

207
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,080
You've been staying busy with this.

208
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,290
Thanks to a source of mine.

209
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,711
Let's gather whatever photos we can
and send them to Mr. Hwang.

210
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,506
He'll do a 3D scan of the face
so we can get a composite sketch.

211
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,550
And once we've got all of that,

212
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,926
I'll go meet with Cho Haewon.

213
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,761
Get as many photos as you can,

214
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,305
send them to Hwang,
tell him it's extremely urgent.

215
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,015
Yeah.

216
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,234
Shit…

217
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,320
-What's up with him?
-Giho, did you ever… finish the edits?

218
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:24,989
Just about, yeah.

219
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,492
Tell me now if you need me for anything.

220
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,078
The episode will air as planned,
don't worry.

221
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,751
What are you doing? Go!

222
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,753
Oh, right.

223
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,966
Mm… I'm saying this to be safe, okay?

224
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,176
Do not go over there by yourself.

225
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,012
I'm going with you to visit that woman.

226
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,482
Is he for real?
He wants us to cut out the interview?

227
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,319
Without confirming with Ms. Oh?

228
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,112
What are we gonna do?

229
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,990
Should we reach out to Ms. Hong for help?

230
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,950
No. No.

231
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,579
I feel like
we should probably tell Ms. Oh about this.

232
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,372
You said he doesn't know
if he'll take it out though.

233
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,166
Oh, my God, are you even listening?

234
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,461
He told me he'd fix the script himself
whenever I refused to do it!

235
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,421
It's Giho's decision.

236
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,925
He gets the final word on editing
as the main producer.

237
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,092
Don't tell me…

238
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,969
you're picking the Amoeba's side?

239
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,972
He's about to ruin
Trigger's reputation right now!

240
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,266
Listen, he's not just some dude here.

241
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,852
He's the Amoeba, as you like to say.

242
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,438
He's Ms. Oh's fanboy.
He'll stand up to them for her.

243
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,944
He'll probably pretend
to take it out, then put it back in later.

244
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,865
So to keep the episode,
he's appeasing Mr. Son…

245
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,992
it's all just an act though?

246
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,330
Kang Giho…

247
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,249
he'd never do something so crazy.

248
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,168
You really must have gone crazy.

249
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,837
Jiyun's been getting on my nerves.

250
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,923
That's your perspective.

251
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,093
That main interview better not get cut.

252
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,637
If you cave in to the Managing Director…

253
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:14,974
you and I will be over.

254
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,522
Have you lost your mind?

255
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,066
Why are you being quiet?

256
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,071
Do you even see me as…
an assistant producer?

257
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,322
What?

258
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,991
Do you see just a…

259
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,118
a loser field producer?

260
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,746
The Managing Director…

261
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,666
said I'd be full-time.

262
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,128
You're the one who said
you wanted to marry someone

263
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,171
with a more stable job.

264
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,883
You said two contractors…
couldn't get married, it wouldn't work.

265
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,469
But I'm an assistant producer now.

266
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,055
I really do want us to get married.

267
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,558
Huh?

268
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,643
I wanted to show you how capable I was.

269
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,368
I could have sworn

270
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,246
I had it somewhere easy to get to.

271
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,875
Let's see now… Hmm…

272
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,044
Goodness me.

273
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,504
Where did I put it?

274
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,632
Somewhere obvious like that…

275
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,053
Come on, where is it?

276
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,556
Ah, there!

277
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,475
It was here!

278
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,936
No, wait. Let me, uh…

279
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,740
Why am I…

280
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,971
Uh, Ms. Oh?

281
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,306
Huh? What?

282
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,892
Well, there's actually, uh…

283
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,229
something I need to tell you
about the interview from the…

284
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,569
So, about that… new writer position.

285
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,654
Oh.

286
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,491
Okay, we'll post an opening
and interview the candidates together.

287
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,118
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

288
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,746
Kang Giho.

289
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,501
Let's watch it together,
since it's your premiere.

290
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,585
Okay.

291
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:56,969
Hello?

292
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,762
What?

293
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,056
We've confirmed he's got no injuries.

294
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,725
All this over a phone though.

295
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,269
I'm glad there wasn't a serious accident.

296
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,856
- We understand.
- Officer, thank you.

297
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,738
I hope this thing…
turns out to be useful somehow to you.

298
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,157
We'll return it to you

299
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,992
when the forensics company
is done with it.

300
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,160
Ah…

301
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,247
Hopefully, you can at least
find the photo… of the dog.

302
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,499
Sorry I brought that up.

303
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,084
It was unnecessary.

304
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,460
Oh, no, sir!

305
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,421
If not for you,
I never would've found it.

306
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,964
As it turns out,

307
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,550
I really had put it
somewhere easy to find.

308
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,553
Never would have looked there
if you hadn't mentioned it though.

309
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,515
Silent mode.

310
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,517
"Alarm"

311
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,686
It's on now.

312
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,062
Well, look at you.

313
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,857
-Excuse me, where's your remote?
-Right there.

314
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,777
Oh, is this, uh… an important episode?

315
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,031
You remember the field producer,
Kang Giho, who followed you around

316
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,490
-going, "Sir, sir"?
-Ah!

317
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,409
This is his debut episode

318
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,536
after being promoted
to assistant producer.

319
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,206
Is that right?
I should watch this too then.

320
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,290
Yeah.

321
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,421
"Watching it right now!"

322
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,547
It's starting.

323
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,438
Mom: Congratulations, Giho.
After all those years! I'm tearing up!

324
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,857
Dad: I'm proud of you, son!
Kang Giho the producer!

325
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,026
Han Do: Run if you're in the office.
Ms. Oh's on the way.

326
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,702
Kang Giho!

327
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,287
Where is Kang Giho?

328
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,748
I'm right here.

329
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,667
You…

330
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,754
Who was it?

331
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,547
Who made you do it?

332
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,508
Son told me from the president.

333
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,968
-Okay, so?
-So I left it out.

334
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,386
What the hell did you just say?

335
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,264
Did you or did you not say it yourself?

336
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,683
You said that… nothing will change

337
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,893
unless we go after the prosecutor
and his friends.

338
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,271
You begged to see this story through!

339
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,731
And then you mangled it
because of the higher-ups?

340
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,692
And you only tell me now after it's aired?

341
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,444
The episode was fine
until the final edits.

342
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,697
How dare you butcher it like this?

343
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,532
You wanted this position so badly,

344
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,659
-this was your debut!
-They're making me full-time…

345
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,744
effective tomorrow.

346
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,205
You couldn't do that for me
no matter how hard you tried.

347
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,291
Just that one thing…

348
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,543
I…

349
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,045
…and I get made full-time.

350
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:43,093
I did nothing wrong with this episode,
all right?

351
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,553
All I did…

352
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,096
is clean it up a little.

353
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:50,142
On my authority as the assistant producer.
That's it. Right?

354
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,104
So that's all you've learned from me?

355
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,566
From being by my side?

356
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,736
Assistant producers…

357
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,072
are responsible for it all.

358
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,782
That's why they have the final say.

359
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,577
They're given authority
so they can hang in till the end.

360
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,330
It doesn't matter what kind of rewards
they're being offered!

361
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,291
Or what kind of pressures
they may be facing…

362
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,169
from the old boys club.

363
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,049
Let me ask you this.

364
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,301
Kang Giho…

365
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,348
do you regret nothing…

366
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:32,934
about your debut episode?

367
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,653
That's right.

368
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,948
I've got no regrets.

369
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,359
Honestly…

370
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,405
I get where Giho's coming from.

371
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,949
I understand…

372
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,784
all too well.

373
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,997
As a team leader though…

374
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,252
I will never forgive him.

375
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,465
That bastard.

376
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,354
You're acting like a human being.

377
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,983
That's just the way things are.

378
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,402
It's not that beautiful world you want.

379
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,990
Every day, someone gets betrayed
by someone they trusted.

380
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,701
That's just the world we live in.

381
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,165
Lunatic Han…

382
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,250
do you trust me?

383
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,755
You're not being serious right now,
are you?

384
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,847
You're the type who looks around
and says, "What a wonderful world."

385
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,558
And a person's fundamental makeup
can't be changed.

386
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,979
You saw what Mr. Kang did.

387
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,149
Why can't I do it too?

388
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,528
It's Kang Giho we're talking about,
not just some guy.

389
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,531
Things must've been really bad
for him to cave.

390
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,035
That moron.

391
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,247
Weak, cowardly leaders…

392
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,502
Ugh, Kang Giho, you idiot.

393
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,255
Well, I promise you we're not the ones
hurting the most right now.

394
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,091
It's Giho.

395
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,639
You're totally killing my buzz,
I'm leaving.

396
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,558
Are you… kidding me?

397
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,019
Ms. Oh.

398
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,773
Ms. Oh. Come on.
I told you I'd walk you home.

399
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,150
You think I do this
'cause I want the limelight?

400
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,444
Trigger's a team, got it?

401
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,571
You know what these bad guys want
more than anything?

402
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,365
For us to fight with each other.

403
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,535
They want us to betray each other
so we destroy ourselves.

404
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,829
We may be far from perfect
as individuals, but…

405
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,707
as a team, we at least have a chance!

406
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,877
That's why we worked our asses off
to get where we are!

407
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,255
So Giho's hurting pretty bad, huh?

408
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,465
I'm so sorry to hear that.

409
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,385
You're gonna get hit,
get out of the road!

410
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,433
-Wait…
-You follow me and you're dead.

411
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,895
Ms. Oh.

412
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,730
Miss…

413
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,651
Ah…

414
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,867
You couldn't do that for me
no matter how hard you tried.

415
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,160
Just that one thing…

416
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,205
I…

417
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,250
…and I get made full-time.

418
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,936
Hello there.

419
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,444
What made you show up in front of my house
like this out of nowhere, Ms. Cho?

420
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,447
Did you come to threaten me?
Is that why you're here right now?

421
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,032
It's a nice night.

422
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,367
I thought I'd come clean.

423
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,502
Damn it…

424
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,469
Come sit.

425
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,183
Isn't this fun?

426
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,646
Always so serious.

427
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,650
Oh Soryong, you're…
a most fascinating person.

428
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,737
So tell me
what you want to come clean about.

429
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,866
Ms. Oh Soryong…

430
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,665
are you different from Koo Hyeongtae?

431
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,753
I gave him a secret.

432
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,715
He heard my confession 20 years ago.

433
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,553
That I… had killed Cha Seongwook.

434
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,228
20 years ago

435
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,648
Are you the one…
who killed Cha Seongwook?

436
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,360
Yes.

437
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,364
Why did you do it?

438
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,246
Wait, you confessed… to murdering
Cha Seongwook to President Koo?

439
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,748
Why are you so…

440
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,543
obsessed with Cha Seongwook anyway?

441
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,253
Were you a fan?

442
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,468
You ever choked on a fish bone?

443
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,679
I don't know.

444
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:46,558
The truth is like…
a fish bone stuck in your throat.

445
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,103
Just swallowing your spit
is enough to make the bone jab you

446
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,396
and cause pain.

447
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,441
It doesn't matter if you ignore it,

448
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,776
it'll force you to spit it out…

449
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,779
once your conscience gets
the better of you.

450
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,574
That's the essence of truth.

451
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,786
For that to apply,
you'd have to have a conscience though.

452
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,205
It's my job to, uh…

453
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,792
to get to the real heart of the truth.

454
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,925
Why'd you kill Cha Seongwook?

455
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,304
Why?

456
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,225
Why…

457
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,604
Why does everyone ask me the reason?

458
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,689
The reason lies ultimately with him.

459
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,984
What the hell are you doing?

460
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,068
- Haewon.
- Give it!

461
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,820
I told you, it's not like that!

462
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,992
Ms. Oh Soryong…

463
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,704
how did you take it
when you got stabbed in the back

464
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,289
by someone you trusted?

465
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,960
You must've been as hurt as I was,
wanting to lash out.

466
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,423
Like I said…

467
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,842
you and I are quite alike.

468
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,165
You've got me all wrong.

469
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,543
You and I…

470
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,295
we're nothing alike.

471
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm not trying to use my emotional scars
as an excuse to murder.

472
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,638
And I… I've got neither time nor energy…

473
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,849
to hang around someone I barely know…

474
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,185
asking for attention
just 'cause I'm lonely.

475
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,322
January Man.

476
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,367
You want to know that story?

477
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,869
Did you do that too?

478
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,873
The sculpture they had
in the Hanju Group lobby.

479
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,791
Bingo.

480
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,670
Ms. Love Lee.

481
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,633
Where did you hide it?

482
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,012
That sculpture?

483
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,182
I have stored this sculpture safely away…

484
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,519
in our final destination.

485
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,939
I assure you of that, Ms. Oh Soryong.

486
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,151
So…

487
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,945
good luck finding it.

488
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,204
Hopefully, we'll meet again, Soryong.

489
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,159
Ms. Oh, is it true
what they said about Kang Giho?

490
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,619
Why? What happened to Giho?

491
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,622
I heard he's gonna be… salaried
starting today.

492
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,040
What?

493
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,251
And I was thinking he'd be reprimanded
for leaving out the prosecutor interview.

494
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,128
Luckily,
the chief's on vacation.

495
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,339
There's no way
he goes full-time that easy.

496
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,591
We had to take
some pretty hard tests to get this job.

497
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,635
I mean,
Giho does cover for everyone's shooting

498
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,804
and editing mistakes
more than anyone else.

499
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,555
You act like full-timers have royal blood.

500
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,474
I asked if you knew
about this or not, Ms. Oh.

501
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,228
Yes, I was aware of it.

502
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,271
I was too busy to mention it.

503
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,442
Wow. That really hurts.

504
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:13,199
You're earlier than I thought you'd be.

505
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,121
Yeah, well… my eyes just popped open.

506
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,961
The forensic report
for that old phone came in.

507
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,045
So soon?

508
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,588
Did we get an update
on the January Man thing?

509
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,383
-It's only Monday though…
-Yeah, it's a Monday for everyone.

510
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,260
And yesterday was the weekend, so what?

511
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,513
Are you sure you informed Mr. Hwang
how urgent this matter is?

512
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,392
Whatever.

513
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,477
Get your stuff, come on.

514
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,954
I can't believe he sold out
just to be a regular hire.

515
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,289
He ruined his first work as a lead
and mine!

516
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,084
We kept it from Ms. Oh too.

517
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,587
Also, you're the main writer now.

518
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,630
Don't talk behind his back,
face him head-on.

519
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,257
Like Ms. Hong would do.

520
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,301
Seriously.

521
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,115
"Incoming Call from Jiyun"

522
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,408
"Decline"

523
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,914
Jesus, why's this story so bland?

524
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,124
I honestly expected more
from a former Trigger writer.

525
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,627
It's a fictional series with a narrative.

526
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,170
It needs drama and gore.

527
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,507
We got to spice things up
with a little murder and chaos

528
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,758
to keep the younger audience.

529
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,927
It's hard to faze kids today
without going extreme.

530
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,012
Have you seen drama recently?

531
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,307
Have you ever seen the dead body
of a person who was torn to shreds?

532
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,519
-Have you seen that?
-What?

533
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,021
Well, no.

534
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,482
You don't get it
because you're used to special effects,

535
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,150
fake blood, all those things.

536
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,278
The victims who have seen
that living hell firsthand though…

537
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,197
have been traumatized for life.

538
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,157
You want me to exploit that for profit?

539
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,328
Instead of offering a little break
from the horrors of the world?

540
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,794
I guess it's time I gave you the talk.

541
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,337
Listen up.

542
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,381
Go ahead and step off
your Trigger high horse

543
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,966
and write what you're good at.

544
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,051
You'll never make it here
with that attitude.

545
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,928
I mean,
you're basically a rookie here, right?

546
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,848
Stay humble 'cause you're just a rookie.

547
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,809
Just do what the veterans tell you to.

548
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:47,186
Huh? I want you to rewrite it.

549
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,771
You got a week.

550
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:53,192
Man, I can't believe
I have to coach her so much.

551
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,239
Ms. Hong…

552
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,742
De… Despite everything,

553
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,163
Jang really does have an eye for…
what the modern audience wants.

554
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,586
"Dealer Healer"

555
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,337
"Written by: Hong Nahee"

556
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,882
The dog photo was indeed on the phone.

557
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,216
Oh.

558
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,596
I'm sending it to Haru-san

559
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,681
-to check if it's Bom.
-Okay.

560
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,184
Was there anything else
that turned up besides this?

561
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:29,270
So we did some digging…
and a detective's name came up.

562
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,105
- A detective?
- Yup.

563
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,567
Mr. Cha liked to archive his, uh…
important text messages.

564
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,028
That's where I found
references to the man. Here.

565
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,154
Oh.

566
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,948
"Han Donghyeok"?

567
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:42,825
The name Han Donghyeok

568
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,119
wasn't on the list of detectives
who worked on the Cha Seongwook case.

569
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,454
Detective Han:
I'll let you know if I find him tomorrow.

570
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,663
Please give me some time.

571
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,582
-What the heck…
-Huh?

572
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,543
If this is from '06…

573
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,630
Do you have any texts
from before or after that year?

574
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,923
This is all we recovered.

575
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,512
I need to go somewhere.

576
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,973
- I'll get in touch later.
- Wait, Lunatic Han!

577
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,398
Han Jeong Colorectal Clinic
Colon and Rectal Surgery

578
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,739
You need some money?

579
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,865
Screw you.

580
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,784
Like you'd lend me money.

581
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,162
What do you want?

582
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,916
Tell me what you remember from when…
Dad died in that car accident.

583
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,084
Crazy bastard.

584
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,210
"Han Jeong, Director"

585
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,629
It was 2006,
it's not like it was yesterday.

586
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,674
Yeah, well, I don't remember a thing,
that's why I'm here.

587
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,761
I told you, your memory's not the issue.
Your mind has a coping mechanism.

588
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,180
You didn't want to remember what happened,

589
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:50,268
so your brain opted to selectively…
delete all those memories,

590
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,727
like nothing happened.

591
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,604
I'm not here for a psych checkup,

592
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,065
not from the city's best butt doctor.

593
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,984
I'm asking about our dad.

594
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,196
The guy who cared about
his smart older son more than anything.

595
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,572
What's to remember?

596
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,286
A vehicle slammed into him changing lanes
and he died. That's it.

597
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,122
You really remember nothing else?

598
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,124
You were 19 years old, man, my God.

599
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,001
And Mensa really let you in?

600
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:18,379
You wanna hear all about Mom collapsing
after crying so much?

601
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,881
'Cause her husband died
in a freak accident?

602
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,758
Leaving her and her sons alone
in the world?

603
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,177
Forget it.

604
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,556
We had one hell of a father, as you know.

605
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,642
A man of integrity.

606
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,146
That's what kept him going…
as a detective, you know?

607
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,026
Only one unit came to his funeral.

608
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,612
There were just four who came down.

609
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,955
Hey, kiddo.
You must be going through a lot.

610
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,624
Did you happen to find anything?

611
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,668
Something in your dad's vehicle?

612
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,796
My mom said they scrapped the car.

613
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,089
I'm pretty sure there was nothing.

614
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:05,968
The man should have known better

615
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,346
than to work
against the interests of his own.

616
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:09,680
It's payback for the prick.

617
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,015
He thought he was better than us

618
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,725
'cause he went to the police university.

619
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,477
He should've stayed in narcotics

620
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,479
instead of sticking his nose
where it didn't belong.

621
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,230
Quiet, the kid's gonna hear you.

622
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,732
Let's just eat something.

623
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,946
You weren't the only one traumatized.

624
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,200
That funeral will haunt me forever.

625
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,952
I vowed never to work a job
that barely made money

626
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,246
and would make my death go unnoticed.

627
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,916
I wanted money and respect.

628
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,085
It's the main reason I became a doctor.

629
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:41,128
What would you know?

630
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,595
Damn it, why can't I remember that day?

631
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,597
You really don't remember
what you were doing?

632
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,807
No.

633
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,225
You were in the ER.

634
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,771
Our aunts said you laid down next to Mom,
who'd collapsed, and slept for two days…

635
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,565
…just snoring your head off.

636
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,619
You really didn't find anything
in the car?

637
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,371
Tsk.

638
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,999
I feel like you'd know.

639
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,335
I just said what I could
to get those pricks off my case

640
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,587
'cause they were being assholes
about everything.

641
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,382
So you found something?

642
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,555
The junkyard called Mom
the day of the accident.

643
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,434
They'd found an envelope
and wanted her to go get it.

644
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,478
Mom told me to just burn it.

645
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,815
She didn't want to see anything else
related to detective work.

646
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,279
I just couldn't bring myself to do it
since Dad's blood was all over it.

647
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,907
On the morning of the accident,

648
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,452
Dad told me
he had to go out and get something.

649
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,417
I didn't know what it was…

650
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,420
but it seemed important to him.

651
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,423
So I just held onto it.

652
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,274
I'm right here, Dad. I'm back.

653
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,491
Hey, you crazy bitch.

654
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,203
Why the hell did you go nuts with an ax
first chance you got

655
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,914
instead of announcing your return
like a normal person?

656
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,316
Well, Mr. Assemblyman…

657
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,653
you must take after our beloved chairman.

658
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,283
You show up after 20 years
to tell me I remind you of Dad?

659
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,495
I'm way better than him.

660
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,455
You're starting to piss me off.

661
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:29,041
Do you still play around like you used to?

662
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,170
What have you got down there?

663
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,673
You been hiding anything interesting?

664
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:47,476
If you're curious…
why don't you come downstairs?

665
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,104
I'll play with you.

666
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,358
Did you know…

667
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,821
that we're the only ones who climbed up

668
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,532
out of the dark

669
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,992
and made it out alive?

670
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,083
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

671
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,147
You crazy bitch.

672
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:38,068
You crazy bitch. Goddamn you.

673
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:43,323
Crazy bitch. You're fucking crazy.

674
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,619
Crazy bitch!

675
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,467
Oh, fuck!

676
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,635
That fucking hurts!

677
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:16,315
You crazy bitch!

678
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,317
Why did you have to show up
all of a sudden

679
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,360
just to start another shitstorm, huh?

680
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,446
Are you out of money?

681
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,740
You want your part
of Dad's inheritance? Fine.

682
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,700
But just get out of my fucking life!

683
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,286
"All of a sudden"?

684
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,871
I've been dreaming about this
my whole life

685
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,331
and you think it's all of a sudden?

686
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,126
Jinman. Look at me, little brother.

687
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,506
You know how hard I worked…
to get my hands on that.

688
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,092
That hurts!

689
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:49,264
Dad taught us to never treat family
this way! You know that!

690
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:53,018
Who…

691
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,604
Who was taught what…

692
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,482
-by our father?
-You're insane!

693
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,318
You bitch, and you're even worse than Dad!

694
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,157
And that's why…

695
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,327
that's why I survived.

696
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,508
It has been a while.

697
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,601
That's where my inheritance is going.
I'm donating everything to this trust.

698
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,691
What? You? Donating?

699
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:47,322
La noblesse oblige, as they say.

700
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,077
You don't know what that is?
You're a politician.

701
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,874
Make sure that you donate
half of your inheritance to them…

702
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,211
from what our soon-to-depart chairman
is leaving you.

703
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,841
Now it makes sense
why you were seeking so much attention.

704
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,177
It's money, it always is. I knew it.

705
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,640
Let me guess what's happening.

706
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,310
I'm sure it's some shell company
you're donating to…

707
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,937
I'd have to be crazy to do that.

708
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,649
This is bullshit, why are you coming
after my money instead of Dad's?

709
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,776
I've still got a long life ahead of me.

710
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,865
You're sure you'll be okay?

711
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,246
Once Trigger starts getting dirt on Hanju,

712
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,624
everything you own will turn to dust.

713
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,167
No more golden badge for you.

714
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,210
No one's messing with Hanju.

715
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,921
Who would do that? Trigger?

716
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,840
Don't make me laugh.

717
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,939
I wouldn't be the only one screwed.

718
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,483
You'd be fucked too.

719
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,870
It's all up to you.

720
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,626
If you wanna keep playing
with your little dolls.

721
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,315
She was all settled down in the States

722
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,943
before the hornet's nest
just had to get stirred up

723
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,945
by those Trigger pieces of shit!

724
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:05,585
"When the fuck are you
getting rid of Trigger?!"

725
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,129
"Soon."

726
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,176
They've got one card remaining.

727
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,804
Am I really gonna let them play it now?

728
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,326
Moka!

729
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,997
-Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine.

730
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,134
Congrats on the new title.

731
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:00,265
You're the only one
who looks out for me, you know?

732
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,893
I've thought about this and…

733
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,064
I realized the reason I liked you…

734
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,859
wasn't 'cause you were
an assistant producer,

735
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:14,237
a field producer,
or any other stupid title.

736
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,449
I liked you for who you were.

737
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,662
I like money too, I, uh…

738
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,707
I mean, I do want stability.

739
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:31,630
That's why life's always been…
nerve-wracking and exhausting for me.

740
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,341
You were different somehow though, Giho.

741
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,096
You were so kind to everyone.

742
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,140
You were so warm.

743
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,605
You didn't care if it was you
who ended up with the short straw,

744
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:51,483
-and that's why I--
-Moka, hold on, hold on a minute, please.

745
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,445
Just a minute.

746
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,864
I didn't realize till afterwards…

747
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,078
that for me to marry you…

748
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,164
it really didn't matter
if you were full-time.

749
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,168
I should have tried harder
to keep you grounded.

750
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,006
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry…

751
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,140
Hug it out?

752
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,525
Hu… Hug it out?

753
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,822
If you don't… you'll regret it.

754
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,740
I already regret it.

755
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:43,702
I gotta go.

756
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,563
Jesus…

757
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,528
Why would you write
an awful message like that on a cake?

758
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,324
KP… KP, you jerk.

759
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,993
Did you pay by the letter?

760
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,411
"Happy Breakup"

761
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,423
There you are.

762
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,300
Get this, man.

763
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,221
KP just… She broke up with me.

764
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,681
"Happy Breakup"

765
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,183
What do I do now?

766
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,688
If she says it's over,
there's nothing you can do.

767
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,066
Oh?

768
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,318
You're cursing me out in your head,
aren't you?

769
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,446
"This damn traitor asshole…"

770
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,449
"He sold out the show…

771
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,495
for a position he's unqualified for," huh?

772
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,621
Snake.

773
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,332
One time, I heard someone say…

774
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,963
"You make the weakest link your asset
when looking to shake up an organization."

775
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,967
That's all they did.
These assholes exploited our weakest link.

776
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,511
-So, you're on my side?
-Uh, no.

777
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,892
At this point, Ms. Oh is the only person
really on your side.

778
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:36,982
She's hands-down the most amazing person
I've met since I began working.

779
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,112
I know! That's Ms. Oh for you.

780
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,822
She's the greatest.

781
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,742
When I first met Ms. Oh,

782
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,035
-I thought that--
-Gah, please don't force yourself

783
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,287
to laugh like that.

784
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,292
Not sure
if it's because I don't laugh often,

785
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:59,296
but… when someone laughs
for no reason like that, I wonder…

786
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,550
are they doing that
'cause they actually feel like crying?

787
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,055
Stop making Ms. Oh upset.
I know you don't mean it.

788
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,391
Come back to us.

789
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,078
Your crying's gonna make me want to cry.

790
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,238
Allow me to introduce you…

791
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,367
Detective Han Donghyeok.

792
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,619
My father.

793
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,954
My oh my…

794
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,670
You told me… you'd found
somewhere my son could've been.

795
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:27,092
We met once after you told me
you might know where Seongwook was,

796
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,970
and then…
you stopped responding all of a sudden.

797
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:36,768
I figured… you were just another detective
like all the others were

798
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,186
who came to the house.

799
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,314
I never would have guessed…

800
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,861
that something like this
may have happened to you.

801
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:59,082
This was in my dad's car in '06,
when the accident occurred.

802
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,800
The four detectives
mentioned in that document

803
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,011
tried to cover up
Cha Seongwook's death. And…

804
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,430
"Officer Kim Yonggyun misplaced
a total of 6 pieces of evidence…"

805
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,973
…my father found out about it.

806
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:18,268
"…including the finger of Cha Seongwook,
at the scene of the murder."

807
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:20,979
This is…

808
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,274
That's the kind of guy my dad was.

809
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,901
This document has to be telling the truth.

810
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,194
"Signed by Han Donghyeok"

811
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,538
"Victim Cha Seongwook
was found in the bathroom…"

812
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:53,761
Where is he…

813
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,015
Where did he go?

814
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,561
I've looked so hard for you…

815
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:07,942
and someone had already found
where you were…

816
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,475
I thought I'd figured out
why I crash-landed at Trigger…

817
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,230
but I didn't know the half of it.

818
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,441
How about you, Ms. Oh?

819
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,236
Beats me, I crash-landed here as well.

820
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,450
Hi, Mr. Hwang, you got the results?

821
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,285
We took
the photo of the sculpture you sent,

822
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,080
made a wireframe outline,
then we scanned it.

823
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:06,084
The facial composite we got as a result
matches the old photos of Cha Seongwook

824
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,002
more than 98%.

825
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:09,879
You got a…

826
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,924
-a 98% match?
-98%?

827
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,760
Yup. But didn't you say
this sculpture was created

828
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,887
after Cha Seongwook went missing?

829
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,767
How'd the artist manage to get…
a mold that was so accurate?

830
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,365
Now we just need to get…

831
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:38,866
an interview with Cho Haewon.

832
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,912
Cho Haewon

833
00:59:52,463 --> 00:59:53,631
I'd like to meet today.

834
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:05,727
Tonight at seven. My workshop.

835
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:09,939
This evening…

836
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,942
we're going to Cho Haewon's workshop.

837
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,955
You lived a just and honorable life.

838
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:50,123
I'll give you that.

839
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,584
But still,
this really wasn't the way to do it.

840
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,714
I was too young to know what was going on…

841
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,467
and you were too far away
for me to make sense of it.

842
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,723
I think I'm starting to understand.
