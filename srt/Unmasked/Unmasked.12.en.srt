EP12: THE CONFESSION

2
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,275
Seriously, Do.

3
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,068
I think we need to call 911 now.

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,029
I… I'm worried
something went wrong down there.

5
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,782
What do you think we should do? Huh?

6
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,117
Just stay calm, okay?

7
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,958
What are you…

8
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,580
It's here, Do!

9
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,332
There it is. It's up!

10
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,875
You see it?

11
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,661
Soryong, come on.

12
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,288
Soryong!

13
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,834
Soryong!

14
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,587
Soryong!

15
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,346
Ms. Oh!

16
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,728
Where are you going?
No! Do! Don't do it!

17
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,647
- Do!
- She needs our help!

18
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,691
- Han Do!
- Come on, Giho!

19
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,361
Oh Soryong!

20
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,052
Oh! Hey, Ms. Oh!

21
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,471
Ms. Oh! You're alive!

22
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,100
Hey! Come back!

23
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,518
Ms. Oh!

24
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,853
Over here! Over here!

25
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,813
Holy shit, Ms. Oh!

26
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,234
Right here!

27
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,944
Yeah!

28
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,947
You don't see me? Whoa!

29
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,782
Over here!

30
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,702
Ms. Oh!

31
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,037
Let's get out of there! Ms. Oh!

32
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,458
Do, c'mon, pool's closed!

33
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,086
Got it! I'm on my way right now.

34
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,675
"FROM: OH SORYONG, TRIGGER"

35
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,302
You're telling me

36
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,554
Cho Jinman buys underage girls online,

37
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,431
he murders them and then…

38
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,515
dumps them in the reservoir?

39
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,559
I think, given our findings,

40
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:32,272
Virgin Slave is a website that sells
underage girls to its VIP clients.

41
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,524
And the assemblyman
was looking at their "products,"

42
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,026
which can only be viewed by members.

43
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,652
So, open-and-shut case.

44
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,362
Might as well smuggle them
in Hanju's shipments.

45
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,031
Easy to hide.

46
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,243
And these bastards
own our nation's top newspaper?

47
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,787
What a sick joke. Jesus…

48
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,998
I mean, this is enough for
an arrest warrant, at the very least.

49
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,208
Don't you think?

50
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:55,962
I don't know. Should we wait and stand by
while they run the tests to be safe?

51
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,923
I just can't understand.

52
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:03,303
How messed up does the Hanju family
have to be for them to…

53
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,265
I mean, this is worse than
anything we'd imagined.

54
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,892
Exactly.

55
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,561
Soryong, you okay there?

56
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,106
Ah, seriously, man.

57
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,317
We've been waiting over three hours.
What's taking so long?

58
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,532
Loony Han.

59
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,034
You were rude earlier.

60
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,911
Huh?

61
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,830
"Oh Soryong!" What was that?

62
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,542
What was I supposed to say,
"Ms. Oh" or something?

63
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,838
Could've tried "Ms. Oh."
Would've been shorter to say, at least.

64
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,550
Wow, someone's in a good mood. Huh?

65
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,301
Why were you down there for so long?

66
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,849
I thought I was a goner.

67
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,144
I guess I passed out cold.

68
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,440
Sweetie.

69
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,361
Soryong.

70
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,197
Oh Soryong!

71
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,868
But then I heard you…

72
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,497
I heard you calling my name.

73
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,850
My mom had this big scar on her ankle.

74
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,644
Wait. Why are you telling us this?

75
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,647
When I was a little girl…

76
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,319
she scolded me
and I ran and hid in an alley.

77
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,283
My mom tried so hard to find me.

78
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,536
But I stayed put in that alleyway.

79
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:57,459
I stayed put even when I saw her trip
and cut her ankle.

80
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,674
When I went to see my mom's body
after she died…

81
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,552
I saw the scar

82
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,764
on her ankle where it always was.

83
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,152
I hate the burden of guilt.

84
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,073
That's why I do this.

85
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,535
I hate when people ask,

86
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,623
"Why are you so obsessed
with the Cha Seongwook case?"

87
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,086
It's 'cause I knew
if I ignored it,

88
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,464
the guilt would eat away at me forever.

89
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,720
I did suspect that…

90
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,098
digging deeper might reveal something.

91
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,225
Something huge.

92
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,567
I never would've imagined…

93
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,028
we find this down there.

94
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,492
Ms. Oh, look.

95
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,786
What do we do?

96
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,122
- What are we gonna do?
- Until the cops get here,

97
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,207
we have to do what we can
to protect the crime scene.

98
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,336
- Roll up the windows.
- The windows, get the windows.

99
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,685
Is there a problem, sir?

100
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,853
I should be asking you that.

101
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,355
You're trespassing on private property.

102
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,440
Private property?

103
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,858
- Oh!
- Oh, it is?

104
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,901
So this place belongs to…

105
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,988
Huh. We didn't know. We had no idea.

106
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,782
We didn't mean to stop here, actually.

107
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,286
Uh… my wife's feeling
a little carsick or something,

108
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,705
so we were taking a break for her.

109
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,249
We're taking a break…

110
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,835
- How are you, sweetie?
- Not good.

111
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,754
- Oh my, she's not doing too well.
- Uh…

112
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,589
Think you're pregnant?

113
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,258
- Uh…
- You think your sister's pregnant?

114
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,926
- Get going.
- Yep, we're leaving, sir.

115
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,261
- We're sorry. We're so sorry, yup.
- Hurry it up.

116
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,597
- What the…
- You suck at acting. My sister?

117
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,015
You seriously thought
that would work?

118
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,266
What should I have said,
she's your daughter?

119
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,185
- No! That would've been even weirder!
- What was I suppo...

120
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,519
The doors. Lock the doors.

121
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:22,812
I need you to let me inspect your vehicle.

122
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,272
- Lock it. Lock it.
- Please open the door.

123
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,107
- Lock it.
- Drive away. Drive away.

124
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,817
- Please open the door, sir.
- Go. Just go. Just drive!

125
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,527
Stop! Open this door! Hey!

126
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,992
Stop them!
They've got something!

127
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,243
- Don't let them get away!
- Back up, back up!

128
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,747
Back up. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

129
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:44,542
- What do we do? No, back up!
- Water's behind us. Back up where?

130
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,919
- Just back up a little more!
- We can't! We gotta go around!

131
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,087
Just do it! Go back!

132
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:50,507
Hey! You can't be here!

133
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,841
- Water! Water!
- I know! I can't go back any farther!

134
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,346
- Sir, open up!
- Damn it, are you serious?

135
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,680
Open the door, now!

136
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,099
- Ah, dude! Just…
- Sir!

137
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,183
- Open the door!
- Get out of there.

138
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,684
Open the door. Hurry up!

139
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,728
Jeez!
What is wrong with you people?

140
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,980
Do you have a warrant?

141
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,149
- What warrant?
- You did this all without a warrant.

142
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,193
You scared the crap out of us, sir!

143
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,488
Your loss.

144
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,491
Because we have our own.

145
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:23,706
God, we've been driving around in circles
getting away from these thugs.

146
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,208
- What took you so long?
- Calm down, we're here.

147
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,793
You see me? Over here.

148
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,671
Tell them Major Crimes is taking over.

149
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,965
Keep clear. This is an active crime scene!

150
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,511
Another one coming up.
Whoa, slow down, easy.

151
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,180
Lower it.
Good, good. Keep it steady.

152
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,765
Slowly, slowly.

153
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,850
Set it down there.

154
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,102
How much more do we have?

155
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,728
- We've got a lot more.
- We keep at it then.

156
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,147
Call for backup if you need.

157
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,190
Be thorough. Make sure you get everything.

158
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,984
Understood, sir.

159
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,068
Left. Left!

160
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,404
A search is currently underway.

161
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,697
Repeat, search underway.

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,657
Go right, slow down.

163
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,869
Make sure to wrap those tight!

164
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,538
Whoa, careful. Careful.

165
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,541
You break even one of them
and it's your ass!

166
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,628
I can't even… How many are there?

167
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,755
How long were all those bodies down there?

168
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,508
I don'... I don't get how someone
could do something so horrible.

169
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,885
They're psychopaths.

170
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,553
All right, keep your eyes peeled!

171
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637
Will do, sir.

172
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,559
So, time to find this Hanju guy
and take him into custody. Okay?

173
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,685
Hey, rookie!

174
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,978
Yes, sir.

175
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,620
We came with a warrant
for search and seizure.

176
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,622
You think you can block us, huh?

177
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,831
Get out of our way!

178
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,916
Let me.

179
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,000
All right.

180
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,669
You folks need to stop this obstruction.

181
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,754
Step aside.

182
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,189
What's this about, huh?

183
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,317
We recovered several dead bodies
from a reservoir on your property.

184
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,612
You're gonna have to come
with us, Mr. Cho.

185
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,030
You're wanted for questioning.

186
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,159
Do you have any idea who I am?

187
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,036
- Mr. Cho Jinman.
- Not what I meant.

188
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,458
I cannot be arrested
as a member of the National Assembly.

189
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,669
That is my privilege and I'll be using it.

190
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,921
Article 44.

191
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,674
"No member of the Assembly
shall be arrested or detained

192
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,842
without the consent of the Assembly."

193
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,680
Questioning, huh?

194
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,141
Well, why don't you come back
with an Assembly-approved warrant?

195
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,811
Assemblyman,
the privilege you're referring to

196
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,438
technically applies
only when Assembly's in session.

197
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,065
The session doesn't start until September.

198
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,817
It seems you aren't aware
that a special session

199
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,152
is set to convene on this very day.

200
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,535
So if you'd like to arrest me,
I suggest you follow the proper protocol

201
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,455
and request a warrant for arrest
that's approved by my peers.

202
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,085
I doubt these findings will be reported
to parliament until tomorrow.

203
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,921
The media is gonna catch wind of this,
and once that happens…

204
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,757
it's a matter of time
before that warrant's out.

205
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,885
Sorry.

206
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,347
I'm afraid getting that approval
won't be as easy as you think.

207
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,599
Why don't you… why don't you…

208
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,729
Why don't you give it a try?

209
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,246
Our detectives

210
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,748
will be staking out the area.

211
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,499
And I'll dispatch the Forensics Service

212
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,209
so they'll analyze the bodies right away.

213
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,253
I'll be on guard at Forensics,

214
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,089
like Cerberus standing at the gates
of the underworld.

215
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,217
And we'll prepare the episode.

216
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,620
I told you to get rid of Oh Soryong
while you still could, didn't I?

217
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,996
God fucking damn it!

218
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,458
My father got you to where you are today,
so you better do something about this.

219
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,878
What the hell
have you even been doing, huh?

220
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,090
What were you doing
while those nosy Trigger pricks

221
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,550
were digging around over there
and starting all this shit?

222
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,679
How dare you put me through
this kind of humiliation?

223
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,849
All of those things
were the doings of your father.

224
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,102
And you knew nothing
about any of it, Assemblyman.

225
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,438
What?

226
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,315
You yourself were a victim of his abuse.

227
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,492
My dad's not a man
who'll leave this alone!

228
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,496
What the hell does he…

229
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,289

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,460
Listen carefully.

232
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,256
This is the only way you and Hanju
can get out of this intact.

233

A single slip-up at this stage

234
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,427
and all that you've worked towards
will crumble around you.

235
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,764
For God's sake,
just do exactly as I tell you

236
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,432
and keep quiet.

What? Says who?

Apparently, the Chief of Police
called the captain and ordered him to...

That was quick.

I'm only saying this
because I'm worried about you.

You know what happens

Of the bones uncovered from the concrete,

261
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,628
some of them belonged to Korean women.
They'd been there a long time.

And the rest
were placed more recently.

they belonged to teenagers

00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,274
Oh, yeah?

323
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,198
Okay.

324
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,993
Let me see.

325
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,789
Uh…

326
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,207
Okay, here.

327
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,793
Okay.

328
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:41,342
Go ahead.

329
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,513
Okay, here.

330
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,141
See?

331
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:41,193
Help.

332
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,195
Help. He…

333
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,530
he was trying to kill me.

334
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,619
CHIEF KIM GYENAM

335
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,043
Apparently Jinman's been
keeping a child at his place.

336
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,796
I think she was trafficked.
She just turned up at the station.

337
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,257
She'd injected him with some drug.

338
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,758
What should we do?

339
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,019
You smoke, don't you?

340
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,624
"CHO JINMAN"

341
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,546
Batshit insane.

342
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,006
What the hell?

343
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,092
You really think you have the clout
to bring me in?

344
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,511
What the hell kind of evidence is that?

345
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,181
Who the fuck cares
what some stupid foreign kid said?

346
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:53,891
A syringe?

347
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,360
Listen… just…

348
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,112
tell them to fuck off
and stop this however you can.

349
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,075
Who cares about the public?

350
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,704
The moment…

351
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:23,295
the moment when the cops set
one fucking foot in this house,

352
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:26,799
that'll be it for you, understand, Chief?

353
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,385
Oh, excuse me!

354
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,261
Justification?

355
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:34,556
Oh, I well I think that's something
you need to find for yourself.

356
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,058
You!

357
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,644
I fed you this whole fucking time!

358
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,397
Shit! I fed you till you had your fill!

359
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,317
So you'd better do your miserable job!

360
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:48,612
You fucking useless shitheads!

361
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,168
- Bring him out here!
- He is a murderer!

362
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,004
- This is a setup!
- Let him face justice!

363
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,009
"We'll Support Cho Jinman Until The End"

364
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,054
- Cho Jinman is a criminal!
- Stop it! All of you, stop!

365
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,598
- Whoa, he's coming out!
- There he is, there he is!

366
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,724
There he is.

367
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,018
Please move.
Let him through to the car.

368
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,022
- I believe you!
- You're a liar!

369
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,111
Wait a minute.

370
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,866
What do you know
about the site Virgin Slave?

371
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,660
Sir! I believe you!
We believe you!

372
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,338
- Get him out of here!
- Pathetic scum.

373
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,842
Cho Jinman!

374
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,641
I believe you!

375
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:50,609
Fucking animals. How dare they,
in front of my own goddamn house?

376
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,117
The guy imploded.

377
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,369
Anticlimactic.

378
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,455
Crazy how it ended up
being that easy, hmm?

379
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:05,040
We know what this means though.

380
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,543
President Koo must've cut him loose.

381
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,215
That one guy threw dooky. Ugh.

382
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,510
Gosh.

383
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,476
Ms. Oh.

384
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,894
President Koo wants to see you.

385
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,396
President Koo?

386
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,162
It's been a while.

387
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:45,998
May I ask what this is about?

388
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,125
Some people
start with "hello."

389
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,545
Obviously, this is about the show.

390
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,339
You're well aware
I'm no longer with Trigger.

391
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,966
Let's just be honest.

392
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,093
We both know
you're working the Cha Seongwook story.

393
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,887
The timing is ideal.

394
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,766
I want you to return to your post
and cover it.

395
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,771
This is from 20 years ago,
the Cho Haewon interview.

396
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,441
Feel free to use it on the show.

397
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,611
I'm sure your ratings
will skyrocket. It'll be historic.

398
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,364
Sorry…

399
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,284
What are you trying to do?

400
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,746
"While Koo Hyeongtae,
the producer who interviewed her,

401
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,207
tried to get the episode to air
with all his strength,

402
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,001
he caved to external pressure."

403
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,503
Make sure you emphasize that last part.

404
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,050
That's…

405
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,011
embarrassingly shameless, even for you.

406
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,346
You don't want it then.

407
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,769
What are they?

408
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,521
- Your terms.
- You learn pretty quick.

409
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,106
I've always liked you, you know.

410
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,151
I'll try to get to the point then,
so you can get to it.

411
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:57,945
Yeah, please do.

412
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,744
I'll make a confession.

413
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,957
Without the president
falling on his sword,

414
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,500
it won't be a good ending.

415
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,336
Added bonus is he ties in to the story.

416
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,630
So interview me.

417
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,384
Are you really confessing?

418
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,637
Or are you just…

419
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,973
indulging yourself?

420
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,102
When we were preparing
the episode in secret,

421
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,980
I had every intention
of going up against them.

422
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,815
But then…

423
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,817
the detective who was
investigating the case,

424
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,902
and had procured key evidence,
turned up dead.

425
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,532
I thought I'd be next on the kill list.

426
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,493
Tell me you wouldn't stand down.

427
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,579
I would've aired the episode,

428
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,956
no matter what.

429
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,001
Ah.

430
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,087
Fearless people such as yourself

431
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,089
might not be able to understand.

432
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,800
I didn't have the stomach to go all in.

433
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,802
I am…

434
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,849
I am but an ordinary man.

435
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,570
We make decisions
every second of our lives.

436
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,740
We do what we think is right,

437
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,785
regardless of any consequences.

438
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,214
You wanna let him redeem himself?

439
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,929
You wanna put this blatant attempt
at whitewashing his name on our show?

440
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,389
It's the only option we have right now...

441
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,474
No.

442
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,100
That's not true.

443
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,188
My dad died investigating Hanju.

444
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,440
Hanju is not the only villain here.

445
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,068
Everyone involved,
from detectives who hid evidence,

446
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,904
and to President Koo,
they're all complicit in this.

447
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,991
You're saying that giving the mic to them
is the only choice we have right now?

448
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,702
You're being irrational, Mr. Han.

449
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,621
Have you forgotten
the reason we're airing this?

450
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,873
The truth behind
the death of Cha Seongwook.

451
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,083
The death of your father,

452
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,460
covered up by the Hanju Group.

453
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,962
Generations of murder and abuse.

454
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,548
Our moral duty
is to show the world this episode.

455
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,426
President Koo's excuses
may very well have an impact on...

456
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,304
That bastard President Koo
was Cho Jinman's accomplice!

457
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,848
And I'll destroy him
by revealing who he is.

458
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,435
I don't wanna air his pathetic sob story
on our show.

459
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,980
I refuse to let him sugarcoat his crimes
so he can be brought down gently.

460
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,148
And the tape?

461
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,026
Cho Haewon's interview. We throw it out?

462
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,071
Are you suggesting
we toss out all our findings,

463
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,156
all the work we've done?
That's what you want?

464
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,326
We need this for the ratings.

465
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,997
You know, the guy did say he'd resign.

466
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,835
And his apology will help clear
Trigger's name so we can cover this story.

467
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,586
Okay, but that's not even the issue.

468
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,798
President Koo could easily stop us
from airing the episode.

469
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,593
I think, before anything,
we should be getting the episode out.

470
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,512
You all know I've tried that approach.

471
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,182
Even the most noble goal,
when achieved through unjust means,

472
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,643
becomes unjust as a whole.

473
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,438
Do.

474
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,861
I'll admit, If I were in his shoes,

475
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,737
I might have done the same thing.

476
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,822
Remember when…

477
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,951
when I killed that interview
in exchange for being made full-time?

478
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,079
I did everything
the higher-ups asked.

479
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,497
I mean, it's not like
there were death threats.

480
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,375
I just had a chance
to take an opportunity.

481
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,129
So maybe what President Koo
did back then wasn't so...

482
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,798
This is exactly
what President Koo wants us to do.

483
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,218
He wants to guilt-trip all of us

484
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:54,139
to make us sympathize
with his cowardly, self-serving decisions.

485
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,352
Then sit this out.

486
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,982
All or nothing…

487
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,819
is not an attitude
that works for this show.

488
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,115
Personal qualms,
based on our individual convictions,

489
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,867
have no place in a show like ours.

490
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,787
You must be willing to accept decisions,
even if you disagree,

491
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,624
provided that they're based on fact
and reveal the greater truth.

492
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,667
That's necessary to work here.

493
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,588
It's our moral obligation,
as journalists and producers.

494
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,548
If you put your convictions first then,

495
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,302
I'm afraid to say it,

496
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,181
but your time spent on Trigger

497
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,352
was a waste, Mr. Han.

498
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,987
Ms. Oh, wait, why… why would you…

499
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,405
- Wait. Wait, Do.
- Mister… Mr. Han.

500
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,074
Mr. Han.

501
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,288
Come on, Ms. Oh.

502
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:02,332
What are y'all doing?
Let's make this happen.

503
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,477
Cha Seongwook…

504
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,728
Cho Haewon solo interview

505
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,697
- Let's go over that again. First part.
- Right.

506
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,532
Remember that smile you trimmed earlier?

507
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:37,701
Use that, slow it down, but subtle.

508
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,119
Wait. Okay, stop.

509
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:42,122
- Should I go get more?
- Oh, yes, please.

510
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,667
- Oh, you're here.
- Which story are you on again?

511
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,627
A star producer abusing his workers.

512
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,338
He's a big earner,
so they wanna flush the whole thing.

513
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:51,798
Pissing away a great story.

514
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,675
Hmm…

515
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,635
I'll bet Ms. Oh would've made it work.

516
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,970
True.

517
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,221
"THE CONFESSION"

518
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:03,560
What's wrong?

519
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,105
I can't write a single line.

520
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,567
I think this case
is just too big for me.

521
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,903
I really, really want this
to be a groundbreaking episode.

522
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,240
But I just can't.

523
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,536
From time to time, people ask me,

524
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:25,582
"No teleprompter,
so how do you memorize all those lines?"

525
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,836
Trigger scripts
aren't just words on a screen.

526
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,422
Instead, I just…

527
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,966
I close my eyes, and I listen.

528
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,885
I think about…

529
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:41,222
the stories, and the heartbreak,
the poor victims.

530
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,725
A projector starts rolling in my head.

531
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,312
And the words just flow out of me.

532
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,314
And you wanna know why?

533
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,485
It's because Ms. Hong, when she wrote,

534
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,446
she poured her heart out.

535
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,910
She would always say,
"Before you deliver your lines,

536
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,330
try to read not the words,
but the emotions."

537
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:11,753
HONG NAHEE

538
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,881
Yes, Ms. Hong.

539
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,467
The emotions…

540
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,681
KP…

541
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,311
KP…

542
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,677
I'm heading over for
the final interview with President Koo.

543
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,388
If any of you wanna join,

544
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,598
feel free to come.

545
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,815
Okay.

546
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,036
This is quite the audience you've brought.

547
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,758
It's all set. We can begin now.

548
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,638
The media has an obligation
to serve the nation's citizens

549
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,056
by putting checks on those in power

550
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,976
through fair, balanced,
and truthful reporting.

551
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,853
But regretfully,

552
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,148
when faced with
the imposing authority of Hanju,

553
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,026
I failed to uphold these fundamentals.

554
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,403
Back then, everyone reporting on the story

555
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,572
was either demoted
or fired from their job.

556
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,870
You know,
controlling your facial expressions

557
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,371
is part of your job description.

558
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,207
God, you people…

559
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,083
It wouldn't kill you
to lighten up once in a while.

560
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,420
It sounds like…

561
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,841
even after our interview,
you feel no remorse.

562
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,310
Remorse isn't an emotion I find useful.

563
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,396
Although I felt sentimental
towards the end of that.

564
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,109
It was as though you finished writing
a letter I'd left incomplete.

565
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,453
All right, let's hurry.

566
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,873
We're gonna splice in this interview
right after the interview with Cho Haewon.

567
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,166
Let's go!

568
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,339
The look on Soryong's face was priceless.

569
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,216
I'll keep an eye on
the Master Control Room

570
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,677
to make sure
the episode doesn't go off the rails.

571
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,018
You do that. I'll watch from my office.

572
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:15,353
Yes, sir.

573
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,774
Let's just leave it here and…

574
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,317
Cut down that glare a little bit.

575
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,861
- Placement's okay?
- Other way. Other way.

576
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:23,945
- Other…
- Yes.

577
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,321
Like this, huh?

578
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,198
"Cha Seongwook Disappearance Case
Producer Koo Hyeongtae"

579
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,533
- Let's do it like that.
- Yeah, looks good.

580
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,005
The writers eat this stuff?
That explains...

581
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,381
- It's starting, it's starting now!
- Oh.

582
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,019
"THE CONFESSION"

583
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,065
20 years ago, a young television star
just hitting his stride,

584
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,317
suddenly went missing.

585
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,860
Disappearing without a trace.

586
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,323
I just wanna know where my son is.

587
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,908
The "January Man" statue,

588
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,702
kept for years
in the lobby of Hanju's offices,

589
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,205
was confirmed to contain
the bronze-encased head of Mr. Cha.

590
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,291
It was determined that Ms. Cho Haewon,

591
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,169
the oldest daughter
of the powerful Hanju Group family…

592
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,921
and his lover…

593
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,672
was the murderer.

594
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:29,761
And now,
the unspeakable crimes of the Hanju family

595
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,846
have finally come to the surface.

596
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,183
However, as part of this broadcast,

597
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,937
a past omission will be addressed by us.

598
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,191
What you see here is a 20-year-old tape,

599
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,528
Trigger Episode 890, completely unaired,

600
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,407
containing the full details
of the Cha Seongwook murder investigation.

601
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,034
However, this tape

602
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:58,539
was hidden away by none other than
a member of the Trigger production staff.

603
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:03,419
So, today's episode will contain
both a confession and an apology,

604
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,547
for Trigger's actions
and our shameful past.

605
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,181
I wanted to possess him.

606
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,144
"CHO HAEWON, 24 YEARS OLD"

607
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,188
I wanted to keep him forever.

608
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,691
Are you the one…

609
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,110
who killed Cha Seongwook?

610
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,781
Yes.

611
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,160
Why did you do it?

612
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,247
That face…

613
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,210
that face of his.

614
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,634
My father wanted to punish me,

615
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,179
so he stole it.

616
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,808
The producer in the footage

617
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,020
is the sitting president of KNS,
Mr. Koo Hyeongtae.

618
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,647
He wishes to make a confession

619
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,358
and issue an apology to our viewers.

620
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,361
Back then, everyone reporting on the story

621
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,822
was either demoted
or fired from their job.

622
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,867
In certain cases,
their lives were threatened.

623
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,495
So I abandoned the story.

624
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,622
{\an8}"PLEASE HELP FIND MY SON CHA SEONGWOOK"

625
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,041
20 years went by…

626
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,962
I tried to relieve myself of guilt
by justifying my actions.

627
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,297
I told myself…

628
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,925
that I was fulfilling my duties
as a journalist by staying alive,

629
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,261
to fight another day.

630
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,515
However, I now believe…

631
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,772
the time has come for me to give in
and stop deluding myself.

632
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,442
On my honor as a journalist,
this is a confession

633
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,569
and my final interview.

634
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,907
I assume responsibility for my actions,

635
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,867
and therefore…

636
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,496
I will resign as the KNS president.

637
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,004
We, the staff of Trigger,

638
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,839
take this opportunity to remind ourselves

639
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,758
of a past lapse
in our journalistic integrity.

640
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,803
To our viewers, our fellow citizens,

641
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,514
we humbly and sincerely apologize.

642
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,563
Trigger vows to give this case
our full attention until it's resolved.

643
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:31,651
We strive for a world in which
no subject is exempt from investigation.

644
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,694
Lastly,

645
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:38,533
we'd like to offer our deepest condolences
to the late Mr. Cha Seongwook,

646
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,451
and to the victims

647
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,622
whose remains
were left in the reservoir so heartlessly.

648
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,838
Trigger
May their souls rest in peace.

649
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:02,598
"GOOD ON HIM FOR COMING FORWARD."

650
00:44:02,682 --> 00:44:03,975
"THAT WAS COOL. A REAL GROWNUP."

651
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,393
"CHA SEONGWOOK CAN REST IN PEACE
THANKS TO KOO."

652
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,561
"HE'LL BE KNOWN
AS THE ICON OF CONFESSION NOW."

653
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,979
"MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN THOSE POLITICIANS."

654
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,068
Oh, hello.

655
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,238
Yes, the public is reacting well.

656
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,324
"CONFESSION ICON"?

657
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:23,119
I appreciate that.

658
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,372
I'll make a visit very soon.
I'll bring the assemblyman as well.

659
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,583
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,793
I think it's time
that I turn the page on this.

661
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,004
Thanks, have a good night.

662
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,472
{\an8}"KOO IS DR. TRIGGER?

00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,628
Shit!

674
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,882
The ratings are soaring,
just as we expected.

675
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:26,682
You bastard.

676
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,062
How could you?
How dare you?

677
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,689
You violated
the Personal Information Protection Act

678
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,900
when you spied on your employees,
so we'll be reporting you.

679
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,110
Wanna add an assault charge?

680
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,405
You'll be booked as a flagrant offender.

681
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,158
I just couldn't stomach
that revolting confession.

682
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,580
You…

683
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,708
must think you're in
some sort of superhero movie.

684
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,714
But you're living
in the real world, Soryong,

685
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:00,633
and there's no happy end.

686
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,302
You're all…

687
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,264
only screwing yourselves.

688
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,063
With people like you
lurking around every corner,

689
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,523
the world can use heroes.

690
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,655
You sh…

691
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,448
You little…

692
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,621
Do you want your stuff?

693
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:37,920
Hang on.

694
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,047
When did you arrange all this?

695
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,556
…I refuse to let him sugarcoat his crimes

696
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,266
so he can be brought down gently.

697
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,393
Then sit this out.

698
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,814
Come on,
at least give us a sign or something.

699
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:57,982
You want us to work separately?

700
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,151
You take on President Koo
while we're preparing the episode.

701
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,736
We operate separately.

702
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,696
It's the safest way
to divert his attention.

703
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,906
The story breaks right as the show airs.

704
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,535
Finding dirt on this guy
isn't gonna be easy though.

705
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,037
It's easier when you're close.

706
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:16,250
There isn't anyone else…
who knows Koo's wrongdoings more than him.

707
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,381
The taste was slightly off,
but it's fine now.

708
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,261
What's this about?

709
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,512
Why the sudden meeting, Mr. Han?

710
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,557
Why'd you have me transferred to Trigger?

711
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,269
Was it because you wanted me
to serve as Ms. Oh's human shield?

712
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,481
You knew that she'd see me
for the lunatic I am,

713
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,524
and you were secretly rooting for her,
weren't you?

714
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,611
You were also the one who hired
Kang Giho as main producer,

715
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,155
even after giving him such a hard time
about his academic credentials.

716
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,910
Gonna keep answering your own questions?

717
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:53,788
"Dr. Trigger."

718
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,415
You knew that was my handle.

719
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,961
The president was able to use the IT team
to gain access to my account credentials,

720
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,338
with the goal of tearing Trigger apart.

721
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,132
The News Department
already investigated and told us.

722
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:06,342
So then,

723
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:09,053
what more do you need me to tell you?

724
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:16,143
This is the ideal scenario
for "Dr. Trigger" to herald his return.

725
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,400
Who could Dr. Trigger be?

726
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,902
It's about time we unveiled his identity.

727
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,490
It's time to decide.

728
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,785
Please hand it over…

729
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,539
the proof of the spying.

730
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,791
Why would I?

731
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,501
Because you want to.

732
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,257
It's time for you to take charge
and put an end to this two-faced coward

733
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,218
who hides behind a mask of integrity.

734
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,860
You've changed, you know that?

735
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,031
It's Trigger.

736
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,952
Trigger allows a man to be reborn…

737
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,706
as his true self.

738
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,798
…a whistleblower reports
that the KNS President, Koo Hyeongtae,

739
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,427
has been engaging in mass-surveillance
of his employees over an extended period

740
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,637
in order to protect
the powerful Hanju Group.

741
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,515
It's being reported that
this whistleblower is none other than

742
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,226
Mr. Son Huiwon,
the right-hand man to President Koo,

743
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,936
and KNS Managing Director,

744
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,772
and he has already provided
the authorities with extensive evidence

745
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,316
to back up these explosive claims.

746
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,818
In other words, the president
of a public broadcasting company

747
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,779
tried to muzzle his own journalists.
Do I have that correct?

748
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:51,864
That's correct.

749
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,949
It has also been revealed
that President Koo has been attempting

750
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,744
to illegally manipulate KNS' programming,

751
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,245
shaping the news coverage to his liking

752
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,081
in order to help conceal
the criminal activities of the Hanju Group

753
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,708
and other high-profile individuals.

754
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,293
It sounds like
KNS has been functioning

755
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,003
as the group's private broadcaster.

756
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,588
How long has this been going on?

757
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,048
According to
our background research,

758
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,967
President Koo has been linked to
the Hanju Group for some time.

759
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,553
Their relationship
goes back a few decades.

760
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,264
The late Chairman Cho Taesu's
team of executives…

761
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,808
Today, the case against Cho Jinman,

762
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:23,646
charged with murder, attempted murder,
unlawful imprisonment, human trafficking,

763
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,564
and defacing and concealing a corpse,

764
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,234
has been officially referred
to the Prosecutors' Office

765
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,318
for further legal proceedings.

766
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,028
In the meantime,
a warrant for the arrest

767
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,114
of Police Station Chief Kim Gyenam
and his accomplices,

768
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,824
who played a part in concealing evidence,

769
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:39,370
has been issued following
revelations of Cho Haewon's murder.

770
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,248
The trial of former
KNS President Koo Hyeongtae,

771
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,875
who has been indicted on charges of
workplace misconduct

772
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:48,379
and violating the Protection of
Communications Secrets Act, opens today.

773
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,799
Meanwhile, a number of victims
have come forward with stories

774
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,344
of their sexual harassment
by the former president in the past.

775
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,182
Many are speculating as to how
these allegations will impact the trial.

776
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,989
Mm-hmm.

777
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,160
Thank you for coming all this way.
I'll be in touch.

778
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,330
- Here.
- Oh, you're here.

779
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,666
Oh, you didn't have to bring anything.

780
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,961
Hey… as our suffering father…

781
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,254
we gotta look out for you.

782
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,339
Thank you.

783
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,678
- Oh, right.
- Ah… appreciate it.

784
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,347
Money?

785
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,599
Come on.

786
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,061
30? That's cheap!
30.30,000 won.

787
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,479
- Oh, no… Double?
- That's too little.

788
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,746
- A little more, a little more.
- I've really been going through it lately.

789
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,336
- Gosh.
- Hey, Daeyong.

790
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,296
At least he wasn't in pain.

791
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,422
Very true.

792
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,634
- Oh!
- Oh, hello, Mr. Son.

793
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,844
Please, I'm just the humble owner
of a teahouse now.

794
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,430
I have to say,
the name is "Tea and Me," right?

795
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,015
It sounds a little corny, doesn't it?

796
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:25,934
Did you really open a cafe?

797
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,853
- Well, you know.
- How'd you find time to visit?

798
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,937
Gotta keep busy.

799
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,856
Hey, I'm the managing director now.

800
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,234
You know, not even one of you
congratulated me on my big promotion.

801
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,487
Oh, come on,
we've all been busy, you know?

802
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,447
The Chanbyeol Act story, right?

803
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,698
Why don't we throw a party,

804
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,408
- since we're all here?
- Huh?

805
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,786
How's business been?

806
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,246
Well, if it isn't Mr. Son.

807
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,373
"You and Tea," right? Hmm?

808
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,124
- It's "Tea and Me."
- Oh, right. "Tea and Me."

809
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,335
By the way, that white shirt
looks great on you, Mr. Han.

810
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,545
Have you eaten yet? You want anything?

811
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,172
- Oh, sure. Whatever's there.
- All right, great.

812
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,715
- I'll bring something over.
- Oh, no, I'll go.

813
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,175
- Oh, uh… Wanna come with me?
- Oh no, just stay put.

814
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,094
Yeah, you guys should go together.
Go together.

815
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,013
- Hmm…
- Cuties.

816
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,516
I guess they must still think
we don't know about them.

817
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,184
They're a good match.

818
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,480
However, Mr. Jang's crimes
went much deeper than that.

819
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,233
He made his assistant producer
book motel rooms for him,

820
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,777
where he'd coerce
female extras and co-stars

821
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,445
into sleeping with him
in exchange for roles.

822
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,531
Oh, my God,
I can't believe people like that exist!

823
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,116
That man is absolute trash.

824
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,575
…also tasked with scouring the nation

825
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,037
for clinics that could provide abortions
for the women in secret.

826
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,997
So basically, you were so upset

827
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,500
that you, uh, urinated on him in anger.

828
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,211
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

829
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,464
To be honest, peeing on him was just about

830
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,717
all I could do at the time.

831
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,010
Besides,
I didn't originally intend to pee on him.

832
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,387
Actually, Mr. Jang was the one
who kicked things off…

833
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,389
The blur isn't really hiding much, is it?

834
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,473
Oh, no, no, come on.

835
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,850
It's basically impossible
to tell it's you.

836
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,059
You look great on camera.

837
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,229
Are you doing all right?

838
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,439
Heard your drama got canceled.

839
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,023
I'm not ready to quit.

840
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,401
I will be insisting on
writing what I want,

841
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,819
not dealing with that piece of…

842
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,780
Ms. Hong, how noble of you.

843
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,949
Where'd this superhuman strength
come from?

844
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,242
Try raising a kid.

845
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,245
There's not a thing I won't do
to provide for her.

846
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,084
Wow, you looked great.

847
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,794
I mean… never mind…
That was you?

848
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,423
It was super blurry.
No one will know.

849
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,549
"YEONGRAK FUNERAL HOME"

850
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,676
Feeling a little better?

851
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,679
I'm still worried about that face-blur.

852
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,349
- It looked like me?
- Yeah, of course it did.

853
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,768
I totally knew it. Man…

854
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,646
Wasn't that story
originally your assignment?

855
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,065
Lunatic Han, passing that up?

856
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,734
Someone once told me

857
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,237
to keep my personal vendettas
out of our episodes, is why.

858
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,616
May I ask you something?

859
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,829
Why'd you make that post about
the cheating couple on the Trigger staff?

860
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,789
You know it was none of your business.

861
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,252
I felt betrayed.

862
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,930
I guess, after working
for the network for some time,

863
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,058
I came to hold Trigger
to a higher standard,

864
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,351
and I expected better from them.

865
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,269
Please just give me more time.

866
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,189
I'll tell my wife I'm divorcing her.
I'll do it today, please!

867
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,233
Please, just give me a little…

868
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,652
Damn it.

869
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,403
Damn it.

870
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,405
Damn it! Shit!

871
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,619
"LEE SANGMOK, TRIGGER"

872
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,293
And I couldn't accept that you guys,

873
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,170
of all people, had let me down.

874
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:41,838
"KNS MOVED TO A NEW BUILDING!"

875
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:48,512
Okay, so?

876
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,181
Who was the other woman then?

877
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,851
You wanna know?

878
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,940
I guess not.

879
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,906
Mind if I also ask you a question?

880
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,119
Why do you exclusively date
total scumbags?

881
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,376
Uh…

882
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,838
I guess…

883
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,593
with men who…

884
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,303
claim to like me, I don't turn them down.

885
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,722
I don't know.

886
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,933
I suppose I just say, "Why not?"

887
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,102
Someone opens their heart…

888
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:39,771
you don't turn them down?

889
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:46,320
Whoa, what are you doing?

890
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,781
Let's try the other way around.

891
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,409
Tell someone you like him first.

892
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,539
Wouldn't be the first time
you came at someone without warning.

893
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,042
And if you did, well…

894
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,088
I might start trusting again.

895
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,901
Oh, Detective Yu.

896
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,321
You two dating?

897
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,822
No. No way.

898
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,533
Is something wrong?

899
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,753
So this was discovered
at Cho Jinman's house?

900
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,797
An anonymous trust or something?

901
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,550
Something smelled fishy,

902
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,135
so I did some digging.

903
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,720
And it turns out

904
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:57,933
an enormous sum of money from Hanju
went into this account.

905
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,477
- When did this happen?
- Exactly.

906
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,229
The date's what matters here.

907
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,022
It was deposited

908
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,816
the day before Cho Haewon's death.

909
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,408
The autopsy… never happened.

910
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,288
Does that mean…

911
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,671
Cho Haewon…

912
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,090
is still alive.
