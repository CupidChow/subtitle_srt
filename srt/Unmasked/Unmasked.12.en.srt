I think, given our findings,

64

Virgin Slave is a website that sells
underage girls to its VIP clients.

and I ran and hid in an alley.

What is wrong with you people?

177
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,980
Do you have a warrant?

178
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,149
-What warrant?
-You did this all without a warrant.

179
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,193
You scared the crap out of us, sir!

180
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,488
Your loss.

181
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,491

-What took you so long?
-[Detective Yu] Calm down, we're here.

185
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,793
You see me? Over here.

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,671
[Detective Yu]
Tell them Major Crimes is taking over.

187
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,965
Keep clear. This is an active crime scene!

Whoa, slow down, easy.

189
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,180
[crew worker 1] Lower it.
Good, good. Keep it steady.

190
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,765
[crew worker 2] Slowly, slowly.

191
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,850
[crew worker 1] Set it down there.

192
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,102
[crew worker 3]
How much more do we have?

193

203

[Detective Yu] You break even one of them
and it's your ass!

204
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,628
I can't even… How many are there?

205
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,755
How long were all those bodies down there?

206
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,508
[Giho] I don'-- I don't get how someone
could do something so horrible.

207

They're psychopaths.

208
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,553
All right, keep your eyes peeled!

209
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:19,637

210
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,559
So, time to find this Hanju guy
and take him into custody. Okay?

Get out of our way!

We recovered several dead bodies
from a reservoir on your property.

226
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,612
You're gonna have to come
with us, Mr. Cho.

227
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,030
You're wanted for questioning.

228
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,159
Do you have any idea who I am?

229
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,036
-Mr. Cho Jinman.
-Not what I meant.

230
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,458
I cannot be arrested
as a member of the National Assembly.

231
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,669
That is my privilege and I'll be using it.

232
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,921
[Jinman] Article 44.

233
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,674
"No member of the Assembly
shall be arrested or detained

234

without the consent of the Assembly."

235

Questioning, huh? [chuckles]

236
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,141
Well, why don't you come back
with an Assembly-approved warrant?

237
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,811
Assemblyman,
the privilege you're referring to

238
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,438
technically applies
only when Assembly's in session.

239
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,065
The session doesn't start until September.

240
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,817
It seems you aren't aware
that a special session

241
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,152
is set to convene on this very day.

242
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:05,535
So if you'd like to arrest me,
I suggest you follow the proper protocol

243
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,455
and request a warrant for arrest
that's approved by my peers.

244
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,085
I doubt these findings will be reported
to parliament until tomorrow.

245
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,921
The media is gonna catch wind of this,
and once that happens…

246
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,757
it's a matter of time
before that warrant's out.

247
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,885
[chuckles] Sorry.

248
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,347
I'm afraid getting that approval
won't be as easy as you think.

249
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,599

256

will be staking out the area.

257
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,499
And I'll dispatch the Forensics Service

258
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,209
so they'll analyze the bodies right away.

259

have you even been doing, huh?

270
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,090
What were you doing
while those nosy Trigger pricks

271
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:44,550
were digging around over there
and starting all this shit?

272

How dare you put me through
this kind of humiliation?

273

All of those things
were the doings of your father.

about any of it, Assemblyman.

00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,817
the detective who was
investigating the case,

525
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,902
and had procured key evidence,
turned up dead.

526
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,532
I thought I'd be next on the kill list.

527
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,493
Tell me you wouldn't stand down.

528
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,579
I would've aired the episode,

529
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,956
no matter what.

530
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,001
Ah.

531
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,087
Fearless people such as yourself

532
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,089
might not be able to understand.

533
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,800
I didn't have the stomach to go all in.

534
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,802
I am…

535
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,849
I am but an ordinary man.

[♪ pensive music playing]

537
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,570
We make decisions
every second of our lives.

538
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,740
We do what we think is right,

539
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,785
regardless of any consequences.

540
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,214
You wanna let him redeem himself?

541
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,929
You wanna put this blatant attempt
at whitewashing his name on our show?

542
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,389
It's the only option we have right now--

543
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,474
[Han Do] No.

544
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,100
That's not true.

545
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,188
My dad died investigating Hanju.

546
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:58,440
[Han Do]
Hanju is not the only villain here.

547
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,068
Everyone involved,
from detectives who hid evidence,

548
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,904
and to President Koo,
they're all complicit in this.

549
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,991
You're saying that giving the mic to them
is the only choice we have right now?

550
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,702
-You're being irrational, Mr. Han.
-[scoffs]

551
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,621
[Soryong] Have you forgotten
the reason we're airing this?

552
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,873
The truth behind
the death of Cha Seongwook.

553
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,083
The death of your father,

554
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,460
covered up by the Hanju Group.

555
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,962
Generations of murder and abuse.

556
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,548
Our moral duty
is to show the world this episode.

557
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,426
President Koo's excuses
may very well have an impact on--

558
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,304
That bastard President Koo
was Cho Jinman's accomplice!

559
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,848
And I'll destroy him
by revealing who he is.

560
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,435
I don't wanna air his pathetic sob story
on our show.

561
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,980
I refuse to let him sugarcoat his crimes
so he can be brought down gently.

562
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,148
And the tape?

563
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,026
Cho Haewon's interview. We throw it out?

564
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,071
Are you suggesting
we toss out all our findings,

565
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,156
all the work we've done?
That's what you want?

566
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,326
[Daeyong] We need this for the ratings.

567
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,997
You know, the guy did say he'd resign.

568
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,835
And his apology will help clear
Trigger's name so we can cover this story.

569
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,586
Okay, but that's not even the issue.

570
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,798
President Koo could easily stop us
from airing the episode.

571
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,593
I think, before anything,
we should be getting the episode out.

572
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,512
You all know I've tried that approach.

573
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,182
Even the most noble goal,
when achieved through unjust means,

574
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,643
becomes unjust as a whole.

575
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,354
-[deep inhale]
-[deep exhale]

576
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,438
Do.

577
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,861
I'll admit, If I were in his shoes,

578
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,737
I might have done the same thing.

579
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,822
[Giho] Remember when…

580
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,951
when I killed that interview
in exchange for being made full-time?

581
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,161
[sighs]

582
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,079
[Giho] I did everything
the higher-ups asked.

583
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,497
I mean, it's not like
there were death threats.

584
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:40,375
I just had a chance
to take an opportunity.

585
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,129
So maybe what President Koo
did back then wasn't so--

586
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,798
This is exactly
what President Koo wants us to do.

587
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,218
He wants to guilt-trip all of us

588
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:54,139
to make us sympathize
with his cowardly, self-serving decisions.

589
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,352
Then sit this out.

590
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:03,982
All or nothing…

591
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:07,819
is not an attitude
that works for this show.

592
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,115
Personal qualms,
based on our individual convictions,

593
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,867
have no place in a show like ours.

594
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,787
You must be willing to accept decisions,
even if you disagree,

595
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,624
provided that they're based on fact
and reveal the greater truth.

596
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,667
That's necessary to work here.

597
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:26,588
It's our moral obligation,
as journalists and producers.

598
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,548
If you put your convictions first then,

599
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,302
I'm afraid to say it,

600
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,181
but your time spent on Trigger

601
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,352
was a waste, Mr. Han.

But I just can't.

"No teleprompter,
so how do you memorize all those lines?"

633

aren't just words on a screen.

00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,966
I close my eyes, and I listen.

00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:36,885

the poor victims.

And you wanna know why?

641
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,485
It's because Ms. Hong, when she wrote,

642
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,446
she poured her heart out.

643
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,910
She would always say,
"Before you deliver your lines,

644
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,330
try to read not the words,
but the emotions."

[camera beeping]

659
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,758
It's all set. We can begin now.

660
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,638
The media has an obligation
to serve the nation's citizens

661
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,056
by putting checks on those in power

662
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,976
through fair, balanced,
and truthful reporting.

663
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:51,853
But regretfully,

664
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,148
when faced with
the imposing authority of Hanju,

665
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:58,026
I failed to uphold these fundamentals.

666
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,403
Back then, everyone reporting on the story

667
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,572
was either demoted
or fired from their job.

00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,870
You know,
controlling your facial expressions

670
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,371
is part of your job description.

God, you people…

672
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,083
It wouldn't kill you
to lighten up once in a while.

673
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,420
It sounds like…

674
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,841
even after our interview,
you feel no remorse.

675

Remorse isn't an emotion I find useful.

Although I felt sentimental
towards the end of that.

"The Confession"

700
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,065
20 years ago, a young television star
just hitting his stride,

701
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,317
suddenly went missing.

702
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,860
Disappearing without a trace.

703
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:08,323
I just wanna know where my son is.

[Soryong] The "January Man" statue,

705
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,702
kept for years
in the lobby of Hanju's offices,

706
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,205
was confirmed to contain
the bronze-encased head of Mr. Cha.

707
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,291
It was determined that Ms. Cho Haewon,

708
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:21,169
the oldest daughter
of the powerful Hanju Group family…

709
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,921
and his lover…

710
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,672
was the murderer.

711
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:29,761
And now,
the unspeakable crimes of the Hanju family

712
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,846
have finally come to the surface.

713
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:35,183
However, as part of this broadcast,

714
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,937
a past omission will be addressed by us.

715
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,191
What you see here is a 20-year-old tape,

716
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,528
Trigger Episode 890, completely unaired,

717
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,407
containing the full details
of the Cha Seongwook murder investigation.

718
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,034
However, this tape

719
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:58,539
was hidden away by none other than
a member of the Trigger production staff.

720
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:03,419
So, today's episode will contain
both a confession and an apology,

721
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,547
for Trigger's actions
and our shameful past.

722
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,181
I wanted to possess him.

726
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,110

728
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,781
Yes.

729
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,160
Why did you do it?

730
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,247
That face…

731
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,210
that face of his.

732
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,634
My father wanted to punish me,

733
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,179
so he stole it.

734
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,808
[Soryong] The producer in the footage

735
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,020
is the sitting president of KNS,
Mr. Koo Hyeongtae.

736
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,647
He wishes to make a confession

737
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,358
and issue an apology to our viewers.

738
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,361
Back then, everyone reporting on the story

739
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,822
was either demoted
or fired from their job.

740
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,867
In certain cases,
their lives were threatened.

741
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,495
So I abandoned the story.

742
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,622
"Please help find my son Cha Seongwook"

743
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,041
[President Koo] 20 years went by…

744
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,962
I tried to relieve myself of guilt
by justifying my actions.

745
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:29,297
I told myself…

746
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,925
that I was fulfilling my duties
as a journalist by staying alive,

747
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,261
to fight another day.

748
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,515
However, I now believe…

749
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,772
the time has come for me to give in
and stop deluding myself.

750
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,442
On my honor as a journalist,
this is a confession

751
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,569
and my final interview.

752
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,907
I assume responsibility for my actions,

753
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,867
and therefore…

754
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,496
I will resign as the KNS president.

755
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,004
We, the staff of Trigger,

756
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,839
take this opportunity to remind ourselves

757
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,758
of a past lapse
in our journalistic integrity.

758
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,803
To our viewers, our fellow citizens,

759
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:19,514
we humbly and sincerely apologize.

760
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,563
Trigger vows to give this case
our full attention until it's resolved.

761
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:31,651
We strive for a world in which
no subject is exempt from investigation.

762

Lastly,

763
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:38,533
we'd like to offer our deepest condolences
to the late Mr. Cha Seongwook,

764
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,451
and to the victims

765

were left in the reservoir so heartlessly.

00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,427
has been engaging in mass-surveillance
of his employees over an extended period

873
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,637
in order to protect
the powerful Hanju Group.

874
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:36,515
It's being reported that
this whistleblower is none other than

875
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,226
Mr. Son Huiwon,
the right-hand man to President Koo,

876
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,936
and KNS Managing Director,

877
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,772
and he has already provided
the authorities with extensive evidence

878
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:45,316
to back up these explosive claims.

879
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,818
[TV host] In other words, the president
of a public broadcasting company

880
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,779
tried to muzzle his own journalists.
Do I have that correct?

881
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:51,864
[Jongu] That's correct.

882
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,949
It has also been revealed
that President Koo has been attempting

883
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,744
to illegally manipulate KNS' programming,

884
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,245
shaping the news coverage to his liking

885
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,081
in order to help conceal
the criminal activities of the Hanju Group

886
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,708
and other high-profile individuals.

887
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,293
[TV host] It sounds like
KNS has been functioning

888
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,003
as the group's private broadcaster.

889
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,588
How long has this been going on?

890
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,048
[Jongu] According to
our background research,

891
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,967
President Koo has been linked to
the Hanju Group for some time.

892
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,553
Their relationship
goes back a few decades.

893
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:17,264
The late Chairman Cho Taesu's
team of executives…

894
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:19,808
Today, the case against Cho Jinman,

895
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:23,646
charged with murder, attempted murder,
unlawful imprisonment, human trafficking,

896
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,564
and defacing and concealing a corpse,

897
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,234
has been officially referred
to the Prosecutors' Office

898
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:29,318
for further legal proceedings.

899
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,028
[news anchor 1] In the meantime,
a warrant for the arrest

900
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,114
of Police Station Chief Kim Gyenam
and his accomplices,

901
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,824
who played a part in concealing evidence,

902
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:39,370
has been issued following
revelations of Cho Haewon's murder.

903
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,248
[news anchor 2] The trial of former
KNS President Koo Hyeongtae,

904
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:44,875
who has been indicted on charges of
workplace misconduct

905
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:48,379
and violating the Protection of
Communications Secrets Act, opens today.

906
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,799
Meanwhile, a number of victims
have come forward with stories

907
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,344
of their sexual harassment
by the former president in the past.

908
00:50:55,970 --> 00:51:00,182
Many are speculating as to how
these allegations will impact the trial.

909
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:14,989
[Soryong] Mm-hmm.

910
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:20,160
Thank you for coming all this way.
I'll be in touch.

911
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,330
-Here.
-Oh, you're here.

912
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,666
Oh, you didn't have to bring anything.

913
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,961
Hey… as our suffering father…

914
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,254
we gotta look out for you.

915
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,339
Thank you.

916
00:51:33,674 --> 00:51:34,675
[knocks]

917
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,678
-[Soryong] Oh, right.
-[Daeyong] Ah… appreciate it.

918
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,347
[trills] Money?

919
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,599
-[Soryong] Come on.
-[Daeyong laughs]

920
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:46,061
[trills] 30? That's cheap!
30. 30,000 won.

921
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,479
-Oh, no… Double?
-That's too little.

922
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,816
[indistinct chatter]

923
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,746
-[Jiyun] A little more, a little more.
-I've really been going through it lately.

924
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,336
-[Daeyong] Gosh.
-Hey, Daeyong.

925
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:12,296
At least he wasn't in pain.

926
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,422
Very true.

927
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,634
-Oh!
-Oh, hello, Mr. Son.

928
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,844
Please, I'm just the humble owner
of a teahouse now.

929
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,430
I have to say,
the name is "Tea and Me," right?

930
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,015
It sounds a little corny, doesn't it?

931
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,224
[both chuckle]

932
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:25,934
Did you really open a cafe?

933
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:27,853
-Well, you know.
-How'd you find time to visit?

934
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,937
Gotta keep busy.

935
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,856
Hey, I'm the managing director now.

936
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,234
You know, not even one of you
congratulated me on my big promotion.

937
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,487
Oh, come on,
we've all been busy, you know?

938
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,447
The Chanbyeol Act story, right?

939
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,698
[Ms. Hong] Why don't we throw a party,

940
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,408
-since we're all here?
-[Daeyong] Huh?

941
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:43,786
How's business been?

942
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,246
Well, if it isn't Mr. Son. [chuckles]

943
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,373
"You and Tea," right? Hmm?

944
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,124
-[Soryong] It's "Tea and Me."
-Oh, right. "Tea and Me."

945
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,335
By the way, that white shirt
looks great on you, Mr. Han.

946
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,545
Have you eaten yet? You want anything?

947
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:55,172
-[Jiyun] Oh, sure. Whatever's there.
-All right, great.

948
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,715
-[Moka] I'll bring something over.
-Oh, no, I'll go.

949
00:52:56,799 --> 00:52:58,175
-[Moka] Oh, uh… Wanna come with me?
-Oh no, just stay put.

950
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,094
Yeah, you guys should go together.
Go together.

951
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,220
[Daeyong chuckles]

952
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,013
-Hmm…
-Cuties.

953
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:05,516
[sighs] I guess they must still think
we don't know about them.

954
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,184
-[chuckles]
-[Jeongseok] They're a good match.

955
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,480
[Soryong] However, Mr. Jang's crimes
went much deeper than that.

956
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,233
He made his assistant producer
book motel rooms for him,

957
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,777
where he'd coerce
female extras and co-stars

958
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,445
into sleeping with him
in exchange for roles.

959
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,531
[mourner] Oh, my God,
I can't believe people like that exist!

960
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,116
That man is absolute trash.

961
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,575
[Soryong]
…also tasked with scouring the nation

962
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:27,037
for clinics that could provide abortions
for the women in secret.

963
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:28,997
[Jeongseok] So basically,
you were so upset

964
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,500
that you, uh, urinated on him in anger.

965
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,211
-[Jeongseok] Is that right?
-Yeah.

966
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,464
To be honest, peeing on him was just about

967
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,717
-all I could do at the time.
-[laughter]

968
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,010
[Han Do] Besides,
I didn't originally intend to pee on him.

969
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,387
Actually, Mr. Jang was the one
who kicked things off…

970
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,389
The blur isn't really hiding much, is it?

971
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,473
Oh, no, no, come on.

972
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,850
It's basically impossible
to tell it's you.

973
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,059
[Giho] You look great on camera.

974
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,229
Are you doing all right?

975
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,439
Heard your drama got canceled.

976
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,023
I'm not ready to quit.

977
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:57,401
I will be insisting on
writing what I want,

978
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,819
not dealing with that piece of…

979
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,780
-[deep breath]
-Ms. Hong, how noble of you.

980
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:03,949
Where'd this superhuman strength
come from?

981

Try raising a kid.

982
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,245
There's not a thing I won't do
to provide for her.

983
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:14,084
-[sighs]
-[Giho] Wow, you looked great.

984
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,794
[Giho] I mean… never mind…
That was you?

985
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,796
[laughter]

986
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,423
[Giho] It was super blurry.
No one will know.

-Feeling a little better?

989
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:25,679
I'm still worried about that face-blur.

990
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,349
-It looked like me?
-Yeah, of course it did.

991
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:30,768
[groans] I totally knew it. Man…

992
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:34,646
Wasn't that story
originally your assignment?

993
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,065
Lunatic Han, passing that up?

994
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:38,734
Someone once told me

995
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,237
to keep my personal vendettas
out of our episodes, is why.

996
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,616
May I ask you something?

997
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,829
Why'd you make that post about
the cheating couple on the Trigger staff?

998
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,789
You know it was none of your business.

999
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,252
I felt betrayed.

[♪ gentle music playing]

1001
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,930
[Han Do] I guess, after working
for the network for some time,

1002
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:11,058
I came to hold Trigger
to a higher standard,

1003
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,351
and I expected better from them.

1004
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,269
[Sangmok] Please just give me more time.

1005
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:17,189
I'll tell my wife I'm divorcing her.
I'll do it today, please!

Please, just give me a little…

-[Sangmok] Damn it.

00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,405
Damn it! Shit!

And I couldn't accept that you guys,

1012
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,170
of all people, had let me down.

Okay, so?

00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,181
Who was the other woman then?

You wanna know?

1017
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,940
[sighs] I guess not.

[deep breath]

1019
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,906
Mind if I also ask you a question?

1020
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:12,119
Why do you exclusively date
total scumbags?

00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,376
[Soryong] Uh… [chuckles]

1023
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:22,838
[sighs] I guess…

00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,593
with men who…

1025
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:29,303
claim to like me, I don't turn them down.

I suppose I just say, "Why not?"

Someone opens their heart…

Whoa, what are you doing?

Let's try the other way around.

1034
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:52,409
Tell someone you like him first.

1035
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,539
[Han Do] Wouldn't be the first time
you came at someone without warning.

1036
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,042
And if you did, well…

1037
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,088
I might start trusting again.

00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:29,321
You two dating?

1040
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:30,822
No. No way.

1041
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,533
Is something wrong?

1042
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:38,330
[♪ ominous sting]

1043
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,753
[Giho] So this was discovered
at Cho Jinman's house?

1044
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,797
An anonymous trust or something?

1045
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,550
Something smelled fishy,

1046
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,135
so I did some digging.

1047
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,720
[Detective Yu] And it turns out

1048
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:57,933
an enormous sum of money from Hanju
went into this account.

1049
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,477
-When did this happen?
-[Detective Yu] Exactly.

1050
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,229
The date's what matters here.

1051
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:04,022
It was deposited

1052
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:05,816
the day before Cho Haewon's death.

1053
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,902

1054
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,408
The autopsy… never happened.

1055
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,911
[sharp exhale]

1056
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,288
Does that mean…

1057
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,671
Cho Haewon…

1058
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:30,090
is still alive.
