00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,721
This way. Come on.

2
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,222
Where are we going?

3
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,053
Haven of Faith, Number 7

00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,066

She pulled another all-nighter.

9
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,128
Trigger, Investigative journalism.

10
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,131
I've been robbed…
robbed of my son.

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,717
- Huh?
- They burned up my son.

12
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,346
Those Haven of Trust people did it.
His body is in ashes!

13
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,515
- Did you say Haven of Trust?
- Jeongnam!

14
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,601
How could they…
how could they do that to my baby?

15
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,437
We had no idea
those documents were forged either.

16
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,022
A forged birth certificate?

17
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,482
- Ma'am, please.
- Jeongnam!

18
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,400
- Hello?
- I need you to calm down…

19
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,486
- Ma'am. Ma'am!
- Give me back my son!

20
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,197
Excuse me, repeat that for me, ma'am,
if you could, please.

21
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,740
Wait, hello?

22
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,369
You're here early.

23
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,496
It… It's moving day, isn't it?

24
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,210
I was hoping to wrap up my edit
before shipping it to the director…

25
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,424
In This Beautiful World Of Ours

26
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,844
That idiot Jeongnam
drank himself to death,

27
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,928
the hell could I do?

28
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,179
Hold on a minute, pastor, come on.

29
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,765
Why don't you put the gun down
so we can talk this out?

30
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,726
Don't you take another step closer.

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,520
Do it and I'll shoot.

32
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,438
Hey, all of you! Cameras off!

33
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,523
Hey, hey, the cameras.

34
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,607
Put them down, guys.

35
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,734
Lower the cameras.
Turn them off and put them away.

36
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,820
Cameras are all gone.

37
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:34,946
That's how the man died.

38
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,239
It was his drinking…

39
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,699
…so we'll have them do an autopsy, huh?

40
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,659
While we're at it,
we could also check how the family--

41
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,119
I mean, the congregation's doing.

42
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,708
The guy's a nutcase.

43
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,836
Hello.

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,755
I wanted to introduce myself
with a present.

45
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:56,259
"Oh Soryong"? Who the hell are you?

46
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,886
I'm the team lead for Trigger.

47
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,220
Shame on you all!

48
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,806
Men answering to this godless jezebel.

49
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,766
Hey, I'm no ordinary jezebel.

50
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,476
Happened to hear

51
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,563
about last night's hasty cremation
and document forgery.

52
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,565
It was cremated? So there's no body?

53
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,484
What? Were you afraid
an autopsy would reveal traces

54
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,236
-of Halloween?
-You talking about drugs?

55
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,197
So you do know the zombie drug.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,489
One shot of Halloween

57
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,575
destroys your veins
and causes skin necrosis,

58
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,327
which leaves us something like this.

59
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,745
Also, how does a right-handed man

60
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,955
inject himself over and over
just in his right arm?

61
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,707
Didn't you hear what the cops said?

62
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,251
He was drunk!
It was all the booze that killed him!

63
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,129
The blood-alcohol content
at time of death was below .038.

64
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,841
Most likely a by-product of decomposition
and can't serve as evidence of drinking.

65
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,385
Lady, you're not God.
How do you know what the kid did?

66
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,721
You think we need an autopsy to find out?

67
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,806
We're Trigger.

68
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,518
Here's a tox report
from Kim Jeongnam's blood sample

69
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,603
as taken at the scene,

70
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,105
and it says, "Lorazepam."

71
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,692
We've already confirmed that this sleep
medication is used here in Haven of Trust.

72
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,445
What's strange is all the other drugs
in his system as well.

73
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,989
Now how might someone

74
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,159
who never left the compound
shoot himself up with these new drugs?

75
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,162
So, pastor…

76
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,414
would you know?

77
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,042
He was born evil.

78
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,877
His spirit was unholy.

79
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,170
I'm the one who made--

80
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,172
-Why'd you kill my son?
-Whoa, whoa. Ma'am, hold on.

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,465
-Why?
-Hold on, ma'am, wait.

82
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,800
Did you forget dumping him here?

83
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,094
A little late to try and play
the "loving mother" act.

84
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,554
How dare you?

85
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,682
What? What? Tell me I'm wrong!

86
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,808
You know I'm right!

87
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,727
If you loved him so much,
you should've raised him yourself.

88
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,479
You sold him off because he was defective,

89
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,647
and you know it!

90
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,399
Whoa!

91
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:38,111
Jeongnam! Oh, my God, my son, Jeongnam!

92
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,240
Oh, my God,
my son, no!

93
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,494
You all have got some nerves
showing yourselves here.

94
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,580
Stop your whining.

95
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,294
You should be thanking me
for sending your son off to Heaven.

96
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,256
- Mister Lee!
- What's wrong? What is it?

97
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,258
Did you get shot?

98
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,260
I can't…

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,012
- breath.
- I'll call 911.

100
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,180
Call them fast! Lee Sangmok…

101
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,307
Whoa, sir!

102
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,599
- Officer, we have a man down.
- Breath, breath.

103
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,101
-Just try to breath.
-He's been shot!

104
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,853
We called a while ago. What took so long?

105
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,105
Trigger?

106
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,858
Get out of here.
No one's allowed on my property!

107
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,526
Hold it!

108
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,530
Why the fuck are you just standing there?

109
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,282
Why aren't you doing your damn jobs?

110
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,951
You should take this with you.

111
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,786
It's a gift, after all.

112
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,040
You sacrilegious little hussy!

113
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,086
Why don't you head inside?

114
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,589
I'll save you from a life of sin…

115
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,592
so you can never do this again.

116
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,719
That's it.

117
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:47,013
Woman, you got a death wish or something?

118
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,264
Whoa! No.

119
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,184
Whoa, hey! It's over, Ms. Oh.

120
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,525
-Just shoot.
-What?

121
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,818
It's a nice day out…

122
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,863
-so just shoot me.
-I'll really do it.

123
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,198
Do it. Go ahead!

124
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,867
-Hey, hey!
-Go ahead and shoot!

125
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,869
Go ahead and shoot! Do it!

126
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,246
-Ms. Oh!
-I am the son of God!

127
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,959
- Let go of her, you bastard!
- Shoot me!

128
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,961
- Pull the trigger!
- Let her go!

129
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,465
That producer at Trigger,

130
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,342
a known hunter of the corrupt.

The naked truth

the hero they say she is, or…

133
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,599
is she a two-faced villain?

Dr. Trigger

138
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,693
Another politician
from a "royal" background

139
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,279
has been elected
in this National Assembly Election.

140
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,198
Assemblyman-elect Cho Jinman…

141
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,659
…the son of Chairman Cho Taesu
of Hanju Group,

142
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,035
won his seat last week.

143
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,662
The election remained close
throughout the night,

144
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,247
with Assemblyman Cho ultimately--

145
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,375
Lee Sangmok, how's it going?

146
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,173
Looking good. You've got guts.

147
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,342
You can still finish the episode.

148
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,971
You can't be serious right now.

149
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,557
I'm injured. I can't work.

150
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,641
Hey.

151
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,686
They pointed a shotgun at us,

152
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,689
and then the cops say if we show up again,
we get a restraining order.

153
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,607
They're supposed to protect us,

154
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,359
-not the Haven of Trust.
-My point exactly.

155
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,029
Why even bother with these stories?

156
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,781
-This is a fucked up world…
-"Fu…"

157
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,325
Let's use "forked up", huh?

158
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,661
You should be proud of your work.

159
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,705
You exposed Pastor Kim, that's great.

160
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,417
Your sense of duty is inspiring.

161
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,504
After two weeks, I reached my limit.

162
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,591
I haven't been home at all.

163
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,385
I can't remember
the last time I changed my socks.

164
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,763
And I've failed.

165
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,056
I can get us in, I figured it out.

166
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,725
Great, do it yourself.

167
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,809
Yeah.

168
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,936
'Cause I'm resigning.

169
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,355
Yoon said that yesterday.

170
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,065
You taking turns with him or something?

171
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,861
Goddamnit,
don't you ever get sick of this?

172
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,155
With every story I do,

173
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,158
I get more fear and more hate
for this terrible world of ours.

174
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,284
How?

175
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,787
How do you stay so optimistic
through all this?

176
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,040
We're both in the same line of work,
how do you do it?

177
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,542
That's what pisses me off the most.

178
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,800
Is he injured that bad?

179
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,885
Uh…

180
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,429
Ms. Oh, can we step outside?

181
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,269
Seriously?

182
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,397
I mean, did you not hear about the post
on the Trigger forums?

183
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,358
I got to plan a business trip, got hauled

184
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,069
by my hair to fill out forms
for the cops, so, no, I did not.

185
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,404
Is it because he just had that kid?

186
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,281
Like postpartum depression or something?

187
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,242
Uh… that kid is like three years old.

188
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,077
It's a panic disorder. Look at this.

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,162
The servers crashed
right after this was posted

190
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,497
and once they came back up,

191
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,748
the post was gone.

192
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,166
It's fake news and it's hack.

193
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,961
We're too much of a big ugly family
for an affair.

194
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,505
This isn't a joke,
the tabloids are running wild.

195
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,383
So we let them run.
That's no reason for him to go off on me.

196
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,303
He's the one
supposedly cheating on his wife.

197
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,222
"It has to be Lee.
I've seen him hit on writers."

198
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,351
It's just a bunch of trolls
looking for attention.

199
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,937
I'm sorry, but how is an investigative
journalist falling for this?

200
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,021
What if it did happen?

201
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,357
Ah, hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

202
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:28,442
-You're not going to ask him, right?
-Of course.

203
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,069
We always fact check with the source.

204
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,988
-It's protocol.
-To hell with protocol.

205
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,115
-You know he's testy, come on.
-Stop being scared.

206
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,660
Have the guts to go in and get the facts
instead of talking behind the man's back.

207
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,913
He may be testy,
but his pride's what keeps him going.

208
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,039
An affair?

209
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,585
When he's ready to go back in the field,
shoot me a text.

210
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,302
Oh, my goodness. Everything's so shiny.

211
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,054
And they say they're in the red.

212
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,727
Creating an Honest World
KNS

213
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,397
Trigger: Firing the Bullet of Truth

214
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,529
Well, look who it is.

215
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,325
If it isn't dear Ms. Oh Soryong,
our country's own protector of justice.

216
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,665
Hey, Lee Sangmok!

217
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,380
How about that cheater who resigned, huh?

218
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,300
I heard the editing room was his spot.

219
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,177
Poor guy must've been stressed.

220
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,762
You should get your people into yoga.

221
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,305
You ride them too hard.

222
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,641
Ride them how? Are they bicycles?

223
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,603
You haven't changed a bit, have you, sir?

224
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,897
Still learning the meaning of respect,
I see.

225
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,774
You can get in trouble for that nowadays.

226
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,609
Why don't you speak for yourself.

227
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,986
You're a disobedient one.

228
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,696
-Ain't that right?
-Is it?

229
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,034
I heard about the singer
you got dirt on, some has-been.

230
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,662
He is not just a has-been.
It's Cha Seongwook.

231
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,622
And what dirt? I'm no muckraker.

232
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,917
Aren't you concerned? Or you fearless?

233
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,962
I learned a few things
from this amazing director in drama.

234
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,216
He happened to teach
this rookie producer fearlessness.

235
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,967
Oh…

236
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,471
They're replacing mister cheater

237
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,807
-with a real freak.
-Stop calling him a cheater!

238
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,601
Ah, should've gotten rid
of his ass long ago.

239
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,561
The benefit of being full-time, huh?

240
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,232
These pesky workplace laws…

241
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,651
they're pretty fucked up.

242
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,153
What do you think?

243
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,574
Man, I wish
I could do it in the edit bay.

244
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,037
This thing was on the whole time,
oh, my goodness. It's a habit.

245
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,758
I called you hours ago.

246
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,261
You go to the old office or something?

247
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:02,763
Getting my things.

248
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,974
So you haven't seen
your new office at all?

249
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,308
Why? Is it…

250
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,227
Mid Century Modern?

251
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,646
Have I not made myself clear
to stop working so much

252
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,231
and help your team out, huh?

253
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,316
Your team's a mess
with their leader always

254
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,985
neglecting them for an investigation.

255
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,114
Is this about the affair?
My God, are you serious?

256
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,782
You know how Lee Sangmok is.

257
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,617
He doesn't have the balls
to cheat on his wife.

258
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,077
What's the matter with people?

259
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,662
Who'd screw that guy?

260
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,081
-No one.
-Well, why else would they say it?

261
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,959
Unless someone here's been making
the beast with two backs on the clock.

262
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,628
What's wrong with consenting adults
getting a little action?

263
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,255
-What?
-You know I'm right!

264
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,508
What's wrong with sex if it's not illegal?
Or an affair?

265
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,343
We know you guys do
some shady things in here.

266
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,512
-Oh, jeez, don't start with that.
-Can you really blame the guy

267
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,473
with his so-called family judging him?

268
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,557
I'd probably quit too.

269
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,186
I'll say it again.
I don't believe these stupid rumors.

270
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,022
How do you believe something
with no proof, huh?

271
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,732
Good for you. That's great.

272
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,985
Here. Courtesy of the president's office.

273
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,696
Hmph. After slashing our budget… bananas.

274
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,281
It's a yellow card.

275
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,408
You'll be out
if you don't quit smearing the guy.

276
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,910
Mr. Condom?

277
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,162
He knows a lot about smearing things,
I'm sure.

278
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,499
That Dr. Trigger post…

279
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,375
Did KNS delete that?

280
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,920
Apparently,
the original poster removed it.

281
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,004
The IP was somewhere in Ghana.

282
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,172
What did I say?

283
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,174
It's just somebody fishing for a reaction.

284
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,763
Oh, um… I heard we're getting
some guy from soaps.

285
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,556
That scumbag Jang told me

286
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,266
you're getting a guy that's a total freak.

287
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,727
He seems to have it easy though.

288
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,437
It's easier being shameless.

289
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,940
Apparently, he applied
to Animal Paradise first.

290
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,817
He's a bit too old to be a rookie.

291
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,820
Han Do, Born in 1990

292
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,029
So he is.

293
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,865
But why the Animal Paradise job?

294
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,492
Well, I'll tell you why.

295
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:51,956
Humans are hopeless.

296
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,707
He said those exact words

297
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,793
-to the general manager's face?
-He probably won't work.

298
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,878
Way to go. Love that.

299
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,298
According to his résumé,
he won some film award or something.

300
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,383
"Post Mise-en-scène Film Festival,
Audience award"

301
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,927
Great credentials and still ends up
at Current Affairs,

302
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,264
must have pissed someone off pretty good,
or… he screwed up royally.

303
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,474
-Wouldn't you guess?
-Exactly.

304
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,351
We've got no manpower with Lee out.

305
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,895
There's not much of a choice
for a manager to make here.

306
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,981
He's the best you've got.

307
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,025
Well, I'd say it's a chief's job
to get a little leverage over the bosses.

308
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,986
Your chief stuff's pissing me off,
all right?

309
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,195
What about tomorrow's episode?

310
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,989
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm doing it, of course.

311
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,032
-Why even bother asking?
-Our director's resigned

312
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,284
and we got no hook.

313
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,452
If you air this episode
and we haven't got a kill shot

314
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,454
-then our ratings not only--
-I know, I know, our ratings drop

315
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,706
and then we've got lawsuits.

316
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,375
-It pisses me off more than you know.
-In the show's long history,

317
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,294
we've never canceled an episode. Ever.

318
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,004
-You know this.
-You know I've never backed down

319
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,088
from anything.

320
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,012
Oh, and uh…

321
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,015
our "hopeless humans" rookie,
he'll be dropping in to meet the team

322
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,808
before his official start.

323
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,311
Can you just, for once in you life,
not make him run for the door?

324
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,271
I'm as nice as they make 'em.

325
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,642
Delivery Request

326
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,893
Decline

327
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,328
Jo Mingeun, if you keep missing tutoring,

328
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,829
you'll end up like this man.

329
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,126
Smacking on candy, delivering stuff,

330
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,295
like he's proud of what he does.

331
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,927
You plant poop, that's what you'll get.

332
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,429
You never heard that one before?

333
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,516
Don't sling poop or you'll end up

334
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,768
-like your poopy mom. Here.
-Oh, my go…

335
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,520
Good luck pooping.

336
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,605
Don't be a poopy head.

337
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,607
And now, I'm pooping out of here.

338
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,192
That man's a lunatic!

339
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,611
That's it,
I'm posting this guy's picture online.

340
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,741
Whoa, hey, Mingeun, wait for me.

341
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,076
Let's walk together.

342
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,708
Sorry, guys.

343
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,751
Not sure there's room.

344
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,461
Can you hit five for me? Thanks.

345
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,672
Whoa, you're Oh Soryong, right?

346
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,424
I'm such a huge fan of your show.

347
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,384
- Real big fan.
- Oh, I appreciate it.

348
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,263
But, by the way,
that rumor going around…

349
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:57,474
that affair. Is it true?

350
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,810
Can you just hit five?
I got my hands full here.

351
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,316
Why is the basement "one half"?

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,901
They should have just picked a number.

353
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,111
I mean, commit, you know?

354
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,407
KNS
Current Affairs Department

355
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,784
A man can't enjoy a lollipop?

356
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,838
-Thank you.
-Sure.

357
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,474
Animal Paradise

358
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,235
Yup.

359
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,906
You guys are just better.

360
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,373
This is the Amazing Animal Paradise,
isn't it?

361
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,043
Yeah, it is, but this isn't
where you're assigned.

362
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,211
Excuse me.

363
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,339
What happened to our office?

364
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,300
Isn't this Current Affairs?

365
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,219
Ah, I guess nobody told you.

366
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,806
The president told us
to move in here this morning.

367
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,265
Wait, the president…

368
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,811
All right, look,
my name is Han Do

369
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,188
and if you would just check
with HR again…

370
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,981
- Soaps guy?
- Uh… Huh?

371
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,067
You're not here.

372
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,111
Trigger's this way.

373
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,699
-Is that right?
-Uh-huh.

374
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,910
But why am I…

375
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,747
You're with us.

376
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,791
And where'd my office move to?

377
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,277
Trigger

378
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,658
- This is too crazy.
- The dog! The dog! The dog!

379
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,034
Get the dog!

380
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,579
Oh, hi Ms. Oh!

381
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,372
Are you kidding me?

382
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,332
- You can't be serious.
- No, no, no, no, don't eat that.

383
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,501
We're neck-deep in work right now, okay?

384
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,671
I'm sending this dog up the elevator
with a pile of crap, you hear me?

385
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,548
I'm not kidding! I'll do it.

386
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,216
Whoa, wait! Hold on, oh, God.

387
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,761
-What on earth?
-The Animal Paradise guys

388
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,430
rescued 200 dogs.

389
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,682
Then one just happened
to have a litter of puppies,

390
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,143
which is why we've taken
this guy on temporarily.

391
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,394
But why us?

392
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,188
Giho and Ha are out working on a story,

393
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,149
our forums are blowing up,
and there's no sign of the new guy.

394
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,318
They're treating us like we're maids.

395
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,196
I almost broke my back
just lugging all this stuff down here.

396
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,363
Koo Hyeongtae, that good-for-nothing…

397
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,324
Wait, you can't go up there.
Not to the president.

398
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,201
Are you out of your mind?

399
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,119
I know, sweetie,
you're important or whatever

400
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,454
but he's the president.

401
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,331
I don't care if he's the president,
he should know!

402
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,291
We haven't done anything wrong here.

403
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,459
I'm going upstairs.

404
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,461
Oh, sweetie, you're getting a call.

405
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,258
- Hey.
- Hey, Ms. Oh.

406
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,135
It's an emergency, it's a red alert.

407
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,387
- Whoa, wait, wait, wait,
- Hey, look, it's Pastor Kim, right?

408
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,931
- Sports car?
- Huh? It is, yeah.

409
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,057
Get down, get down.

410
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,059
Ms. Oh,
Pastor Kim's on his way out right now,

411
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,145
but the real problem is
these tour buses that keep driving in.

412
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,355
Ooh! There's another one.

413
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,564
Oh, duck!

414
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,149
Ms. Oh, right now,

415
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,818
uh, a van and two tour buses
are going up the hill.

416
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,820
What if those people drop dead tonight?

417
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,948
- Then we close in!
- Huh?

418
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,574
We strike, it's time to go.

419
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,117
Today. Lee's out,

420
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,662
so we infiltrate
and get the footage that we need.

421
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,081
I'm going to Yongpyeong,
you stay right where you are.

422
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,165
Wait, whoa… listen.

423
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,584
I'm… I'm not able to do
anything dangerous today, I'm serious.

424
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,254
I still haven't totally healed
from that rib injury that I got.

425
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,755
Hello?

426
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,258
Seriously? Damn it.

427
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,342
What'd she say?

428
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,135
-She's on her way over now.
-Right now?

429
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,638
Call the others.
I got to get back to Yongpyeong.

430
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,683
Ah, but don't call anyone
who's out of town.

431
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,268
And get Seo for me.

432
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,937
We need everyone if we're gonna finish
this episode by tomorrow.

433
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,315
Go interview the M.E.
who did the autopsy on Kim Jeongnam.

434
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,483
We have to get that.

435
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,985
But what's the use without Sangmok?

436
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,028
Tell the world we're canceling an episode

437
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,738
for the first time
because the director ran away?

438
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,324
Why not?
We're already at rock bottom, aren't we?

439
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,619
I mean, what do you think you can do
without a director?

440
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,330
Well, I'm not alone. Got my rookie.

441
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,335
What? Come in.

442
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,435
He transferred from Soap Operas.

443
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,561
Your name?

444
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,354
Sorry, but I think you're mistaken.

445
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,690
I'm not the person--

446
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,985
-Oh, what are you doing?
-Formally onboarding you.

447
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,612
Effective immediately.

448
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,364
What kind of onboarding is--

449
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,450
It's a new fad
with Gen Z couples these days.

450
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,244
It's a gift.
Now, now, don't try to run away.

451
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,829
You're gonna help us out, okay?

452
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,539
Hmm? We need you.

453
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,499
I thought we'd do your welcome party

454
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,209
-outside in the sun.
-What--

455
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,337
Do you like extreme sports, by chance?

456
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,299
When the heck is she getting here?

457
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,428
He… hey, what are you doing? Come on.

458
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,348
- Man, sure must be nice.
- What do you mean?

459
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,357
Wow, that looks fun.

460
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,233
- Wait a minute.
- That place is a fortress.

461
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,902
How's she getting in?

462
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,324
Where is the producer anyway?

463
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,910
Uh… descending from the air.

464
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,871
Hey, stop that.

465
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,373
Giho, pull it together.

466
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,597
Whoa!

467
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,260
Ms. Hong. Ms. Hong!

468
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,595
Ms. Hong. Get this.

469
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:51,805
Where are the dogs?

470
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,100
Oh, I took them back, no issues.
Whatever, guess what I found out.

471
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,601
You know the rookie from earlier?

472
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,604
I got a friend on the Drama staff
and they just told me what happened.

473
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,899
Well, they didn't personally witness it
but her brother's supervisor's friend did.

474
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:06,653
And you will not believe the reason
that he got canned from Soap Operas.

475
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,698
All right, so, uh…
I heard Han Do got fired…

476
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,908
'cause he peed on Jang.

477
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,869
-What?
-Maybe it was more like

478
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,621
he blasted him with urine.
An eruption of urine?

479
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,915
There was pee though.

480
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,834
You fucking asshole!

481
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,252
Watch where you're aiming!

482
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,713
- Ah, dammit, crazy fuck!
- He then went,

483
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,508
"You crazy bastard,
you fucking disgusting piss guy."

484
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,260
And then he just walked away.

485
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,387
Guess everyone thinks they're a writer now

486
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,972
-with these stories.
-This happened, I'm telling you.

487
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,308
There's no way
that if someone actually peed on Jang,

488
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,934
he would have just cursed and walked away.

489
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,937
Oh, so you know Mr. Jang? Seriously?

490
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,607
- Not very well, but Oh does.
- Oh Soryong?

491
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,984
Wait, you're saying
that Ms. Oh knows that man?

492
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,068
Sweetie,

493
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,738
take it from another writer,
if you want to keep your job here,

494
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,115
you got to learn to keep your mouth shut.

495
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,783
So quit worrying about all that

496
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,495
and make sure you find out
how things are going on Giho's end.

497
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,333
Okay, but do you think--

498
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,626
Got it.

499
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,470
You're crazy!

500
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,138
We've both got legs!

501
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,239
Crazy bitch.

502
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,075
The hell was she talking about?

503
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,410
Don't worry, don't help or anything.

504
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,704
God, I'm exhausted.

505
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,099
911?

506
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,227
Uh, I was out paragliding,
and I seem to have…

507
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,145
landed in the wrong spot.

508
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,397
Oh, this place?

509
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,607
I don't know.
It looks like a facility of some kind

510
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,942
but I don't know the exact--

511
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,443
Right, please hurry.

512
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,139
Haven of Faith, Number 13

513
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,515
This…

514
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,393
All this…

515
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,104
Who did this?

516
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,898
The pastor's wife.

517
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,568
-The pastor's wife?
-Mm-hmm.

518
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,280
Where are the others?

519
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,533
Are they here?
Where's everyone else?

520
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,885
Timer

521
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,470
Hey, rookie.

522
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,056
Hurry.

523
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,432
You lost your mind?

524
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,768
It's very important you stay with this guy
and hide somewhere.

525
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,936
Give me 30 minutes.
If help isn't here by then,

526
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,980
you hurry,
get out and call the police, okay?

527
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,733
Listen to me,
our assistant director's outside, Giho.

528
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,693
Let go!

529
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:37,572
Whatever you do, make sure
that this guy makes it out safely, okay?

530
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,240
Ugh, why am I doing this?

531
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,951
Here.

532
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,745
Ugh, as a last resort.

533
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,622
Okay, I'll take it then.

534
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,044
-Oh…
-Where are you--

535
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,046
Take this too.

536
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,550
You're guarding him.

537
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,386
Don't forget.

538
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,762
Wait, hey!

539
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,516
You kidding me? Jesus!

540
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,564
Can you tell me how to get out?

541
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,107
The exit…

542
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,027
The exit.

543
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,863
- Ex…
- I'm trying to get out.

544
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,990
The door.

545
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,159
Door.

546
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,661
Door.

547
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,581
Ah, ah…

548
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,336
Over there?

549
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,089
The exit. Is it… is it that way?

550
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,930
Oh, damn it. Whatever.

551
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,017
I can't help this dude if I die anyway.

552
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:34,022
I'll go outside and I'm calling the cops,
stay right here.

553
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,025
-Huh?
-Freeze game.

554
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,402
You act like ice till…

555
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,362
I touch you. Start the game.

556
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,198
Ah… ah…

557
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,282
Ice game!

558
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,707
Ah…

559
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,462
Freeze game.

560
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,441
Those who follow the voice…

561
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,623
Healing Through Faith

562
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,317
Ugh, where exactly
did he say the exit was?

563
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,536
Oh, God, this is the wrong direction.

564
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,466
Oh!

565
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,455
It's not human.

566
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,957
You're looking at a beast right here.

567
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,960
A crazed, worthless lowlife.

568
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,380
You're worth less than our crypto rigs.

569
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,471
We were 30 million
in the red last month.

570
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,389
How dare you doze off, huh?

571
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,393
These machines, they mine for us
though we feed them nothing.

572
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:18,853
But all you do is eat,

573
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,355
giving nothing in return.

574
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,523
You see how you're a parasite?

575
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,610
You got to do better than that
to enter the kingdom of faith!

576
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,153
Amen!

577
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,323
By the power of faith shall you rise!

578
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,869
So she's the mastermind.

579
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,498
And now for the mother
who raised her child to be a parasite!

580
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,583
You, get up here.

581
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,045
-Go on, go on.
-You need to be punished.

582
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,425
Goodness! I'm sorry.

583
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,387
I'm sorry, okay? Get up!

584
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,561
Now then, hit her 100 times.

585
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,108
- Hurry up and hit her!
- Hit her!

586
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,277
Hit her!

587
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,571
I guess you won't fully understand

588
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,616
unless I give you a punishment injection.

589
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,119
Hurry up and hit her!

590
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,663
Want me to show you how?

591
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,667
Mom!

592
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,507
Mom! Mom!

593
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,300
-It's because all of you…
-Please!

594
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,969
…are such disgraces

595
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:37,348
that those media sons of bitches
always look down on us!

596
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,945
What the hell is that?

597
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,197
Oh Soryong from Trigger!

598
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,034
What the hell do you think you're doing?

599
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,086
Get that bitch!

600
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,555
Get the outsider!

601
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,814
Stop chasing me!

602
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,650
Han! You hear me? Hey!

603
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,360
- Han Do!
- What the hell did you do?

604
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,995
Grab the traitor!

605
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,129
Hmph.

606
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,924
Ugh, what is going on?

607
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,175
Didn't she say half an hour?

608
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,135
Yeah, I thought so. What's going on?

609
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,887
Whoa, hold on.

610
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,055
Someone's coming.

611
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,264
-Huh?
-Someone's coming.

612
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,185
Whoa, here they come!

613
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,686
- What's going on?
- Open the gate!

614
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,732
They're right behind us!

615
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,446
Get off her! Ms. Oh!

616
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,992
-Hey, Ms. Oh!
-Take this, Giho!

617
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,869
Let go! Get off!

618
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,082
Hey! Get off of him!
Get off of him!

619
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,418
-Let him go!
-Help me!

620
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,262
Hey, Giho!

621
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,514
- Take this! You ready?
- Whoa! Ms. Oh, no!

622
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,307
Kang Giho!

623
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,517
Giho!

624
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,437
I can't get the gate open!

625
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,912
Ms. Oh!

626
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,625
-Ms. Oh!
-Hey!

627
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,682
Freaking idiot!

628
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,171
Oh, shoot.

629
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,966
Whoa! Hey, hey, Ms. Oh!

630
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,719
-Ms. Oh! Ms. Oh! I'm sorry!
-Shit!

631
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,803
Ms. Oh!

632
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,722
It's the police.
The police, the police!

633
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,848
There's a person inside!
- Over here!

634
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,058
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- They're inside.

635
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,559
- They got our team leader!
- Hurry, damn it!

636
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,770
Open the gate!

637
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,915
Yongpyeong Police Station

638
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:34,210
Detective, uh, is this really going to go
on my permanent record?

639
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,004
It's hard enough being freelance.

640
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,133
-Zombies, you say?
-Kidnapping, illegal guns, assault.

641
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,761
She gives an order
and a bunch of her followers,

642
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,973
these enormous men, go and drag off
this woman acting like a zombie

643
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,641
like she was some wild forest creature.

644
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,519
-Right. And then?
-And then…

645
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,562
God, you're not listening.

646
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,147
I saw everything.

647
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,233
They're growing flowers
in their Haven of Trust.

648
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,527
I promise
they're opium poppies, detective.

649
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,571
It's to make Halloween.
You know about this new drug.

650
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,699
Officer.

651
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:09,120
This communist criminal trespassed
on our private property which is illegal.

652
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,247
As you can see, she has a wild imagination

653
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,748
and makes up horrific stories

654
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,833
-about what she saw.
-That's enough, lady.

655
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:14,959
You're the one lying your face off!

656
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,043
All right, all right,
let's, uh…

657
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,628
Let's see it then.

658
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,130
The evidence you took.

659
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,381
-The flower. Right?
-Oh…

660
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,050
Um, detective, the thing is…

661
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,469
-there's this coworker of mine, and--
-Oh, my God. Jesus Christ!

662
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,388
Pastor, what on…

663
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,519
How dare you treat
the son of God like this!

664
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,063
Oh, my God! Look at all this blood. Oh!

665
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,773
Ma'am.

666
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,817
He was caught in a motel
with a church member

667
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,861
and jumped out of the window.

668
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,696
Hurry up
and get him some clothes. Come on.

669
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,281
Your fucking dick.

670
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,158
-Are you an animal?
-Honey, uh, it's not how it looks.

671
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,076
- Okay?
- How many times have I told you

672
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,454
- to go to a hotel and not a motel…
- All right, that's enough.

673
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,205
Hey, hey, take him someplace else.

674
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,583
-Ma'am, please do that at home!
-You need to settle down.

675
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,585
Ugh, come on,
pastor, put that on.

676
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,919
What are you guys doing, huh?

677
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,088
Why are you wasting time?
Go search their compound.

678
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,424
We can't raid their compound
just 'cause we feel like it.

679
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,675
We need a warrant.

680
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,511
I'll be completely honest here
since no one's recording,

681
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,722
but do you know
how many times I've brought those two in?

682
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,599
We can try to book them,
but in this area,

683
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,143
the higher-ups just wave their hand
and they get out.

684
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,145
They're in with the prosecutor.

685
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,273
With many actually.

686
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:23,110
We're the ones working our asses off
so it annoy us more than anyone, okay?

687
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,613
And it's so embarrassing,
you wouldn't believe.

688
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,198
I'm telling you, it sucks.

689
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,077
So just… cut us some slack.

690
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,706
That's why we're doing
an episode on this story.

691
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,375
All you need's public opinion.

692
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,668
It'll force them at least
to make a little effort.

693
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:43,506
Come on. I'm ready.

694
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,716
Let's do this. What do you say?

695
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,930
You're seriously killing me.

696
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,723
Listen, I don't mind staying behind.

697
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,308
So let my guys go.

698
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,477
They got work to do.

699
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,940
All right, go.

700
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,067
-Thank you.
-Set this on my desk.

701
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,151
Okay.

702
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,530
The thing is,
if you have that flower on you,

703
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,781
you need to take it out now.

704
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,865
But you said…

705
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,370
Criminal Complaint Against Oh Soryong

706
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,664
Oh.

707
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,333
What are you doing?

708
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:20,876
Evidence.

709
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,586
-Huh?
-What?

710
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,798
-Oh, it's for our story.
-You want us to investigate or…

711
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,808
Just call if you need more from me.

712
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,269
Hey, where are you going?

713
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,895
I need you to give me that flower.

714
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,982
-Give it to him first though.
-Oh, that?

715
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,359
Oh…

716
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,449
-Yup, that's gone.
-Gone where?

717
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:54,994
Hey!

718
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,037
Oh, no, we should go.
I'll see you later, Ms. Oh.

719
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,665
Man, he actually lost it.

720
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,627
Come in.

721
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,341
What brings you here at this hour?

722
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,760
Proof of Jang Hakui's
verbal and physical abuse,

723
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,720
soliciting bribes, and sexual favors.

724
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,473
I thought after Jang,
I wouldn't wind up at Current Affairs.

725
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,392
We agreed! I chose the animals.

726
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,811
That's what I chose,
and that was the job--

727
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,021
That was the job.

728
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,232
We agreed, didn't we?

729
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,817
But you sent me to Trigger? Oh, go…

730
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,739
Today I was almost killed
just being at work.

731
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,366
You must have met Ms. Oh then.

732
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:18,953
So you know her?

733
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:24,083
You know back in the day,
Soryong and Jang actually used to date.

734
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,627
That was a long time ago.

735
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,963
It's all in the past now.

736
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:34,385
Okay so, wait, why are you telling me
about this now?

737
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,345
Ever since I was a reporter,

738
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:41,058
I've always hated those who hide behind
the facade of a nice title,

739
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:46,021
yet inside, they have filthy hearts,
they hide their true intentions.

740
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,817
I'm not sure what the point of this is.

741
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,569
Who knows?

742
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,738
You'll never get back at Jang

743
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,532
if you're all on your own.

744
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:58,033
Especially not with where you are.

745
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,702
I'm sure you know that.

746
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:05,457
Think of Trigger
basically as your time in purgatory.

747
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,752
A stop on the way to revenge.

748
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,474
You know I'm right.

749
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,813
I got dashcam footage from this morning
of these people shooting at me.

750
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,942
I'm sure you're aware,
that's attempted murder.

751
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,652
For now, let's use that to…

752
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:42,995
I'll keep them here
for the 48 hours I'm allowed to by law.

753
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,748
Do your episode, all right?

754
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,208
But you should know that if this fails…

755
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,210
not only will I have to turn in my badge

756
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,130
but they're going to go prey on
even more innocent folks.

757
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,882
This time, you'll get your warrant.

758
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,967
Bet on it.

759
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,352
Praise the Lord,

760
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,561
praise be to Jesus.

761
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,606
Let us all praise Jesus. Hallelujah!

762
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,571
Ms. Hong.

763
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,159
-Did you clean it?
-I did.

764
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,452
Alcohol swab and everything?

765
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,079
Huh?

766
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,914
Uh, no. I, uh…

767
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,625
I didn't wanna ruin it,
so I wiped it with a dry rag.

768
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,709
Ah…

769
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,505
Oh, Chief, please stop!
Come on and sit down!

770
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:37,424
-All your pacing is putting us on edge.
-How do you expect me to stay put?

771
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,635
You know what Soryong's like.

772
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,012
I'm worried
that the chief at that police station

773
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,223
will call to complain to President Koo.
What then?

774
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,351
You all let me know if something happens.

775
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,186
Ms. Hong, Ms. Hong, Ms. Hong.

776
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,439
Since you're checking the footage,
you mind sending it to the shared folder?

777
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,817
Looks like someone
doesn't want their hands dirty.

778
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,277
I'm okay
with getting my hands dirty, but I…

779
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,362
- Thank you.
- I swear to God

780
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,239
she only carries around
that phone of hers for show.

781
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:01,448
- Jesus Christ.
- Yes, Professor.

782
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,283
- I've reviewed the footage.
- Oh, right, right.

783
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,077
As for the plants in the field
where Ms. Oh landed,

784
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,496
those were definitely opium poppy plants.

785
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,957
It's illegal to grow them
without a permit in Korea.

786
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,417
I don't know how they've managed

787
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,710
-such a large operation.
-Oh.

788
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,379
-I sent you an email, so check it.
-Ah, right, thank you professor, yup.

789
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,964
I can never get through
to them in one call.

790
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,674
Chief, about that Haven of Trust place…

791
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,343
Haven of Trust? Yeah, right.
More like Haven of Drugs.

792
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:24,263
Whoa! M… Ms. Oh, are you all right?

793
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,933
Huh? I mean, I was worried sick
that you might not make it out of there.

794
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,309
Yeah, right,
I'm sure you were just worried

795
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,561
it'd go on your permanent record.

796
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,938
- How'd you get out without me calling?
- I walked out.

797
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,440
Hey, what were you thinking?

798
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,525
You put our rookie in a lot of danger.

799
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:37,651
Yeah, really.

800
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,486
The interview? The autopsy?

801
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,364
Apparently, the doctor
went to Vietnam for a conference.

802
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,283
Huh? So then…

803
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,367
We're gonna be okay.

804
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,911
He's gonna get the interview
from Vietnam in the morning.

805
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,748
-Nice.
-Can we really air this on time though?

806
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,124
Today's already here.

807
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,710
Well, uh, we got our writer

808
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,420
and everyone else, so why not?

809
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,548
You gonna cut it yourself?

810
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,759
Do… do you even know
where the edit bay is?

811
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,607
Huh?

812
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,734
It's our rookie.

813
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,902
- Ah.
- Looking rough.

814
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,036
Given the hour…

815
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,830
Are you coming in
or on your way home?

816
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:34,625
You don't need to answer that.

817
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:36,627
Just go back where you came from.

818
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:40,047
I was specific on what you were to do.

819
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,716
I said protect that kid or the flower

820
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,427
no matter what you had to do.

821
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,223
We are all bound by our sense of duty.

822
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,892
The work we do here is special.

823
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,228
We need people who understand duty.

824
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,146
No one's just passing the time here.

825
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,358
Everyone here works as a team,

826
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:01,109
if that's not you, there's the door.

827
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,486
You're not a good fit.

828
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,988
Hey, uh, why's she saying this?

829
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,241
Uh, just watch, you'll see.

830
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,493
It's funny, your talk about duty…

831
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,538
after you handcuffed me

832
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,207
and kidnapped me
on our very first day together.

833
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,503
An intellectually challenged young adult

834
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,256
makes his way
into the Kim's compound facility.

835
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,801
Less than a year later,
this young man's body is discovered

836
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,470
rotting on top of a toilet
in a public bathroom.

837
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,265
Somehow the police conclude
accidental death.

838
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,641
However…

839
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,063
the data we obtained,
after working our rear ends off

840
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,523
says otherwise.

841
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,610
It indicated a large amount of drugs
in his system did him in.

842
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,112
And someone else did it.

843
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,782
In order to know what happened,
we need an autopsy,

844
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,619
impossible at this point thanks to
scumbag Kim cremating the remains.

845
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,455
Regular people might just
scroll past a story like this

846
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,374
or be quick to hit the dislike button.

847
00:47:57,457 --> 00:48:00,085
It's the people
who do this work who risk our lives

848
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,170
to shed light on these wrongdoings.

849
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,214
There's no other way to put an end to it.

850
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,260
Other reasons? I don't have any.

851
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,304
It was an unjust death.

852
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,264
That's what it is.

853
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,519
Yeah, the pastor's the villain,
that part, of course, is obvious.

854
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:22,190
Though I don't know why risking our lives
is part of this kind of work

855
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,985
when there are
plenty of safer, less extreme ways

856
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:28,155
to get aerial surveillance
this being the 21st century.

857
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,909
Why? It's just so…

858
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,496
-outdated.
-What?

859
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:43,211
-"Outdated"?
-Outdated.

860
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,805
What?

861
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,933
What what?

862
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,231
Tell me what you would've done.

863
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,025
Tell me, rook.

864
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,154
You know what? Don't spoil it.

865
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,949
Kang Giho, set up a desk,
so the man can work.

866
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,911
I don't believe a smart rookie like you

867
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,455
could lose important evidence
just like that.

868
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,707
I don't buy it.

869
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,169
Wait, hey!

870
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,881
You were the backup.

871
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,508
But a crummy one.

872
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,388
For now, airing the episode
comes before anything,

873
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,555
so let's…

874
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:39,518
just… table this for now.

875
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,565
21st century.

876
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:47,359
Outdated.

877
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,582
Uh, so… this, uh…

878
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,293
This is, uh, the only spot we have left.

879
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,049
- Ch… Chief, why are you still here?
- Hey, you…

880
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,300
Yeah, you should probably

881
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,219
-clean, uh, clean this desk off.
-Oh, right.

882
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,471
Editing in progress

883
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,354
-Moka. We have another one?
-Yes. Yes.

884
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,523
- Let's check on Halloween purchases.
- Just a second.

885
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:29,359
Hey, Kang Giho! The interview footage.

886
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,445
-With the family of the deceased.
-Right, right! On it, on it!

887
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,032
-They didn't even read the email.
-Ugh, I'm not doing that.

888
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:36,908
- Done!
- You sent it?

889
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,368
- Yeah!
- Okay, okay.

890
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,080
Almost done.

891
00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:45,375
How far along are we?

892
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,585
-Here.
-There. Stop.

893
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,128
Okay. And that's a wrap.

894
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,005
-You did good.
-Eh.

895
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,798
-Clean up, then conference room.
-Yeah.

896
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,025
"Around 400 believers,

897
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,527
some of those children,
sent by their own parents."

898
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,782
A 21st century approach might work…

899
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,494
Probably.

900
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,414
Hey, is everything ready on set?

901
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,999
Yup, just give me one second.

902
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,209
Ms. Oh.

903
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,836
-We're all set.
-All right. Let's begin.

904
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,382
Title, standby.

905
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:36,134
Title, cue.

906
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,143
Counselor's Office

907
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:49,356
It says here…
you've found yourself with Trigger.

908
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,818
But… didn't you enjoy working on dramas?

909
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,576
I thought your love of work

910
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,454
was what kept you going
despite your struggles.

911
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,882
February 18th, Sunday

912
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,429
March 1st, Friday
Refuses to communicate

913
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,265
We request that the authorities conduct

914
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,392
a formal investigation into the Kim's

915
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,854
and render harsh justice to prevent
the deaths of any more innocents

916
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,230
like Kim Jeongnam.

917
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,481
"Please reach out if you have
information on the Haven of Faith"

918
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,609
Oh Soryong with Trigger,
a voice for all the voiceless,

919
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,820
we are their last resort.

920
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:37,946
Trigger: Firing the Bullet of Truth

921
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:40,949
Good job, everyone.

922
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,450
Good job.

923
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,994
Good work, people.

924
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,413
- This is my favorite song.
- Nice work tonight.

925
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,293
But, uh, where'd Soryong run off to

926
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,879
right after we finished
airing the episode?

927
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,631
Hey, rookie, you can go home.

928
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,383
Not like you have much to do here.

929
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,302
What?

930
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,429
We've got a ton of work.
He gets to go home?

931
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:06,183
- What else do we have left?
- Chief, you always discriminate.

932
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:09,394
I've been here for three years!
I've never gotten to go home on time!

933
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,151
I'm close friends
with your department chief, you punk.

934
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,154
How dare you even try to arrest me.

935
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,031
A flagrant civil rights violation,

936
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:24,159
and I will most definitely call
the main office for that.

937
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,246
Who the hell are you people?

938
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,749
What are you doing putting your hands
on a pastor, you prick?

939
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,959
-Now, now, now, hold on, hold on.
-Let me go. Damn it.

940
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,378
We're placing you both under arrest

941
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:38,256
for the production and distribution
of banned substances.

942
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,050
- Can you prove that?
- Of course we can.

943
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:45,430
Behold a 21st century device
that takes to the skies

944
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:49,267
collecting evidence from places
that humans can't go.

945
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,748
Didn't I tell you… that I would save you?

946
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,044
"Forgive us our sins

947
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,588
and lead us not into temptation…

948
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,467
but deliver us from evil."

949
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,390
Apologize to her.

950
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,269
Take them in.

951
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,395
Let go of me! Damn it!

952
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:36,398
Detective! I swear
I didn't know about this, okay?

953
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:39,276
I'll make sure you regret this day!

954
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,360
I'm innocent!

955
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,778
I don't know anything about that.

956
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,780
I'm innocent!

957
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,793
You Trigger guys are all right.

958
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,755
That was beautiful timing.

959
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,140
Cha Seongwook Disappearance Case

960
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,643
Today's Tip-off: New post from Dr. Trigger

961
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:26,698
Unfortunately,
the person you all killed

962
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,616
was an innocent civilian.

963
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:33,121
That is to say that the cheating
mafia member is still alive and well.

964
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,498
This leaves me with no choice

965
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,335
but to reveal the footage
taken on the day in question.

966

968
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:52,182
Going forward, make sure
that more innocents don't end up dead.

969
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,933
Take care.

970
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,422
Congratulations on
KNS' new building expansion and moving
