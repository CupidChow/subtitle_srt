1
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:08,925
Is that you in the nude photo?

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,802
Don't you think
you should step down as producer?

3
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,930
EP04: MIGHTY IS THE CAMERA

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,393
Are you having an affair
with the man in the photo?

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,020
Are you the Trigger employee
having an affair?

6
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,396
Who was that in the photo with you?

7
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,481
As the producer, any comments?

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,774
How are you feeling right now?

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,110
Anything you'd like to say
to all the Trigger fans out there?

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,611
Are you dating the guy
who took the photo?

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,947
Who on your team
was responsible for the leak?

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,924
I'm paying you back.

13
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,889
Let's get you inside.

14
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,685
What are your thoughts
on the Trigger controversies?

15
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,229
You're the showrunner,
we wanna hear from you!

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,487
Was that you in the leaked footage?

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,405
Don't you think it's your duty to resign?

18
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,865
Why are you putting me on trial?

19
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,411
As if the non-consensual photos
weren't enough…

20
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,915
now you want blood?

21
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,501
How is this any different
from what happened last night?

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,128
I do not give my consent.

23
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,299
You cannot use
a single one of these images.

24
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,744
Cho Haewon?

25
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,260
And now, our Focus Issue segment.

26
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,389
- Mr. Hwang.
- Thanks. So, four months ago,

27
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,017
Ms. Lee's attempted murder
of her own father shocked the public,

28
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,770
who dubbed it
the "Prosecutor's Member Massacre."

29
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,148
After the first hearing today,

30
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:32,443
the scene grew violent,
with protesters attacking Ms. Lee.

31
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,906
Oh, hey, uh, Yerim.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,076
Wanna head inside and finish our, uh,
conversation from earlier…

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,411
Goddamn it!

34
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:42,745
Hey. Hey!

35
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,331
I know it was you.

36
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,791
I know you posted those photos.

37
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,918
The ones with Soryong and all that.
Didn't you?

38
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,379
- And so what if it was?
- Jesus… are you insane?

39
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,881
You're totally out of control!

40
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,091
Yeah. Got me figured out.

41
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,845
'Cause who else but a crazy person

42
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,972
would sleep with a perv like you?

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,892
I had fun, I'll admit.

44
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,687
Our little role-play, where I pretended
to be Ms. Oh, was something new.

45
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,105
I'll just say…

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,273
I didn't post it.

47
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm not lying about that.

48
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,447
Oh, God, I made eye contact.

49
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,825
I mean,
what the hell was Ms. Oh thinking?

50
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,620
Seriously, I told her first thing,
not to come into work today.

51
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,246
Maybe she's gone insane from the shock.

52
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,165
I dunno, man, she's kind of a badass.

53
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,042
Yeah, but she still has feelings.

54
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,835
I mean, she's strong
but she's still a woman.

55
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,670
Come on now, Ms. Oh…

56
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,672
is someone who defies comprehension.

57
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,132
She transcends her chromosomes,

58
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,508
her mental fortitude's
on a whole nother level.

59
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,803
What does any woman see in that amoeba?

60
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,972
What's everyone doing here?

61
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,265
- Oh, God, ow, my leg!
- Hi, Ms. Oh!

62
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,934
They can see you, come here!

63
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,019
They're gone now.

64
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,229
They are?

65
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,649
Oh.

66
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,568
Hey.

67
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,903
What the hell were you thinking,

68
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,780
coming in today
after everything that just happened?

69
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,864
Are you nuts?

70
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,950
Believe me,
Cho Haewon is the reason I'm here.

71
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,368
Cho… Cho Haewon?

72
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,581
IT'S ME, CHO HAEWON.

73
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,666
LET'S MEET AT 10 A.M.

74
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,750
DON'T TELL ANYONE.

75
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:11,834
JUST THE TWO OF US.

76
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,004
Hey, didn't I say
to stop looking into Cha Seongwook?

77
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,840
Soryong, I have to side with him here.
It's too dangerous.

78
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,510
You know why you never hear
about the other producers

79
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,512
and journalists
who've gone after that woman?

80
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,514
It's because
every single one of them lost their jobs!

81
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,765
It's career suicide!

82
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,892
That was all long ago.

83
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,270
And if what you're saying is true,

84
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,605
then we're the show to take her on.

85
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,982
If anything, we should close in.

86
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,567
Oh, God, you really have gone insane! Huh?

87
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,403
How could I not,
given what I'm dealing with here?

88
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,535
SHOCKING NUDE PHOTO OF PRODUCER OH SORYONG

89
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,181
Pardon me?

90
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,021
Would you mind picking up that ring?

91
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,193
Why don't you get it yourself?

92
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:31,998
That's nice cologne.

93
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,167
Valein?

94
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,379
You always grope
strange men you don't know?

95
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,549
Or are you just jet-lagged?

96
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,260
It almost sounds like
you know my itinerary.

97
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,355
The hell are you doing?

98
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,121
Step outside, Mr. Han.

99
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,206
No, stay.

100
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,335
We'll be needing
an official witness anyway.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,964
Honey?

102
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,175
- Oh. Hello.
- Honey?

103
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,426
- My goodness. Ms. Choi!
- What are you doing here?

104
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,804
Whose plant is that?

105
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,555
This is urgent.

106
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,557
It's a confidentiality agreement

107
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,519
stating both parties agree
to an interview off the record.

108
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,065
Bad press can be a real drag.

109
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,236
Would you mind telling me why…

110
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,154
you wanted to see us?

111
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,324
I assumed the rumors
would've died down after 20 years.

112
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,951
That was a little naive.

113
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,829
There are still rumors
that I went into hiding,

114
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,330
that I got plastic surgery,

115
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,998
even that I killed myself.

116
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,418
People gossip.

117
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,336
That can be counted on, you know?

118
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,798
Aren't you wondering…

119
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,050
whether Cha Seongwook…

120
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,511
is still alive?

121
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,229
Haven't heard that name in a while.

122
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,191
You tell me, Ms. Oh.

123
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,112
Do you think he's alive?

124
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,366
The only thing I know for certain…

125
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,910
is that the last person
to see Cha Seongwook alive…

126
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,539
is sitting right in front of me
and she's alive and well.

127
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,254
As I'm sure you know,
the night that he vanished,

128
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,256
Mr. Cha was a VIP guest

129
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,216
for the premiere of his first film.

130
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,515
{\an8}FEBRUARY 10TH, 2004 9:37 P.M.

131
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,600
{\an8}That night…

132
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,769
…you contacted him, didn't you?

133
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:00,897
CHO HAEWON: SEE YOU AT YOUR PLACE.

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,064
I'LL BE THERE AROUND 11:30.

135
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,238
FEBRUARY 11TH, 2004. 4:44 A.M.

136
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,205
You were the last person
who saw Mr. Cha Seongwook alive.

137
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,209
After that night,
he wasn't heard from again.

138
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,503
Can you tell me more?

139
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,922
What did you two discuss?

140
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,010
I'm not here to be interrogated.

141
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,054
I came to give a tip.

142
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,181
A tip?

143
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,144
Can I ask if you're married?

144
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,897
- I'm not.
- Not you.

145
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,942
I meant you, Mr. Han.

146
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,239
Why don't you finish what you were saying?

147
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,115
The tip you're here to report?

148
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,161
After I raised my own child,

149
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
I couldn't help but feel bad
for Seongwook's father.

150
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,794
Not knowing whether his only son was alive
must've been unbearable.

151
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,548
That's why I decided
to come clean about a secret.

152
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,133
One I'd planned to keep forever.

153
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,221
By secret, you mean…

154
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,600
That night, someone came to see him
before I did.

155
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,853
A woman with burgundy nails,

156
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,356
who reeked of this perfume called "Reine."

157
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,153
Who the hell was that woman?

158
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,446
Look at me… Just look at me!

159
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,783
Come on,
why are you being like this?

160
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,076
How could you?

161
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,078
You have a burner phone?
What, so you could call her?

162
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,580
- I told you, it's not like that!
- Give it!

163
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,834
After I found out, all I did…

164
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,086
was pack up my luggage and leave.

165
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,132
According to the police reports,

166
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,925
you were the only woman

167
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,178
on the CCTV footage
in the apartment that night.

168
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,347
You don't really believe everything

169
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,766
that came out of that sham investigation,
do you?

170
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,940
Okay.

171
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,902
Do you remember… anything about her face?

172
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,613
Any features stand out?

173
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,323
I only know she was tall and thin.

174
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,367
My biggest regret to this day…

175
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,078
I didn't pull her hat off
to get a look at her face.

176
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,213
Anyway, that's all I had to tell you.

177
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,425
Why tell us now?

178
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,345
You would've had more to gain…

179
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,973
by coming clean about all this back then.

180
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,560
You've never been in love, huh?

181
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,733
You see, I loved that man so much
I would've died for him.

182
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,780
I wanted to protect him

183
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,574
even if it ruined me.

184
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,084
See you around.

185
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:30,523
Goodbye.

186
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,610
Oh, what the…?

187
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,778
You look hot!

188
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,530
Man, I can't believe
what a haircut can do!

189
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,781
What were you doing out there?

190
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,366
Oh, I was filming.

191
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,661
Everything from the lobby to the hallway,
I've got it all on tape!

192
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,870
Tch. What do we do?

193
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,039
We already signed off on her NDA.

194
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,708
That explains her confidence.

195
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,669
Who is this guy, Cha Seongwook?

196
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,296
You used to produce soaps,
how have you not heard of Cha Seongwook?

197
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,381
Let's put it this way.

198
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,509
His debut was essentially
the film industry equivalent

199
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,595
of Ronaldo's Man U debut in '03.

200
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,889
He managed
to catapult to stardom as a model

201
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,225
and then get a starring role
in just one year.

202
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,685
And right when he was blowing up,

203
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:11,188
all of a sudden, overnight, he disappears.

204
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,065
But even though he vanished into thin air,

205
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,985
his movie was a big hit
and stayed in theaters for a while.

206
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,779
I think the case would've closed
if his agency hadn't covered it up.

207
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,823
The police began their investigation,

208
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,950
and then his agency came out and said

209
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:26,120
that Seongwook had been dating
this art school student.

210
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,998
However, it turned out
that this mystery student

211
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,709
was so much more
than just some pretty girl.

212
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,377
She had a surprising background.

213
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,545
By background, you mean…

214
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,631
The Hanju Group,
the famous media conglomerate

215
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,259
that's said to be
more powerful than Samsung.

216
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,763
Haewon's the daughter of Cho Tessu,
Hanju's chairman.

217
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,474
I should ask…

218
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,350
you're on this case together?

219
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,398
If not, then this conversation is over.

220
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,112
I really don't understand this.

221
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,072
She was accused of murder,

222
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,449
but the body was never recovered,

223
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,326
lucky for her,
so she went underground.

224
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,452
Why come back now?

225
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,954
Maybe she heard
that we were snooping around.

226
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,749
Listen, there's a motive here,
there has to be.

227
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,917
What's the trigger?

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,084
What set this in motion?

229
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,130
- Oh Soryong?
- Oh Soryo…

230
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,675
- Ms. Oh, wait! Ms. Oh!
- Hmm?

231
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,514
Hey, where is she?

232
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,808
I'm not allowed to go in there.

233
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
You're fighting again?

234
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,233
What's this about?

235
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,029
Oh…

236
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,621
Ms. Hong, thank you.

237
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,289
I'll get this cleaned
and delivered to you.

238
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,374
No need for that.

239
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:56,126
Considering all the free consultations
you've given us.

240
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,920
I should've stayed with the firm.

241
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,755
Serves me right, trying to save the world.

242
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,340
A public defender.

243
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,925
Look at me now.

244
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,844
All because of that bastard.

245
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,637
I used to think
saving the world would be glamorous.

246
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,056
What's with all these boxes?

247
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,975
You remember Lee Yumi?

248
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,978
She stabbed her lawyer father
around four months ago?

249
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:17,022
I've been working so hard on this case,
I haven't even had time to pump.

250
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,983
But to make things worse,

251
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,901
the prosecutor wants 18 years.

252
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,696
Her shitty father didn't even die,

253
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,281
and they wanna charge her with murder?

254
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,867
I heard she didn't just stab him…

255
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,119
she completely severed his penis.

256
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,454
The bastard…

257
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,875
had been raping his daughter
since she was six years old.

258
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,128
It went on for the past 14 years.

259
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,046
The monster had it coming.

260
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,841
This is precisely
what discretionary mitigation is for.

261
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,927
What kind of animal
rapes his own daughter,

262
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,512
films himself doing it,

263
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,266
and then makes her recreate the sex acts
for a photo album?

264
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,895
And he made his wife, her mother,
watch all of it.

265
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,190
And this whole time,
Yumi never went to the authorities?

266
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,734
She did.

267
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,569
Around 13…

268
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:05,946
she went to the precinct

269
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,656
and showed them her underwear
with his semen.

270
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,158
Thank you, detective.

271
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,621
Anyways, let me apologize once more
for all the trouble she's caused you.

272
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,539
Yeah, yeah. All right, good.

273
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,874
Yup. Let's do dinner.

274
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,210
Right, you have a nice day. Mm-hmm.

275
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,344
Mom's gonna die
if you keep doing this!

276
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:32,348
Please, don't! Please, stop!

277
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,392
Stop it!

278
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,443
Yumi.

279
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,739
You remember… your mother…

280
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,327
I chopped out her tongue
for doing what you did, didn't I?

281
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,581
Daddy's a prosecutor.

282
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,626
Don't try to make him the bad guy.

283
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,544
Got it?

284
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,759
The pig's a high-powered lawyer,

285
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,428
so the prosecution's hard at work
trying to cover for him,

286
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,681
and some of their claims
are outright disgusting.

287
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,975
How dare the media release
this kind of garbage?

288
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,560
You guys had good coverage.

289
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,312
Probably since you're a public network.

290
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,397
This one shared our perspective.

291
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,773
PROSECUTOR CASTRATED BY DAUGHTER:
WHY SHE HAD TO DO IT

292
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:24,066
WRITTEN BY HWANG JINWOO

293
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,528
It seems the pen is useless here.

294
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,364
The camera might prove more powerful.

295
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,410
Help me. Please.

296
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,624
But does Lee Yumi… want us to cover this?

297
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,420
There's the problem.

298
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,423
The moment she learned that her father,
whom she'd thought to be dead,

299
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,507
was still alive,

300
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,633
she just shut down.

301
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,884
She's barely said a word.

302
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,177
Sounds like she's afraid.

303
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,304
An old fear response is kicking in.

304
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,223
She's saying she wants the death sentence.

305
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,350
This is why I need you.

306
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,311
I want you
to try convincing her otherwise.

307
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,855
You're experienced.

308
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,440
I'm sure you could persuade her.

309
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,070
If I help… will you two make up?

310
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,114
I don't know what went on
between you and your husband,

311
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,616
but he's getting a little hard to look at.

312
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,785
So you're protecting your own.

313
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,288
You people at Trigger,
you're just like the rest of them.

314
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,207
I guess I'll go it alone,
working till my boobs explode.

315
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,292
Fine. Fine!

316
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,962
Anyway, I'm sure you're busy!

317
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,442
You've lost more weight.

318
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,693
I told you, you need to eat.

319
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,195
You're looking even worse.

320
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,032
Ms. Oh here…

321
00:17:55,532 --> 00:18:00,037
has kindly offered to help us out
in building your case.

322
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,997
She's a TV producer.

323
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,127
Ms. Yumi.

324
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,550
Ms. Yumi.

325
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,514
There's something
I wanted your advice about.

326
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,186
This stupid bastard took nude photos of me
and posted them online.

327
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,646
Called me a home-wrecker.

328
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,898
I don't know
who made the forum post, but…

329
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,193
I know exactly who took the photos
while I slept.

330
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,530
It was my boyfriend.

331
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,992
I consider myself pretty brave,

332
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,703
but when it comes to this kind of thing…

333
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,582
I'm just at a loss for what to do.

334
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,336
It's like my brain's not working anymore.

335
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,924
Uh, sorry…

336
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,343
What are you talking about?
Where are you going with this?

337
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,970
This man said he loved me.

338
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,850
He said he'd protect me no matter what.

339
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,812
I just don't know
who this person is anymore.

340
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,568
And now I… keep turning over
these thoughts in my head, like…

341
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,030
"Maybe I'm a horrible judge of character."

342
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,496
"Maybe I'm the one
who drove him to act this way."

343
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,711
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'd tell you all this,

344
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,795
having just met.

345
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,339
But that's precisely why.

346
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,176
You don't know me,

347
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,596
You're not prejudiced against me
in any way.

348
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,190
So, Ms. Yumi…

349
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,400
Um, about letting the TV program
cover you...

350
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,152
I'm just…

351
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,532
…an evil bitch
who tried to kill her own father.

352
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,705
I deserve to be punished,
and that's exactly what'll happen.

353
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,499
I'm sorry, but…

354
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,211
please leave me alone.

355
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,715
Uh… Yumi…

356
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,681
Ms. Oh.

357
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,687
You should leave the guy.

358
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,108
Just be safe when you do.

359
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,327
You sure that's Cho Haewon?

360
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,995
Yes, sir. Oh, also…

361
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,790
We pinged Dr. Trigger's location
the moment they made the post.

362
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,335
It was uploaded from inside the station.

363
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,421
INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE
TRIGGER CASE REPORT

364
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,051
So that makes
the culprit one of ours then?

365
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,512
Also take a look at this, sir.

366
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,806
How about you give me everything at once,
sound good?

367
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,810
TRIGGER EPISODE 1784
VIEWERSHIP RANK #1

368
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,437
What, are you trying
to cheer me up with this?

369
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,274
It's all thanks to Han Do,
the team's new hire.

370
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,192
He's a talented guy.

371
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,987
Why don't we use this opportunity
to get rid of Oh Soryong

372
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,530
and get some fresh faces in here?

373
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,781
No, no.

374
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,201
Keep her on.

375
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,704
- Oh Soryong is good where she is.
- Sir?

376
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,747
You probably don't know this,

377
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,500
but Cho Haewon's the angel of death.

378
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,045
She's unpredictable,
and I might need someone…

379
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,339
to take the fall for me.

380
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,427
Remind me,
what was the name of that new guy?

381
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,515
Did the chief call a meeting?

382
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,892
I'm guessing that means
they picked Lee's replacement?

383
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,770
It's gonna be Kang.
He's the only experienced AP.

384
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,272
Except he's contract.

385
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,775
Hey, we're short-staffed,
but they can't promote just anyone.

386
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,027
There's no way.

387
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,154
I would bet on the Pee Guy!

388
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,531
Me too. I think it'll be Han Do.

389
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,408
He's skilled and good under pressure.

390
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,784
Amoeba's an idiot.

391
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,745
Right, Songi?

392
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:16,293
All right, having consulted with Mr. Son
following the cat killer case,

393
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,128
we're having Mr. Han take over.

394
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,590
He'll be overseeing Team Four.

395
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,426
Oh.

396
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,470
Mm, what?

397
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,847
Does this mean I'm gonna get a raise?

398
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,849
- Huh?
- Because if it doesn't…

399
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,060
I'd rather just stay an AP.

400
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,436
Whoa…

401
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,063
No, there's no raise.

402
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,774
- And you, Kang Giho.
- What about me?

403
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,275
Starting today,
you'll be the producer for Team Five.

404
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,152
Your salary remains the same.

405
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,529
Wow.

406
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,073
Seriously?

407
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,619
Holy shit…

408
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,664
So this must be
how Mr. Son plans to get us canceled.

409
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,459
All right, that means we'll be operating
five different teams from now on.

410
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:01,463
So you'll get a week to refresh,
just like you've all been requesting.

411
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,590
- So your work better be good.
- Thank you, sir.

412
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,677
Hey, Kang Giho,
is this about the salary thing? Cheer up.

413
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,763
You're the first contractor
to make main producer!

414
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,098
I know.

415
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,312
I'm so overjoyed,
I'm just at a loss for words, sir…

416
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,856
- Oh, wow, wow, wow…
- Wow, so now, I'm…

417
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,486
Do, we did it, we made it!
We made it, man! We did it!

418
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,862
Hey, man, let go!

419
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:30,450
Can I just say,
if I'm managing, I should get a raise.

420
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,576
That'll be all.

421
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,537
Then who's gonna be taking over
Sangmok's spot?

422
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,415
- You are.
- Wow, check out Mr. Opportunist.

423
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,750
There are things in this world so valuable

424
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,544
that they can't be bought with money.

425
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:42,254
I'm telling you.

426
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,005
Why don't you get that, man?

427
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:51,388
DR. TRIGGER INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE

428
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,311
This conversation
stays between the three of us.

429
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,606
That's you, me,
and Mr. Son, General Manager.

430
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,775
As for the recording, it'll be disposed of
once the investigation's over.

431
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,110
No need to worry.

432
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,488
Eat your food outside.

433
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,157
You'll be more comfortable.

434
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,159
Got it, boss.

435
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,790
Your colleagues think
you're a childless career woman,

436
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,585
but I see here that you, in fact,
have a young daughter.

437
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,378
Is there a reason you've been hiding this?

438
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,922
Are you perhaps… a single mother?

439
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,092
Please respect my privacy.

440
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,095
I mean, what does my divorce
have to do with catching Dr. Trigger?

441
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,346
And it hasn't been finalized,

442
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,265
we're trying to reconcile.
You should try it.

443
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,100
Been staying busy, Mr. Seo?

444
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,478
It's my understanding
you haven't been home lately.

445
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,854
You thought about
giving us less work down here?

446
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:41,938
Huh?

447
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,441
I just hope you've been showering.

448
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,361
I was in the middle of an edit
when you called me in.

449
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,030
What's up with these questions anyway?

450
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,198
A little invasive.

451
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,407
Want me to give it to you straight?

452
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,700
Rumors of him being gay

453
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,870
Can you explain
the rumors about your sexual orientation?

454
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,123
- Congrats on the promotion.
- Right. Thank you, sir.

455
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,334
Do you know who nominated you,
Mr. Kang?

456
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,669
- Yeah, I'm sure it was Ms. Oh...
- It was me.

457
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,048
Huh?

458
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,342
Uh, it didn't come from the team leader?

459
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,886
Mr. Kang.

460
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,056
There's always more than meets the eye.

461
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,641
Yeah…

462
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,603
So then the person Ms. Oh picked…

463
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,234
It's good
to see you dress for the occasion.

464
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,319
You seem to be adjusting rather quickly.

465
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,156
How much longer will this take?

466
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,546
Thank you. You can go.

467
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,922
Oh. Yes, President Koo.

468
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,010
Take a seat.

469
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,269
Which Chinese character is used for "Do"?

470
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,353
I've been wondering.

471
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,314
I don't use one.

472
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,192
It's a purely Korean name.

473
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,486
Did you really come all this way
to ask me that?

474
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,696
Oh.

475
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,615
I guess I'm just a guy
who likes to ask things in person.

476
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,370
How are you getting along with Ms. Oh?

477
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,038
You two click?

478
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,878
I'd appreciate it

479
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,257
if you'd work on
the Cha Seongwook case with her.

480
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,508
Really? Why?

481
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,678
The Cha Seongwook case?

482
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,014
You don't need to update me
every day or anything,

483
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,517
but I'd like to be notified
when critical info comes in.

484
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,811
You report directly to my office.

485
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,938
Why would I do that?

486
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,779
Unlimited company card.

487
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,364
Eat your fill.

488
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,825
Get up your strength.

489
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,916
WHY WON'T YOU PICK UP?

490
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,668
WE NEED TO TALK, SORYONG.

491
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,464
PLEASE TALK TO ME.

492
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,133
Oh, shit!

493
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,179
SORYONG!!!!

494
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,056
YOON: WE CAN'T GET ANY WORK DONE
WITH ALL THE INTERROGATIONS!

495
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,102
What are you doing here?

496
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,021
The higher-ups want heightened security.

497
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,943
Are they really using this as an excuse
to install six more cameras in here?

498
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,153
This is ridiculous!

499
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,371
Up here, up here, here,

500
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,164
here, here, and here.

501
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,964
Is our office their prime target?

502
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,467
You don't think this is overkill, Mr. Son?

503
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,470
It's to protect all of us
from potential acts of terrorism.

504
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,806
As far as the company is concerned,

505
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,017
the cameras are part of
the cost of doing business.

506
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:12,857
He's asking for you.

507
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,902
DR. TRIGGER INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE

508
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,612
You're seriously
interrogating people here?

509
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,823
What's with the sexual orientation stuff?

510
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,702
All this questioning…
is affecting our team's output.

511
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,954
Questions regarding orientation
are relevant.

512
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,580
This was a sex-related incident.

513
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,208
This is just preliminary questioning.

514
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,752
Based on today's findings,
we'll be turning the lucky winner

515
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,837
over to the authorities.

516
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,508
Please remove the unnecessary cameras.

517
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,218
We would appreciate it, sir.

518
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,220
Hmm.

519
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,431
I heard you chose the rookie

520
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,433
over your loyal subordinate
for the new position.

521
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,935
Quite surprising,

522
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:52,355
coming from a leader
who cares so deeply for her team.

523
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,315
But I get it.

524
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,025
You knew that a contract worker

525
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,069
wasn't as competent
as a full-time employee

526
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,404
when shit hits the fan.

527
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,947
Consider this…

528
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,367
won't the rookie feel completely betrayed
by you and your team

529
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,327
once he figures out that he was picked…

530
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,164
merely to serve as the fall guy?

531
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,124
What?

532
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,585
Uncomfortable with the truth?

533
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,009
I need you to drive me somewhere.

534
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,053
So I'm a main producer,
but I don't get a raise…

535
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,889
…and now I gotta cover AP duties as well?

536
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,015
Ms. Oh, can we talk?

537
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,767
I'd drive myself if I could,

538
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,352
but there's this ringing in my ears,

539
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,314
and I'm worried I'll crash if I drive.

540
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,616
Hey! Oh Soryong, hey…

541
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,618
I said I wanted to talk!
Why won't you answer...

542
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,787
Wait, what the hell?

543
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,580
This your new guy? Really?

544
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,248
Hey! Hey! Get out! Hey!

545
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:58,004
Did you know that forcing someone
to talk to you is another form of abuse?

546
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,380
You know that?

547
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,757
Wait… Don't…

548
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,304
Oh, God! Oh, my arm.

549
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,890
- Open up.
- No, wait! Oh, God, my arm.

550
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,810
Let's get going.

551
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,396
Wait! Wait! No, no, no, wait!

552
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,357
Oh, seriously?

553
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,821
- Was he...
- I'm embarrassed enough, so let's not.

554
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,241
I need you
to at least enter a destination.

555
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,501
What Cho Haewon said about that woman.

556
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,127
You believe her?

557
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,297
I don't even believe in myself,
you're asking the wrong guy.

558
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,508
Assuming she was telling the truth,

559
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,470
her reluctance to bring this to the police
20 years ago…

560
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,473
had nothing to do with love.

561
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,810
Her foolish pride got in the way.

562
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,354
She probably couldn't accept the reality

563
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:58,898
that she'd fallen
for a pathetic, cheating loser.

564
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,361
She was embarrassed by her mistake.

565
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,946
This about you?

566
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,075
I guess so.

567
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,414
Your business cards.

568
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,711
You could've put them on my desk.
Why'd you have to give me them now?

569
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,380
I was afraid you'd toss them away
and forget about them.

570
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,924
Imagine that every single card
weighs 100 kilos.

571
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,217
And if you mess up,

572
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,928
all that weight returns to you,
and bears down on your soul.

573
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,973
I'm picking up on a sadistic streak
in your work ethic.

574
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,435
Employees get free counseling services,
you know.

575
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,353
I highly recommend it.

576
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,356
I'll take care of my own mental health.
Take these with you.

577
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,196
Han Do, Producer at Trigger

578
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,824
I knew it.

579
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,576
You wanna look,
so stop pretending otherwise.

580
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,131
Ma'am?
Someone's here to see you.

581
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,346
Are you Ms. Lee Yumi's mother?

582
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,724
I'm Oh Soryong, a producer at KNS.

583
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:22,732
Please leave.

584
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,652
Ma'am, if we don't help your daughter,

585
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,446
she'll be spending her best years
behind bars.

586
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:32,116
You know the hell she went through
better than anyone else.

587
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,410
You were right there with her.

588
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,582
Why are you tending
to your husband like this,

589
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:44,462
when you haven't once…
gone to visit your daughter in prison?

590
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,716
After everything he did to her.

591
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,512
How can you do this?

592
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,405
What exactly
did that man do to his daughter?

593
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:12,740
What the hell is wrong with her?

594
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,160
This is why I didn't tell you,
'cause you'd react this way.

595
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,412
Oh, react normally?

596
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,623
I mean, she still waits hand and foot
on that sick pervert

597
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,500
despite everything he did to her daughter?

598
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,087
It's not just weird,
that woman… she's sickening!

599
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,756
That woman witnessed
unimaginable physical abuse

600
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,966
for a long time.

601
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,677
We should not expect her to act normal.

602
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,392
You're a regular Mother Teresa,
aren't you?

603
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,894
Not me.

604
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,147
I'm a petty and narrow-minded person,

605
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,398
so I guess I'll never understand

606
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:47,984
what could lead someone
to make those decisions.

607
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,115
She's refusing to see you.

608
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,744
HYUNGSO DETENTION CENTER

609
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,247
Oh, uh… I'd like to deposit money
into Yumi's account.

610
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,125
Please encourage her
to buy herself some sneakers or something.

611
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,002
VOYEURISM PUNISHMENT

612
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:17,638
Mr. Hwang Jinwoo?

613
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,932
We're from internal auditing.

614
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,852
Please hand over your laptop
and come with us.

615
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,188
Uh, okay then.

616
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,939
Let me use the bathroom before I give...

617
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,234
Hey… Hey,
you can't just seize someone's...

618
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,153
Mr. Hwang. Mr. Hwang.

619
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,240
It would be in your best interest
not to make a scene.

620
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,993
Okay. All right, fine.

621
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,370
I've got nothing to hide. Let's go. Okay.

622
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,209
We pulled this from your laptop,
Mr. Hwang.

623
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,836
It's everything,
including the film footage.

624
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,008
Mr. Son,
let me just co… come clean right now.

625
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,928
It's true that I have, in fact,
been dating Ms. Oh Soryong,

626
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,471
so I'm the one who took the photo.

627
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,306
But… tha… that…

628
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,268
I swear to God I didn't take that video,
I didn't do it, sir!

629
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,394
Hwang Jinwoo.

630
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,440
This isn't some minor offense
like urinating in a public place

631
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,650
and hurting our image.

632
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,902
The evidence we've gathered on our end

633
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,904
would be enough
to take down the entire network.

634
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,031
Don't you know what world we're living in?

635
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,784
- You should know better.
- Right, we… well, I, uh…

636
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,161
How could I be Dr. Trigger?

637
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,997
Y-You know me better than that.
I'm spineless.

638
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,916
My spine's practically nonexistent.

639
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,751
Let me guess.

640
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,795
Ms. Oh is above you
in the company hierarchy,

641
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,338
and you felt like less of a man.

642
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,589
You felt emasculated.

643
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,883
You had to knock her down a peg or two.

644
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,426
Listen, just…

645
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,012
What's it gonna take
for you to believe me? Huh?

646
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,098
Mr. Son, come on, you know me,

647
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,766
I'm one of your newsroom juniors.

648
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,811
I beg you, just this once,
please help me out. Help me.

649
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,521
Were you perhaps blackmailed by a rival?

650
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,439
No, no, President, no, I wasn't!

651
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,108
Nothing like that, sir!

652
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,986
If you… if you just let this slide,
just this once,

653
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,530
I'll spend my entire life
repaying my debt to you, sir.

654
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,867
No… I, I…
I'll do anything, I'm your loyal dog.

655
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,578
Please, just this once.
Don't do this to me, sir.

656
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,288
Please, I'm begging you, sir.

657
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,916
Why would a newsroom reporter
do something like that?

658
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,960
And why'd Soryong
go out with that douchebag?

659
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,920
- She could do better.
- Seriously though.

660
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,340
It's not like she cheated
or did anything wrong.

661
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,884
Not her fault she has poor taste.

662
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,677
Don't anybody
breathe a word of this to her.

663
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,804
I'm not interested
in Soryong's private life.

664
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,222
But I'm worried they'll cover it up.

665
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,266
The higher-ups
sweep everything under the rug,

666
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,268
and a real crime's been committed here.

667
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,105
Wow…

668
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,067
Gosh, seems like yesterday you were
a rookie who couldn't look me in the eye.

669
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,486
And now you're a chief. There you go.

670
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,947
The end times are truly upon us.
They're here.

671
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,825
That's what you get.
Shouldn't have left us like you did.

672
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:44,493
Now let your former rookie
pour you a glass.

673
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,786
Sure, go ahead.

674
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,710
- Oh, Seongchun.
- Mm-hmm?

675
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,963
Um, 20 years ago…

676
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,008
- Uh-huh?
- …when you were the Trigger chief,

677
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,970
do you happen to recall
the Cha Seongwook incident?

678
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,391
Get a load of this.

679
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,021
You're not here just to talk,
you're here to get a lead, aren't you?

680
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,942
The years
haven't dulled your instincts at all.

681
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,443
That's a Trigger chief for you.

682
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,321
All right, fine, whatever.

683
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,783
Hey, man, you could have just,
you know, asked me straight up.

684
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,327
Don't go beating around the bush,
just ask the question.

685
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,164
You know, back then,
it was a real shitshow, huh?

686
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,125
Hanju kept taking reporters to court
for minor things,

687
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,503
most of the stations
had no option but to deal with it.

688
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,088
Right, exactly!

689
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,756
I've gone over every case,

690
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,842
including the ones we never aired,
and that was the only missing one.

691
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,555
I guess it can't hurt to tell you now.

692
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:51,060
We got this close
to airing the episode back then.

693
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,605
What? By "this close," you mean…?

694
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,773
Ah, jeez.

695
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,276
We sussed it all out. Huh?

696
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:02,196
So once we got a read on the situation,
we set up a decoy right away.

697
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,075
"A" was our surface operator,
the one who went after the scoop.

698
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,661
- Oh, right, right, yeah. Mm.
- Yeah, so that guy was just the decoy.

699
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:11,872
But behind the scenes,
I was actually on the story,

700
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,791
me and a certain "B".

701
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,502
And that guy, he was extremely dedicated.

702
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:20,089
The whole thing was kept under wraps
like a 007 operation.

703
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,674
No previews at all.

704
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:22,967
And then…

705
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,971
Minutes before we went live,
the prick took the tape, and…

706
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,724
just went dark, he was gone.

707
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,268
- Ugh, son of a bitch.
- What?

708
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,061
Jesus Christ, what was…

709
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,187
Who the hell was it?

710
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,939
Do I know this person?

711
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,027
These days,
he's pretty well-known at the network.

712
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,864
Hey, tell me,

713
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,949
he still have a condom drawer?

714
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,376
TO DIRECTOR SON HUIWON
TIP-OFF ABOUT DR. TRIGGER

715
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,420
JOURNALIST HWANG JINWOO'S
PHILANDERING PRIVATE LIFE

716
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,718
SIGNED BY: SONG YERIM, NEWS ANCHOR

717
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,397
Now that I'm out of the game,

718
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:22,860
I really do regret so much about my work.

719
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,530
What, you feel like
you could've relaxed a little more?

720
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,158
No, no.

721
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,329
I wish I'd been able to stick it out.

722
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,956
See things through to the end.

723
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,210
The regrets washed over me
once time passed.

724
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,005
Hey, the camera's
pretty damn powerful, right?

725
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,717
If I'd fought harder
and stood my ground a little more

726
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,886
up until the very end,

727
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,138
who the hell knows?

728
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,475
I might've even…
made things easier on you guys.

729
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,937
You've gotten wiser.

730
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,233
You don't have
some terminal disease, do you?

731
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,110
Wiseass.

732
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,740
Your job is to buffer your employees
from all the verbal abuse.

733
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,493
You gotta treat your guys well.

734
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,789
By the way, how's the team?

735
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,166
You got any quality underlings?

736
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,045
Of course.

737
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,922
I do.

738
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,181
Hi, how are you?

739
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,607
Oh.

740
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,822
When I was a kid,
my brother made me steal a toy

741
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,867
and Dad cut off my finger
to teach me a lesson.

742
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,202
He saw the blood gushing from my finger,

743
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,121
and he heard me screaming in pain.

744
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:01,125
But my father didn't even bat an eye.

745
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,335
Just kept scolding me.

746
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,381
Child victims of abuse
are easy to spot.

747
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,842
People can sense
the gaping holes in their hearts.

748
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,093
You know what I mean?

749
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:16,348
They become prime targets
for all the worst men have to offer.

750
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,684
Abusers have an instinct for it.

751
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,021
You gave birth to her.

752
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,567
You don't feel her pain?

753
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,279
If you don't have what it takes
to care for her,

754
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:33,032
the very least you can do
is prevent further harm.

755
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,578
How will that hole in her heart
ever be filled?

756
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,762
If my husband dies,
she'll be labeled a murderer.

757
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,096
I can't let that happen.

758
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,688
Parents have the strangest ways
of showing their love.

759
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,983
Your poor daughter…

760
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,237
actually wants
to be found guilty of murder.

761
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,530
She just wants to die.

762
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,742
What she needs more than anything
is her mother.

763
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:23,207
We all need someone who'll take our side,
who'll be there for us no matter what!

764
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,212
Who'll just be omma.

765
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,623
You getting out?

766
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,555
What is it? Come on, spit it out!
You're the one who wanted to talk.

767
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,436
Why do you think
everybody likes you so much?

768
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,645
Uh...

769
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,816
If you're mad we both got promoted,
talk to the bosses.

770
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,818
God, you're such a jerk, seriously!

771
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,571
You know, I'm this close
to punching you in the nose.

772
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,868
Now that I'm a main producer…

773
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,202
you know what the best part of that is?

774
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,122
Not that you care.

775
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,832
Write-ups, you know?

776
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,712
Contractors aren't allowed to do write-ups
to explain their mistakes.

777
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,005
And it's so unfair.

778
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,591
But now that I have that right,

779
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,510
I think I've figured out
the reason I want to do this work.

780
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,596
I think I…

781
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,307
want recognition.

782
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,352
I want to be appreciated
by the people that I respect.

783
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,479
Well, Ms. Oh picked you,
didn't you get your wish?

784
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,105
No, not me, you! No, you…

785
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,524
You were Ms. Oh's number-one pick,
you dumbass.

786
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,575
But luckily, Kang Giho…

787
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,744
does not back down.

788
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,708
I have just started to show you
my true potential, okay?

789
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,378
Let's face off, let's go, man.
Fair and square.

790
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,589
Right.

791
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:42,805
You're the first coworker I've ever had
a famous "rooftop one-on-one" with.

792
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,268
What an honor, Mr. Kang.

793
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,652
Dude's such a snake, I swear to God.

794
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,113
So she picked me, huh?

795
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,549
Hey. Soryong.

796
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,102
I wanted to meet up one more time
just to get a little closure.

797
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,646
Question number one.

798
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,649
Why'd you take that photo?

799
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:37,443
I…

800
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,027
Well, you know, I...

801
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,363
You were just looking so beautiful,

802
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,657
- and I wanted to capture it on...
- That's a copout.

803
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,702
Question number two.

804
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,874
Are you really…

805
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,918
Dr. Trigger?

806
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,006
No, Soryong,
you… you already know I'm not, okay?

807
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,383
You… you know
I'm not that kind of person.

808
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,094
How could you think I'm Dr...
Oh, hold on a sec, okay?

809
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,262
I'm cramping up here.

810
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,764
No, I'm not Dr. Trigger.

811
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,349
No, absolutely not. I'm not, not at all.

812
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,185
What do you mean "kind of person"?

813
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,312
When you say "not that kind of person"?

814
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:14,813
What are you?

815
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,608
A good person?

816
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,818
Huh? I'm…

817
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,321
Wanna know what makes you trash?

818
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,657
Your article about Lee Yumi was good.
I read it.

819
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,328
But now,
nothing you wrote has any credibility.

820
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,873
No one's ever gonna take
your reporting seriously.

821
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,541
What I'm saying…

822
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,545
is that I'm not the only one wronged here.

823
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,547
'Cause every single victim,

824
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:44,009
everyone you've covered over the years
has been affected. You get it?

825
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,472
From this point on…

826
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,226
you and I are over. Get out.

827
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,604
Okay, Soryong…

828
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,232
I… I understand
where you're coming from.

829
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,318
Can… can I just say…

830
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,278
You know that… that photo, right?

831
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,658
Could… could you maybe
tell the company…

832
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,412
that we took the... that you consented
to having the photo taken?

833
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,039
Wh-What do you think?

834
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,418
I was told that I should be careful.

835
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,462
To stay safe when breaking up with you.

836
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,339
But now I really wanna hit you!

837
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:25,259
You listen.

838
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,303
If one more photo of me shows up online…

839
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,182
I'll be seeing you in court.

840
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,267
Mm-hmm.

841
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,442
Uh, so…

842
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,778
Um… you know, the…

843
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,113
What now?

844
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:54,079
Uh, what, um, what should we…

845
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,582
do about the ring now?

846
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,252
Here it is.
Here's your ring. Here it is.

847
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,838
Take it, tightwad! Take it! Take it!

848
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,922
Get out!

849
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,010
Oh, God, Soryong, that was the bad arm.

850
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,762
- Oh, sweetie, no. Soryong...
- I said get out!

851
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,973
Come on, this isn't like you,
why would you...

852
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,017
Give me a sec,
let me just get… get the ring.

853
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,978
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

854
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,563
Hey, wait! Whoa!

855
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,481
Whoa! Come on!

856
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,943
I was just trying to ask
what we should do with it.

857
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,282
Thank God.

858
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,579
I had a funny dream last night.

859
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,331
- Really? What kind of dream?
- You can go in now, Ms. Oh.

860
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,415
Oh.

861
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,459
Wait.

862
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:41,960
She agreed to it?

863
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,211
Yes, she's agreed to see you.

864
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,006
Show her in, please.

865
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,239
You're looking much better today.

866
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,911
It's good to see.

867
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,083
These sneakers…

868
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,127
they're nice and warm.

869
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,381
Thank you for that.

870
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,683
I…

871
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,269
Dumped the guy.

872
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,106
I followed your advice.

873
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,733
I made sure I was safe when I did.

874
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,736
So I wanted to say thank you.

875
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,120
One day, all of a sudden,

876
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,331
I noticed my stomach was swelling up.

877
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,503
At first,
I thought I was just gaining weight.

878
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,338
I didn't know I was pregnant.

879
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:12,009
I took time off from school,
and I gave birth at home.

880
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,721
And then that man took the child.

881
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,767
And he murdered it

882
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,562
before the cord was even cut.

883
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:29,109
I think that was when I… I…

884
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,612
knew I had to kill him.

885
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,995
Killing him was the only way to wake up
from the nightmare I was living in.

886
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,541
And that's why I did it.

887
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,548
I've never once regretted it.

888
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,218
The thing that ashames me the most…

889
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,184
…is that I didn't get to say bye
to my mom.

890
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,313
That was my last moment with her.

891
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,572
I wanna see my mom!
Where is she?

892
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,293
I know that some people
blame my mom for what happened.

893
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,131
But I understand her.

894
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,844
She was my mother.

895
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,726
And she was there.
She was down in that hellhole with me.

896
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:51,691
I'm sorry. Depressing story, isn't it?

897
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:57,656
I know that people probably can't…
wrap their heads…

898
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,159
…around a story like this.

899
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,410
Ms. Yumi.

900
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:08,542
Though they may look flawless from afar…

901
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,631
every single household has its scars.

902
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,425
I'm sure that many see you

903
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,679
as a perfect flower, in bloom.

904
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,349
A beautiful one.

905
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,896
Truly.

906
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,485
Thank you.

907
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:42,576
About the thing…
that Ms. Choi mentioned last time,

908
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,828
we don't have to air this episode

909
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,580
if you don't want to...

910
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,498
I want you to put this out in the world.

911
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:54,379
This prison is the first place

912
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,840
I've ever slept well.

913
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:02,387
At first, I thought I should kill myself
rather than live this way.

914
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:07,267
But thanks to Mr. Han,
I've changed my mind about that.

915
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,771
How did you…

916
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,482
come to know Mr. Han?

917
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,568
He came by

918
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:19,321
and left a note this morning.

919
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,921
HAN DO, PRODUCER AT TRIGGER

920
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,259
SENDER: TRIGGER PRODUCER

921
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:48,266
SENDER: TRIGGER PRODUCER HAN

922
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,857
I instantly recognized
my mom's handwriting.

923
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,025
If my husband dies,
she'll be labeled a murderer.

924
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,109
I can't let that happen.

925
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,075
Ms. Oh…

926
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:10,330
…I'm not giving up on myself.

927
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,087
I'm gonna live a good life.

928
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:42,070
May this be a pleasant day out,
and may I never come back here again.

929
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:01,298
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

930
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,133
HWANG JINWOO, NEWS DEPARTMENT

931
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,272
What the heck?

932
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:01,941
What are you…

933
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,361
What are you doing here?

934
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,112
I could ask you the same question.

935
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,447
What are you doing standing in the rain,

936
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,449
- all sad and...
- My umbrella just flew off.

937
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,118
Why are you here?

938
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,330
Lee Cheolgyu's dead.

939
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,792
Seriously?

940
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,215
Uh…

941
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,551
Ms. Yumi!

942
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,595
You hear that?

943
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:34,641
Ms. Yumi, you're finally free!

944
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,936
You're free now!

945
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,106
You're gonna catch a cold!

946
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,607
Who really cares?

947
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,239
I'll have one of the guards tell her,
and then I'll come right back.

948
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:25,567
Omma…

949
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,029
That's what you get
for standing out in the rain.

950
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,531
- You gotta be careful.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

951
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,285
If I knew you'd pester me,
I would've gotten another car.

952
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,914
I'll get meds from the pharmacy there.
You wait here.

953
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,347
- Mom!
- Hi!

954
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,392
- Hi!
- Hello!

Hey, sweetie, your breakfast is ready!

958
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:53,840
Nope, nope, nope,
I'm running late, I've gotta go now!

959
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,049
Come on, hon!

960
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:57,010
- At least one bite before you go!
- No, Mom.

961
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,094
It was great, I'm full already.

962
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,346
- Oh, give me a break.
- Come on, I've told you a million times

963
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,098
that eating breakfast
gives me a stomachache!

964
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,767
Besides, since when
do you make me breakfast?

965
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,144
You've never done that before.

966
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:09,647
I just… opened my eyes this morning
and suddenly felt...

967
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,732
You felt what?

968
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:12,609
I felt like making a nice breakfast
for my daughter.

969
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,861
- Oh, really, is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

970
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:17,697
You know, Mom,
sudden change in behavior is a bad omen.

971
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,991
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

972
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,743
And can you stop wearing my cat socks?

973
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:24,162
I really don't want your athlete's foot,
it's gross.

974
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,748
At least wash them before I get home.
Okay, bye!

975
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,249
Hey, you be careful!

976
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,126
Oh, the temper on that girl!

977
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:31,961
I think they suit me.

978
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:34,130
Don't you think? Meow.
