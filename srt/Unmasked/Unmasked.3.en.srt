EP03: For The Loser

2
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,521
Ugh, seriously. Jeez.

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,441
Man, these people
are just unbelievable, huh?

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,360
That felt like…

5
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,237
…it was done intentionally,
don't you think?

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,239
Oh, of course it was!
Look at your face, you're bleeding.

7
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,323
It wasn't though.

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,993
Come on, they smashed up the office
with a fire extinguisher

9
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:36,369
and they, they…

10
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,454
…they did this to her face.

11
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,873
Ho… How could you say
this wasn't done intentionally?

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,541
Oh, yeah, they did it.

13
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,002
- Intentionally.
- Huh?

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,095
- Jinwoo!
- Yeah?

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,097
-Hurry and get in. We don't have time.
-Yeah.

16
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,685
Oh, man…

17
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,105
Thank heavens
the sprinklers didn't kick in.

18
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,066
That would have been awful
if all our files got wet.

19
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,400
Did something happen over there?

20
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,777
I heard a seven-year-old kid

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,403
went missing at his own apartment.

22
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,489
I guess
the mom reported him missing too late.

23
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,157
An amber alert was issued
three hours ago.

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,492
- Oh.
- Whoa, uh, look at this.

25
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,536
Emergency Notification
Amber Alert

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,704
Come on, come on!
Let's go. Hurry up!

27
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,581
Excuse me!
Has the child been found?

28
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,209
Sir, sir!

29
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,892
Is anyone home?

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,772
Hello?

31
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,693
What do you want? It's very late.

32
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,362
Ma'am, I'm with the police.

33
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,406
There's a missing seven-year-old boy,
we'd like your cooperation.

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,117
Well, my son's in middle school.

35
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,201
- So, we're done here.
- Ma'am…

36
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,121
What do you think you're doing?

37
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,374
You sure those are your son's shoes?

38
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,671
Whose are those?

39
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,217
- Oh! You can't--
- Where's the kid now? Huh?

40
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,510
-I asked where your kid was.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

41
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,594
- Just get out. Get out!
- Let's go, guys, let's go.

42
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,429
I think this door's locked.

43
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,183
Open this door.

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,935
No one goes in Junyeong's room.

45
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,604
Not even my husband
unless absolutely needed.

46
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,022
He's studying for a math competition

47
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,566
-so he's really sensitive!
-I said open this door!

48
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,526
You know what polyphasic sleeping is?

49
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,570
- We can't disturb him right now.
- Damn it, move.

50
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,989
- What the-- Wh-- What are you doing?
- Get out of the way.

51
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,824
Do you know how expensive this door is?

52
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,325
Are you out of your mind?

53
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,914
You'll be in trouble
if this Mingeun kid's not there.

54
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,335
What is all this?

55
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,088
My husband teaches
veterinary medicine, okay?

56
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,756
It's from the lab where he works.

57
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,467
And our son…

58
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,803
is actually gonna be a doctor.

59
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,347
Junyeong.

60
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,725
Junyeong,
get up for a second.

61
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,019
Junyeong.

62
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,896
What the hell?

63
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:08,980
The fu--

64
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,205
Why does that surprise you?

65
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,919
You're the one who made me do this.

66
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,798
You told me I had to kill the kitties.

67
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,969
And kill the kid and bring him here.

68
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,055
You said you'd rape me again…

69
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,849
You told me
you'd kill my parents if I didn't…

70
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,186
…didn't do everything you said.

71
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,524
Run, kitty! Hurry!

72
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,650
Get away!

73
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,360
You!

74
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,946
Get out of here right now!

75
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,294
Oh, yeah.

76
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,465
Nice and warm.

77
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,930
I heard the perps
who threw the smoke bombs

78
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,098
turned themselves in.

79
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,559
They're arguing that they were only doing

80
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,602
what the voice of God
was telling them to do.

81
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,938
Mm, that, and…

82
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,982
as for Dr. Trigger's cyberterrorism act,

83
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,776
our own company's legal team
is gonna be handling that internally.

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,236
President Koo has informed me.

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,864
And we are to make no contact whatsoever
with the police or media.

86
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,032
Especially you, Ms. Oh.

87
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,492
Be careful.

88
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,494
If you start snooping around
like you always do,

89
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,580
-you're out, got it?
-Hey, watch what you're saying…

90
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,123
Oh, no, no, no.

91
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,374
Those aren't my words.

92
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,585
I'm relaying exactly
what President Koo directed me to,

93
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,754
word for word. That's all.

94
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,505
You tell Koo I'll be as gentle as always.

95
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,965
He's got nothing to worry about.

96
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,301
Uh, "President Koo,"

97
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,053
I should say.

98
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,680
- Yes, Detective.
- Ms. Oh.

99
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,098
Where's the producer who wet himself?

100
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,351
- You know, that guy who--
- You mean Han Do?

101
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,269
Why do you need to know?

102
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,772
The false tip
that your producer got from that kid.

103
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,981
You know about this kid?

104
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,441
From a kid? Do you mean…

105
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,443
The house Han Do visited yesterday.

106
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,403
I'm not supposed to tell you this, but…

107
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,655
you heard about
this missing child case, right?

108
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,740
Here.

109
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,911
Kang Giho, pack your camera.

110
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,747
Come on, Rookie. Get in the car
and bring the photo from the store.

111
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,749
-Whoa. Where are we going?
-I'll explain on the way.

112
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,463
Come on, dude, hurry up.

113
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,965
Come on.

114
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,261
That missing child was just found dead.

115
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,263
-It looks like he was murdered.
-Huh?

116
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,515
What's important

117
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,393
is that the suspect is Son Junyeong,
a middle school kid.

118
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,977
This guy's not even 14 years old yet.

119
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,105
So a kid killed another kid?

120
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,899
We're following up on the Son…
whatchamacallit kid?

121
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,570
Hang on. We're going back to the old guy?

122
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,197
That's right.

123
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,991
We're going to Yoon Namgi's house…
where we were this morning.

124
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,076
But why?

125
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,245
The detective is saying

126
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,580
they tracked Junyeong to that house.

127
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,168
There's no way.

128
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:02,255
This is the kid?
This can't be Son Junyeong.

129
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,756
Let's focus on getting there.

130
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,217
Looks like there's a fire now too.

131
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,802
Oh, God, this is bad.

132
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,595
Step on it, Mr. Bae.

133
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,525
Hey! This way!
What are you guys doing?

134
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,240
This path is blocked.
Guys, this path is blocked!

135
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,616
Let's find another way in.

136
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,619
We're producers, not the police.
It's real life here.

137
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,538
What if the old man's
with that little shit right now?

138
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,999
We're not gonna try to get them out,
that's for the police.

139
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,917
It's much too risky.

140
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,670
- Detective Yu!
- Oh, there you are!

141
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,046
Hey, let them in! Come on!

142
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,800
Is this our guy?

143
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,100
- Someone help me!
- The kid's in here!

144
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,852
We found the kid!

145
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,688
Hey, buddy, are you okay?

146
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,191
Can you walk?

147
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,525
Are you all right?

148
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,949
Are you okay?

149
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,040
Transporting the patient to the ER!

150
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,416
Patient coming through!

151
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,216
Watch out!

152
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,092
Rescue! Rescue squad!

153
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,761
Hey! Hey! Han Do!

154
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,845
The man's unconscious.

155
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,930
He's not breathing.

156
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,474
We'll give him first aid
on route to the hospital.

157
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,562
You need to stay clean and well-kempt

158
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,523
as a member of society.

159
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,066
You came to me, didn't you?

160
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,442
That's good enough for me.

161
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,959
Don't just stand around.

162
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,002
- Get him out of here!
- Get back! Get back!

163
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,547
- Control these people!
- I told you to get back!

164
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,423
It was that bastard?

165
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,553
He… He didn't…

166
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,058
That old man would never harm anybody.

167
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,728
I…

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,023
I told you, didn't I?

169
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,651
I said we have to catch that bastard,
did I not?

170
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,945
- Hey, come on, settle down.
- I did!

171
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,113
-Take it easy.
-I told you guys

172
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,698
if that kid could kill a cat…

173
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,700
so horribly,

174
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,411
then he's more than able to kill people!

175
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,620
Didn't I say?

176
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,002
Han Do!

177
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,671
- Hey, Han… Han Do! Han Do! Han Do!
- Hey, you got to get up.

178
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,673
- Hey! Can we get some help here?
- Han Do!

179
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,758
Over here!

180
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,997
He's gone…

181
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,916
He's gone.

182
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,585
He doesn't look good.

183
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,212
That's just the tranquilizers.

184
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,547
Looks like they're working,
he's pretty out of it.

185
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:16,133
The tests show nothing's wrong with him.
He's healthier than I am.

186
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,677
So, why would he collapse like that?

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,554
Experiencing intense shock
all of a sudden will do that.

188
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,724
That, or the rage he felt at the moment
may have made him black out.

189
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,601
We'll monitor him for an hour or so.

190
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,270
Man…

191
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,523
I'm so used to
seeing this guy keep his distance,

192
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,401
but then he treats this old man
like his actual grandfather?

193
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,403
Watch him so he stays out of trouble, huh?

194
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,487
Where are you going?

195
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,117
Oh, my God. They're not detaining him?
On what grounds?

196
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,119
Because of his age,
he's not a flight risk,

197
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,954
and because the little prince needs rest.

198
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,205
Does that make any sense?

199
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,208
What? You gonna go see
Son Junyeong right now?

200
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,835
First, we need evidence.

201
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,294
Everything in due time, okay?

202
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,384
- Is that the producer?
- She is!

203
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,345
- She's coming out.
- Over here! Ma'am! Ma'am!

204
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,472
- Ms. Oh! Excuse me!
- Come on, don't give me that!

205
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,308
Hey, wait. Hey, Ms. Oh… Excuse me. Ms. Oh!

206
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,727
Let me through! I need to talk to her!

207
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
Ms. Oh!

208
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,523
Ms. Oh! Ms. Oh! Ms. Oh!

209
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:13,941
Give me a second.

210
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,026
Hey…

211
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,486
-Your mouth, what happened?
-I'm fine, it's okay.

212
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,574
What aren't they saying about this?
There's more to this case, isn't there?

213
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,783
Jinwoo, I… I can't just--

214
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,911
Don't do that. We're at the same company.
We're close enough, you can fill me in.

215
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,788
Hey, I'm sorry, I, uh…

216
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,331
I'm not able to tell you.

217
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,125
I don't get it, sweetie…

218
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,043
It's me here.

219
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,211
It's your boyfriend.

220
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,880
This is different, this is work.

221
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,424
Wow, Soryong. Huh.

222
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:41,051
- I did not realize how uptight you were.
- I got something really important.

223
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,136
I got to go.

224
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,804
-Let's do this later, okay, Jinwoo?
-But…

225
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,306
What am I to you exactly?

226
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,807
Soryong, hold on.

227
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,100
Where's your ring? Wait.

228
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,810
You're missing your ring.
Where's the ring?

229
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,270
Your ring! Wait a minute!

230
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,773
What happened to your ring? Hey, Soryong!

231
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,503
Ms. Joo, did you see the news?

232
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,671
- Apparently, his family's loaded!
- So what?

233
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,090
He has the audacity to claim
the old man raped him

234
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,550
and threatened him
into killing that child.

235
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,552
He's even claiming
the old man stabbed him

236
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,804
and set the house on fire.

237
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,305
He says he's a victim in this.

238
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,556
A victim? Please.

239
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,017
There's no signs of rape
and it's obvious he wasn't stabbed.

240
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,101
That wound was self-inflicted.

241
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,062
Facts are worthless
if you can manipulate the media--

242
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,396
Oh.

243
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,106
Oh, my goodness.

244
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,275
Sir, you shouldn't be up
in your current condition.

245
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,693
I'm a producer.

246
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,111
Han Do, Current Affairs Department

247
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,613
With Trigger.

248
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,781
Oh.

249
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,242
Oh, wow.

250
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,326
Oh, wow.

251
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,828
How eerie!

252
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,163
'Cause I thought about
going to the press with this

253
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,623
and I wasn't sure if I should.

254
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,917
Right, so…

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,585
-Let me just ask one thing.
-Ma'am…

256
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,462
I wanna know
what he did with my baby's eyes,

257
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,922
that's all I wanna know!

258
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,006
VIP Ward. Room 206
Son Junyeong

259
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,591
-Then I'll leave. Oh, please!
-We're the victims here!

260
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,009
It's not fair what you're doing.

261
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,803
Why are you protecting that monster?
He's evil!

262
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,888
What did you do with Mingeun's eyes?

263
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,099
Come on!

264
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,059
- Oh, ma'am. Whoa, whoa!
- Oh, honey! Honey!

265
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,186
- Are you okay?
- Honey! Honey!

266
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,772
Ma'am?
Ma'am, are you all right?

267
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,940
- What's wrong?
- Oh, my God!

268
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,483
- Officers, here, both of you.
- Honey!

269
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,609
Please, take her to the ER!

270
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,944
Actually, we got to guard the door.

271
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,363
-Oh, my God! She might die here!
-Are you okay? Sweetheart?

272
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,283
I can… guard the door. I'll stay here.
You both take her.

273
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,451
- Come on, go!
- Holy crap. Okay.

274
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,703
Put her on my back!

275
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,247
Let's get you up.
Can you stand?

276
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,373
Hurry up!

277
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,624
-Go!
-I really shouldn't be

278
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,293
-leaving my station though.
-Ugh, just take her already! Come on!

279
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,961
Oh, man…

280
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,255
Ma'am, are you all right?

281
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,121
Excuse me, how'd you get in here?

282
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,623
I'll ask the questions.

283
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,708
Why'd you kill the kid?

284
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,877
And the old man?

285
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:25,758
I could yell.

286
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,597
Guess no one's around?

287
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,223
Well, turn off your phone…

288
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,726
and I'll tell you.

289
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,067
One more thing.

290
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,235
Those cute cats you killed…

291
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,197
What made you kill innocent creatures?

292
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,115
What a shame.

293
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,159
No college for you?

294
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,702
What?

295
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,372
You want the right answers,
then ask the right questions.

296
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,375
Who else but you
could've killed the old guy?

297
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,459
I didn't do that.

298
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,505
I heard what that wage slave said to you.

299
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,881
I heard the whole thing.

300
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,634
Man, with you on it,
that animal killer's cooked. Aren't they?

301
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,719
I mean, it's only
a matter of time now, you know? You--

302
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,390
Look at this.

303
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,517
I keep getting a bunch of sympathy online.

304
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,185
Even with no support,

305
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:21,021
I can't be tried as an adult,
so I can't go to prison.

306
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,648
Like I said, no one can beat me.

307
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,024
I'm basically invincible.

308
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,986
So, get out of here, Trigger.

309
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,741
Tell the kid's mom and dad

310
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,202
that his eyeballs
are never gonna be found.

311
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,706
Mister, do you know what it's like…

312
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,041
when someone…

313
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,920
…breathes…

314
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,507
…for the last time ever?

315
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,802
I wonder if that's how Yuri Gagarin felt

316
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,388
staring down at Earth
from space that day.

317
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,266
That kid had the most beautiful eyes.

318
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,478
Oh…

319
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,397
Guess you don't know the reference.

320
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,108
The Soviets?

321
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,152
Who succeeded in space flight?

322
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:12,031
In 1 hour and 29 minutes aboard Vostok 1

323
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,575
on April 12th, 1961.

324
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,410
Hmm?

325
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,789
How many times
do I have to tell you guys? Gah!

326
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,666
- Sir? Sir!
- Guess the police are on their way.

327
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,335
Looks like you're screwed.

328
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,774
Ooh. Oh…

329
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:53,155
I just kept wondering why I ended up
in this shithole…

330
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,617
…instead of where I wanted to be
on the Animal Paradise show.

331
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,786
Looks like I got the answer.

332
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,996
Hey.

333
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,706
What's your future look like?

334
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,501
Youngest killer ever?

335
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,669
Maybe they'll call me devil spawn.

336
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,631
Yeah, my goal is 100 victims.

337
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,965
Pfft, whatever.

338
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,843
No, pricks like you
don't get called killer

339
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,178
or even devil spawn, no, no.

340
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,262
Just one word…

341
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,431
losers.

342
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,725
You're just a loser
that's reached the end of the road.

343
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,310
There's no way out of this for you.

344
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,978
Too young for prison?

345
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,356
Yeah, maybe you don't have legal issues,

346
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,191
that doesn't matter in the work I do.

347
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,526
Your rights?

348
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,653
Hmm… couldn't care less about that.

349
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,114
There is one thing we do care about.

350
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,448
You ever heard of the, uh…

351
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,033
the Hall of Pain?

352
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,953
These media vultures will do anything
to help their ratings.

353
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,164
And they don't care
whose lives they destroy in the process.

354
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,667
They're gonna air all your secrets.

355
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,293
The Hall of Pain.

356
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,173
What's your… What's your point?

357
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,968
An unbelievable IQ
and still not so bright.

358
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,972
This is why
children need to work on their EQ.

359
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,810
Listen to me, loser.

360
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,895
By Hall of Pain…

361
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,023
I mean that I'll use my camera

362
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,733
to show the world your crimes

363
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,319
so no one ever forgets
your tormented face.

364
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,572
That's the gist of it anyway.

365
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,701
Your immortal video
will torture you forever.

366
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,287
Even after you die.

367
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,581
So…

368
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,708
good luck.

369
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,628
What the hell?

370
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,715
It's my phone,

371
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,008
not my camera.

372
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,803
No college for you either, huh?

373
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,980
What the hell?

374
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:53,192
I was thinking this was my room,
we were both pretty freaked out.

375
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,361
You guys are just standing there
calling yourselves law enforcement?

376
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,989
What is this?
I ought to… report all you guys.

377
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,618
- I'm going home.
- Oh, of course.

378
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,287
Excuse me, sir!

379
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,872
Sir!

380
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,540
Hey! Hey, wait up!

381
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,791
I just wanna…

382
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,252
talk for a second.

383
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,718
You're a producer for Trigger, right?

384
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,138
Promise you'll cover this story.

385
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,516
What?

386
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,519
If you guys don't report on this,

387
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,063
I'll arrest you
for everything you just did.

388
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,856
So be smart about this.

389
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:34,858
Good luck.

390
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,326
Yes, Mother.

391
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,495
Our lawyer just let us know…

392
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,455
…the old man's timely death
was a godsend.

393
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,793
Right, that man coerced him

394
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,586
into doing those things.

395
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,047
Oh, just a second.

396
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,299
Yes.

397
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,634
Okay.

398
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,278
Gonna need something bigger
in order to take them down here.

399
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,200
To Be Demolished

400
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,671
So this thing's a camera?

401
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,298
This is it.

402
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,592
I put a really small camera inside here.
It's pretty sneaky.

403
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,178
Ah, modern technology.

404
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,432
This thing's going to film anyone
who sneaks their way in

405
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,683
whenever you're not here.

406
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,187
Let's see if the evil bastard
who took your cat ever comes back here.

407
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,192
I'm sure you know,
but nobody needs to know it's here.

408
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,530
He must like you. The pants wetter.

409
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,116
Huh?

410
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,826
I'm a seer,

411
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,747
and I… I can read folks pretty good.

412
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,717
Ugh, seriously…

413
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,427
I thought we were on the same side.

414
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,472
Thought I could trust you. Huh.

415
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,974
- Check around the back of the house.
- Yes, sir.

416
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,561
Come on, this thing's all melted.

417
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,729
It won't even turn on.

418
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,272
Oh. Let me see.

419
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,108
Whoa! I wouldn't do that.

420
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,361
If you're keeping evidence from us,

421
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,653
you'll be guilty
of obstruction of justice.

422
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,946
I don't know if it's evidence,

423
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,615
but it's our private property for sure.

424
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,575
Of course, we are public broadcasting so…

425
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,743
Argh, you…

426
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,913
Would you let an expert I know see it?
And we both check it together?

427
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,543
-That's all you're asking?
-Uh, well…

428
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,379
it'd be nice if you could…

429
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,006
share the travel records
of someone as well.

430
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,177
Mmm…

431
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,597
It's a lot more damaged
than I was led to believe…

432
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,141
- …over the phone.
- Is that a no?

433
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,519
I told you
to let the Forensic Service do this.

434
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,188
We've got all the new technology now.

435
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,066
Trust me, if I can't do this,
no one else in Korea can either.

436
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:25,529
-Now… who's receiving the results?
-Right over here, guy.

437
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,322
What's that blinking? Is that a signal?

438
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,534
Are you still at it? Oh, my God.

439
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,953
After I came all this way
just like you asked me to?

440
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,579
Uh, it's just a magnesium deficiency.

441
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,914
Magnesium? No, it isn't.

442
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,291
So about the… travel records…

443
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,418
You know how it works.

444
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,670
You'll sit tight
until we confirm the results.

445
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,594
Now where is he?

446
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,347
When I find that guy, he's dead meat.

447
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,891
Uh, I think he went down there, sir.

448
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,186
Jesus Christ, man,
why won't you ever answer your phone?

449
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,022
The least you could do
is tell me where you're going.

450
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,774
I've been looking forever for you.

451
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,317
We need teamwork.

452
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,861
Understand?

453
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,155
Ignore me, yeah. Again. Huh.

454
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,870
Now that's good teamwork,
peeing as a unit.

455
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:18,039
Therefore, we've decided
that we can no longer sit idly by…

456
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,376
Right. We should be good to go.

457
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,752
Okay.

458
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,129
This investigation's still ongoing.

459
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,089
This investigation is still ongoing.

460
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,550
Nevertheless, internet trolls
are harassing our client.

461
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,303
We will not just sit quietly
accepting this malicious behavior,

462
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:34,014
irreparably damaging our client,
who's still a minor.

463
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,726
From this point forward,
we will be taking legal action

464
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,603
against those who leave malicious comments

465
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,147
or spread rumors and fake news online.

466
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,315
That is all.

467
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,441
Sir, I have a question.

468
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,818
I'm sorry,
but we aren't taking questions today.

469
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,653
How about facts?
Are you taking those?

470
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,909
Son Junyeong intentionally made
a false report to a producer

471
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,828
during the serial
cat killing investigation.

472
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,538
Were you aware of that fact?

473
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,168
That's baseless speculation.

474
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,252
Once again, we will be pursuing--

475
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,338
- One more thing.
- Hey, don't--

476
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,547
Son Junyeong claims

477
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,841
Mr. Yoon sexually assaulted him
and ordered him to kill,

478
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,385
but were you aware
of the fact that Mr. Son,

479
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,471
days before, disguised as a woman,

480
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,389
threatened the old man
with a deadly weapon?

481
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,975
Did that really happen?

482
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,477
Thank you,
we have nothing more at this time.

483
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,728
No, wait, no, I'm not finished--

484
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,487
Can you share any information?

485
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,531
Well, uh… I, uh…

486
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,076
I've onl… only been
with the company a week. Very sorry.

487
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,912
What'd you hope to accomplish?

488
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,664
He killed all of them, that asshole.

489
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,332
The prick deserves what's coming.

490
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:43,917
Listen closely, Mr. Han,

491
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,711
since you don't have
a quarter of that kid's intellect.

492
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,339
You think the truth's coming out?
That's the way this ends?

493
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,508
The kid gets punished
and apologizes for everything he did?

494
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,634
Uh, no.

495
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,220
No, and that is exactly why I did
what I did just now.

496
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,389
Let's review what you did.

497
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,392
If you made that up to pressure him,
that's defamation.

498
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,270
And if it's true,
they still sue you for factual defamation.

499
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,813
You keep getting summoned to court

500
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,232
and all your time and your money
goes to defending yourself

501
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,568
while that kid plays games
in his fancy house.

502
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,237
Oh, shit.

503
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,866
I think I'm the one who caused this.

504
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,577
Had I not gone over there…

505
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,623
to see that old man…

506
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,625
He'd be alive?

507
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,836
Is that what you think?

508
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,090
Spending your life
dwelling on hypothetical what-ifs

509
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,342
is absolutely
the dumbest thing you can do.

510
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,261
It already happened, it's done.

511
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,139
And furthermore, you're not the story,
the victims here are.

512
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,350
No more pity parties from you.
And no more crying.

513
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,603
So, shut the hell up and just do your job.

514
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,148
What if I cover this story?

515
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,818
Is there any way
that monster goes to jail?

516
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,156
It's such a fucked up law
that minors get away with these crimes.

517
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,616
How do we change it?

518
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,159
Seems to me like…

519
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,161
you're looking for reassurance.

520
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,289
Well, I'm definitely gonna need something
to continue doing this.

521
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,125
Hope is never obvious.

522
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,587
It's not something you can find out there.

523
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
Why is it that I'm the one left behind

524
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,310
when Han Do shit the bed?

525
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,398
If you want assurance from me,
let's get going. I'll show you.

526
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,696
All right, here we go.

527
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,239
We'll start with the bad news.

528
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,533
I wasn't able to extract any audio.

529
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,204
Uh, it isn't all there,
but being such a master of the craft,

530
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,792
I did… manage to recover
the footage of the crime itself.

531
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,168
Uh…

532
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,813
Man, that hurts like hell.

533
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,695
This is self-defense.

534
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,041
What do you think… he was grabbing at?

535
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,460
Well,
that's for the detective to find out.

536
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,171
It's a bit too small… to decipher.

537
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,048
Now, here it is.

538
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,594
How did you think
to put a camera there anyway, huh?

539
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,388
The life of a producer,
you know?

540
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,599
All right then, I'll be off
once I've had a chat with Ms. Oh.

541
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,727
Okay, I'll just wait downstairs
with Mr. Bae.

542
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,146
Hmm…

543
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,232
This will cause quite a stir
once it makes the news.

544
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,568
Ms. Oh,
we couldn't have done it without you.

545
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,652
Uh…

546
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,529
Detective.

547
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,408
In your press briefing,
could you… leave our names out?

548
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,410
Where is this humility coming from?

549
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,662
It's not humility, just being careful.

550
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,167
Once it's out that we were involved,
what Han Do did will come to light.

551
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,377
Everybody who loves gossip

552
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,255
will drag him over the coals
for doing this or that…

553
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,174
Weathering the storm

554
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,050
and surviving the hits

555
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,719
is how you grow as a person.

556
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,345
Again, just being careful.

557
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,349
Now to those travel records…

558
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,896
There are no records of a Cho Haewon
entering Korea whatsoever.

559
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,689
-Not at all?
-Two possibilities.

560
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,982
Either she never entered,

561
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,276
or somehow,
she changed her personal information.

562
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,736
That's as far as I can go.

563
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,821
There's always people watching.

564
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,282
Oh, Ms. Oh, you're done.

565
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,575
Here you go.

566
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,078
Whose number is this?

567
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,455
Mingeun's father.

568
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,248
It was fate.
I was in the ER earlier

569
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,374
and he just walked in.

570
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,336
I told him I was a producer at Trigger
and he agreed to an interview.

571
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,630
This is fate telling me to nail it.
Don't you think?

572
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:01,049
All right then,
I'm heading to Mingeun's house with Do.

573
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,300
Why don't you interview them alone?

574
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,678
What the hell?

575
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,473
Go by yourself.

576
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,392
You don't mind going overboard
when no one asked you to,

577
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,311
but you bail whenever we need you.

578
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,938
How do I deal with that?

579
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,607
-That's not what--
-I don't need to hear your excuses.

580
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,984
You know, respecting your team members
is the least you could do.

581
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,529
- Hey--
- God! Why do you hate everything?

582
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,368
-I get it, okay? I'm coming. I'm coming.
-No, stay here, see if I care!

583
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,578
Let's go, okay?
Let's go. Let's go!

584
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,580
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

585
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,291
Let's go, Mr. Bae!

586
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,211
Thank you for agreeing to this interview.

587
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,421
I'm sure things can't be easy
for you right now.

588
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,465
I had no choice with all that's happened.

589
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,677
Having a hard time trusting anyone at all.

590
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,264
I know it must be difficult,
but the police are doing all they can.

591
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,183
We're going to do everything in our power
to help you as well.

592
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,979
Uh, um… this is Han Do,
one of our producers.

593
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,022
And, uh, I'm Kang Giho.

594
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,151
- What…
- Ah, ah…

595
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:08,074
I'm not sure why Han Do is on the ground.
Uh, um…

596
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,876
Huh?

597
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:31,014
- Get out! Get out!
- I'm not wearing shoes!

598
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,974
I'm barefoot! God, that hurts.
Ma'am, wait! Wait!

599
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,100
Ma'am, just a second!

600
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,687
Ma'am! Ugh, ma'am!

601
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,149
What the hell's your deal?

602
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,233
Come on!

603
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,776
What kind of person goes around

604
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,820
flipping off
random strangers on the street?

605
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,197
My God! You could've given me
a heads-up at least.

606
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,991
These people have had it
bad enough as it is

607
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,701
without us adding to their misery.

608
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,954
That's why I said
I wasn't coming to this interview.

609
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,373
I mean, you're afraid of tiny puppies
that are this big?

610
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,791
You? Animal Paradise?

611
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,336
That really was a "what the fuck," dude.
What the fuck?

612
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,338
Hey, people like me exist.
You can like something

613
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,756
-you're afraid of.
-Shut up at once!

614
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,259
Please.

615
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,761
You see what you did?

616
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,513
Stop making people say horrible things.
Can you do that?

617
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,223
We gotta go back to the office.

618
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,267
Oh, man, what are we gonna do?

619
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:18,227
Ms. Hong, Ms. Oh, Chief,
they're gonna…

620
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,522
Oh, God, we're so screwed.
We are so royally screwed.

621
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,611
Are you a reporter?

622
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,949
Why?

623
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,286
That's all right,
it's not a pleasant story.

624
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,790
What?

625
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,252
Junyeong, I know it's tough, okay?

626
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,880
But that's why you should focus
on solving your equations

627
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,548
- and get in the right headsp--
- Get off, bitch!

628
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,300
I don't need this shit for med school!

629
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,760
For fuck's sake.

630
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,595
My goodness.

631
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:58,184
Jesus Christ, how much trouble
has the kid gotten himself into overnight?

632
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,520
Ma'am, you're not keeping…

633
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,939
…anything else from me, are you?

634
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,774
Huh?

635
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,447
Uh… no.
I've told you everything. Everything.

636
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,492
I mean, what could be worse
than what he's already done?

637
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:16,119
To confirm, I have everything?

638
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,996
Right. Mm…

639
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,755
The, uh, interview…

640
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,424
I think it's off.

641
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,508
What?

642
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,137
What the hell? Are you crazy?

643
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:38,141
No, uh… H-Han-- Han Do actually
gave the kid's mom, uh, the finger.

644
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,350
You know, one of these?

645
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,935
The finger?

646
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,729
Well, uh, he didn't do it today…

647
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,980
…but that's why they kicked us out

648
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,064
- without our shoes on.
- What do we do?

649
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,191
Mingeun's father just sent me a text.

650
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,028
He says he'll file a report
if we call him again.

651
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,365
For these kinds of cases,

652
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,742
the greatest weapons we have

653
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,702
for winning over our viewers…

654
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,620
…are the parents' tears.

655
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,081
We open with the tears
to grab the viewers and make them--

656
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,708
That'd be playing for pity.

657
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,880
I think showing the killer's cruelty
and dangerous tendencies

658
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,424
is always a better approach than just…

659
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,051
capitalizing on misery.

660
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,928
You're talking like
you didn't derail our whole operation.

661
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,180
Are you a sociopath?

662
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,806
What about the old man?

663
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,350
Not only does he lose his life,

664
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,312
they then frame him as the offender,
ruining his memory.

665
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,606
That's why I think
we open with Son Junyeong…

666
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,485
…and not the victims.

667
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,948
Wait, you actually met the kid?

668
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,200
H… How though?

669
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,871
Oh, you know, a little hospital visit.

670
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,331
So, wait…

671
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,957
that's where you were
when I couldn't find you?

672
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,709
- Wow.
- Sweetie…

673
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:48,878
that was brave.

674
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,214
Why didn't you tell us sooner about that?

675
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,341
I could have too, if it wasn't illegal.

676
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:56,219
That means this recording won't be able
to be used on air, right, Ms. Oh?

677
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,846
We'll film
a good old-fashioned reenactment,

678
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,599
and then we'll just top it off
with the audio from this.

679
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,725
That should do the trick.

680
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,976
No problem.

681
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,687
Uh… Huh?

682
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,272
I'm gonna go interview someone with Giho.

683
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:11,150
Wai… What? What interview?
What are you talking about?

684
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,485
They'll beat us to death
if we go back there.

685
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,611
Not them.

686
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,114
I think he killed someone else.

687
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,951
Someone before this.

688
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,704
I keep thinking
about what you said earlier.

689
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,332
What did you mean,
it's not a pleasant story?

690
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:31,003
I think it was four years ago.

691
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,757
There was a family with two children.

692
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,552
A brother in third grade
and one who was developmentally disabled.

693
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,596
- Five years old. He died in an accident.
- We have a child

694
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,098
who inhaled too much water.

695
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:43,558
- He's not breathing at all!
- The crazy thing is…

696
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,478
word spread fast among the moms
that the child's death wasn't an accident.

697
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,730
What happened if it wasn't an accident?

698
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,191
The rumor was

699
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,860
the older brother murdered him.

700
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,821
The family was in Apartment 106,
Unit 1806

701
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,906
from the case
that made the news recently…

702
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,076
and the older brother from back then

703
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,787
is actually Son Junyeong himself.

704
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,253
Don't.

705
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,173
You may go home now.

706
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,885
I can take it from here.

707
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,720
Yes, but ma'am…

708
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,430
I said go.

709
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:27,476
And the police
didn't even bother investigating

710
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,228
whether it had been
a murder or an accident?

711
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,190
You said there were wounds
on Son Junyeong's hands and wrists?

712
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,443
Junyeong's mother…
said those were because of his eczema.

713
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,112
What were the cops gonna do,
argue against a parent?

714
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,406
Did he actually have eczema though?

715
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,701
The kid's skin has been flawlessly white
since he was born. Really.

716
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,204
The younger child had the issues.

717
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,747
The mother never gave him love.

718
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,709
I was wondering if me doing this

719
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:55,004
might be too risky
if this interview goes on the air?

720
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,215
I'm the only one
who ever worked in that house.

721
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,760
We'll edit you out
if that's what you want.

722
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,305
Really? I would feel better if you did.

723
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,682
What the heck are you saying?

724
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,560
The episode will be pretty mild
without the bombshells though.

725
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,563
Son Junyeong will probably get released.

726
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,901
He told me
his goal was to kill 100 people.

727
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,362
-Wait, what?
-I'd be his third.

728
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,614
And his fourth…

729
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,741
would it be you?

730
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,160
I'm not-- No. What? We never even met.

731
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,411
Oh, that's right.

732
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,333
You were there a long time, weren't you?

733
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,752
-Uh-huh.
-So, to be safe,

734
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,128
we should get our names changed.

735
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,047
Or no, what are your thoughts on moving?

736
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,841
-Like abroad somewhere?
-W-Well, there's always plastic surgery.

737
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,718
That's good!
Do you know a good plastic surgeon?

738
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,971
There's one
across the street from the office.

739
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,140
Does he, um,
wanna kill 100 people, really?

740
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,145
We should air this.

741
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,983
What the hell are they gonna do?
Yeah, please do it.

742
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,985
Oh, ma'am, thank you.

743
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,927
Cut. Cut!

744
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,806
You sneezed so many times
that I lost count already!

745
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:30,433
I told you to keep it in, didn't I?

746
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,476
And I told you I didn't want to.

747
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,561
I got allergies, man.

748
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,979
Allergies…

749
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,480
He says he's got allergies.

750
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,399
Did I not tell you
that building this whole set

751
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,650
puts us way over budget?

752
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,279
Didn't I say that?
Are you gonna pay for us to hire an actor?

753
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:45,865
Also, you're scared of dogs,
but cool with cats? What's that about?

754
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,575
-Yes.
-Yes?

755
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,869
I don't love cats though.
I'm more of a dog person.

756
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,832
You are so extremely difficult.

757
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,376
-Okay, Mr. Ha? Let's reset.
-Hurry up. Come on.

758
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,753
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just one more.

759
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,213
Hold it in. Don't you sneeze on me.

760
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,673
Just don't, please.

761
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,884
And what is that smell?

762
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,386
Uh… Mr. Bae,
do you have to smoke on set?

763
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,388
Are we ready to shoot? I'll throw it out.

764
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,433
What an eventful night we're having.

765
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,728
All right, everyone. And… standby.

766
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,563
Action!

767
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,231
Come on! I said stop that!

768
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,151
Are you still not done?

769
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:27,490
No, I'm done,
I just wanted to go over it again.

770
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:31,494
They found Mingeun's eyes.

771
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,663
Really? Where?

772
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,500
Mr. Yoon had them apparently.

773
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,421
That's what was in his hands in that clip?

774
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,554
Wow…

775
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:53,808
They must have been connected
in their past lives, huh?

776
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,650
- Good luck then.
- Right.

777
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:09,115
I have to start editing now.
Sad face, sad face.

778
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,200
I'll come to see you later on.
Early in the morning.

779
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,785
-Kissy Princess.
-Yeah.

780
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,120
Shooting heart.

781
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,873
Okay. Let's finish this right now.

782
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,667
Let's do this!

783
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,129
By Hall of Pain…

784
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,840
"Hall of Pain," really?

785
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,134
What a guy, this joker, huh?

786
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,318
Episode 1784
The Old Man Who Burns Cats

787
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,113
- Hmm.
- Oh, you got graphics too.

788
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,322
What do you think?

789
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,032
It felt cinematic.

790
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,742
Who thought up the opening?

791
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,621
You soap opera guys know your stuff.

792
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,374
We should be good
once we cut out the gore.

793
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,500
- Mm-hmm.
- We used stuffed animals.

794
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,210
- I know.
- Oh.

795
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,962
You guys are a good team after all.

796
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,630
Yes…

797
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,468
Hey, Mr. Bae can act.

798
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,094
Stop using Mr. Bae, you punk.

799
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,517
A chilling urban legend

800
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,312
started making rounds
on some online forums a few months ago.

801
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,274
The story goes that the old man
would appear in the streets

802
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,984
only under the cover of night.

803
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,114
However, after digging deeper
into what was happening,

804
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,284
our team instead
uncovered the true horror…

805
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:40,289
of a young prodigy
who grew up to become a monster.

806
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,462
Though Mr. Yoon burned to death,

807
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,006
Mingeun's eyes were found intact,

808
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,009
tightly clasped… in Yoon's hands.

809
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,678
We have obtained video evidence

810
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:58,724
telling a very different story
from that given by Mr. Son

811
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,101
that it was Yoon
who had orchestrated everything.

812
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,855
I can't be tried as an adult,
so I can't go to prison.

813
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,398
My goal is 100 victims.

814
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,734
That kid had the most beautiful eyes.

815
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,445
To the boy turned monster,
disregarding the value of life,

816
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,782
the life of an animal,
the life of a human,

817
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,868
these were
no more than mere trophies to brag about.

818
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,495
Does this monster

819
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,040
exploiting his own legal status
as a minor

820
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,376
to make a mockery of the value of life

821
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:28,504
truly deserve to be exempt
from his crimes?

822
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,341
Oh Soryong with Trigger,
a voice for all the voiceless,

823
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,093
we are… their last resort.

824
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,178
Goddamn it!

825
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,097
Junyeong.

826
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,099
Junyeong. Junyeong!

827
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,267
Junyeong.

828
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,603
What are we going to do?

829
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,939
- Take him away.
- Stay back!

830
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,315
- Get away!
- Stay back!

831
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,192
- Ma'am, please move aside.
- Wait, wait, wait!

832
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,945
- No! Get away! Stop!
- Get away! Let me go! Get off!

833
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,530
Get away from him!

834
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,407
- Let go of me, you perverts!
- Stay still!

835
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,117
Let go of me! Stop it!

836
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,743
Let me go! Get off me!

837
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,704
- Let go of me, you fuckers!
- Calm down.

838
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,511
Move.

839
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,851
- You! You bastards!
- Whoa, what's this now?

840
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,269
Just stop!

841
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,397
-Hey, come on!
-You ruined my son's future!

842
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,898
You think you'll get away with this?

843
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,026
I figured you'd say thank you.

844
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,360
What?

845
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,154
Edmund Kemper.

846
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,198
The Co-Ed Killer with an IQ of 145.

847
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,493
He liked to brutally torture animals
at an early age.

848
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,703
A few years later…

849
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,831
his first murders were his grandparents.

850
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,709
And then in his final act of horror,

851
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,794
his mother was his target.

852
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,173
Not even 10 years later.

853
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,259
He hit her on the head
with a hammer to kill her,

854
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,762
then chopped off her head
to use as a dartboard.

855
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,934
You should be grateful
we intervened in time.

856
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,320
The least you could do
is pretend to feel some remorse

857
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,529
for the ones…

858
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,574
who died so you didn't have to.

859
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,078
You're an adult.

860
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,874
You're the mother of that child

861
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,294
and the one who died,
so please act like it.

862
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:45,140
All right, let's go.
Okay? Let's go.

863
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,689
Can I ride in a different car?

864
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,404
She's in the other car.
Let's go.

865
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:05,911
Ma'am! Ma'am!

866
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,083
I'm resigning.

867
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,668
You lied to me.

868
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:15,879
I hate taking cases
that'll haunt me down the road.

869
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,717
All right.

870
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,824
National Assembly Passes Bill
To Name New Law After Mingeun

871
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,868
I can't believe
the cops let her in on the investigation.

872
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,162
Ms. Oh's freaking cool, huh?

873
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,246
- Uh-huh.
- Huh?

874
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,330
Huh?

875
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,750
Oh, wow, you agree?

876
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,793
Go home.

877
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,755
Or have a celebratory beer
for your first story.

878
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,424
I actually
have to edit everything for the reruns.

879
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,760
There won't be any reruns.

880
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,305
That boy's very wealthy father
has just informed us

881
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,639
that he'll be scouring the episode

882
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,184
in order to sue us
if we get any details wrong.

883
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,393
We can't give them any more ammo.

884
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,020
So it's the debut and finale for this one?

885
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,688
You'll be working on stories like that
till you're dead.

886
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,983
Would the company card be too much to ask
for his producing debut?

887
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,658
All right, fine.

888
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,872
Thank you! Thank… you!

889
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,291
Wow, I get to use
the chief's company card.

890
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,043
-The fabled "triple-C."
-What?

891
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:37,377
It's an honor, sir.
All hail the card.

892
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,087
- Can we get some steaks?
- Hey.

893
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,673
Cows are expensive.
Go get samgyeopsal instead.

894
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,467
Pigs are cuter than cows.

895
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,344
Uh, so, uh, hey…

896
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,972
Uh, Ms. Hong, he's asking for you.

897
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:50,808
Me?

898
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,520
Yeah, I'm also gonna need…
a key to the cabinet.

899
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,189
If you would just tell me which files,
I'm sure I can get them--

900
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,982
You want me to ask permission
for every little thing?

901
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,778
Make a copy if you don't have a spare.

902
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,156
Nice work.

903
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,075
Hey, man…

904
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,910
…he said no steaks
'cause cows are expensive,

905
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,036
what about the lamb place?

906
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,830
-I have an appointment.
-Huh?

907
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,251
I should get going.

908
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:19,127
Han Do.

909
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,129
Will your appointment take long? Hey!

910
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,966
Has he heard… all the rumors or something?

Spread out the payments…

921
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,645
…for as long as you can. Thanks.

923

Watch your step there.

924
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,279
How are you, sir?
Are you holding up?

925
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,157

Excuse me.

928
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:41,705
Is this the funeral
for the elderly man from the show?

929
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,206
Uh… uh, yes.

930
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,710
This is the funeral for Mr. Yoon Namgi.

931
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,713
We saw what happened on TV
and looked up where this was.

932
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,049
Can we pay our respects?

933
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,301
Oh, yeah, of course.

934
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,232
Go ahead and pay your respects.

935
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,359
Come on in.

936
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,131
-Just a second.
-Ah, sure.

937
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:41,098
Find it yet?

938
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,434
Find what?

939
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,561
Your reassurance

940
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,032
What are we doing today?

941
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,829
How about something…

942
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,500
a little different?

943
