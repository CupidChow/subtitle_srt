BUILDING COMPLETION CEREMONY

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,064
On this day, I, Koo Hyeongtae,

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,357
am declaring an all-out war
on misinformation.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,735
We'll be working with law enforcement

9
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,446
to get to the bottom
of this vile act of cyberterrorism.

10
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,199
No. Please don't jump to
any conclusions

11
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,909
before you've heard
both sides of the story.

12
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,077
No, we're not responsible

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,203
-for what happened with the Haven--
-Hang up.

14
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,996
Didn't I tell you
not to take these prank calls?

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,248
- Ms. Hong.
- What are you doing, Ms. Hong?

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,000
-You wanted to take those?
-No!

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,460
What is this, North Korea?

18
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,920
Who's even watching this anyway?

19
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,339
And to our employees,
your full cooperation is much appreciated.

20
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,801
Songi said it's the anniversary
of her mom's death.

21
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,177
Has anyone seen her yet?

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,137
Her mom is dead? When'd that happen?

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,347
Songi's only in her early twenties.

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,183
Sweetie, you type fast,
and you're great at what you do,

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,644
but your cheekbones do stick out a bit.

26
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,395
Physiognomy tells me you like to pry.

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,772
Maybe facial contouring would help?

28
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,565
Nope, but chopping off your tongue would.

29
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,067
Oh, and about the raunchy video
from yesterday.

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,193
I don't think that was a deepfake.

31
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,402
Ms. Hong, do you think--

32
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,661
Whoa, is it "bring your dog to work" day?

33
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,413
Oh, you're the new guy, right?

34
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,499
I'm Seo Jeongseok. Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,084
Sorry, my hands are sweaty.

36
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,044
My name is Han Do.

37
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,173
My name's Yoon Byeonggeun. I'm a producer.

38
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,676
I'm your senior,
so I'd recommend shaking my hand.

39
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,356
Oh hey, what's with the funeral getup?

40
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,482
You really don't know?

41
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,110
They're rounding everyone up
because of yesterday's incident.

42
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,194
President Koo's a natural

43
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,863
when it comes to
putting out fires like this.

44
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,490
If someone told me
he majored in media firefighting,

45
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,867
-I'd believe it.
-Media firefighting, yeah.

46
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,368
He was so quick to respond,
it's almost as if

47
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,288
he knew this would happen.
It's a little suspicious.

48
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,831
You think President Koo is Dr. Trigger?

49
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,915
No way, man.

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,710
He might hold a deep grudge against us,
but he's still our Great Leader.

51
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,380
I dunno…
that would be a pretty shady move.

52
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,548
On-brand though.

53
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,758

some dirt on the president.

-That's great. Love it.

00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,892
Why mess with a story
that will never see the light of day?

58

I mean, let's just take him out
and be done with it.

00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,271
I know you're just joking around,
but that's crossing the line.

60
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,565
- Someone could hear you.
- You think I'm joking?

61
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,442
We've been on Trigger for a while.

62

00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283

We did, sir.

90
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,867
There were rumors
that she'd returned to Korea,

91
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,202
that she was living abroad,

92
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,373
and as it turns out,
she's been in the States for 20 years.

What, I'm not allowed
to ask Millenials questions now?

"Well, that's unique"

instead of thinking up gifts,

163

167

It might've been the right move.

171
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,737
It wasn't a porno,
it was illegal material.

172
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,405
And I should note,
it might've been a deepfake.

175
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,704
so if you could send
some additional resources to--

176
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,206
You still don't get it, do you?

177
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,833
-Your show's at risk of cancellation.
-Canc…

178
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,128
Uh, President Koo, I mean…
I just think that canceling our show

179
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,255
over one incident might be a bit…

180
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,757
-a bit too--
-A bit too harsh?

181
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,552
That travel show we canceled had
double the ratings of your pitiful show.

182
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
And you scumbags refuse to take ads.

183
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,641
The industry's under strain,
but what would you know about that?

184
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,392
I don't care how iconic your show is,

185
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,437
if you tank our reputation
and don't bring in money, you're done.

186
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,898
You think the president
can't do that much?

187
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,319
So you want to cancel our show
over unverified fake news,

188
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,947
because we don't bring enough revenue,
and the public's upset?

189
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,740
I got that right?

190
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,619
Uh… Let me explain, sir.

191
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,413
Ms. Oh isn't quite seeing
the big picture just yet.

192
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,834
Soryong, you think you're hot shit
because you run a highly acclaimed show?

193
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,628
We've all been there, okay?

194
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,880
Trigger's accomplishments
are not your doing.

195
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,758
You're just riding on the coattails
of your seniors' success.

196
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,553
During harder times,
we managed to run a tight ship

197
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,887
and avoid these controversies.

198
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,306
I'd say we're doing just as well
as our seniors did.

199
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,850
Huh.

200
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,938
Then how would you like to duke it out
with one of the big dogs?

201
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,275
-What?
-You and I will go head-to-head

202
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,943
and we'll see who comes out on top.

203
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,903
If I can catch Dr. Trigger first,

204
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,446
then that's a wrap on your show.

205
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,075
And in the unlikely event that it's you,
cancellation plans will be paused.

206
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,827
You'll get a grace period.
What do you say?

207
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,912
Please, President Koo,
the guys in our department

208
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,124
are sleep-deprived enough as it is,
if they have to do this now too--

209
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,625
Getting cold feet?

210
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,502
Why should we keep you around

211
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,963
if you can't even find
a petty criminal like this?

212
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,008
Challenge accepted.

213
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,556
There'll be no exchange of information
between us.

214
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,683
So fair play.

215
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,396
What on earth were you thinking,
taking him up on that?

216
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,189
I'm gonna investigate
the Cha Seongwook case

217
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,816
while he's busy with Dr. Trigger.

218
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,651
Cha…

219
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,320
Are you out of your damn mind?

220
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,696
I told you a million times to stop!

221
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,115
Look.

222
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,326
If he manages to get to our guy first,
then we're totally screwed!

223
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,953
Hey, we're going get him first.

224
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,872
You just said you'd work on Cha Seongwook.

225
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,540
So then who… who… who is "we"?

226
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,417
Me?

227
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,668
For Christ's sakes, I'm the chief.

228
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,838
What, you think I'm just farting around
with nothing better to do? Huh?

229
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,132
No one ever said you'd do it alone.

230
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,216
Think about it.

231
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,969
The Cha Seongwook case is
one of the top unsolved cases in Korea.

232
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,181
Not a single show's
dared to touch it for two decades.

233
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,807
Who stands to gain the most

234
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,601
if we manage to hit a home run?

235
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,729
Cancellation?
They'll beg us for an interview.

236
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,315
I'll ride down with you.

237
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,233
Oh, of course, sir.

238
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,401
Oh, right.

239
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,072
Who took over for the producer
who quit over PTSD?

240
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh, uh…

241
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,743
Uh, we were actually
just talking about that.

242
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,037
How about we let that rookie of yours
try his hand?

243
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,123
Sheesh. Isn't this a new building?

244
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,502
Uh, is the rookie you're referring to…
Mr. Han?

245
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,213
I've talked to him, he's one smart fellow.
Great credentials.

246
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,633
Yeah, but still…
I'm not sure somebody so new should be--

247
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,719
Your show's about to get canceled,
so why not take a few risks?

248
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,013
Why don't we start
by addressing some outdated rules?

249
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,307
We've got an experienced AP,
Kang Giho.

250
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,267
But our company, as we know,

251
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,478
historically hasn't allowed
contractors to lead.

252
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,646
Mm-hmm. That's right.

253
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,526
Okay.

254
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,112
Why don't you send over
the guy's portfolio?

255
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,289
Do people ever say
you remind them of a cat?

256
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,375
Your energy is very feline.

257
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,294
Mr. Han.

258
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,839
Look people in the eye
when they talk to you.

259
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,382
I kind of prefer not to.

260
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,972
I'm gonna be straight with you.

261
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,516
Do you think… you're a nepo hire?

262
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,188
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I'm asking because we're in this together.

263
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,441
If you don't wanna answer the question…

264
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,276
…then you can choose to remain silent.

265
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,696
I don't know, I'm not sure this counts.

266
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,242
Mr. Son Huiwon did have a hand
in getting me assigned here.

267
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,706
But wouldn't a nepo hire
be given a higher position?

268
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,291
To me, this feels like…

269
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,044
I couldn't be any further down.

270
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,723
♪ Just close your eyes and fall ♪

271
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:51,395
♪ Trust me, close your eyes and fall ♪

272
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,063
♪ Just close… ♪

273
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,566
Listen up.

274
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,028
This team doesn't bring in money
like Soap Operas.

275
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,531
Our pride and principles
don't allow us to run ads.

276
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,283
And that, for the past 10 years,

277
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,912
has made us the viewers'
number one most trusted show.

278
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,582
Of all the investigative shows on the air,
our ratings are the highest.

279
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,959
We're this company's household program.

280
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,045
Trigger.

281
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,672
You got it?

282
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:23,427
I'm sure James Son, Mr. Ivy League,
managed to pull some strings

283
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,554
landing you, a decent enough guy,

284
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,599
but a terrible fit! Right here.

285
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,062
Our new guy. Our nepo hire.

286
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,647
All right then. Okay?

287
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,357
Now that's cleared up. Hmm?

288
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,441
This is for you.

289
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,653
Okay, Chief, Ms. Hong? Our meeting.

290
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,446
Uh-huh, right, uh… let's go.

291
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,367
What was that?
Who won that fight? I'm confused.

292
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,661
It was pee-guy for sure.
He definitely just pissed his pants.

293
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,996
No way,
someone peed in the office?

294
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,666
Huh?

295
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,001
Are you shitting me?

296
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,754
Why would you wait so long
to tell me he's a pee-bomber?

297
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,214
We haven't fact-checked
nor confirmed that.

298
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,590
But I heard it from our very own Jiyun.

299
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,344
Every word-of-mouth story
is a mixture of both fact and fiction.

300
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,180
Pee or not, he must've done something,
or we wouldn't be talking about this!

301
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,100
Oh, no.
Just imagine him getting upset at you

302
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,144
then one day he comes in
and he's peed all over your plants! Huh?

303
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,188
You think…

304
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,607
only Mr. Son wants to mess with us
or President Koo as well?

305
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,568
Whoever it was that sent this guy over,

306
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,862
it was a pretty lame attempt at sabotage.

307
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,781
You know what happens when
you trust a young soldier with a bomb?

308
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,700
They blow up the wrong thing
and then hide.

309
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,285
The guy's quaking in his boots.

310
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,120
So don't let some pee-bomb scare you.

311
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,204
You know how it is.

312
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,039
People are crazy these days.

313
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,709
They'll gun you down
over even the tiniest insult.

314
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,168
You should keep your guard up, Ms. Hong.

315
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,379
And I think you should be
a little less paranoid, Chief.

316
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,505
You're too much.

317
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,424
Fascinating…

318
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,509
Huh?

319
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,178
Just thinking about
our subtly obnoxious nepo hire.

320
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,681
He gets more interesting…

321
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,267
the more I watch him.

322
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,144
Any updates? Hear from the writer?

323
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,522
"Newbie: I quit. Please send me
my paycheck of 945,560 won by tomorrow."

324
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,900
Is this like a new trend or something?
Quitting over text?

325
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,319
- So fricking annoying.
- Their heart's not in it anymore.

326
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,447
In which case, it's better
they leave sooner rather than later.

327
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,365
Oh, come on,
it was 10 days! That's it!

328
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,951
It was only 10 days,
for f… fork's sake!

329
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,536
Have you ever watched our show?

330
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,792
Corpses, killings…

331
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,838
I'm honestly not a huge fan
of gratuitous violence in the media.

332
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
"Gratuitous?"

333
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,801
The stories that we cover
aren't works of fiction.

334
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,096
I'm not a huge fan of downplaying
real-world pain and tragedy.

335
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,681
You might be a nepo hire.

336
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,142
But this is an actual job, okay?

337
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,562
Whatever the real reason
you ended up on this team,

338
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
it's high time that you did some work.

339
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,858
Come on.

340
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:48,614
Here's where we keep the files and footage
used for every single episode of our show,

341
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,740
from the pilot onward.

342
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,160
The secret to investigative journalism?
You need to pick a good story.

343
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,745
Once you've gone through
all this material,

344
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,914
the makings of a good scoop
will be engrained in your head.

345
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,041
So I want you to review
everything down here and--

346
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,626
Pick a good story? Is that right?

347
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,712
That's a job for the grown-ups here.

348
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,797
But with you,

349
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,549
we're building your instincts
so that one day

350
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,134
you'll pick out the good stories.

351
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,679
I want you to review and reclassify
every single case down here,

352
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,764
separating the open from the closed ones.

353
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,308
Determine which cases are worth
a follow-up, write up a report,

354
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,602
and give it to me by tomorrow.

355
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,646
So it's just this?

356
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,274
"Just this?"
It's a little more than just filing.

357
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,985
Next!

358
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,495
This here,
is the safe where we store records

359
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,539
from the best Trigger episodes
we've aired.

360
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,041
It's valuable evidence,
and often used in court.

361
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,502
Ms. Hong is the only one of us here
with the keys.

362
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,171
So…

363
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,759
So, you want me to do this all…

364
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,595
-by tomorrow?
-No photos, no scanning.

365
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,182
And taking the materials
off the premises is strictly forbidden.

366
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,601
You got this.

367
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,947
Finding the Killer
Hwajeong Serial Murders

368
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,707
Oh, uh, hello? Yes.

369
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,876
Have a good night.

370
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,711
Yeah, I'm heading out.
Good night.

00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,214
Democracy in Retrograde
Taming of the Media

372
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,515
Anything else I should know?

373
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,600
Almost done, Kang Giho?

374
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,060
Uh, yup, I'm ready.

375
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,022
But can I ask,
what do you need my portfolio for?

376
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,399
Oh, you know,
just reorganizing after this new hire.

377
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,859
- Ah!
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

378
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,569
Hey, no one's getting ahead of anyone.

379
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,492
- Another thing, Kang Giho.
- Uh-huh?

380
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,702
The chief mentioned you'd come across
a pretty good story.

381
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,080
Why don't you write us a pitch?

382
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,164
Whoa… I…

383
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,791
Wait a sec,
Ms. Oh, are you for real?

384
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,418
Mm… I wouldn't read into it too much.

385
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,796
Just write the pitch.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

386
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,340
It's just… Sorry, give me a sec.

387
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,258
Can you hear my heart beating?

388
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,010
"Produce! Producer!"

389
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,804
"Producing!"

390
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
I'm on it.

391
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,018
Yeah!

392
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,353
Well, at least he's excited.

393
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,240
Surprise.

394
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,327
Emergency Stairs

395
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,458
Why?

396
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,129
Soryong.
It's not like we're having an affair.

397
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,172
Do we really need to meet
in secret place like this?

398
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,049
I hope it's not 'cause
you're ashamed of me, babe.

399
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,217
Why would you say that?

400
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,844
Why would I say that?

401
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,304
I'm madly in love with you. Come on.

402
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,226
Where's the ring? You're not wearing it?

403
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,562
You're not wearing your ring.

404
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,147
Still no answer.

405
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,149
Not gonna lie, I'm a little heartbroken.

406
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,819
You know what, just forget it…

407
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,737
I can tell when I'm being rejected,

408
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,489
so just… just keep that thing.

409
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,200
It's not like I'll ever wear it.

410
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,747
All right. I'm off.

411
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,583
Put it on me?

412
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,754
You serious?

413
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,091
Se… seriously? You mean it? Really?

414
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,888
Okay. Okay.

415
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,191
Get out of here.

416
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,484
All right. Okay. Wait, first…

417
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I love you.

418
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,071
See ya.

419
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,622

Oh my…

428
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,105
You think you're cute?

429
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,816
Come here, you.

430
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,820
What are you doing here? Huh?

431
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
You stay there.

432
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,415
Oh… what?

433
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,174
Come here.

434
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,685
So you're the one.
You're the guy, huh?

435
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,979
You freak! You sick bastard!

436
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,480
You're the guy hurting all those cats!

437
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,441
You psycho cat-killing freak!

438
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,900
You're sick!

439
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,154
The other shoe's about to drop, buddy!
Your sorry ass is going to jail!

440
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,656
Stop! Let go!
On the count of three…

441
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,033
One, two…

442
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,702
- Three!
- Three, three, you prick!

443
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,537
Hold still, you sicko.
I'm gonna make a call.

444
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,290
Okay, I'll stay still. Staying still.
Staying still. Got it.

445
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,375
Hello? Police? Come quick!

446
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,502
I got your serial cat killer right here.

447
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,587
No! He doesn't!

448
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm telling you,
you have the wrong guy here!

449
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,633
And I'm telling you, I caught this prick
red-handed in the act of cat meowder!

450
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,177
Hey, stop calling me a prick, okay?

451
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,137
No one deserves it
more than a prick like you, prick!

452
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,722
Okay, guys, let's all calm down.

453
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,558
So you're trying to tell me
you weren't using this to hurt the cat?

454
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,644
Okay, listen to me, there was twine
wrapped around its neck,

455
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,771
and I was gonna use this to cut--

456
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,189
"Cut, cut, cut!"

457
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,274
He said "cut"! He said "cut"!
He admits it, you heard him!

458
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,860
Wow! You really just
gave yourself away, huh?

459
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,113
I got you on camera, following the cat
all the way from the store.

460
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,239
-What now, huh?
-Officer.

461
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,532
Hey, hey! Look, look, look!

462
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,950
He probably got this
from doing something insane!

463
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,660
- Seriously!
- Lots of violent psychopaths

464
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,079
have fingers just like that!

465
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,872
All right, I'm gonna
just ignore this jackass--

466
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,457
What did you call me? I'll show you jack--

467
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,334
-Whoa, whoa…
-Officer.

468
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,128
This is a dereliction of duty,
and a total violation of my human rights.

469
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,214
I mean, what about
"innocent until proven guilty"?

470
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,715
I'm telling you, officer.
I'm an innocent man!

471
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,426
-Sir, are you employed?
-Obviously not. Look at him.

472
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,011
Here. Happy now?

00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,180

-Oh, this one's from my old job.
-Whoa, hang on, let me see.

476
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,975
Let go. Come on, let go.

477
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,230
Technology's something, huh?

478
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,314
Seems we've caught an identity thief.

479
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,066
- You don't understand, that's from befor--
- Just stop!

480
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,026
"Dereliction of duty," huh?

481
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,112
Don't underestimate the Korean police.

482
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,571
All right then.

483
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,240
- Call someone who can vouch for you.
- Yeah, call 'em.

484
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,367
Jesus Christ, I did nothing wrong!
Why do all this?

485
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,702
If you have a problem with it,
you can stay here overnight.

486
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,455
- Man, I really gotta pee.
- Let's take it outside, sir.

487
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,416
-Let me take a leak, come on!
-Throw the book at this guy, okay?

488
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,750
You pigs can do whatever you want--

489
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,171
Sir, you can't throw up in here, okay?
Okay?

490
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,141
Shit!

491
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,976
You again, really?

492
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,728
You're gonna cause an accident, you know.

493
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,400
My cat.

494
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,280
I asked you to find my cat.

495
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,031
Jesus, that wasn't even your cat.

496
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,200
It was just a stray cat.
It didn't belong to you.

497
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,411
-It's my cat.
-Huh?

498
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,456
Whoa, what the…

499
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,790
Hey, cut it out. Come on.

500
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,459
The cat is mine.

501
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,004
Hey! Let go! Jesus.

502
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,298
What the hell? Come on, it's cold out.

503
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,050
Just hurry up
and get on home, okay? It's freezing.

504
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,603
-Will you be checking any bags?
-No, no bags.

-Uh, thanks for your hard work, officers.

515
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,925
I mean, this, uh, TV producer…

516
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,306
You feel wronged?

517
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,642
To be fair, judging by the footage,

518
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,685
they had every reason to suspect you.

519
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,938
If you're gonna feed
stray cats, do it out in the open.

520
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,022
Be proud of it.

521
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,274
You don't seem to care
what people think anyway.

522
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,859
I just wanna live
a long, quiet life, okay?

523
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,528
I'm not trying to do good deeds.

524
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,696
But anyway, thank you.

525
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,365
I'll pay you back somehow.

526
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,991
No need for that.

527
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,786
I'll be there
whether it's the 10th or 100th time.

528
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,081
That is in the job description, after all.

529
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,546
I'm starting to like you, Mr. Han.

530
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,932
Think of sunflowers. Pretty, right?

531
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,032
Exquisite flowers bloom from their center,
but still they pretend to have thorns.

532
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,369
You're a little like that,
so prickly with everyone.

533
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,996
It's almost like you wanna get hurt.

534
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,124
The point is, I don't care
if you pee-bombed someone.

535
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,667
Or were a nepo hire.

536
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,544
Let's be a team.

537
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,382
I'm not pretending.

538
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,219
I've been screwed over so many times
that I have trouble trusting people.

539
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,555
I flat-out don't trust people, actually.

540
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,102
So do me a favor and warn me
before you get all soft like that.

541
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,520
'Cause if you keep that up…

542
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,273
I might start trusting again.

543
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,373
This building belongs to
a delinquent landlord!

544
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,000
I can't give you back the deposit.
Keep the place.

545
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,337
Rental Scam Property

546
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,299
Jang Hakui

547
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,425
I can't give you back the deposit…

548
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,322
That's cute.

549
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,531
"Thirst, Mother, The Unjust"

550
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,050
There he is again.

551
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,011
-No, Dad, don't! Stop it!
-Stay still! I said, stay still!

552
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,597
How dare you steal?
Did you forget your dad's a cop?

553
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,974
I told you to stay still!
Why won't you listen to me?

554
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,935
-Hyung said I had to!
-Why, you little shit!

555
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,228
I promise, he made me!

556
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,355
- Just say you're sorry!
- Stay still.

557
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,608
-Just tell your father you're sorry!
-Hyung, why aren't you saying anything?

558
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,276
I told you to stay still.

559
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,945
- Damn it, I said stay still!
- Hyung!

560
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,321
Hyung!

561
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,781
Hyung!

562
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,912
Hakuna matata.

563
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,793
Hakuna matata.

564
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,548
Oh, my gosh, what is this?

565
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,343
Again? My God,
what kind of sick maniac would do this?

566
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,388
Oh, my God,
this time it was a mother and kitten!

567
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,348
And they sewed their eyes shut.

568
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,766
What is happening in this country?

569
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,727
Why won't they do something
about the mentally ill?

570
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,812
Those poor things.

571
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,064
Don't you think we should call the cops?

572
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,983
What kind of monster
could do such a thing?

573
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,026
Hey, hey. Do you really
have to take a photo of that?

574
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,903
You have no idea
how many views this'll get.

575
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,366
That's just disgusting.
Keep walking, kids.

576
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,909
Nothing to see here. Go on.

577
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,047
Hey! I could charge you!

578
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,300
Officer! Anyone call in
a cat-related incident?

579
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,469
Are you just barging in here
and asking questions?

580
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,803
That cat yesterday.

581
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,182
It's been murdered.
They found its body next to its mother.

582
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,391
We've gotten reports,

583
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,102
chopped-up cats have been turning up
around the neighborhood.

584
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,146
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

585
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,773
I hear you,
a cat's been killed.

586
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,441
Understood. What do you want us to do?

587
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,609
What do you mean?

588
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,320
People can't just do that to an animal!

589
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,072
All right, do you see
what we're dealing with over here?

590
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,908
I understand that you're an animal lover,

591
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,994
but unless it's a mass-killing situation,
a few animal deaths don't matter.

592
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,996
I mean, it's not
as though you saw the perpetrator.

593
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,956
You think this psycho
who killed these animals

594
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,875
doesn't have it in him
to kill a human, huh?

595
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,252
Lady, come on!

596
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,545
You can't do that here!

597
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,465
Ugh, come on, let's get you
to the… the bathroom. Hurry up!

598
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,403
Oh, Jesus, how long was I out?

599
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,489
-You're back from the States?
-Wake up, get it together.

600
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,534
I didn't go to the States,
it's only been a day.

601
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,618
Whoa, really?

602
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,703
Oh, man, you threw me off.

603
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,293
Oh, so, um, yesterday,
while I was researching,

604
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,711
I logged onto the dark web.

605
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,839
Man, it's scary out there.

606
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,674
Like, animal abuse forums?

607
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,592
One look
and you'll lose faith in humanity.

608
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,761
People can be straight-up evil.

609
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,346
-This is it here?
-Yeah, that one.

610
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,597
That's not it.

611
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,769
Serial Cat Killer of Seocho-gu

612
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,397
Is this your way
of getting back at them for yesterday?

613
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,315
Or are you collaborating with Giho?

614
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,985
I didn't ask you
to write a pitch for this story.

615
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,153
What do you mean? Collaborating?

616
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,530
The cat from yesterday

617
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,490
and its mother was killed.

618
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,159
They were both viciously slaughtered
and left out on the street.

619
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,829
Whoever did this, they're not even human.

620
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,913
Hey, what are you even…

621
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,957
Are you talking about
that cat story from the internet?

622
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,084
The police don't care
because they're just cats.

623
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,295
This psycho needs to be exposed,

624
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,714
and it's our responsibility
to do it on the show.

625
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,799
Hey, wait…

626
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,926
Did you… read my pitch?

627
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,304
Did I what?

628
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,180
Look, it's almost identical to mine.

629
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,807
I'm not a mind reader.

630
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,851
How would I possibly know
what's in your pitch?

631
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,020
Whatever, man, just come out
and admit it if you copied it!

632
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,855
- But I didn't copy you!
- Well, you must have!

633
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,648
What's wrong with you?
You still half-asleep?

634
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,525
What are you talking about?
Your proposal is exactly the same as mine!

635
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,527
And why do you keep
putting your feet up on my chair?

636
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,778
-What the hell are you talking--
-You're completely insane!

637
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,946
Come on, come on.

638
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,323
Calm it down, okay?

639
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,659
What a lively crew we've got.
And it's still only morning.

640
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,329
Conference room, now.

641
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,752
All right, so, about Mr. Han's story…

642
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,341
These cats are getting killed
left and right,

643
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,260
but the perpetrator's hard to catch,
and it's unclear how he'd be charged,

644
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,179
so the cops aren't doing anything.

645
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,973
If we could unmask the killer live,
it'd get tons of attention,

646
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,393
and I'm guessing they'd stop
for fear of getting doxxed.

647
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,940
Mr. Han may seem agitated,

648
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,816
he was framed
as the cat killer last night.

649
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,443
I'm not agitated, I'm outraged!

650
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,487
And not because
I got framed as the killer.

651
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,740
This is my brain's natural response
after seeing the sick and terrible things

652
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,824
done to those poor cats.

653
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,368
Putting all of that aside,

654
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,578
this talk of unmasking the killer,

655
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,497
that's absolutely not what we do here.

656
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,748
I like it.

657
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,000
I gotta say, it's more topical

658
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,252
than a 20-year-old missing person's case.

659
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,755
- Give it a go.
- Come on now, sir!

660
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,048
Lower your voice.

661
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,008
I'm not one of your underlings.

662
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,976
Trigger's internal policy
is that we put aside hierarchy

663
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,519
when it comes to debating what we cover.

664
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,773
Not once have we ever chosen a story
just because a higher-up told us to.

665
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,442
I don't know how it was
in the newsroom though.

666
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,652
Excuse me, sir.

667
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,322
This is a proposal I wrote.
Please have a look.

668
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,783
- Kang Giho.
- Oh, Mr. Kang?

669
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,243
Why are you handing me this?

670
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,411
Uh, so the…

671
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:23,167
Um… the, uh… the cat incident,
I was actually on that story first.

672
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,252
If you look at my proposal--

673
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,420
So work together.

674
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,589
Use your AP chops
to help Mr. Han with his segment.

675
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,966
Sir?

676
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,051
You're an associate producer, no?

677
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,095
Bold move listing these credentials.

678
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,807
We don't exactly require
a degree from the top schools,

679
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,184
but we do have some standards.

680
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,895
And here you are,
listing a college I've never heard of.

681
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,655
Sir, I assumed you of all people
would give respect to my staff.

682
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,532
But apparently I was wrong.

683
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,701
I won't stand for this.

684
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,789
I've taped our conversation
from yesterday, so if you keep this up,

685
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,875
I'll go public about the cancellation,

686
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,210
about everything we discussed,

687
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,838
and let the police handle Dr. Trigger.

688
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,757
That seems like a much simpler solution.

689
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,229
Cancellation? Did I hear that?

690
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,900
Uh, what just… Oh.

691
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,614
Oh. Hi, sir.

692
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,909
-How are we doing?
-I suggest you keep your staff in line.

693
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,543
I truly had no idea.

694
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,129
I don't even really care about this stuff.

695
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,923
I just wanted to catch the killer that--

696
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,466
But that's even worse.

697
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,927
My dream is to produce my own stories.

698
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,224
What you just said makes it
even more humiliating and hurtful.

699
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,143
At least pretend you want this job.

700
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,571
Why the roof?

701
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,120
Ms. Oh…

702
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,914
Do you think I'm stupid too?

703
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,083
You never ever
take my calls, do you?

704
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,128
I just climbed nine flights of stairs.

705
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,587
I couldn't talk on the phone.

706
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,506
Why didn't you just take the elevator?

707
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,218
You could've just taken the elevator,

708
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,178
you didn't have to walk up
all those stairs.

709
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,608
Are you done crying?

710
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,360
I'm not even halfway done.

711
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,696
Have you considered grad school?

712
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,825
I could probably help you
with some of the tuition.

713
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,914
We're supposed to be
in the AI brave new world by now.

714
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,750
And this place is stuck in the past.

715
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,461
All style and no substance.

716
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,006
It's no wonder everybody's
always trash-talking the media.

717
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,219
So are we… gonna get canceled?

718
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,644
That guy Han, first he reminded me
of a cat, you know what I mean?

719
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,229
'Cause he's petty and feline,

720
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,857
but turns out he's a cold-hearted snake.

721
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,610
And you seriously gave up
your big America trip for that?

722
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,653
Are you crazy?

723
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,572
Why would I give up on
Cha Seongwook because of Han?

724
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,698
Then why stay?

725
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,912
My Cha Seongwook contact got in touch.

726
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,627
BlueBeard: Give me a few days
to bring Cho Haewon to Korea.

727
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,587
I got Han's call soon after that.

728
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,380
Hey, Mr. Han.

729
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,091
Wha… Whoa, you mean…

730
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,595
Cho… Cho Haewon, the… the woman
who used to go out with Cha Seongwook?

731
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,056
That's crazy.

732
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,643
I'm gonna hit this out of the park.

733
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,395
No one's canceling Trigger.

734
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,233
Don't sweat it, okay?

735
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,236
You're a sparkling, pretty little thing.
Don't let the school stuff get you down.

736
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,613
Believe me, I don't want it to.

737
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,618
And it's a misunderstanding,
the Han Do thing.

738
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,496
He's not the kind of guy
who would steal someone's work.

739
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,747
Whoa, hold on a minute.

740
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,415
How are you…

741
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,417
Are you seriously siding with him now?

742
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,337
Man, I feel like
I'm totally alone in this!

743
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,630
I mean, how?

744
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,340
You've only known the guy for a few days.

745
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,424
Are you kidding me?

746
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,677
How can you be so fickle with your love?

747
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,137
My what? That's dramatic.

748
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,681
You know what? Hang on, stop. Stop.

749
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,099
I want you to tell me here and now!

750
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,600
Do you choose me or that snake?

751
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,353
Snake-cat? Hurry up and choose already.

752
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,105
Aren't you cold? I'm going in.

753
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,941
-You'll catch a cold out here.
-Wait, hold on, wait…

754
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,777
Come on, please! Wait, wait!
Please, you can just choose me!

755
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,196
And there. Welcome.

756
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,493
How's your arm doing? Looks fine now.

757
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,788
Have you gotten
any new footage since yesterday?

758
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,540
So you saw that thing this morning, huh?

759
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,000
Man, whoever did that's a real freak.

760
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,167
Right, about that.

761
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,836
So since we parted ways,

762
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,754
did you notice anyone suspicious
hanging around here?

763
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,631
If I had, I would've reported it myself.

764
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,300
Welcome.

765
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,176
How are we gonna find this sicko?

766
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,886
I'm giving you my contact info.

767
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,347
If you catch anything on video
or see something suspicious,

768
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,515
call and let us know.

769
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,184
Wait a minute,
does you giving me your contact info

770
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,395
mean that Trigger's covering this story?

771
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,315
Hell yeah, Oh Soryong,
let's freaking go! All right!

772
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,817
Man, with you on it,
that animal killer is cooked.

773
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,819
Aren't they? I mean, it's only
a matter of time now, you know? You--

774
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,696
Dude, it's not like
Trigger's the actual police!

775
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,159
You're a horrible judge of character.
Maybe work on that.

776
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,664
"1do"? That's his email?

777
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,083
More like "one don't".
Man, that guy's a jerk.

778
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,213
The slipped up dogs of war return.

779
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,049
I think we're more like freedom fighters.

780
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,801
Did he leave?

781
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,304
He's out working on that story
that just got confirmed.

782
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,598
The snake went scurrying off like a rat.

783
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,185
And I'm asking you, for God's sake,
call me when Mr. Son comes in, okay?

784
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,394
You and that temper of yours

785
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,272
always end up escalating
even minor issues.

786
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,566
Excuse me,

787
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,984
can I get Han Do's number?

788
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,779
He's been here long enough,
why doesn't he have a business card?

789
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,322
The company's really slacking off.

790
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,574
All right, why do you want Han's number?

791
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,910
I'm trying to do some work here. You know?

792
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,579
Mr. Son told me to help him
on this project, remember?

793
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,373
With this energy,
you could be chief one day.

794
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,291
Yeah. Yeah.

795
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,210
We need to talk.

796
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,046
So I just got word,

797
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,256
they've got their own
Dr. Trigger task force.

798
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,092
President Koo's overseeing it.

799
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,301
According to my source,

800
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,221
he's already got
some security camera footage.

801
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,515
The edit bay in our building
didn't have CCTV though.

802
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,934
But they're saying
it's from a camera in the hallway.

803
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,394
It's got a month's storage on it.

804
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,896
Every team member walked down that hall,
that won't narrow it down.

805
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,439
Well, think again.

806
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,566
They spotted an outsider.

807
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,361
Someone who wasn't supposed to be there
was caught on tape.

808
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,197
Anyway, they're thinking
there's a high probability

809
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,865
that this outsider is Dr. Trigger.

810
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,743
Things are getting pretty dicey for us.

811
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,538
We're this close
to being taken off the air.

812
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,501
Outsider?

813
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,172
Hey, um…

814
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,718
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop or anything,

815
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,806
but there's actually
this one old guy in the area…

816
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,935
They… they call him crazy garbage man.

817
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,521
Anyway, a friend of mine said…

818
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,443
that they saw the old guy
burning some dead cats.

819
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,695
-Dead cats?
-Yeah.

820
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,281
I've got it on video.

821
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,169
Do you know where this guy lives?

822
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,295
"To be demolished"

823
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,754
The area is condemned,

824
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,049
so everyone else left,
and his house is the only one standing.

825
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,742
- Hello?
- Yo.

826
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,243
It's me, Kang Giho.

827
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,329
What were you thinking,
rushing off by yourself?

828
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,915
I had to, I got a tip
from the convenience store.

829
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,166
Wait, you… you… you what?

830
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,211
I'm actually at
the suspect's house right now.

831
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,631
In a sec, I'm gonna send
my source's contact

832
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,715
so you can set up an interview.

833
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,176
Wha… Uh… He…

834
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,609
Rat!

835
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,489
We've got the staff writer candidate here.

836
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,366
Cancellation or not,
we've got tons of work.

837
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,701
We do need to hire,

838
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,452
-so if you're busy, I'll handle it.
-No, I'll come.

839
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,121
Ms. Hong.

840
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,707
About the cancellation.

841
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,834
I'm sorry I couldn't tell--

842
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,295
I don't need to know.
Don't worry about it.

843
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,008
Man, that's so weird.

844
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,801
So weird.

845
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,052
What's so weird?

846
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,222
That was Han Do on the phone,
he said he met a source for the cat thing

847
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,307
and asked me to set up an interview.

848
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,391
A source?

849
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,727
He's already found a source?
Where was this?

850
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,145
At the convenience store, I think.

851
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,313
What else?

852
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,857
Well, the number
that Mr. Han Do gave me

853
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,568
- isn't in service anymore.
- …is not in service.

854
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,986
Sure you didn't write it down wrong?

855
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,613
- Are you coming or not?
- Coming.

856
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,364
-Try checking it again.
-Okay.

857
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,658
So weird…

858
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,920
Chief, can I steal her?

859
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,004
What is it?

860
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,172
I'm sorry, this is urgent.

861
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,256
Ms. Oh.

862
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,385
Han Do is missing. He went off the grid.

863
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,804
Calls were going through earlier
before you got here,

864
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,639
but now it goes straight to voicemail.

865
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,765
Do you think something happened to him?

866
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,558
Did you double-check the number?
Call him again?

867
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,185
It still says it's out of service.

868
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,899
Um, Ms. Oh.

869
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,777
What if the person he found
really was the cat killer, an… and

870
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,153
he wound up inside the killer's house?

871
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,281
Yeah, I'm gonna call the police
and check things out on the scene.

872
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,075
You call Han Do's family, okay?

873
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,287
Breaking into a stranger's home

874
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,915
and then relieving himself.

875
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,625
Those are some bad manners.

876
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,794
Uh, I heard the cats meowing,

877
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,046
and the door was open, so…

878
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,176
Here. Eat up.

879
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,098
Bless you.

880
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,358
What are you doing?

881
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,784
-Hey, don't paint my finger--
-No, no…

882
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,994
Seriously, don't paint…

883
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,246
What are you--

884
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,956
You need to stay clean and well-kempt

885
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,751
as a member of society.

886
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,461
That's how people will respect you.

887
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,758
If that's the case,
why do you live like this?

888
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,217
Oh, I'm a lost cause.

889
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,512
Because of the way I look,

890
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,723
even the police won't listen to me.

891
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,349
Well, there you go.

892
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,435
If you really want
to help the cats, take care of…

893
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,521
If you keep this up,
no one'll want anything to do with you.

894
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,106
I'm not just talking about the police.

895
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,900
You came to me, didn't you?

896
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,818
That's good enough for me.

897
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,113
I sat by, looking on

898
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,200
as those poor things were murdered,
one after the other.

899
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,244
I couldn't stand it any longer.

900
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:33,624
So I decided
to bring these fellows on home with me.

901
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,711
I leashed them
with a bit of plastic twine.

902
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,963
Some of them got away though.

903
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,717
Heaven help the monster behind this.

904
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,679
How could they do something so heinous
to these little angels?

905
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,601
I could say the same about what you did.

906
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,896
Why'd you burn them? Jesus…

907
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,856
I was told the law says

908
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,442
dead animals are disposed of

909
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,820
in simple garbage bags.

910
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,904
I couldn't…

911
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,573
How could I do that
to their poor, suffering souls?

912
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:11,328
I knew I had to cremate them
so they could move on to a better place.

913
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,542
Hang on, how'd you know about that?

914
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,794
Apparently, a student saw you do it.

915
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,713
And they say
that it terrified her to death.

916
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,300
That kid was making up stories!

917
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,471
What?

918
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,430
Hey, grandpa…

919
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,142
how'd you like to die
with your little friend?

920
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,853
You'd like that?

921
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,837
I saw the cat murderer.

922
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,340
I know who it is.

923
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,968
I should have dealt with him
then and there.

924
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,931
Han Do!

925
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,184
Han Do!

926
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,854
Han Do…

927
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,860
How did you…

928
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,820
How do you think?

929
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,448
By scouring all CCTV footage leading here,

930
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,200
starting with the convenience store.

931
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,932
I'm sorry.

932
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,936
I don't think I've ever been
this embarrassed in my entire life.

933
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,896
I…

934
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,566
You know what? Never mind.

935
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,194
I'm sorry about all this,

936
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,821
but we gotta catch
that kid who lied to me.

937
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,990
Who's we? Who'll do the catching?

938
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,616
After hearing this guy's story,

939
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,284
I'm thinking that kid fed me wrong info.

940
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,452
And what if he's the perp?

941
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,621
Are you gonna defecate on his house?

942
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,623
Your fear response is really something.

943
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,708
That's so…

944
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,668
That's a low blow. Mocking me for my--

945
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,752
All right, stop.

946
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,592
No way.

947
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,971
You went in there without a camera?

948
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,140
You recorded nothing?

949
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,599
Oh, um…

950
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,815
Amateur mistake.

951
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,609
These kids are lying to you
'cause they know they'll get away with it.

952
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,155
Hey! Hey man, are you okay?

953
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,074
Are you… You're not injured, are you?

954
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,076
Oh, man, I was like…

955
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,204
so worried your body
would turn up tomorrow, all chopped up!

956
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,081
What's with the pants, man?

957
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,917
-Huh?
-I don't care what Son said.

958
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,253
You're not leadership material yet.

959
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:51,173
We'll pick someone
once we see how this turns out.

960
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,674
Effective immediately,

961
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,177
the two of you'll work together,
in the same role.

962
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,888
- Huh?
- Listen to me, Han.

963
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,723
Our team has to operate as a unit.

964
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,892
So don't go and try to be a hero.

965
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,186
And from now on,
Kang Giho is your new best friend.

966
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,480
His life is yours, and your life is his.

967
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,067
If you don't like it,
go back to where you came from.

968
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,995
- Don't.
- Sounds like he agreed to it.

969
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,455
Right?

970
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,834
I'll go have a talk with the old guy.

971
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,711
Take care of him.

972
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,671
Taking care of people's what I do best.

973
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,049
We're gonna have our meeting
back at the office.

974
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,300
Hey, let's go.

975
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,384
Come on.

976
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,053
Hop in, let's go.

977
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,702
I live in apartment 106.

978
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,496
Can you help me out?

979
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,123
My bag is a little heavy.

980
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,312
Oh, come on,
we had a one-night stand,

981
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,356
you think we're a couple now or…

982
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,567
You recorded it?

983
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,986
Are you freaking insane? What are you…

984
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,695
I went to that store and they said
that you already took the footage.

985
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,906
Yup, we've got the guy's face on tape.

986
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,254
Whoa, don't press that! Don't…

987
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:40,091
Haven of Trust demands
the release of Pastor Kim and his wife!

988
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,885
- I've about had it with these cult freaks.
- Release them now!

989
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,311
Are you all right?

990
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,525
