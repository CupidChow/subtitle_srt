00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:16,683
EP02: SETBACK

2
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:49,090
Religious freedom now!

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,884
"STOP RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION"
"TRIGGER IS FAKE NEWS"

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,511
Cutting in… one, two, three.

5
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,388
BUILDING COMPLETION CEREMONY

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,064
On this day, I, Koo Hyeongtae,

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,357
am declaring an all-out war
on misinformation.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,735
We'll be working with law enforcement

9
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,446
to get to the bottom
of this vile act of cyberterrorism.

10
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,199
No. Please don't jump to
any conclusions

11
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,909
before you've heard
both sides of the story.

12
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,077
No, we're not responsible

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,203
- for what happened with the Haven...
- Hang up.

14
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,996
Didn't I tell you
not to take these prank calls?

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,248
- Ms. Hong.
- What are you doing, Ms. Hong?

16
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,000
- You wanted to take those?
- No!

17
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,460
What is this, North Korea?

18
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,920
Who's even watching this anyway?

19
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,339
And to our employees,
your full cooperation is much appreciated.

20
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,801
Songi said it's the anniversary
of her mom's death.

21
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,177
Has anyone seen her yet?

22
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,137
Her mom is dead? When'd that happen?

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,347
Songi's only in her early twenties.

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,183
Sweetie, you type fast,
and you're great at what you do,

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,644
but your cheekbones do stick out a bit.

26
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,395
Physiognomy tells me you like to pry.

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,772
Maybe facial contouring would help?

28
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,565
Nope, but chopping off your tongue would.

29
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,067
Oh, and about the raunchy video
from yesterday.

30
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,193
I don't think that was a deepfake.

31
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,402
Ms. Hong, do you think...

32
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,661
Whoa, is it "bring your dog to work" day?

33
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,413
Oh, you're the new guy, right?

34
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,499
I'm Seo Jeongseok. Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,084
Sorry, my hands are sweaty.

36
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,044
My name is Han Do.

37
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,173
My name's Yoon Byeonggeun. I'm a producer.

38
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,676
I'm your senior,
so I'd recommend shaking my hand.

39
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,356
Oh hey, what's with the funeral getup?

40
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,482
You really don't know?

41
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,110
They're rounding everyone up
because of yesterday's incident.

42
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,194
President Koo's a natural

43
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,863
when it comes to
putting out fires like this.

44
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,490
If someone told me
he majored in media firefighting,

45
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,867
- I'd believe it.
- Media firefighting, yeah.

46
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,368
He was so quick to respond,
it's almost as if

47
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,288
he knew this would happen.
It's a little suspicious.

48
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,831
You think President Koo is Dr. Trigger?

49
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:45,915
No way, man.

50
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,710
He might hold a deep grudge against us,
but he's still our Great Leader.

51
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,380
I dunno…
that would be a pretty shady move.

52
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,548
On-brand though.

53
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,758
Maybe we should dig up
some dirt on the president.

54
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,262
Title, "How Many Skeletons
Are In the President's Closet?"

55
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,638
'Bout to get yourself in trouble, man.

56
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,723
- Come on, guys.
- That's great. Love it.

57
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,892
Why mess with a story
that will never see the light of day?

58
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,894
I mean, let's just take him out
and be done with it.

59
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,271
I know you're just joking around,
but that's crossing the line.

60
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,565
- Someone could hear you.
- You think I'm joking?

61
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,442
We've been on Trigger for a while.

62
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,569
I think I know how to pull off
the perfect crime.

63
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,988
Huh?

64
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,283
So where's Ms. Oh? We're supposed
to get our stories straight,

65
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,534
but she's still not here.

66
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,539
"MEMORIAL MASS FOR THE VICTIMS OF
THE PAINTED FLOWER KINDERGARTEN ACCIDENT"

67
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,252
We dedicate this mass

68
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,672
to the angels whose lives
were tragically cut short

69
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,967
in a horrific accident 20 years ago today.

70
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,929
In loving memory
of Park Sunjeong Maria,

71
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,931
Kim Yeji, Kim Uram,

72
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,769
Chae Yun, Jeon Harin, Shin Yeonu.

73
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:53,191
Let's take this time to say a prayer
for these children's lost souls.

74
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,914
As always,
we'll be filming this.

75
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,836
Something important must've come up.
Hence the camera, right?

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,921
"PLEASE HELP FIND CHA SEONGWOOK"

77
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,881
We've gotten to know
each other pretty well, huh?

78
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,383
So, what do you know?

79
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,551
We've found her, sir.

80
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,221
Found her? Found who?

81
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,725
Mr. Cha Seongwook's…
his ex-girlfriend.

82
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,775
Did you…

83
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,987
Did you really find her?

84
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,198
We did, sir.

85
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,867
There were rumors
that she'd returned to Korea,

86
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,202
that she was living abroad,

87
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,373
and as it turns out,
she's been in the States for 20 years.

88
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,250
She even changed her name.

89
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,127
Oh…

90
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,838
And did you get in touch with her?

91
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,922
Yes.

92
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,590
Well, indirectly, but still.

93
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,761
I'm going to meet with her.

94
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,638
You know, tracking down that woman

95
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,348
might be the breakthrough we need…

96
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,727
if we are ever gonna solve
your son's disappearance.

97
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,691
My precious son…

98
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,860
Seongwook…

99
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,865
Please ask her where he is

100
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,491
and how he's doing.

101
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,371
Please ask her for me when you find her.

102
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,748
I beg you, please.

103
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,541
Please.

104
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,834
I promise I will.

105
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,295
I'll do just that.

106
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,925
Why'd she bring flowers?
This place barely gets any light.

107
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,927
What's the matter?
They're the ray of hope we need

108
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,637
in this depressing hole of an office.

109
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,307
You would say that.
You'll eat up anything Soryong gives you.

110
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,732
- Oh, man.
- Is that nail polish?

111
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,110
Whoa, chief, come on,
why're you giving him such a hard time?

112
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,362
What's wrong?

113
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,240
Well, us Gen Z-ers… uh… uh…

114
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,576
I mean, Millennials too…
I guess you wouldn't get it.

115
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,745
It's called
having a sense of style, right?

116
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,539
Hey, man, I wasn't judging,
I was just asking a question.

117
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,416
What, I'm not allowed
to ask Millenials questions now?

118
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,126
You could've easily said,

119
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,045
"Well, that's unique"
and just played it cool.

120
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,880
My, you've grown.

121
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,548
Anyway. Here, this is for you.

122
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,716
"TRIGGER: FIRING THE BULLET OF TRUTH"

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,426
They say if you survive
three months on Trigger,

124
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,969
you've basically reached
the Promised Land,

125
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,806
but I've been here for three years
and I'm still assistant producer.

126
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,265
I have a killer story right here.

127
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,809
So why isn't anyone interested, huh?

128
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,852
Giho, assistant producer's
the best job here.

129
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,937
You don't have a clue.

"WIFE: I SENT YOU THE DIVORCE PAPERS."

131
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,773
And neither do I.

132
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,735
So, there's this crazy dude who takes
these stray cats and then he's…

133
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,321
You're not gonna open that?

134
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,447
Exciting stuff in there.

135
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,866
It's your new ID badge.
Here, check it out.

136
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,701
Oh. Wait, you make this yourself?

138

No, right?

139
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,040
What kind of maniac would do that?

140
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,208
You're in my personal space.

141
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,046
Oh, right… I totally am.

142
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,048
My bad. Sorry, man. Sorry about that…

143
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,467
Ah, you're here!

144
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,344
Head up to
the President's office right away.

Yes.

00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,349
Oh. Hello, President Koo.

148
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,475
Yes, I understand.

149
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,279
Did you watch the inauguration?

150
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,738
Oh, yes, of course we did.

151
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,324
Wow, you were so charismatic,
you were just…

152
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,453
We haven't met since the move.

153
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,122
Didn't want to come empty-handed.

154
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,124
Oh, uh, a sun… a sunflower, huh?

155
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,668
Wow, it's… it's… it's beautiful, huh?

156
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,841
Oh…

157
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,343
Ms. Soryong,
instead of thinking up gifts,

158
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,345
why don't you try some self-reflection?

159
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,222
Parachuting into a cult's headquarters

160
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,975
and you dragged along a rookie
on his first assignment.

161
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,768
If this is about me
and my methods, then I...

162
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,020
It might've been the right move.

163
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:01,355
That story wouldn't have gone anywhere
if you hadn't done it.

164
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,274
That being said, what were you thinking,

165
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,735
letting a porno leak
right before the inauguration?

166
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,737
It wasn't a porno,
it was illegal material.

167
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,405
And I should note,
it might've been a deepfake.

168
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,866
President Koo,
while we're on the subject,

169
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,744
people from all across the country
are flooding our homepage now,

170
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,704
so if you could send
some additional resources to...

171
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,206
You still don't get it, do you?

172
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,833
- Your show's at risk of cancellation.
- Canc…

173
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,128
Uh, President Koo, I mean…
I just think that canceling our show

174
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,255
over one incident might be a bit…

175
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,757
- a bit too...
- A bit too harsh?

176
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,552
That travel show we canceled had
double the ratings of your pitiful show.

177
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
And you scumbags refuse to take ads.

178
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,641
The industry's under strain,
but what would you know about that?

179
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,392
I don't care how iconic your show is,

180
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,437
if you tank our reputation
and don't bring in money, you're done.

181
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,898
You think the president
can't do that much?

182
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:48,319
So you want to cancel our show
over unverified fake news,

183
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,947
because we don't bring enough revenue,
and the public's upset?

184
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,740
I got that right?

185
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,619
Uh… Let me explain, sir.

186
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,413
Ms. Oh isn't quite seeing
the big picture just yet.

187
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,834
Soryong, you think you're hot shit
because you run a highly acclaimed show?

188
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,628
We've all been there, okay?

189
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,880
Trigger's accomplishments
are not your doing.

190
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,758
You're just riding on the coattails
of your seniors' success.

191
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,553
During harder times,
we managed to run a tight ship

192
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,887
and avoid these controversies.

193
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,306
I'd say we're doing just as well
as our seniors did.

194
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,850
Huh.

195
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,938
Then how would you like to duke it out
with one of the big dogs?

196
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,275
- What?
- You and I will go head-to-head

197
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,943
and we'll see who comes out on top.

198
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,903
If I can catch Dr. Trigger first,

199
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,446
then that's a wrap on your show.

200
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,075
And in the unlikely event that it's you,
cancellation plans will be paused.

201
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,827
You'll get a grace period.
What do you say?

202
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,912
Please, President Koo,
the guys in our department

203
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,124
are sleep-deprived enough as it is,
if they have to do this now too...

204
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,625
Getting cold feet?

205
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,502
Why should we keep you around

206
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,963
if you can't even find
a petty criminal like this?

207
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,008
Challenge accepted.

208
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,556
There'll be no exchange of information
between us.

209
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,683
So fair play.

210
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,396
What on earth were you thinking,
taking him up on that?

211
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,189
I'm gonna investigate
the Cha Seongwook case

212
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,816
while he's busy with Dr. Trigger.

213
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,651
Cha…

214
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,320
Are you out of your damn mind?

215
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,696
I told you a million times to stop!

216
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,115
Look.

217
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,326
If he manages to get to our guy first,
then we're totally screwed!

218
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,953
Hey, we're going get him first.

219
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,872
You just said you'd work on Cha Seongwook.

220
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,540
So then who… who… who is "we"?

221
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,417
Me?

222
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,668
For Christ's sakes, I'm the chief.

223
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,838
What, you think I'm just farting around
with nothing better to do? Huh?

224
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,132
No one ever said you'd do it alone.

225
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,216
Think about it.

226
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,969
The Cha Seongwook case is
one of the top unsolved cases in Korea.

227
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,181
Not a single show's
dared to touch it for two decades.

228
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,807
Who stands to gain the most

229
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,601
if we manage to hit a home run?

230
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,729
Cancellation?
They'll beg us for an interview.

231
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,315
I'll ride down with you.

232
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,233
Oh, of course, sir.

233
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,401
Oh, right.

234
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,072
Who took over for the producer
who quit over PTSD?

235
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
Oh, uh…

236
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,743
Uh, we were actually
just talking about that.

237
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,037
How about we let that rookie of yours
try his hand?

238
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,123
Sheesh. Isn't this a new building?

239
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,502
Uh, is the rookie you're referring to…
Mr. Han?

240
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,213
I've talked to him, he's one smart fellow.
Great credentials.

241
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:15,633
Yeah, but still…
I'm not sure somebody so new should be...

242
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,719
Your show's about to get canceled,
so why not take a few risks?

243
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,013
Why don't we start
by addressing some outdated rules?

244
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,307
We've got an experienced AP,
Kang Giho.

245
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,267
But our company, as we know,

246
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,478
historically hasn't allowed
contractors to lead.

247
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,646
Mm-hmm. That's right.

248
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,526
Okay.

249
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,112
Why don't you send over
the guy's portfolio?

250
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,289
Do people ever say
you remind them of a cat?

251
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,375
Your energy is very feline.

252
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,294
Mr. Han.

253
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,839
Look people in the eye
when they talk to you.

254
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,382
I kind of prefer not to.

255
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,972
I'm gonna be straight with you.

256
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,516
Do you think… you're a nepo hire?

257
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,188
I'm not accusing you of anything.
I'm asking because we're in this together.

258
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,441
If you don't wanna answer the question…

259
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,276
…then you can choose to remain silent.

260
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,696
I don't know, I'm not sure this counts.

261
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,242
Mr. Son Huiwon did have a hand
in getting me assigned here.

262
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,706
But wouldn't a nepo hire
be given a higher position?

263
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,291
To me, this feels like…

264
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,044
I couldn't be any further down.

265
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,566
Listen up.

266
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,028
This team doesn't bring in money
like Soap Operas.

267
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,531
Our pride and principles
don't allow us to run ads.

268
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,283
And that, for the past 10 years,

269
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,912
has made us the viewers'
number one most trusted show.

270
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,582
Of all the investigative shows on the air,
our ratings are the highest.

271
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,959
We're this company's household program.

272
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,045
Trigger.

273
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,672
You got it?

274
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:23,427
I'm sure James Son, Mr. Ivy League,
managed to pull some strings

275
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,554
landing you, a decent enough guy,

276
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,599
but a terrible fit! Right here.

277
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,062
Our new guy. Our nepo hire.

278
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,647
All right then. Okay?

279
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,357
Now that's cleared up. Hmm?

280
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,441
This is for you.

281
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,653
Okay, Chief, Ms. Hong? Our meeting.

282
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,446
Uh-huh, right, uh… let's go.

283
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,367
What was that?
Who won that fight? I'm confused.

284
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,661
It was pee-guy for sure.
He definitely just pissed his pants.

285
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,996
No way,
someone peed in the office?

286
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,666
Huh?

287
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,001
Are you shitting me?

288
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,754
Why would you wait so long
to tell me he's a pee-bomber?

289
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,214
We haven't fact-checked
nor confirmed that.

290
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,590
But I heard it from our very own Jiyun.

291
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:05,344
Every word-of-mouth story
is a mixture of both fact and fiction.

292
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,180
Pee or not, he must've done something,
or we wouldn't be talking about this!

293
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,100
Oh, no.
Just imagine him getting upset at you

294
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,144
then one day he comes in
and he's peed all over your plants! Huh?

295
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,188
You think…

296
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,607
only Mr. Son wants to mess with us
or President Koo as well?

297
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,568
Whoever it was that sent this guy over,

298
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,862
it was a pretty lame attempt at sabotage.

299
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,781
You know what happens when
you trust a young soldier with a bomb?

300
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,700
They blow up the wrong thing
and then hide.

301
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,285
The guy's quaking in his boots.

302
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,120
So don't let some pee-bomb scare you.

303
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,204
You know how it is.

304
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,039
People are crazy these days.

305
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,709
They'll gun you down
over even the tiniest insult.

306
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,168
You should keep your guard up, Ms. Hong.

307
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,379
And I think you should be
a little less paranoid, Chief.

308
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,505
You're too much.

309
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,424
Fascinating…

310
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,509
Huh?

311
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,178
Just thinking about
our subtly obnoxious nepo hire.

312
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,681
He gets more interesting…

313
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,267
the more I watch him.

314
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,144
Any updates? Hear from the writer?

315
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,522
"NEWBIE: I QUIT. PLEASE SEND ME
MY PAYCHECK OF 945,560 WON BY TOMORROW."

316
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,900
Is this like a new trend or something?
Quitting over text?

317
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,319
- So fricking annoying.
- Their heart's not in it anymore.

318
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,447
In which case, it's better
they leave sooner rather than later.

319
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,365
Oh, come on,
it was 10 days! That's it!

320
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,951
It was only 10 days,
for f… fork's sake!

321
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,536
Have you ever watched our show?

322
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,792
Corpses, killings…

323
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,838
I'm honestly not a huge fan
of gratuitous violence in the media.

324
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
"Gratuitous?"

325
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,801
The stories that we cover
aren't works of fiction.

326
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:31,096
I'm not a huge fan of downplaying
real-world pain and tragedy.

327
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,681
You might be a nepo hire.

328
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,142
But this is an actual job, okay?

329
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,562
Whatever the real reason
you ended up on this team,

330
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
it's high time that you did some work.

331
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,858
Come on.

332
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:48,614
Here's where we keep the files and footage
used for every single episode of our show,

333
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,740
from the pilot onward.

334
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,160
The secret to investigative journalism?
You need to pick a good story.

335
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,745
Once you've gone through
all this material,

336
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,914
the makings of a good scoop
will be engrained in your head.

337
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,041
So I want you to review
everything down here and...

338
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,626
Pick a good story? Is that right?

339
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,712
That's a job for the grown-ups here.

340
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,797
But with you,

341
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,549
we're building your instincts
so that one day

342
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,134
you'll pick out the good stories.

343
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,679
I want you to review and reclassify
every single case down here,

344
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,764
separating the open from the closed ones.

345
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,308
Determine which cases are worth
a follow-up, write up a report,

346
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,602
and give it to me by tomorrow.

347
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,646
So it's just this?

348
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,274
"Just this?"
It's a little more than just filing.

349
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,985
Next!

350
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,495
This here,
is the safe where we store records

351
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,539
from the best Trigger episodes
we've aired.

352
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,041
It's valuable evidence,
and often used in court.

353
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,502
Ms. Hong is the only one of us here
with the keys.

354
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,171
So…

355
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,759
So, you want me to do this all…

356
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,595
- by tomorrow?
- No photos, no scanning.

357
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,182
And taking the materials
off the premises is strictly forbidden.

358
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,601
You got this.

359
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,947
Finding the Killer
Hwajeong Serial Murders

360
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,707
Oh, uh, hello? Yes.

361
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,876
Have a good night.

362
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,711
Yeah, I'm heading out.
Good night.

363
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,214
Democracy in Retrograde
Taming of the Media

364
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,515
Anything else I should know?

365
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,600
Almost done, Kang Giho?

366
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,060
Uh, yup, I'm ready.

367
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,022
But can I ask,
what do you need my portfolio for?

368
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,399
Oh, you know,
just reorganizing after this new hire.

369
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,859
- Ah!
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

370
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,569
Hey, no one's getting ahead of anyone.

371
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,492
- Another thing, Kang Giho.
- Uh-huh?

372
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,702
The chief mentioned you'd come across
a pretty good story.

373
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,080
Why don't you write us a pitch?

374
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,164
Whoa… I…

375
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,791
Wait a sec,
Ms. Oh, are you for real?

376
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,418
Mm… I wouldn't read into it too much.

377
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,796
Just write the pitch.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

378
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,340
It's just… Sorry, give me a sec.

379
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,258
Can you hear my heart beating?

380
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,010
"Produce! Producer!"

381
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,804
"Producing!"

382
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
I'm on it.

383
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,018
Yeah!

384
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,353
Well, at least he's excited.

385
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,240
Surprise.

386
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,327
EMERGENCY STAIRS

387
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,458
Why?

388
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,129
Soryong.
It's not like we're having an affair.

389
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,172
Do we really need to meet
in secret place like this?

390
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,049
I hope it's not 'cause
you're ashamed of me, babe.

391
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,217
Why would you say that?

392
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,844
Why would I say that?

393
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,304
I'm madly in love with you. Come on.

394
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,226
Where's the ring? You're not wearing it?

395
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,562
You're not wearing your ring.

396
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,147
Still no answer.

397
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,149
Not gonna lie, I'm a little heartbroken.

398
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,819
You know what, just forget it…

399
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,737
I can tell when I'm being rejected,

400
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,489
so just… just keep that thing.

401
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,200
It's not like I'll ever wear it.

402
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,747
All right. I'm off.

403
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,583
Put it on me?

404
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,754
You serious?

405
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,091
Se… seriously? You mean it? Really?

406
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,888
Okay. Okay.

407
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,191
Get out of here.

408
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,484
All right. Okay. Wait, first…

409
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I love you.

410
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,071
See ya.

411
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,622

Oh my…

420
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,105
You think you're cute?

421
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,816
Come here, you.

422
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,820
What are you doing here? Huh?

423
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,532
You stay there.

424
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,415
Oh… what?

425
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,174
Come here.

426
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,685
So you're the one.
You're the guy, huh?

427
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,979
You freak! You sick bastard!

428
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,480
You're the guy hurting all those cats!

429
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,441
You psycho cat-killing freak!

430
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,900
You're sick!

431
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,154
The other shoe's about to drop, buddy!
Your sorry ass is going to jail!

432
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,656
Stop! Let go!
On the count of three…

433
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,033
One, two…

434
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,702
- Three!
- Three, three, you prick!

435
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,537
Hold still, you sicko.
I'm gonna make a call.

436
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,290
Okay, I'll stay still. Staying still.
Staying still. Got it.

437
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,375
Hello? Police? Come quick!

438
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,502
I got your serial cat killer right here.

439
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,587
No! He doesn't!

440
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm telling you,
you have the wrong guy here!

441
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,633
And I'm telling you, I caught this prick
red-handed in the act of cat meowder!

442
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,177
Hey, stop calling me a prick, okay?

443
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,137
No one deserves it
more than a prick like you, prick!

444
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,722
Okay, guys, let's all calm down.

445
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,558
So you're trying to tell me
you weren't using this to hurt the cat?

446
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,644
Okay, listen to me, there was twine
wrapped around its neck,

447
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,771
and I was gonna use this to cut...

448
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,189
"Cut, cut, cut!"

449
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,274
He said "cut"! He said "cut"!
He admits it, you heard him!

450
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,860
Wow! You really just
gave yourself away, huh?

451
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,113
I got you on camera, following the cat
all the way from the store.

452
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,239
- What now, huh?
- Officer.

453
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,532
Hey, hey! Look, look, look!

454
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:48,950
He probably got this
from doing something insane!

455
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,660
- Seriously!
- Lots of violent psychopaths

456
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,079
have fingers just like that!

457
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,872
All right, I'm gonna
just ignore this jackass...

458
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,457
What did you call me? I'll show you jack...

459
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,334
- Whoa, whoa…
- Officer.

460
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,128
This is a dereliction of duty,
and a total violation of my human rights.

461
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,214
I mean, what about
"innocent until proven guilty"?

462
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,715
I'm telling you, officer.
I'm an innocent man!

463
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,426
- Sir, are you employed?
- Obviously not. Look at him.

464
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,011
Here. Happy now?

468
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,975
Let go. Come on, let go.

Seems we've caught an identity thief.

471
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,607
You don't understand,
that's from befor...

472
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:21,066
Just stop!

473
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,026
"Dereliction of duty," huh?

474
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,112
Don't underestimate the Korean police.

475
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,571
All right then.

476
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,240
- Call someone who can vouch for you.
- Yeah, call 'em.

477
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,367
Jesus Christ, I did nothing wrong!
Why do all this?

478
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,702
If you have a problem with it,
you can stay here overnight.

479
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,455
- Man, I really gotta pee.
- Let's take it outside, sir.

480
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,416
- Let me take a leak, come on!
- Throw the book at this guy, okay?

481
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,750
You pigs can do whatever you want...

482
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,171
Sir, you can't throw up in here, okay?
Okay?

483
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,141
Shit!

484
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:55,976
You again, really?

485
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,728
You're gonna cause an accident, you know.

486
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,400
My cat.

487
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,280
I asked you to find my cat.

488
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,031
Jesus, that wasn't even your cat.

489
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,200
It was just a stray cat.
It didn't belong to you.

490
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,411
- It's my cat.
- Huh?

491
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,456
Whoa, what the…

492
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,790
Hey, cut it out. Come on.

493
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,459
The cat is mine.

494
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,004
Hey! Let go! Jesus.

495
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,298
What the hell? Come on, it's cold out.

496
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,050
Just hurry up
and get on home, okay? It's freezing.

497
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,603
- Will you be checking any bags?
- No, no bags.

498
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,816
SEOCHO POLICE STATION
ANNAM POLICE PRECINCT

499
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,819
Oh.

500
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,321
Oh…

501
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,450
Hey, aren't you
the host from Trigger?

502
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,285
- That's me.
- Holy crap, no fricking way!

503
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,162
I'm a huge fan of your work!
Like, your biggest fan!

504
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,456
I've watched every episode
that's ever aired! This is incredible!

505
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,540
I appreciate that.

506
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,168
- Wow.
- Uh, thanks for your hard work, officers.

507
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,131
Okay, um…
yeah, so this prick…

508
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,925
I mean, this, uh, TV producer…

509
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,306
You feel wronged?

510
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,642
To be fair, judging by the footage,

511
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,685
they had every reason to suspect you.

512
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,938
If you're gonna feed
stray cats, do it out in the open.

513
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,022
Be proud of it.

514
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,274
You don't seem to care
what people think anyway.

515
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,859
I just wanna live
a long, quiet life, okay?

516
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,528
I'm not trying to do good deeds.

517
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,696
But anyway, thank you.

518
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,365
I'll pay you back somehow.

519
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,991
No need for that.

520
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,786
I'll be there
whether it's the 10th or 100th time.

521
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,081
That is in the job description, after all.

522
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,546
I'm starting to like you, Mr. Han.

523
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,932
Think of sunflowers. Pretty, right?

524
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,032
Exquisite flowers bloom from their center,
but still they pretend to have thorns.

525
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,369
You're a little like that,
so prickly with everyone.

526
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,996
It's almost like you wanna get hurt.

527
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,124
The point is, I don't care
if you pee-bombed someone.

528
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,667
Or were a nepo hire.

529
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,544
Let's be a team.

530
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,382
I'm not pretending.

531
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,219
I've been screwed over so many times
that I have trouble trusting people.

532
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,555
I flat-out don't trust people, actually.

533
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,102
So do me a favor and warn me
before you get all soft like that.

534
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,520
'Cause if you keep that up…

535
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,273
I might start trusting again.

536
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,373
THIS BUILDING BELONGS TO
A DELINQUENT LANDLORD!

537
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,000
I CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK THE DEPOSIT.
KEEP THE PLACE.

538
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,337
RENTAL SCAM PROPERTY

00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,299
JANG HAKUI

540
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,425
I CAN'T GIVE YOU BACK THE DEPOSIT…

541
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,322
That's cute.

542
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,531
"THIRST, MOTHER, THE UNJUST"

543
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,050
There he is again.

544
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,011
- No, Dad, don't! Stop it!
- Stay still! I said, stay still!

545
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,597
How dare you steal?
Did you forget your dad's a cop?

546
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,974
I told you to stay still!
Why won't you listen to me?

547
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,935
- Hyung said I had to!
- Why, you little shit!

548
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,228
I promise, he made me!

549
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,355
- Just say you're sorry!
- Stay still.

550
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,608
- Just tell your father you're sorry!
- Hyung, why aren't you saying anything?

551
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,276
I told you to stay still.

552
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,945
- Damn it, I said stay still!
- Hyung!

553
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,321
Hyung!

554
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,781
Hyung!

555
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,912
Hakuna matata.

556
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,793
Hakuna matata.

557
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,548
Oh, my gosh, what is this?

558
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:40,343
Again? My God,
what kind of sick maniac would do this?

559
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,388
Oh, my God,
this time it was a mother and kitten!

560
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,348
And they sewed their eyes shut.

561
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,766
What is happening in this country?

562
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,727
Why won't they do something
about the mentally ill?

563
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,812
Those poor things.

564
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,064
Don't you think we should call the cops?

565
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,983
What kind of monster
could do such a thing?

566
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,026
Hey, hey. Do you really
have to take a photo of that?

567
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,903
You have no idea
how many views this'll get.

568
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,366
That's just disgusting.
Keep walking, kids.

569
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,909
Nothing to see here. Go on.

570
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,047
Hey! I could charge you!

571
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,300
Officer! Anyone call in
a cat-related incident?

572
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,469
Are you just barging in here
and asking questions?

573
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,803
That cat yesterday.

574
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,182
It's been murdered.
They found its body next to its mother.

575
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,391
We've gotten reports,

576
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,102
chopped-up cats have been turning up
around the neighborhood.

577
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,146
Whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

578
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,773
I hear you, a cat's been killed.

579
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,441
Understood. What do you want us to do?

580
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,609
What do you mean?

581
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,320
People can't just do that to an animal!

582
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,072
All right, do you see
what we're dealing with over here?

583
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,908
I understand that you're an animal lover,

584
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,994
but unless it's a mass-killing situation,
a few animal deaths don't matter.

585
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,996
I mean, it's not
as though you saw the perpetrator.

586
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,956
You think this psycho
who killed these animals

587
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,875
doesn't have it in him
to kill a human, huh?

588
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,252
Lady, come on!

589
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,545
You can't do that here!

590
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,465
Ugh, come on, let's get you
to the… the bathroom. Hurry up!

591
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,403
Oh, Jesus, how long was I out?

592
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,489
- You're back from the States?
- Wake up, get it together.

593
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,534
I didn't go to the States,
it's only been a day.

594
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,618
Whoa, really?

595
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,703
Oh, man, you threw me off.

596
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,293
Oh, so, um, yesterday,
while I was researching,

597
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,711
I logged onto the dark web.

598
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,839
Man, it's scary out there.

599
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,674
Like, animal abuse forums?

600
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,592
One look
and you'll lose faith in humanity.

601
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,761
People can be straight-up evil.

602
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,346
- This is it here?
- Yeah, that one.

603
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,597
That's not it.

604
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,769
SERIAL CAT KILLER OF SEOCHO-GU

605
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,397
Is this your way
of getting back at them for yesterday?

606
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,315
Or are you collaborating with Giho?

607
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,985
I didn't ask you
to write a pitch for this story.

608
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:04,153
What do you mean? Collaborating?

609
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,530
The cat from yesterday

610
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,490
and its mother was killed.

611
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:10,159
They were both viciously slaughtered
and left out on the street.

612
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,829
Whoever did this, they're not even human.

613
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,913
Hey, what are you even…

614
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,957
Are you talking about
that cat story from the internet?

615
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,084
The police don't care
because they're just cats.

616
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,295
This psycho needs to be exposed,

617
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,714
and it's our responsibility
to do it on the show.

618
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,799
Hey, wait…

619
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,926
Did you… read my pitch?

620
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,304
Did I what?

621
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,180
Look, it's almost identical to mine.

622
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,807
I'm not a mind reader.

623
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,851
How would I possibly know
what's in your pitch?

624
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,020
Whatever, man, just come out
and admit it if you copied it!

625
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,855
- But I didn't copy you!
- Well, you must have!

626
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,648
What's wrong with you?
You still half-asleep?

627
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,525
What are you talking about?
Your proposal is exactly the same as mine!

628
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,527
And why do you keep
putting your feet up on my chair?

629
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,778
- What the hell are you talking...
- You're completely insane!

630
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:46,946
Come on, come on.

631
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,323
Calm it down, okay?

632
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,659
What a lively crew we've got.
And it's still only morning.

633
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,329
Conference room, now.

634
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,752
All right, so, about Mr. Han's story…

635
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,341
These cats are getting killed
left and right,

636
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,260
but the perpetrator's hard to catch,
and it's unclear how he'd be charged,

637
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,179
so the cops aren't doing anything.

638
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,973
If we could unmask the killer live,
it'd get tons of attention,

639
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,393
and I'm guessing they'd stop
for fear of getting doxxed.

640
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,940
Mr. Han may seem agitated,

641
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,816
he was framed
as the cat killer last night.

642
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,443
I'm not agitated, I'm outraged!

643
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,487
And not because
I got framed as the killer.

644
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,740
This is my brain's natural response
after seeing the sick and terrible things

645
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,824
done to those poor cats.

646
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,368
Putting all of that aside,

647
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,578
this talk of unmasking the killer,

648
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,497
that's absolutely not what we do here.

649
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,748
I like it.

650
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,000
I gotta say, it's more topical

651
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,252
than a 20-year-old missing person's case.

652
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,755
- Give it a go.
- Come on now, sir!

653
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,048
Lower your voice.

654
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,008
I'm not one of your underlings.

655
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,976
Trigger's internal policy
is that we put aside hierarchy

656
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,519
when it comes to debating what we cover.

657
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,773
Not once have we ever chosen a story
just because a higher-up told us to.

658
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,442
I don't know how it was
in the newsroom though.

659
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,652
Excuse me, sir.

660
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,322
This is a proposal I wrote.
Please have a look.

661
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,783
- Kang Giho.
- Oh, Mr. Kang?

662
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,243
Why are you handing me this?

663
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,411
Uh, so the…

664
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:23,167
Um… the, uh… the cat incident,
I was actually on that story first.

665
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,252
If you look at my proposal...

666
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,420
So work together.

667
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,589
Use your AP chops
to help Mr. Han with his segment.

668
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,966
Sir?

669
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,051
You're an associate producer, no?

670
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,095
Bold move listing these credentials.

671
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,807
We don't exactly require
a degree from the top schools,

672
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,184
but we do have some standards.

673
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,895
And here you are,
listing a college I've never heard of.

674
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,655
Sir, I assumed you of all people
would give respect to my staff.

675
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,532
But apparently I was wrong.

676
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,701
I won't stand for this.

677
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,789
I've taped our conversation
from yesterday, so if you keep this up,

678
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,875
I'll go public about the cancellation,

679
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,210
about everything we discussed,

680
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,838
and let the police handle Dr. Trigger.

681
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,757
That seems like a much simpler solution.

682
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,229
Cancellation? Did I hear that?

683
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:28,900
Uh, what just… Oh.

684
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,614
Oh. Hi, sir.

685
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,909
- How are we doing?
- I suggest you keep your staff in line.

686
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,543
I truly had no idea.

687
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,129
I don't even really care about this stuff.

688
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,923
I just wanted to catch the killer that...

689
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,466
But that's even worse.

690
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,927
My dream is to produce my own stories.

691
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,224
What you just said makes it
even more humiliating and hurtful.

692
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,143
At least pretend you want this job.

693
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,571
Why the roof?

694
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,120
Ms. Oh…

695
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,914
Do you think I'm stupid too?

696
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,083
You never ever
take my calls, do you?

697
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,128
I just climbed nine flights of stairs.

698
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,587
I couldn't talk on the phone.

699
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,506
Why didn't you just take the elevator?

700
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,218
You could've just taken the elevator,

701
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,178
you didn't have to walk up
all those stairs.

702
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,608
Are you done crying?

703
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,360
I'm not even halfway done.

704
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,696
Have you considered grad school?

705
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,825
I could probably help you
with some of the tuition.

706
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,914
We're supposed to be
in the AI brave new world by now.

707
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,750
And this place is stuck in the past.

708
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,461
All style and no substance.

709
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:15,006
It's no wonder everybody's
always trash-talking the media.

710
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:20,219
So are we… gonna get canceled?

711
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,644
That guy Han, first he reminded me
of a cat, you know what I mean?

712
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,229
'Cause he's petty and feline,

713
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,857
but turns out he's a cold-hearted snake.

714
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,610
And you seriously gave up
your big America trip for that?

715
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,653
Are you crazy?

716
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,572
Why would I give up on
Cha Seongwook because of Han?

717
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,698
Then why stay?

718
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,912
My Cha Seongwook contact got in touch.

719
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,627
BLUEBEARD: GIVE ME A FEW DAYS
TO BRING CHO HAEWON TO KOREA.

720
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,587
I got Han's call soon after that.

721
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,380
Hey, Mr. Han.

722
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,091
Wha… Whoa, you mean…

723
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,595
Cho… Cho Haewon, the… the woman
who used to go out with Cha Seongwook?

724
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,056
That's crazy.

725
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,643
I'm gonna hit this out of the park.

726
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,395
No one's canceling Trigger.

727
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,233
Don't sweat it, okay?

728
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,236
You're a sparkling, pretty little thing.
Don't let the school stuff get you down.

729
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,613
Believe me, I don't want it to.

730
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,618
And it's a misunderstanding,
the Han Do thing.

731
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,496
He's not the kind of guy
who would steal someone's work.

732
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,747
Whoa, hold on a minute.

733
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,415
How are you…

734
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,417
Are you seriously siding with him now?

735
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,337
Man, I feel like
I'm totally alone in this!

736
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,630
I mean, how?

737
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,340
You've only known the guy for a few days.

738
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,424
Are you kidding me?

739
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,677
How can you be so fickle with your love?

740
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,137
My what? That's dramatic.

741
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,681
You know what? Hang on, stop. Stop.

742
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,099
I want you to tell me here and now!

743
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,600
Do you choose me or that snake?

744
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,353
Snake-cat? Hurry up and choose already.

745
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,105
Aren't you cold? I'm going in.

746
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,941
- You'll catch a cold out here.
- Wait, hold on, wait…

747
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,777
Come on, please! Wait, wait!
Please, you can just choose me!

748
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,196
And there. Welcome.

749
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,493
How's your arm doing? Looks fine now.

750
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,788
Have you gotten
any new footage since yesterday?

751
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,540
So you saw that thing this morning, huh?

752
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,000
Man, whoever did that's a real freak.

753
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,167
Right, about that.

754
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,836
So since we parted ways,

755
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,754
did you notice anyone suspicious
hanging around here?

756
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,631
If I had, I would've reported it myself.

757
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,300
Welcome.

758
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,176
How are we gonna find this sicko?

759
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,886
I'm giving you my contact info.

760
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,347
If you catch anything on video
or see something suspicious,

761
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,515
call and let us know.

762
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,184
Wait a minute,
does you giving me your contact info

763
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:34,395
mean that Trigger's covering this story?

764
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,315
Hell yeah, Oh Soryong,
let's freaking go! All right!

765
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,817
Man, with you on it,
that animal killer is cooked.

766
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,819
Aren't they? I mean, it's only
a matter of time now, you know? You...

767
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,696
Dude, it's not like
Trigger's the actual police!

768
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,159
You're a horrible judge of character.
Maybe work on that.

769
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,664
"1do"? That's his email?

770
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,083
More like "one don't".
Man, that guy's a jerk.

771
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,213
The slipped up dogs of war return.

772
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,049
I think we're more like freedom fighters.

773
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,801
Did he leave?

774
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,304
He's out working on that story
that just got confirmed.

775
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,598
The snake went scurrying off like a rat.

776
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,185
And I'm asking you, for God's sake,
call me when Mr. Son comes in, okay?

777
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:15,394
You and that temper of yours

778
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,272
always end up escalating
even minor issues.

779
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,566
Excuse me,

780
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,984
can I get Han Do's number?

781
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,779
He's been here long enough,
why doesn't he have a business card?

782
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,322
The company's really slacking off.

783
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,574
All right, why do you want Han's number?

784
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,910
I'm trying to do some work here. You know?

785
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,579
Mr. Son told me to help him
on this project, remember?

786
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,373
With this energy,
you could be chief one day.

787
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,291
Yeah. Yeah.

788
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,210
We need to talk.

789
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,046
So I just got word,

790
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,256
they've got their own
Dr. Trigger task force.

791
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,092
President Koo's overseeing it.

792
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,301
According to my source,

793
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,221
he's already got
some security camera footage.

794
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,515
The edit bay in our building
didn't have CCTV though.

795
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,934
But they're saying
it's from a camera in the hallway.

796
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,394
It's got a month's storage on it.

797
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,896
Every team member walked down that hall,
that won't narrow it down.

798
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,439
Well, think again.

799
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,566
They spotted an outsider.

800
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,361
Someone who wasn't supposed to be there
was caught on tape.

801
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,197
Anyway, they're thinking
there's a high probability

802
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,865
that this outsider is Dr. Trigger.

803
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,743
Things are getting pretty dicey for us.

804
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,538
We're this close
to being taken off the air.

805
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,501
Outsider?

806
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,172
Hey, um…

807
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,718
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop or anything,

808
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,806
but there's actually
this one old guy in the area…

809
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,935
They… they call him crazy garbage man.

810
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,521
Anyway, a friend of mine said…

811
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,443
that they saw the old guy
burning some dead cats.

812
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,695
- Dead cats?
- Yeah.

813
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,281
I've got it on video.

814
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,169
Do you know where this guy lives?

815
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,295
"TO BE DEMOLISHED"

816
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,754
The area is condemned,

817
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,049
so everyone else left,
and his house is the only one standing.

818
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,742
- Hello?
- Yo.

819
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,243
It's me, Kang Giho.

820
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,329
What were you thinking,
rushing off by yourself?

821
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,915
I had to, I got a tip
from the convenience store.

822
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,166
Wait, you… you… you what?

823
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:45,211
I'm actually at
the suspect's house right now.

824
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,631
In a sec, I'm gonna send
my source's contact

825
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,715
so you can set up an interview.

826
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,176
Wha… Uh… He…

827
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,609
Rat!

828
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,489
We've got the staff writer candidate here.

829
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,366
Cancellation or not,
we've got tons of work.

830
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,701
We do need to hire,

831
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,452
- so if you're busy, I'll handle it.
- No, I'll come.

832
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,121
Ms. Hong.

833
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:04,707
About the cancellation.

834
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,834
I'm sorry I couldn't tell...

835
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,295
I don't need to know.
Don't worry about it.

836
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,008
Man, that's so weird.

837
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:15,801
So weird.

838
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,052
What's so weird?

839
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,222
That was Han Do on the phone,
he said he met a source for the cat thing

840
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,307
and asked me to set up an interview.

841
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,391
A source?

842
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,727
He's already found a source?
Where was this?

843
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,145
At the convenience store, I think.

844
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,313
What else?

845
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:29,857
Well, the number
that Mr. Han Do gave me

846
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,568
- isn't in service anymore.
- …is not in service.

847
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,986
Sure you didn't write it down wrong?

848
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,613
- Are you coming or not?
- Coming.

849
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,364
- Try checking it again.
- Okay.

850
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,658
So weird…

851
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,920
Chief, can I steal her?

852
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,004
What is it?

853
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,172
I'm sorry, this is urgent.

854
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,256
Ms. Oh.

855
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,385
Han Do is missing. He went off the grid.

856
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,804
Calls were going through earlier
before you got here,

857
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,639
but now it goes straight to voicemail.

858
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,765
Do you think something happened to him?

859
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:46,558
Did you double-check the number?
Call him again?

860
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,185
It still says it's out of service.

861
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,899
Um, Ms. Oh.

862
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,777
What if the person he found
really was the cat killer, an… and

863
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,153
he wound up inside the killer's house?

864
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,281
Yeah, I'm gonna call the police
and check things out on the scene.

865
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,075
You call Han Do's family, okay?

866
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,287
Breaking into a stranger's home

867
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,915
and then relieving himself.

868
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,625
Those are some bad manners.

869
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,794
Uh, I heard the cats meowing,

870
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,046
and the door was open, so…

871
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,176
Here. Eat up.

872
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,098
Bless you.

873
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,358
What are you doing?

874
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,784
- Hey, don't paint my finger...
- No, no…

875
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,994
Seriously, don't paint…

876
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,246
What are you...

877
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,956
You need to stay clean and well-kempt

878
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,751
as a member of society.

879
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,461
That's how people will respect you.

880
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,758
If that's the case,
why do you live like this?

881
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,217
Oh, I'm a lost cause.

882
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,512
Because of the way I look,

883
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,723
even the police won't listen to me.

884
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,349
Well, there you go.

885
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,435
If you really want
to help the cats, take care of…

886
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,521
If you keep this up,
no one'll want anything to do with you.

887
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,106
I'm not just talking about the police.

888
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:17,900
You came to me, didn't you?

889
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,818
That's good enough for me.

890
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,113
I sat by, looking on

891
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,200
as those poor things were murdered,
one after the other.

892
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:29,244
I couldn't stand it any longer.

893
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:33,624
So I decided
to bring these fellows on home with me.

894
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,711
I leashed them
with a bit of plastic twine.

895
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,963
Some of them got away though.

896
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,717
Heaven help the monster behind this.

897
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,679
How could they do something so heinous
to these little angels?

898
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,601
I could say the same about what you did.

899
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,896
Why'd you burn them? Jesus…

900
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,856
I was told the law says

901
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,442
dead animals are disposed of

902
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,820
in simple garbage bags.

903
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,904
I couldn't…

904
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,573
How could I do that
to their poor, suffering souls?

905
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:11,328
I knew I had to cremate them
so they could move on to a better place.

906
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,542
Hang on, how'd you know about that?

907
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,794
Apparently, a student saw you do it.

908
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,713
And they say
that it terrified her to death.

909
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,300
That kid was making up stories!

910
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,471
What?

911
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,430
Hey, grandpa…

912
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,142
how'd you like to die
with your little friend?

913
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,853
You'd like that?

914
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,837
I saw the cat murderer.

915
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,340
I know who it is.

916
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,968
I should have dealt with him
then and there.

917
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,931
Han Do!

918
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,184
Han Do!

919
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,854
Han Do…

920
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:06,860
How did you…

921
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,820
How do you think?

922
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,448
By scouring all CCTV footage leading here,

923
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,200
starting with the convenience store.

924
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,932
I'm sorry.

925
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,936
I don't think I've ever been
this embarrassed in my entire life.

926
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,896
I…

927
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,566
You know what? Never mind.

928
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,194
I'm sorry about all this,

929
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,821
but we gotta catch
that kid who lied to me.

930
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,990
Who's we? Who'll do the catching?

931
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,616
After hearing this guy's story,

932
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,284
I'm thinking that kid fed me wrong info.

933
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,452
And what if he's the perp?

934
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,621
Are you gonna defecate on his house?

935
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,623
Your fear response is really something.

936
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:02,708
That's so…

937
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,668
That's a low blow. Mocking me for my...

938
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,752
All right, stop.

939
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,592
No way.

940
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,971
You went in there without a camera?

941
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,140
You recorded nothing?

942
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,599
Oh, um…

943
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,815
Amateur mistake.

944
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:29,609
These kids are lying to you
'cause they know they'll get away with it.

945
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,155
Hey! Hey man, are you okay?

946
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,074
Are you… You're not injured, are you?

947
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,076
Oh, man, I was like…

948
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,204
so worried your body
would turn up tomorrow, all chopped up!

949
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,081
What's with the pants, man?

950
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,917
- Huh?
- I don't care what Son said.

951
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,253
You're not leadership material yet.

952
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:51,173
We'll pick someone
once we see how this turns out.

953
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,674
Effective immediately,

954
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:55,177
the two of you'll work together,
in the same role.

955
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,888
- Huh?
- Listen to me, Han.

956
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,723
Our team has to operate as a unit.

957
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,892
So don't go and try to be a hero.

958
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:04,186
And from now on,
Kang Giho is your new best friend.

959
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,480
His life is yours, and your life is his.

960
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,067
If you don't like it,
go back to where you came from.

961
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,995
- Don't.
- Sounds like he agreed to it.

962
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,455
Right?

963
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,834
I'll go have a talk with the old guy.

964
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,711
Take care of him.

965
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,671
Taking care of people's what I do best.

966
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,049
We're gonna have our meeting
back at the office.

967
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,300
Hey, let's go.

968
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,384
Come on.

969
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,053
Hop in, let's go.

970
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,702
I live in apartment 106.

971
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,496
Can you help me out?

972
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,123
My bag is a little heavy.

973
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,312
Oh, come on,
we had a one-night stand,

974
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,356
you think we're a couple now or…

975
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:33,567
You recorded it?

976
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,986
Are you freaking insane? What are you…

977
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,695
I went to that store and they said
that you already took the footage.

978
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,906
Yup, we've got the guy's face on tape.

979
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,254
Whoa, don't press that! Don't…

980
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:40,091
Haven of Trust demands
the release of Pastor Kim and his wife!

981
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,885
- I've about had it with these cult freaks.
- Release them now!

982
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,311
Are you all right?

983
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,525
You…

984
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:34,122
