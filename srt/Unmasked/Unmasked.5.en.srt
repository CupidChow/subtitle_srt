00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,158
I'll get meds from the pharmacy there.
You wait here.

Do, where are you?

14
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,732

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,819

-Don't worry about that! You're bleeding!

00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,690

- Please stay inside.

-Yeah.
-Grab the camera in my car

52
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,881
and get footage of everything.

53
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,758
And call me if anything else happens.

54
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,885
They said the building could collapse
even more, you didn't hear that?

55
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,137
It's not like I told you

56
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,221
- to go inside to shoot.
- Whoa, ma'am!

57
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,056
-I'm gonna need your information.
-Right.

58
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,599
See if there were any children.

59
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,977
Go check. If there were kids on the bus,
how many were there?

60
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,270
- Close the door.
- You got that?

61
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,980
Huh? Han Do!

62
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,690
Hey, first, check on the children!

63
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,358
The children, okay? Check on the children!

64
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,718
I'm reporting live

65
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,303
from the scene
of the Haksung-dong building collapse.

66
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,388
According to the witnesses at the scene,

67
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,849
up until the moment of the collapse,
lots of people

68
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,435
were walking around,
tending to business as usual…

69
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,786
You contact the family?

70
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,287
We're still trying
to get in touch with them.

71
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,413
Han Do.

72
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,341
Who was that who died?

73
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,676
School bus driver,
crushed under the rubble.

74
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,473
And the kids?

75
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,725
Did any kids get hurt?

76
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,520
No, they were all in class.

77
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,695
Who'd you leave there to get footage?

78
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,408
There was already a news team.
Why was I needed?

79
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,161
The building is the evidence
in this kind of disaster.

80
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,288
You're an investigative journalist,
lucky to be at the scene.

81
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,499
Don't leave
just 'cause the press vans get there.

82
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,127
You stay put, at the very least,
to see what happened,

83
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,838
talk to the witnesses,
get leads on cover-up efforts…

84
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,090
Is anyone attempting to control the story?

85
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,094
You know, I'm a victim too.

86
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,263
I've never experienced
anything like this before.

87
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,056
Yeah, same for the civilians
helping out.

88
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,308
- Were they taught how to do that?
- Ms. Oh Soryong?

89
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,977
I need you for a CT scan.

90
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,105
Since you're so proud to admit

91
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,441
you have poor judgment,
Mr. I'm-in-the-right…

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,860
just go home then, okay?

93
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,736
You won't be needed here.

94
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,200
Oh, that's fine.

95
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,911
What is her problem?

96
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,753
Hello?

97
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,255
Uh, chief…

98
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,633
apparently, Ms. Oh's, uh…
at the hospital with Han Do.

99
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,135
She was at the scene of the incident.

100
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,722
Was she there to report
or was she a victim of what went on?

101
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,558
How could you, a producer,
leave out those details?

102
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,560
Oh…

103
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,730
uh, she seems to…
have gotten injured, but, uh…

104
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,773
I heard she walked
to get her CAT scan,

105
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,484
so I guess it's not too serious.

106
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,111
-How's Mr. Han?
-I wanted to ask, but the phone--

107
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:10,031
Just quit, man, if you're gonna
fumble around like some assistant.

108
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,159
Sir, I'm sorry. I'll try…
I'll try and reach them again.

109
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,078
When interviewing
the parents and citizens who rushed

110
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,707
to the scene of the accident,
they commented that this incident

111
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,792
bears an uncanny resemblance…

112
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,295
God, that Ms. Oh.
Trouble just seems to follow her.

113
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,506
Who is she, the Pied Piper of Disaster?

114
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,426
Out of all the places she could've gone,
she's got to be there?

All right, ma'am. We're ready to go.

Ms. Oh Soryong.

121
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,448
Ms. Oh Soryong?

122
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,575
Huh?

123
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,619
How are you feeling?
Do you feel any nausea, or--

124
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,330
Uh, well… I feel a bit dizzy actually.

125
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,457
You have a concussion
and a hairline fracture along your rib.

126
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,542

We've been trying to reach you.

127
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,086
Ms. Oh? We'll keep you here till tomorrow.

128
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,463
You'll be discharged
once your CRP level returns to normal.

129
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,673
Oh, I've really got to go.

130
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,300
I've got to get back
to the office right away.

131
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,884
If you don't want to see an early grave,

132
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,220
then stay off the screens
and get some rest.

133
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,306
You need to focus on recovery.

134
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,099
Get some sleep, okay?

135
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,021

00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,522

and cell phone.

138
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,866
You make sure to get some rest now.

139
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,209
Stop! Put it in park.

Hi, Ms. Oh.

146
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,389
What are you doing here?

147
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,932
I… wanted to bring some clothes for you.

148
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,061
Uh, that and…
these are for you too.

149
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,312
Flowers?

150
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,398
You didn't have to do that,
I know everybody's busy.

151
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,525
These are actually from Cho Haewon.

152
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,777
They even came with a card.

153
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,030
Dear Mr. Han
To our surprisingly nice first encounter

154
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,240
Han?

155
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,536
What took you so long?
I texted a while ago.

156
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,913
My phone?

157
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,416
The nurse said they're not allowed.

158
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,460
Oh, wow,
so you can follow directions.

159
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,297
Are you and Haewon having a fling?

160
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,967
It's none of my business
whether it's an affair

161
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,385
or she's being clingy,

162
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,804
just make sure
not to leak anything confidential.

163
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,180
Hmm? Nothing about the team.

164
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,685
I heard I was your pick for main producer.

165
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,021
Isn't that a serious role
for someone you don't have much faith in?

166
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,984
All right then, I'll be going now.

167
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,820
-It's late, you guys go together.
-No, actually, I'm not finished.

168
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,490
No, really, I better go. Good night!

169
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,201

Don't snoop around without permission.

174
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,016
You carry around
a list of the names of people

175
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,769
who were killed in an accident
20 years ago.

176
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,438
Wanna tell me why?

177
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,774
You looking for dirt on me?

178
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,526
Instead of what I told you to do?

179
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,779
Today's building collapse in Haksung-dong?

180
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:01,822
I plan on covering it.

181
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,327
Something happened.
What made you change your mind?

182
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,370
You normally shirk responsibility.

183
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,874
They're blaming the driver of the bus,
saying he parked illegally.

184
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,168
The same way they did back then.

185
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,379
In that one,
the media pinned those children's deaths

186
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,547
on the bus driver,

187
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,050
who supposedly decided on her own
to change routes.

188
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,469
The way the media is trying
to reshape the narrative

189
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,013
by victim-blaming the bus drivers…

190
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,849
by bringing up the fact

191
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,270
that they changed their route,
or that they parked the bus illegally…

192
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,773
the parallels cannot be ignored.

193
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,319
The only difference being that…

194
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,364
today's bus driver
is the only person who died.

195
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,616
20 years ago, only the driver lived.

196
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,662
I'm gonna look for
the only survivor not on this list.

197
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,833
That bus driver was named Ms. Yeom,
I believe.

198
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,674
Don't haphazardly dig up the past.

199
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,467
You want this case…

200
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,512
I suggest you focus on today's event.

201
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,596
Huh.

202
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,015
And what about…

203
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,935
Cha Seongwook, from 20 years ago?

204
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,729
Isn't that digging up the past?

205
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,359
I'm even more invested now, Ms. Oh…

206
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,821
seeing your response.

207
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,950
You can keep the flowers.

208
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,334
Editing In Progress

209
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,216
Why do you keep telling me
to come in here?

210
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,176
-This place is totally cursed.
-Oh, KP!

211
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,387
Are you insane?

212
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,597
You really are, aren't you?

213
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,181
They've caught the cheater.

214
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,100
Besides, that wasn't us
in the footage, KP.

215
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,810
-The sounds you make are way different--
-Shh!

216
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,020
You always run your mouth!

217
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,148
That's why the chief
keeps getting on your case every day.

218
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,649
Why would you say something like that?

219
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,652
You know, you should've thought
before you took that position.

220
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,448
I told you becoming a main producer
when you're contract does you no good.

221
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,909
How many times have I said
that a softie like you isn't built

222
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,993
for that kind of pressure?

223
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,038
And I told you that it was my dream
to be a producer at Trigger.

224
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,373
Others can say whatever they want to,

225
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,542
but to hear my Kissy Princess say that…

226
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,961
That breaks my heart. It hurts.

227
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,176
Come here.

228
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,844
Just go.

229
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,387
-Come here!
-Go.

230
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,556
-That's what you want?
-No, wait, don't leave.

231
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,104
Your hugs are the next best thing
when I'm low on sugar.

232
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,359
- Whoa, watch your hands!
- Huh?

233
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,537
If it's not important, come back later.

234
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,249
Reading up on cancer?

235
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,834
Could be you're sick,
but that's a cliché.

236
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,003
Maybe it's karma?

237
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,756
What is it this time?

238
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,257
Are you gonna blabber on
about the files?

239
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,259
Would it kill you
to share what you're up to?

240
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,137
Why won't you tell us
what you need them for?

241
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,723
This is the kind of stuff
that drives your staff insane.

242
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,142
-You know that?
-Good Lord, come on now.

243
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,604
You respect your other superiors,
buying them gifts every season,

244
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,272
but you never do
anything like that for me.

245
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,275
"Do unto others
as you would have them do unto you."

246
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,279
I'll return them once I'm done with them,
so just go.

247
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,533
If you keep bugging me,
that cliché might become a reality.

248
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,451
God, I swear, if you sold off those files,

249
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,621
I'll personally kill you
well before the cancer does.

250
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,834
I'm worried about Soryong.

251
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,797
Why do you worry?

252
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,881
It's like a hobby with you.

253
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,300
God, you're heartless. Unbelievable.

254
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,556
I do sometimes wonder though…

255
00:16:56,056 --> 00:17:00,227
If her past hadn't been how it was,
would she be the same person today?

256
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,732
I'm not sure I know the answer.

257
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,233
One thing I know though…

258
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,486
the Oh Soryong we know now
is tough as hell.

259
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,865
88,002 sheep…

260
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,745
88,003 sheep…

261
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,965
Ow…

262
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,102
Cha Seongwook Lives

263
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,396
It's obviously just some permanent marker.

264
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,814
Not really much to see here.

265
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,775
Right, and it's not like…

266
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,943
there's any CCTV here either.

267
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,779
I guess it's all we've got to work with.

268
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,030
Shouldn't you…

269
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,990
at least be treating me to some haejangguk

270
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,950
for helping you out
this early in the morning?

271
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,619
I know we're working together
on this case

272
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,953
and I appreciate the help, but…

273
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,122
you've been doing this way too often.

274
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,708
Jin Noodles

275
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,419
Any details
on the Haksung-dong incident yesterday?

276
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,506
The original contractor is GR E&C.

277
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,008
On the documents,
GR let Grand Architecture

278
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,052
take over the demolition work,

279
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,804
but they basically turned a blind eye

280
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,307
when they illegally subcontracted out
to Chungdae Industries.

281
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,602
Calling Chungdae a company
would be a stretch.

282
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,395
He's basically a one-man operation.

283
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,314
It's not your precinct.
How do you know this?

284
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,442
They caused a couple of accidents
at our precinct a few years ago.

285
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,945
They botched a bunch of project sites.

286
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,197
Their shoddy work
claimed five innocent lives.

287
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,408
During my investigation,
I rounded up all the accidents

288
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,786
that happened
on GR's construction sites nationwide,

289
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,956
they have a bad habit
of letting people die on their watch.

290
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,207
A murderous corporation…

291
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,459
The Serious Accidents Punishment Act
is useless.

292
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,754
They save 250,000 per square meter
when they subcontract.

293
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,173
They only got to pay 40,000 with Chungdae.

294
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,634
And then all that money
goes into Heo Geumran's war chest.

295
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,553
And she takes care
of the former officials,

296
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,263
keeps the VIPs happy.

297
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,889
Heo Geumran?

298
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,851
Their chairperson's a woman?

299
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,436
Because of all this,
the opportunity's there

300
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,064
to take advantage
and fuck up GR for good.

301
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,650
If we look at the Haksung-dong incident
as a gold nugget,

302
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,235
if you just keep digging,

303
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,445
you'll… find this incredible treasure.

304
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,780
A vast corruption network!

305
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,157
It's not uncommon.

306
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,700
That's true for lots of places.

307
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,577
I got a whole pile on my desk.

308
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,339
It's from GR.

309
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,135
Just take it. It's ten million.

310
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,762
You know this, I'm sure, but…

311
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,056
GR didn't know anything about this.

312
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,434
Let's just say
we signed a contract between us, okay?

313
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,061
It was GR
who made us work into the night though.

314
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,399
They even sent thugs
threatening we wouldn't get paid.

315
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:53,734
If we weren't done working by morning,

316
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,485
-they said that--
-No, Chungdae.

317
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,864
You need the money, don't you?

318
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,741
Just be grateful for the payout.

319
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,452
Thank the Accidents Punishment Act
for that.

320
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,537
Listen, man…

321
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,248
I heard someone was killed.

322
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,418
The guy who died was my age.

323
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,504
-I'm sure he had kids and everything--
-No, you listen.

324
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,299
They're gonna go ahead
and pin everything on us anyway.

325
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,051
So we might as well get paid for it.

326
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,678
God, you're so damn soft.

327
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,057
Confidentiality Agreement

328

To Apologize to the People

330
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,698
Isn't that the driver's family?

331
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,408
Oh, my gosh,
it's the widow.

332
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,453
You're right, it is.
It's the driver's wife.

333
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,122
It's the bus driver's wife!
Get the shot! Go. Go.

334
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,633
We've done a grave injustice…

335
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,304
…to the deceased and to his family.

336
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,432
I'm so sorry.

337
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,483
Heo Apologizes On Her Knees

338
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,609
"I Sincerely Apologize"

Heo Moves Hearts With Heartfelt Apology

341
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,124
Can I see the case files
for the '04 Sun Plaza Building Collapse?

342
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,376
What for?

343
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,460
To use as a reference

344
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,587
'cause I'm covering
what happened last night.

345
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,385
First the cat incident,
and now this.

346
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,929
It sure seems like
our rookie has a strong inclination

347
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,181
to work on cases
he was directly involved in.

348
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,516
Yeah.

349
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,310
I'm a one-dimensional thinker.

350
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,395
The problem here is…

351
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,480
despite its scale, the story doesn't hit.

352
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,024
The cause of the collapse is obvious

353
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,027
and a random man in his 40s
was the only fatality.

354
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,111
It's horrible.

355
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,781
Honestly, I'm furious and I feel awful
about what happened, but…

356
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,074
just think…

357
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,119
is this really gonna pique
the interest of our viewers?

358
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,830
Production budgets don't grow on trees.

359
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,914
Wow.

360
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:16,752
Trigger's main writer is pricing out
my story based on the value of a life.

361
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,628
Excuse me?

362
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,755
Pricing out?

363
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,883
You decided the story wasn't worth it
based on your value of a human life,

364
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,301
I think that's pretty clear.

365
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,224
I looked up this GR corporation
since they caused the incident.

366
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,811
Someone died on one of their sites
almost every year.

367
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,856
42 cases just last year,
including ones that resulted in deaths,

368
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,400
only three of those cases
were settled in court,

369
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,861
and in those cases, they got fined
less than three million won.

370
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,404
The rest, they just got a warning.

371
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,532
Wouldn't you agree
it's more than a coincidence?

372
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,910
The corruption
of a giant construction firm

373
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,120
lurking in the shadows
of a building collapse…

374
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,456
is that worth more to you
than the death of a middle-aged man?

375
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,125
So now can I please have the case file?

376
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,128
Oh, hi, Ms. Oh!

377
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,382
- You're out of the hospital already?
- I'm here, aren't I?

378
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,718
What is it?

379
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,096
- Did he ask for the case file?
- Oh.

380
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,555
You heard us from the hallway, did you?

381
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:13,016
You might as well give it to him,
he's not going to budge on this.

382
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:15,977
You'll get the file.

383
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,187
First though…

384
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,898
I want to see that card Cho Haewon wrote.

385
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,441
-I threw it away.
-What?

386
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,901
Where is it now?

387
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,237
The lobby trash can.

388
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,249
This freaking guy, I swear…

389
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,795
God, I can't hold it in.

390
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,840
Where the hell are you going?

391
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,675
-You're the reason I'm in this mess!
-You're the one who wants to dig

392
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,010
in the garbage! Don't blame me!

393
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,887
You want to throw down, Mr. Han, huh?

394
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,515
Come on, what do you even need
that stupid thing for?

395
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,059
Tell me, what's some silly card gonna do?

396
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,979
I need a sample
of Cho Haewon's handwriting.

397
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,689
"Cha Seongwook Lives"

398
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,024
was written on a wall,
outside of his father's house.

399
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,901
I want to compare
the handwriting samples.

400
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,154
Is that all right?

401
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,948
Are you joking?

402
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,659
Come on, you're killing me!

403
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,080
Could you please, for the love of God,
explain yourself earlier?

404
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,753
Dear Mr. Han
To our surprisingly nice first encounter

405
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,839
Don't touch me with your trash hands!

406
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,924
Oh, wow.

407
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,926
You took a photo.
I didn't know it was so important.

408
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,845
Send it to me.

409
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,638
Seriously?

410
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,974
- Wait!
- What now?

411
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,143
Come see me when this is cleaned up.

412
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,394
Hey.

413
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,689
Ten minutes.

414
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,733
What is this, the army?

415
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:48,737
Let's just scrub ourselves clean,
then we can go our separate ways, yeah?

416
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,202
You know, you've been really moody
since that incident?

417
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,746
You've gotten really prickly lately,
just like I am.

418
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,372
You’re getting in my head.

419
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,041
I mean, you know what they say,

420
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,876
"It's important to make good friends."

421
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,212
"Friends," yeah, right.

422
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,922
I'll need 20 minutes
if I'm gonna dry my hair.

423
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,341
You're not entering a beauty pageant,
what are you--

424
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:10,884
Okay.

425
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,178
Bathhouse

426
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,387
She's no fun.

427
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:24,231
- I'm off then.
- Bye.

428
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,238
Sun Plaza Collapse and the Aftermath
PIC: Park Daeyong

429
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:37,327
Were you at a spa just now?

430
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,955
You smell like a bathhouse.

431
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,207
Here you go.

432
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,626
What is it?

433
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,294
Ms. Hong asked me to give it to you.

434
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,213
GR E&C Company Information

435
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,426
Contacts

436
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,267
Yeom Mijin

437
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,186
A 20-year-old number's
got to be outdated by now.

438
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,521
I doubt it'll even go through.

439
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,191
I'm telling you, it won't work.

440
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,902
Oh?

441
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,154
The number you have dialed
is not available.

442
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,907
- Please hang up and dial again.
- I told you it wouldn't work.

443
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,867
Uh, sir.

444
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,620
GR wrote back.

445
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,497
"We regret being unable to cooperate."

446
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,623
They turned us down.

447
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,459
I've also been in touch with the widow,
but she said she's got nothing to tell us

448
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,752
and to stop calling her.

449
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,463
I'm guessing GR already worked out
a settlement with her.

450
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,925
Any contact
with these giant corporations won't be a--

451
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,470
It's impossible, okay?
I doubt they'll agree to see us.

452
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,890
Songi, have you ever been
to a spa with Ms. Oh?

453
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,517
-Huh?
-I know I haven't.

454
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,394
What…

455
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,322
Somehow you've uncovered both my best work

456
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,990
and biggest failure as a producer.

457
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,410
Do you know how the ratings were
for this episode?

458
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,079
We weren't even able to hit one percent.

459
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,831
-Chief, the thing is--
-Hey.

460
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,125
-I've got nothing else to say.
-Let me say one thing.

461
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,836
I'll set this damn thing on fire.

462
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,130
If you wanna cover Haksung-dong,
go fuck with GR.

463
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,591
Why are you messing
with a humiliating past mistake of mine?

464
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,509
-Take this and get out!
-But wait, uh, chief…

465
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,470
Uh, just one… just one…

466
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,074
GR E&C

467
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,742
Wow.

468
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,124
Delivery.

469
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,419
Delivery to: Saeman Apartment
Pickup from: Hoho Sandwich

470
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,924
Why won't these punks
place a delivery order?

471
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,384
Delivery.

472
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,302
Delivery to: GR E&C Building
Pickup from: Hoho Sandwich

473
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,470
Nice.

474
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,687
Delivery for the fifth floor.

475
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,939
Sure, go on in.

476
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,123
We didn't order anything.

477
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,041
Korea Network System, that's me.

478
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,752
-Chairwoman Heo.
-Sir!

479
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,379
- Chairwoman Heo.
- Sir, you can't go in there!

480
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,506
-Chairwoman Heo…
-What the hell do you think you're doing?

481
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,675
I wouldn't have to do this
if you people had answered.

482
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,218
You know how many times I called you?

483
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,387
- Can we help you, sir?
- See? These guys are here

484
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,763
- to show me in.
- Grab him.

485
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,266
Wait, ju… just… let me go.

486
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,350
Would you please just…

487
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

488
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,811
Sir! Sir!

489
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,271
Looking at these consonants,

490
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:53,231
chieut, shiot, and digeut,

491
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,401
compared with the double shiot and rieul
used as the batchims,

492
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,737
their strokes and dots
are done differently.

493
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,364
It's unlikely that these were written
by the same person.

494
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,160
All right.

495
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,203
One thing to note
about this graffiti though,

496
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,788
is that it's rather well-written.

497
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,999
They were very calm, purposeful.

498
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,668
I'm gonna assume…
the writer was a woman.

499
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,044
A woman?

500
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,299
Who else but Cho Haewon would…

501
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,272
He wasn't pretending
to be a delivery person or anything.

502
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,941
He didn't force his way
into the building illegally,

503
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,860
so I'm not sure why you needed to contact

504
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,278
-our president's office.
-It's just that…

505
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:44,073
we've never had to deal
with this kind of approach before.

506
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,909
Right.

507
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,494
The delivery was a bit late.

508
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,832
Problems… only become problems
when you make them problems.

509
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,210
You can make them go away
like they never occurred.

510
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,838
We'll let this one slide.

511
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,548
All we ask is that…

512
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,718
you keep the Haksung-dong incident
under wraps.

513
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,931
You know, our chairwoman occasionally
plays golf with your president. Mm.

514
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,812
You know what? No.

515
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:17,524
Don't let it slide.
Let the whole world know what happened.

516
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,277
Trigger doesn't do backroom deals

517
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,488
or quid pro quos
as a matter of principle.

518
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,741
Oh, feel free to call the police
to report our producer.

519
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,701
That should save us some trouble,

520
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,786
and get the word out.

521
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,333
We plan on continuing to give
the Haksung-dong incident the fair and…

522
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,545
and unbiased coverage
that this story deserves to get.

523
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,422
Oh, our producer told me that…

524
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:44,092
you refused to do an interview

525
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,219
since the matter's
still under investigation.

526
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,512
Can I take that to mean

527
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:51,432
that GR will waive any and all rights
to refute our claims?

528
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,493
You're a nut job!
What the hell was all that?

529
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,789
And you, the team leader,
can you please get a handle on your guys?

530
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,165
Control your team!

531
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,126
I didn't just hear from our president.

532
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,295
I heard from
all sorts of senior official assholes

533
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,463
criticizing me for the way
we're doing our jobs here.

534
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,382
I've had it with you.

535
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,554
Go take… take some time off.

536
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,556
Go to the hospital,
get a Maldives in Mojito.

537
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:33,558
Literally anything
but what you're doing now.

538
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:36,269
At the very least, take a day off
where you're not doing anything!

539
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,478
Seriously!

540
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,899
-Hey, I can drive you.
-I drove here too!

541
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,192
I just didn't want to park
in GR's stupid garage!

542
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,446
Why?

543
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,739
Why'd you come here?

544
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,742
The chief told me
to quit looking into old mistakes of his

545
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,911
and start fucking over GR.

546
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,579
What kind of mistakes?

547
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,080
The Sun Plaza incident.

548
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,375
I just wanted to ask about Yeom Mijin,

549
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,086
but he completely flipped out
and he dragged me the hell out of there.

550
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,257
I came here so that I could see the boss,

551
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,177
Ms. Heo Geumran herself,
as a victim of this whole incident.

552
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,680
She's impossible to get ahold of
in a normal setting.

553
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,850
I had no other choice but to try this.

554
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,520
So you…

555
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,190
were willing to write an apology

556
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,776
if it led you
into the chairwoman's office?

557
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,195
What apology?

558
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,073
You'll be lucky with a minor pay cut,
considering the legal fees.

559
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,241
I'm sure Koo would love that, hmm?

560
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,701
I hear those two golf together.

561
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,916
Remember what happened today.

562
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,751
It's not a game we're playing here.

563
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,754
We're dealing with the real world.

564
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,131
With money, laws, your salary,
all at stake.

565
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:51,135
You're trying to screw them over here
with kid gloves.

566
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,305
If you wanna do this for real,

567
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,267
you've got to search carefully
to find their weakest link.

568
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,953
Oh my, look at you, my dear.

569
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,872
Oh! You've gotten even prettier
than before!

570
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,082
Oh, stop.

571
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,084
It could be because,
for the first time in a while,

572
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,129
we're actually playing some golf.

573
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,924
Yeah, that was some good acting though,
I'd say, huh?

574
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,718
You know, Ms. Heo, I almost cried.

575
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:36,931
You're great at showmanship,
I've always thought that.

576
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:42,729
Oh, you have no idea how hard it is
to make a living out there. Mm…

577
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:44,814
How's the minister?

578
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,649
Has he been doing well?

579
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,777
-He's worried sick about you, that's how.
-Oh, I know.

580
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:52,530
I'm so grateful
that it brings a tear to my eye.

581
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,491
Oh, that said,

582
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,161
I hope I can trust you with this one too.

583
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,872
I'm sure you know what to do.

584
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,960
Chungdae

585
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,837
I wired you 10 million.
Find a place to live.

586
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,047
My Wife

587
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,176
Confidentiality Agreement

588
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,136
Chungdae Industries CEO No Chungdae

589
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,906
I'm really sorry

590
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:14,904
Whoa.

591
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,409
Sir, are you in there?

592
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,915
Anyone home?

593
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,335
I'm pretty sure this is the place.

594
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,803
Uh…

595
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,847
S-Sir? Sir!

596
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,557
Sir!

597
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,769
Sir! Sir!

598
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,772
Sir, are you in there?

599
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,607
Open the door, please!

600
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,942
What are you doing?

601
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,320
Hey, call 911, hurry!

602
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,864
I think Mr. No might be dead.

603
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,209
Han Do, Producer at Trigger

604
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,257
I'm really sorry

605
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,758
I'm not doing an interview.

606
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,803
I mean, I can't, so just go.

607
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,806
Do you have children?

608
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,225
I do.

609
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,936
Two, but I can't really support them.

610
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,523
I need a pair of scissors.

611
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,693
-Scissors?
-Never mind.

612
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,780
What are you doing?

613
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,450
Huh? What… What are you gonna…

614
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,544
Why were you gonna kill yourself
and leave two children…

615
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,089
…when the real villain

616
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,218
is out there living it up
like none of it happened at all.

617
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:01,719
Why is it got to be you?

618
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,888
By taking your own life,

619
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:07,350
you just make it easier for the bad guys
to weasel their way out of this.

620
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,019
Cut it out, jeez.

621
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,106
A man lost his life.

622
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,737
The bus driver who was killed.

623
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,991
You guys wouldn't get it.

624
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,911
You went to good schools,
you work for a nice company…

625
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,079
but those of us,

626
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,081
down here on the bottom,

627
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,958
we go our whole lives

628
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,253
laboring for a living,
no room for much else,

629
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,089
we got to read a piece of paper,

630
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,257
our heads spin.

631
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,844
We get so scared, we submit.

632
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,473
How do you expect someone like me…
with a head like this…

633
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,687
…to go and take… take on GR?

634
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,480
You know this is wrong.

635
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,026
Agreeing to take the fall for those guys,

636
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,904
leaving behind your kids,
you know how wrong that is.

637
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,285
Running away doesn't fix it,
I've tried that.

638
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,538
They'll just continue to victimize people.

639
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,999
And the people that you leave behind,
guess what?

640
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,960
They won't know the full truth. Ever.

641
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,300
Those of us on the bottom
know what misery feels like.

642
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:26,762
Sir, I'm not suggesting we do anything…

643
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,180
too crazy.

644
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,809
I just want to show everybody
what kind of monsters they are.

645
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,314
Sacrificing people for money,
then saying it was your fault.

646
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,107
Just help me expose them.

647
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,778
That's how you can stand tall
for your children and yourself.

648
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,949
Use my head, sir. It's right here.

649
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:50,578
We've got a whole team of heads
capable of thinking for you.

650
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,705
We'll stand by your side. So, please…

651
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,625
give me the benefit of the doubt…

652
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,754
and keep going.

653
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,921
What do you have to lose?

654
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,427
We're not going to your funeral.

655
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,017
Please give us a call, sir, all right?

656
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,612
What was that?
"We're not going to your funeral"?

657
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,738
Are you kidding me?

658
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:28,074
Come on. What if he thinks about
killing himself again?

659
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,034
Oh! What… What?

660
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,244
You stealing from me?

661
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,246
What is it this time?

662
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,583
How'd you know I'd be here?

663
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,502
Well, uh… you know…

664
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,129
you stole my thing last time,
the cat thing.

665
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,010
I guess that makes us even now.

666
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,388
I'm sor-- No, I'm not sorry.

667
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,931
Oh, my God.

668
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,649
- Lovers' quarrel?
- God.

669
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:02,942
Man, Ms. Oh…

670
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,903
Seriously, this guy is way too blunt.

671
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,446
It's like he's never heard of tact.

672
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,073
You know what he said to a suicidal guy?

673
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,910
Why don't you tell her how you steal
instead of pointing fingers?

674
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:15,246
So you're a thief and someone's suicidal?

675
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,917
Yeah, so I went through Han Do's findings.

676
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,545
Got me curious,
so I went to see No Chungdae.

677
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,796
So what? Huh?

678
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,256
Nobody said I was stealing your story.

679
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,133
Like you'd let me do that anyway.

680
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,844
Also, no one sides with me
when my stories get stolen.

681
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,388
The truth is I just…

682
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,349
I just…

683
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,143
I envy you.

684
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,605
Kang Giho.

685
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,442
-What is it?
-Come with me, right now.

686
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,115
Why do you always let Han Do do
whatever he wants?

687
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,783
You didn't even pick me.

688
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,497
Wanna know why I picked him over you?

689
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,791
You really want to know?

690
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,793
Are you sure?

691
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,718
It's 'cause you're a contract worker
and he's full-time.

692
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,305
Ms. Oh…

693
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,516
I get it coming from anyone else,
but not from you, Ms. Oh.

694
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,310
Just say he's better-looking or something.

695
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,395
That'd at least make me feel less shitty.

696
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,523
You're mistaking me for a good person,

697
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,983
but I'm not.

698
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,111
I'm as cold and calculating as they get.

699
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,740
Who knows what'll happen to Trigger
under President Koo.

700
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:36,327
So I figured that if they get rid of me,
he'd do better.

701
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,829
He's better for the Cha Seongwook case
if I go.

702
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,250
Even if things get really bad,
he's salaried.

703
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,753
Which means they won't let him go,
at the very least.

704
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,839
That doesn't apply to you.

705
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,968
The first ones cut are the freelancers,
so I couldn't pick you

706
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,763
since I know
that Trigger means the world to you.

707
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,062
If I could do it again,

708
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,689
I still wouldn't pick you.

709
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,152
Bravo.

710
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,781
Han Do.

711
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,076
Uh…

712
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,994
Uh…

713
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,372
It's finally making sense.

714
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,208
Well, that's good.

715
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,670
I was planning to tell you

716
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,421
everything I told him just now.

717
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,674
And now that you know…

718
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,594
I want you to take over,
if things go south.

719
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,056
Can you please do that?

720
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,278
You know, I…

721
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,197
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait!
Just hold on. Just wait.

722
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,490
This one's on me, okay?

723
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,576
This is all my fault. I stole from you,

724
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,370
and I went to Ms. Oh to whine
about everything, that was childish.

725
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,163
Okay? I'm the bad guy here.

726
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,416
All right? Let's not stand around
like this.

727
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,960
Why don't we go someplace else?

728
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:09,670
When emotions are running high like this,

729
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,048
it… it's good to…
to have a little change of scenery.

730
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,175
All right.

731
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,011
There's always only one truth!

732
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,721
Trigger! Yeah.

733
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,849
Gosh.

734
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,727
Can you guys not, uh…

735
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,479
not drink by yourselves
and pour each other some drinks?

736
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,649
Can you guys do that for me?
That would be good, right? Huh?

737
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,694
Forgive me for overstepping.
If that's what it'll take, hit me, okay?

738
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,451
Kissy Princess

739
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:45,998
I just need to run to the bathroom
real quick.

740
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,709
So, keep telling each other
nice things and so on.

741
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,836
Toilet time…

742
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,212
Hello?

743
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,391
Do you ever get ahold of… Yeom Mijin?

744
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,894
No.

745
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,022
I couldn't get her on the phone,
so I'll look for her in person.

746
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,900
What exactly is it that you…

747
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,152
want to ask her so bad?

748
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,365
Why she never said anything,
despite the fact she was framed?

749
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,911
I couldn't put up with it
if it happened to me.

750
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,627
What makes you so sure she was framed,

751
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,462
Mr. Producer?

752
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:38,175
It's true, she was the one
who decided to change the route.

753
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,594
It's true that…

754
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,681
she deserves some of the blame
for what happened.

755
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,850
That's exactly
why I'm going to find her and ask her.

756
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,853
To ask why she made that decision.

757
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,694
Want me to ask her?

758
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,088
Here you go.

759
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,715
Call from My Daughter

760
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,510
Say hello to Ms. Yeom.

761
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,235
Why didn't you tell me
she was your mother?

762
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,488
You don't report
everything you know right away.

763
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,243
You can't be sure the producer
you're working with is trustworthy.

764
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,621
Or how good they are at what they do.

765
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,207
Both of those reasons.

766
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,459
This is your mother though.

767
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,253
It's not some random stranger
we're discussing here.

768
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,421
All right then.

769
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:01,800
The real reason
why she changed course that day…

770
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,970
You're talking to…

771
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:10,476
maybe the only person
who knows the reason, Mr. Producer.

772
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,936
You need better questions.

773
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,196
Why'd she do it then?
Can you tell me the reason?

774
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,199
Hi!

775
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,283
Hi, everyone.

776
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,868
Put on your seatbelts, everyone.

777
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,955
- There's Dasom, hi!
- Hurry up and sit down.

778
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,916
Thank you, boys and girls.

779
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,542
Everyone buckle your seatbelts?

780
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,128
- Yes!
- All right, good job.

781
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,963
Okay, we're all ready to go.

782
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,466
You okay?

783
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,927
I'm pretty sure I told you
that when Soryong was born,

784
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,303
she came two weeks early.

785
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,056
The director won't let me
go get checked, so…

786
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,267
I'm ready. Let's go.

787
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,072
My goodness.

788
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,792
Hold on tight, children!

789
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,128
Oh…

790
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,630
Hang in there, Ms. Park!

791
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,174
We'll be at the hospital soon.

792
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,260
Is she okay?

793
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,439
From out of nowhere, tragedy struck.

794
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,861
If she was innocent,
then why am I…

795
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,033
Why would she end up dying?

796
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,452
Without even explaining her actions?

797
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,288
Well, that's the power of shame.

798
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,332
It claims good people.

799
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,542
Shit…

800
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,003
Consumed with guilt…

801
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,048
It makes them do it.

802
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,148
I've never been a good liar.

803
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,070
And my mother
wouldn't stop asking about it.

804
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,616
So I told her.

805
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,700
Mom?

806
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,248
That all those
beautiful children on the bus

807
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,333
ended up dead.

808
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,459
Are you here?

809
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,879
Even Ms. Park,
who was on the bus with them.

810
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,381
Mom!

811
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,718
Mom, open the door!

812
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,178
Mom!

813
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,223
I told my mother every…

814
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,809
detail.

815
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:03,190
Is that why you went into this work,
to fight the injustices?

816
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,858
Because of the guilt she felt?

817
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,610
No.

818
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,278
Quite the opposite.

819
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,574
I…

820
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,204
I loved my mother so very much…

821
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,288
but I'm not like her.

822
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,124
I chose this path…

823
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,335
so she could see me
living life to the fullest.

824
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,338
She could see my life is good,

825
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,632
and I have good people in it.

826
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:33,053
I'm thriving instead of taking my own life
the way she did.

827
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,648
My poor mother…

828
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,782
She never knew
that the baby lived thanks to her.

829
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,975
- Hello.
- Sir, it's Songi.

830
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,977
We've received a report related to GR.

831
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,979
The whistleblower said they'll be waiting

832
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,397
in front of their building.

833
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,442
You wanna blow the whistle?

834
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,830
All the video evidence is on there.

835
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,791
Just make sure that Heo Geumran…

836
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,960
spends the next year eating prison food.

837
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,504
You could've gone to the police.
Why'd you call us?

838
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,049
I'm sure those pricks
are on her payroll as well.

839
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,801
They're untrustworthy.

840
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,106
If I'm reincarnated,
I should be a minister's wife, like her.

841
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,525
You're capable of standing
on your own though, Ms. Chairwoman.

842
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,695
Hey! I'm putting myself
through a lot of trouble for all of this.

843
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,406
My money was wasted
on those subcontractors,

844
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,741
they were supposed to protect me.

845
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:20,285
I completely wasted my time
with those little shits.

846
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,787
Holy shit.

847
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:25,165
Wow, and thus begins
the Haksung-dong corruption saga.

848
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,751
You really are lucky, you know that?

849
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,044
Huh?

850
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,504
But the only thing missing here

851
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:33,173
is the lead actress's face
to spice things up.

852
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,841
I already failed once.

853
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,262
The driver told me
that she doubled her security.

854
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:42,099
We just so happen to have an expert
for that kind of thing.

855
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,935
Looks like she's dealing with…

856
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,562
a lot of problems, at home and at work.

857
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,814
What is it?

858
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,486
Come on, you should help him out.

859
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,491
Baek Songi
Child of Park Sunjeong

860
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,951
Look. There she is.

861
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,994
The baby that your mother saved.

862
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,841
You're kind… Songi.

863
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,093
No, not really.

864
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:22,264
We're on the same team,
we should be helping each other, you know?

865
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,645
You're a kind, beautiful soul.

866
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,066
So, you…

867
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,944
will get an assist.

868
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:40,490
Supreme Court

869
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,539
Uh, all quiet so far.

870
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,957
Pi… Pigeon out.

871
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,250
Right.

872
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,128
Do you think we can really pull this off?

873
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,630
'Cause people don't change much.

874
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:58,717
Money isn't the only thing…
that motivates us.

875
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,427
Watch and learn.

876
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,647
Take some notes, Han Do.

877
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,942
Heo is here.

878
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:17,903
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

879
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,121
Chairwoman Heo Geumran,
Oh Soryong, producer with Trigger.

880
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,456
Do you have a few minutes?

881
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:31,917
Get her away.

882
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,752
- Stop them!
- No… No, not now.

883
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,588
No, wait…

884
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,510
-Hey, hey…
-Come on.

885
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,221
Hey… Stop…

886
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,305
- Stop!
- Let go of me!

887
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,393
Chairwoman Heo Geumran.

888
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,979
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

889
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:56,316
You know, you're sexually harassing
a public broadcasting producer!

890
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,613
- You got that on tape, right, Han?
- I did.

891
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,199
I'll take this up with GR formally.

892
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,952
Well, these workers are subcontractors,
not employees.

893
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,328
Ah…

894
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,080
You subcontract these guys too.

895
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:12,415
Pretty convenient
for covering your tracks.

896
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,543
Stop standing there like idiots
and get these three away from me.

897
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,837
Do it now! You moronic little shits.

898
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,506
Contractors have the bargaining power,

899
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,342
don't you think you're abusing
your subcontractors though?

900
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,302
You just treat people
like they're disposable?

901
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,973
The strong take advantage of the weak,
that's the way of the world.

902
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,517
You must think
we're all equal under the law.

903
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,062
But the slaves became workers,
the masters became bosses.

904
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,564
It's merely a difference in vocabulary.

905
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:40,443
You may try to change things,
but the world never changes.

906
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,154
The law won't budge for you.

907
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:46,741
We'll get them changed.

908
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,704
Oh…

909
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,543
As investigative reporters,

910
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,587
it's our job to change people's hearts.

911
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,176
Ma'am, how are you? What brings you here?

912
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,683
You're the one who sent me
a lunch invitation through your secretary.

913
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,810
- What's this about?
- I didn't do that.

914
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,020
I did.

915
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,688
Oh Soryong with Trigger.

916
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,107
I just… wanted to give this to you.

917
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,985
The bitch had so much surgery,

918
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:24,070
her face is an absolute train wreck,

919
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,364
yet because of her husband,
she gets the royal treatment.

920
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,326
How could the world be so unfair?

921
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:33,330
Don't you agree? If I'm reincarnated,
I should be a minister's wife, like her.

922
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,792
What is this?

923
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,210
That'd be your inner voice.

924
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,589
The true feelings that you kept hidden

925
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,924
- under a fake public apology.
- My money was wasted

926
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,594
on those subcontractors,
they were supposed to protect me.

927
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,180
I completely wasted my time
with those little shits.

928
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:53,808
They're all the same,
the dead prick, the subcontractor prick.

929
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:57,604
Those useless assholes. Goddammit!

930
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,442
What is it
that really changes people's hearts?

931
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,778
It is always the truth.

932
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:08,323
Do you admit that you were aware

933
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:11,534
Chungdae was illegally subcontracted
by Grand Construction?

934
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,370
Do you admit that?

935
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,124
Do us a favor…

936
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,960
and take this to the minister, ma'am.

937
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,546
I will.

938
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:28,093
I'll see to it the minister hears
every last detail of this matter.

939
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,928
Keep up the good work.

940
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,096
We will.

941
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,017
So, I've got a train wreck for a face…

942
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,645
but a powerful husband.

943
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,983
Ma'am… Ma'am, please. Ma'am, please!

944
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,110
Listen to me, please!

945
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,739
Damn you, bitch!

946
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,241
Whoa, Ms. Oh!

947
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,201
Get the hell away from me!

948
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:54,285
Oh!

949
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,417
Whoa…

950
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,257
Hey! Hey! Move out of the way!

951
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,050
What the… Stop filming!

952
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,718
Stop filming!

953
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,097
There are some who would argue

954
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,393
the collapse of the building
in Haksung-dong was a long time coming.

955
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,605
These words are for you, Ms. Heo Geumran,
for you and your corruption,

956
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,233
covering up countless deaths
on your work sites,

957
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,027
while you played
the part of a caring philanthropist.

958
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,782
You may try and mask…
your deepest desires.

959
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:36,494
However, the truth
will eventually be revealed.

960
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,833
Oh Soryong with Trigger,
a voice for all the voiceless,

961
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,294
we are… their last resort.

962
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,305
Trigger, right?

963
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,640
I'd, uh…

964
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,477
I'd like to report something.

965
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,985
I heard this was here,
so I came by, though, uh…

966
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:12,155
It's pretty unremarkable, right?

967
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,824
So, how would you say you're doing?

968
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,826
I know you love the work you do.

969
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,916
If No Chungdae
could've reached out to us sooner,

970
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,751
it would've saved us some trouble.

971
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,920
We should be glad he called at all.

972
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,463
We still got more to do with GR.

973
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,757
They'll get investigated, right?
For show, at least?

974
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,721
That chauffeur prick…

975
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,891
took a bribe for 100 million
without his boss knowing.

976
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,184
Chairwoman Heo found out,

977
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,686
beat the crap out of him,
and he came to us for payback.

978
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,104
He blindsided us.

979
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,899
Did you first check to see
if the footage he gave us was doctored?

980
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,443
Did you, or did you not?

981
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,945
Damn it. No.

982
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,489
Hello, you've reached Trigger's office.

983
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:55,657
Excuse me?

984
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,494
Um, sir, excuse me.

985
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:04,415
Uh, the bus driver's widow…
is apparently waiting here in the lobby.

986
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,793
- How am I supposed to raise my kids now?
- Please, ma'am…

987
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,546
-Please calm down, ma'am.
-Where is your integrity?

988
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,674
My husband is gone,
how can I raise the kids alone?

989
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,509
Mr. Han…

990
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:18,137
You bastards aired it!
Without a second thought!

991
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,934
How the hell am I supposed
to raise the kids?

992
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,852
Tell me! How?

993
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,646
You reporters won't help.

994
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,607
-Who's gonna help me now?
-Please calm down, ma'am.

995
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,114
You're just a producer.

996
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:41,369
Do you regret
getting into this kind of work?

997
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,413
No.

998
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,917
Faith…

999
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,296
in myself.

1000
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,592
And faith in my team.

1001
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,430
That keeps me going.

1002
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:02,974
Yeah.

1003
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:24,996
Cha Seongwook Lives
