1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,971
You think this is
"a nice place for a glass of wine"?

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,517
Actually, places like this
are considered really hip nowadays.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,978
Wow, pretty hip ambiance out here, huh?

4
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,896
Of all our stores,
this one has the best vibe.

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,401
Hey,
move your phone, bro, come on.

6
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,154
Cheers.

7
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:33,283
And just for you, Mr. Han, I'm gonna
throw in a little mood lighting. Ta-da!

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,286
Here you go…

9
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,412
One last thing.

10
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,830
A pair of hearts, in your honor.

11
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,791
Enjoy your evening.
You've got this. Fighting!

12
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,153
So why me?

13
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,865
Why do you have to keep bugging me
instead of Oh Soryong?

14
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,167
PRODUCER OH SORYONG

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,460
"KIDNAPPED. CONVENIENCE STORE
NEAR HAN RIVER IF YOU WANNA SAVE HIM."

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,047
You must not know her very well.

17
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,801
She's not coming,
she doesn't play games like this.

18
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,386
Seems like you're the one
who doesn't know her well.

19
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,055
You've only met her once.

20
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,265
You think you know her better than I do?

21
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,059
If she leaves right now,

22
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,560
she'll be here in half an hour.

23
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,650
That was a fake tip you gave, right?

24
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,779
I'm not here to be interrogated.

25
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,906
I came to give a tip.

26
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,826
That night,
someone came to see him before I did.

27
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,453
A woman with burgundy nails

28
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,289
who reeked of this perfume called Reine.

29
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,085
You only got a brief look at her.
And it was late at night.

30
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,254
So how could you possibly tell

31
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,132
whether her nails were burgundy or black?

32
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,759
Do you have night vision?

33
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,099
You said the mystery woman
wore a perfume that was quite strong…

34
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,687
but was that just you?

35
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,382
That's pretty good.

36
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,217
What's your goal?

37
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,847
You disappeared for 20 years,
so why show up now?

38
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,941
For the past two decades…

39
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:18,573
my father's been giving me an allowance,
but recently, he stopped all of a sudden.

40
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,410
No more powerful motivator
than money, is there?

41
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,289
This is Hanju.

42
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,418
The people over there detest the media.

43
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,797
I'd like to…

44
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,092
let them know I'm here.

45
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,970
That's where Trigger comes in.

46
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,739
I once spiked
a glass of 50-million-won wine.

47
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,246
Destroying someone's easier
than I'd thought.

48
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,669
What are you saying?

49
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,717
I'm saying I killed him.

50
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,563
What did you...

51
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,149
Uh, I'll go get tissues.

52
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,262
Lunatic Han!

53
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,265
What happened? Huh?

54
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,309
Oh, what are you doing here?

55
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,893
I received a ransom note!

56
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,522
So you seriously thought
Cho Haewon managed to abduct me,

57
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,982
a full-grown man?

58
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,109
I was worried you might start
talking nonsense like that.

59
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,694
Where is she?

60
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,163
She's gone?

61
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,790
Why here?

62
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,084
How'd you end up here?

63
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,422
She just told me
she once killed a man by spiking his wine.

64
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,675
She what?

65
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:55,521
EP08: THE VANISHED WITNESS

66
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,739
You flatter me, Chief Prosecutor.

67
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,574
Me? The mayor of Seoul?

68
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,160
We both know the nominations
are just a popularity contest.

69
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,245
I wouldn't dream of it.

70
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,998
Choi Hoseong's dead now anyway.

71
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,586
Oh, about the Mr. Lee matter…
I'll smooth things over with Ms. Oh.

72
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,007
Oh Soryong just killed a father and son.

73
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,135
I wonder how she'll deal
with all that bad karma.

74
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,887
Well, the public seems to think

75
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,473
they got off easy
without having to pay for what they did.

76
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,143
I gotta hand it to you.
You've got an eye for talent.

77
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,478
Sir?

78
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,355
Han Do,

79
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,565
turns out he's a real go-getter.

80
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,733
"VVIP KOO HYEONGTAE, KNS"

81
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,486
I don't think
I'm being compensated enough…

82
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,321
for helping with the Cha Seongwook case.

83
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,407
So the money isn't enough for you.

84
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,077
As soon as the story's done…

85
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,954
I'd like to transfer to Animal Kingdom.

86
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,541
Ms. Oh would be disappointed to hear that.

87
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,501
I mean, my coworkers aside…

88
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,381
I don't feel good about working on a show
based around people's pain and misery.

89
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,175
I don't have any sense of duty,
like certain people.

90
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,470
I hear you. The show can be soul-crushing.

91
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,182
I mistook you for a cynic,
but you're more of an idealist.

92
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,689
"CHO HAEWON: THIS IS MY NUMBER.
SAVE IT, AND I'LL BE IN TOUCH."

93
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,859
"LOVED THE SHOW TONIGHT. HOW'S WORK?
BUSY AGAIN? JUST CHECKING IN."

94
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,485
"I'M FREE RIGHT NOW.
WANNA GO OUT FOR DINNER?"

95
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,324
Okay then…

96
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,995
Is there any information
you'd like me to give…

97
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,081
in exchange for Animal Kingdom?

98
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,667
What were you discussing with Han Do, sir?

99
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,172
Go find Oh Soryong,

100
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,925
and tell her she needs to stop
snooping around the prosecutor

101
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,761
who granted a stay of execution
for Choi Hoseong.

102
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,224
Wow.

103
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,643
Wow, bro,
you really cover all your bases, huh?

104
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,481
Come on, I know you drew her out there
so you could get her on CCTV.

105
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,817
Like I always say,
you guys at Trigger are so hardcore. Yeah!

106
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,486
You know who she is?

107
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,114
No, who? Is she famous?

108
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,450
I'll tell you who.
She's the person who stole your lamp.

109
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,203
- Oh!
- Cha Seongwook, does that ring a bell?

110
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,662
Cha Seongwook…

111
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,708
- No, I don't know.
- He was a celebrity 20 years ago.

112
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,169
He was in a commercial
and broke into movies.

113
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,337
Still no?

114
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,632
Come on, bro, you expect me to know
some celebrity from 20 years ago?

115
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,425
I barely remember 20 minutes ago.

116
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,052
Right.

117
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,472
Well, I guess
we need to jog people's memories then.

118
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,640
"VIOLINIST CHOI GEON KILLS SON
AND COMMITS SUICIDE"

119
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,308
So this is how that whole thing ended.

120
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,392
My God.

121
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,228
Hey, did you hear?

122
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,980
That prosecutor has a habit
of letting people off easy, hmm?

123
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,608
He let off the Gogwang Group
and Chairman Park of DOQ Industries,

124
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,360
- just to name a few.
- I know.

125
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,569
Why even lock them up,

126
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,238
if the prosecutor's
just gonna let them back out?

127
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,989
Yeah, exactly.

128
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,491
Giho, what are you up to?

129
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,575
I'm just thinking.

130
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,244
Thinking, huh?

131
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,789
Oh, you poor, inexperienced little thing.

132
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,917
- Stop it. Cut it out.
- I know what this is about.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,586
It's 'cause Exclusives 24 aired
the story you'd been working on.

134
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,463
Villa King, right?
I heard they even caught the guy.

135
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,507
You know,
their guys really put in the work.

136
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,675
All right, come on, quit it.

137
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,134
- You're gonna make him cry.
- No, no.

138
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,929
This is the perfect time
to whip him into shape, for his own good.

139
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,223
Giho, wrap up whatever you were doing

140
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,935
and go ask Ms. Oh
to assign you the Choi Hoseong follow-up.

141
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,312
Listen, you gotta do what you gotta do
for a good story.

142
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,689
Why be so loyal to her?

143
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,773
Utilize that leverage to...

144
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,733
Oh, my God, dude.
Just let me handle it, okay?

145
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,569
Leave me alone. Stop it. Sheesh…

146
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,987
- Stop it.
- Okay, fine.

147
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,489
Can everybody stop bullying me?

Yup, first time in a while.

160
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,837
Goodness, no.
I'm headed to check on ratings.

161
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,679
Mr. Han?

162
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,350
Mr. Han?

163
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,940
Mr. Han?

164
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,112
You're here.

165
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,114
The… the lights…

166
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,867
Uh, can you wait three seconds
before turning them on?

167
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,329
Okay.

168
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,373
One.

169
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,208
Two.

170
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,210
Three.

171
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,718
Now, question for you,
what color are my nails?

172
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,261
Huh?

173
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,557
I… couldn't possibly tell the color
in the dark.

174
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,850
Right?

175
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,062
Just like I told her.

176
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,899
Come on.

177
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,402
Go to Songi or someone else
with that kind of question.

178
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,778
I'm busy, you know?

179
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,655
But I heard Songi's on leave this week.

180
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,907
Thank you.

181
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,956
God, why's that weirdo…
wearing nail polish anyway?

182
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,546
Was he… flirting with me?

183
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,468
Songi shouldn't be taking
so much time off.

184
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,138
We don't have any newbies
to cover for her. Sheesh.

185
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,651
Don't you want to know why Ms. Oh
showed up at the convenience store?

186
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:21,407
Not the obvious reason.
What she's really thinking.

187
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,952
Help us find Cha Seongwook!

188
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,704
Him at 22 / Him now

189
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,751
You really think just adding wrinkles
will make people recognize him?

190
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,252
I don't.

191
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,297
How else can we improve this photo though?
I'm stumped.

192
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,299
"Episode 1,802: DeepFakes' Crosshairs."

193
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,176
It was your story. You should remember it.

194
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,136
Look at you, memorizing stuff.

195
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,679
You're proposing we alter it?

196
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,973
In a recent episode, Mr. Choi used AI

197
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,935
to come up with a facial composite…
of a missing child.

198
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,229
Keeping tabs on other people's episodes,
way to show initiation.

199
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,606
Kang Giho, we can hear you.

200
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,649
I'm sorry they screwed you,
but don't take it out on us.

201
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,985
Ms. Oh, did you see
the recent Exclusives 24 episode?

202
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,320
It's my job to do so, yes.

203
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,658
So, um… uh…

204
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,245
Ms. Oh, since we're on the subject, uh…

205
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,665
do… do you mind putting me
on the Choi Hoseong follow-up?

206
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,293
You know, since I'll have to

207
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,795
give up on my current story and all.

208
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,298
Are you gonna abandon your story
over a scoop then?

209
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,966
You wouldn't be so cavalier

210
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,718
if you'd really poured
your blood and sweat into it.

211
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,887
Come on, you even said you watched it.

212
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,473
I'm not quite sure… what more I can do.

213
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,392
Why should I let you?

214
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,645
What would be the focus of this follow-up?

215
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,647
Uh…

216
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,941
Is there something you've uncovered
or a refreshing take

217
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,818
that makes us see it in a new light?

218
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,528
You need to give me
at least one good reason

219
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,321
that we should air this follow-up.

220
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,619
I won't trust someone
who has no plan at all, so no.

221
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,372
As for you, Lunatic Han,

222
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,748
I'd like you to arrange
a new facial composite

223
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,291
since you proposed it.

224
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,139
Haven't seen that nail polish in a while…
but it's back in full force.

225
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,308
Oh…

226
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,186
I only wore it
to test out Cho Haewon's claims.

227
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,855
Couldn't see them?

228
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,731
Impossible.

229
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,236
Do you know
why I let Dr. Trigger stay on?

230
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,363
- No, why?
- It's 'cause…

231
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,865
I think you're a born investigator.

232
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,368
- No, I'm not.
- You charge headfirst into danger.

233
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,829
You always chase after the stories,
even when you pee your pants.

234
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,539
And you're willing to butt heads
with the higher-ups.

235
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,999
Those are the qualities you need.

236
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,334
I don't think you know me.

237
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,133
Cho Haewon's strange.

238
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,553
Whenever I'm with her, it feels like…

239
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:49,930
it's like she's baiting me.

240
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,141
Maybe with her looks?

241
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,020
Why does she keep claiming
to know you so well?

242
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,480
She said she knew the real reason

243
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,524
you came to that store.
That's weird, right?

244
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,818
Well, 'cause I'm covering
the Cha Seongwook…

245
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,863
Lunatic Han…

246
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:06,989
you have her number?

247
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,533
I thought you had it too.

248
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,327
I have been messaging her on Elegram.

249
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,246
Why didn't you… tell me this sooner?
Give it here.

250
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,463
I'm so sorry about this, sir.

251
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,965
We sincerely apologize, sir.

252
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,052
To be honest…

253
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,387
that day,

254
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,640
when I saw the writing on my wall,

255
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,851
I got really excited, I almost thought…

256
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,103
Seongwook really was alive.

257
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,317
Ever since my boy disappeared,
my heart has hardened.

258
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,903
It's like I'm practically dead.

259
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,780
Mm. It's like…

260
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:52,368
Mm… Even though I knew they were…
just mindless scribbles,

261
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,828
they did get me hoping again.

262
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,333
I thought that somehow, he was alive.

263
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,840
I'm so, so sorry about everything, sir.

264
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,609
Oh, that's right.

265
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,656
You said you were a fan
of Seongwook's, didn't you?

266
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,157
Hang on. Wait right here.

267
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,784
I just remembered…

268
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:37,705
My son signed a bunch of autographs
for me to give to his fans.

269
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,039
Give me a second.

270
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,212
Now, let's see here… I…

271
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,465
Um, Ms. Oh?

272
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,677
He was diagnosed with dementia
four months ago.

273
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,973
He said he wanted
to let all his hopes ride on us,

274
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,934
before all his memories
slip away for good.

275
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,565
I'm so sorry.

276
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,026
I really had no idea.

277
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,913
Yes, Nahee.

278
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,808
That was taken
around the time Cho Haewon showed up.

279
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,810
There was a random woman
in Park Daeyong's office.

280
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,771
I figured
he was having an affair or something.

281
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,938
But today, I found out

282
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,984
that the woman was Trigger's main writer…
20 years ago.

283
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,652
Where's this going?

284
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,405
I asked around
and managed to get her on the phone.

285
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,743
Park Daeyong… do you trust him?

286
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,745
I trust him with my life.

287
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,622
We may not be related,
but we're like a family.

288
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,583
Ugh, how did a softie like you
make it this far?

289
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,959
So you had a call with her?

290
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,630
Apparently, Daeyong asked her
for Ma Seongchun's contact info.

291
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,883
That's the guy who was
Trigger's chief producer 20 years ago.

292
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,927
I heard they met up already.
You know that?

293
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,012
No. He never mentioned it.

294
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,556
If there's one thing I've learned,

295
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,019
it's that personal allegiances
rarely align with profits.

296
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,687
I'm not trying to badmouth Park Daeyong.

297
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,399
I'm just saying
that even the good ones can be gotten to.

298
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,862
If you're really set on putting out
the Seongwook episode,

299
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,032
don't trust anyone except yourself.

300
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,078
- Not even you, Nahee?
- Definitely not.

301
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,663
I wouldn't hesitate to backstab you.

302
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,874
I doubt you would've warned me
if that were really the case.

303
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,835
When we talked,

304
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
the writer said
Park Daeyong and Koo Hyeongtae

305
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,589
used to be inseparable.

306
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,845
She told me that
Park Daeyong joined Trigger 20 years ago

307
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,389
to cover
for Koo Hyeongtae's sudden departure.

308
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,307
Funny, huh?

309
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,853
I worked alongside him for years
and had no idea.

310
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,563
You're telling me…

311
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,732
- Koo worked on Trigger?
- Uh-huh.

312
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,653
He was on Trigger before abruptly
transferring to the News Department.

313
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,574
Anyway… that's what she told me.

314
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,909
Earlier, I saw Koo and Park.

315
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,870
They'd been getting lunch together.

316
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,913
That was everything that I saw.

317
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,498
Just something to consider.

318
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,375
Hold on a second.

319
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,210
What was the name
of the previous chief producer?

320
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,795
Can you give me his contact info?

321
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,099
You're making me uncomfortable.
Is this a staring contest?

322
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,268
Why won't you look me in the eye?

323
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,189
- You hiding something?
- I don't even look my wife in the eye.

324
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,982
Not that I can, since she's abroad.

325
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,775
Is there something you haven't told me…

326
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,194
about the Cha Seongwook case?

327
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,738
What? Come on, what is it?

328
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,241
I'm having the worst month ever, I swear.

329
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,993
What's wrong with all of you? God!

330
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,369
No way…

331
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,330
Did Seongchun get in touch or something?

332
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,915
And now I get the truth.

333
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,708
Wait, it can't be, the guy's not a blab.

334
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,335
There's no way
he would've mentioned this to you.

335
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,419
Come on.

336
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,213
- Come on, Park Daeyong!
- Ah! Scared me.

337
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,590
Okay, so maybe I did meet with Seongchun.

338
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,134
- Why's that so wrong?
- We both know there's more to that story.

339
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,595
Okay! Hyeongtae worked on
the Cha Seongwook case,

340
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,138
and he hid the tape before they could air.

341
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,806
So what? Not like it's my fault.

342
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,600
President Koo…

343
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,562
was on that case
while he was with Trigger?

344
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,023
Are you going to answer me?

345
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,526
Well, yeah, like I just told you.

346
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,908
So that's why Mr. Ma couldn't tell me
about this over the phone.

347
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,410
Because President Koo was involved.

348
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,329
Listen, Soryong…

349
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,582
Koo Hyeongtae…

350
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,501
is not the kind of person
we can take down.

351
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,631
Frankly, we're all just his employees,
and the guy's in charge of our survival.

352
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,009
When'd you get to be so pathetic, Daeyong?

353
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,844
Pathetic?

354
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,722
Hey.

355
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,267
Those who work nine-to-five
lead pathetic lives, okay?

356
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,686
If we wanna survive
and provide for our families,

357
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,771
then living a principled life
is not an option!

358
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,147
Stop it, stop it, listen to me!

359
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,608
You're the chief producer of Trigger.

360
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,237
You just admitted Koo ran off
with the tape right before it aired.

361
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,321
And you forgive him?

362
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,032
What if that tape contained
vital information?

363
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,326
What if it could've changed
the outcome of the case?

364
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,744
What if it had solved it?

365
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,956
That scumbag's drunk on power,
trying to get into politics.

366
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,791
Is staying silent like this…

367
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,377
really what you think you should do?

368
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,920
We both know there's no justice.

369
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,673
Of course not.
That's why we're working on Trigger.

370
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,466
We don't stand a chance on our own,

371
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,593
so let's use Trigger
as our means to fight!

372
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,685
My father…

373
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,313
has lung cancer.

374
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,859
You wanna know what I thought

375
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,320
when they told me
he had less than three months left?

376
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,617
"I can barely afford
my kids' tuition and living expenses."

377
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,747
"Maybe I should get an advance
on my severance."

378
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,585
You wanna live with integrity?

379
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,007
I was a morally upstanding citizen
for 50 years,

380
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,676
and this is all that it got me.

381
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,514
My life being what it is…

382
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,601
I'm fine staying silent.

383
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,396
It's not like it'll change anything.

384
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,237
Your father…

385
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,283
can he do chemo?

386
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,120
It's already spread everywhere.

387
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,331
There's no treatment option.

388
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,793
God…

389
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,715
Man, this world is so terrible.

390
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,010
How can…

391
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,388
How are you feeling now?

392
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,559
Mr. Ma told me

393
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,604
he has some important information
to give us.

394
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,940
We have a meeting tomorrow.

395
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,193
I plan on hearing him out
whether or not you can make it.

396
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,487
And then I'll decide…

397
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,698
whether to take it up with the president.

398
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,535
As for you,

399
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,537
just follow your heart.

400
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,517
Hey.

401
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,771
A piece of your heart

402
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,149
to share with your loved ones.

403
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,820
Whitemint.

404
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,865
It's true what they say
about beautiful people dying young.

405
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,408
What a shame.

406
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,785
You think we can make
an AI composite of Seongwook

407
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,745
like we did for your episode last week?

408
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,166
Uh…

409
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,418
You don't want
just a basic composite, right?

410
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,170
- Well, no…
- You're trying to evoke Seongwook

411
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,504
as he'd really look today…

412
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,673
Okay, here's an idea.

413
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:30,343
There's another company
that's come up with this hot new tech,

414
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,846
they're calling it
the "New AI Style Transfer".

415
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:35,015
I'd say they'd be
a perfect fit for you, but…

416
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,433
Hmm…

417
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,767
But what? Why not?

418
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,519
There are a few things.

419
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,854
First of all, it's expensive.

420
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,523
Second of all, it's super expensive.

421
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,774
And third of all,

422
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,110
it's so expensive
that our entire budget wouldn't be enough.

423
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,737
Do you think they might go for

424
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,406
public interest plus exposure
for their product?

425
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,493
I'm pretty sure management
won't approve of the ridiculous pricing,

426
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,536
but I can put you in contact anyway.

427
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:09,758
TO DAEYONG: TOMORROW AT 9:00 A.M.
PASSAGE INTO MOUNT GWANUN.

428
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,367
PRODUCER OH SORYONG

429
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,538
Hello?

430
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,623
Oh.

431
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,416
- Oh, over here.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

432
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,043
- Hey.
- My name's Oh Soryong.

433
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,796
Whoa, Seongchun.

434
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,507
What's with the getup?
You're completely covered.

435
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,925
You've hyped this up so much,

436
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:54,094
if it's a flop,
you owe us dinner, I swear.

437
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:56,096
- I'm winded.
- Look at you.

438
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,516
I know I said to come to me
once you were ready to reveal my secrets,

439
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,893
but I can't believe
it took you a month. A month!

440
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,853
- Come on.
- That long?

441
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:06,898
Hey, I've been very busy… and so have you.

442
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:12,195
After meeting with this guy,
I went over some of your episodes.

443
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,615
I really gotta say…
you've done a great job, huh?

444
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,701
- I love your work.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

445
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,540
- One thing, sir…
- Uh-huh?

446
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,376
I feel like an incident
like someone running off with a tape

447
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,336
should've gone down
in KNS Current Affairs history.

448
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,171
How has no one heard about this?

449
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,173
Those were hectic times,

450
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,010
they were suing anyone
who even mentioned Cha Seongwook.

451
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,095
There were only three of us
secretly on the case,

452
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,930
including me and Hyeongtae.

453
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,683
I was so worried about a leak
and losing the episode,

454
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,351
that another producer and I

455
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,063
prepared a decoy episode
to use as backup. God…

456
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,567
So what's this vital piece of info
you wanted to give us?

457
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,322
But Koo Hyeongtae said…

458
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,574
- President Koo…
- Koo Hyeongtae…

459
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,284
Uh…

460
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,494
he told me that there was a witness.

461
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,164
Someone who witnessed
Cha Seongwook's murder.

462
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,463
Hold up. Uh…
So the man's dead? Not just missing?

463
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,384
Really?

464
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,553
President Koo identified a witness?

465
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,306
Well, actually,

466
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,059
the catch was
that it wasn't exactly your, um…

467
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,353
most typical witness, you might say.

468
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,899
This is Bom,
the dog that belonged to Cha Seongwook.

469
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,275
Bom, Korean for "spring".

470
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,904
Once Cha Seongwook went missing,
his agent jimmied the locks to get inside.

471
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,239
When he walked in, the dog was out there.

472
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,616
Ugh, okay, so?

473
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,618
There's that woman over at Animal Kingdom!

474
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,871
The animal communicator
who is able to talk with dogs.

475
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,916
I'm telling you, when they talk,
a miracle's gonna happen.

476
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,167
Christ…

477
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,503
This isn't some sketch show.

478
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,672
Anyway, if that were real, don't you think

479
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,465
- the cops would take the dog?
- Come on!

480
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,677
Isn't it our job
as the producers of this show

481
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,055
to try something new,
if it means we can get at the truth?

482
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,766
I'm not saying we make stuff up.

483
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,519
I'm just trying to say

484
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,854
that this psychic
really can speak with dogs.

485
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:14,359
Dogs that used to bite people
can become calm when she does this.

486
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,819
And they stop biting for good.

487
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,987
Oh, yeah?

488
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,406
This dog's apparently dying,

489
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,449
and it's being treated at a clinic nearby.

490
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,660
Why'd you want
this animal psychic's address?

491
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,412
You'll find out, my man.

492
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,830
Is this for a Trigger story?

493
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,915
Here, take my last cig. You enjoy.

494
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,333
- Oh…
- Thanks.

495
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,170
I certainly will!

496
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,300
Hey.

497
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,427
- What?
- What's wrong?

498
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,263
Oh, uh… uh, nothing.

499
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,809
I only heard him talk about it.
Never saw the tape with my own eyes.

500
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,395
I went to talk to him again

501
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,814
after he transferred
to the News Department.

502
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,191
I asked for the tapes
of the episode we did,

503
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,568
for the archives.

504
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,486
You know what he said?

505
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,197
That prick was shameless.

506
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,158
- How'd he respond?
- What was it?

507
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,996
"Seongchun…
you gotta forget Cha Seongwook."

508
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,920
Which episode was the one
he tried to hide? What number?

509
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,174
890.

510
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,184
EP890: CHILD MURDER IN UNGYEONG

511
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:32,729
RED HAIRBAND MYSTERY:
CHILD MURDER IN UNGYEONG

512
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,817
So…

513
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,445
you're really gonna do this?

514
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,281
You wanna take the president on
in this fight?

515
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,076
Basically, you'll be opening up
the gates of hell.

516
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,537
No turning back.

517
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,665
Those gates opened up 20 years ago

518
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,709
when a rookie producer
ran off with the tape.

519
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:59,172
For all we know, he's covered up
even worse cases than this.

520
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,310
I'm here for the president.

521
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,652
Trigger episode 890.

522
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,987
Do you remember that one?

523
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,699
Why did you do it?

524
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,037
A producer runs off with an episode
before it airs?

525
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,499
Oh, you mean Cha Seongwook?

526
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,627
I simply stopped pursuing that case.

527
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,463
I'd done some digging,
and nothing had turned up.

528
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,465
Digging?

529
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,885
You've dug pretty deep though.

530
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,597
Well, I'm here to…

531
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,475
offer you another chance, President.

532
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,936
A final chance

533
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,815
to tell us the truth about
the Cha Seongwook case from 20 years ago.

534
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,027
I'm not addressing the President Koo
sitting in front of me now.

535
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,947
I'm addressing the man
who had a passion for the truth…

536
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,950
Mr. Koo, my predecessor.

537
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,664
Would you like to offer a rebuttal now?

538
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,793
If you must know,

539
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,296
you try digging it back up.

540
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,341
Fine.

541
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,806
I'm formally requesting to interview you.

542
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,684
Episode 890 of Trigger,
the Cha Seongwook incident,

543
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,936
should've been aired
without any interference,

544
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,147
which is why we'll air it properly.

545
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,901
Unlike some, I won't be using any decoys,

546
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,195
and I most definitely…
will not be running away.

547
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,907
So if you…

548
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,912
have a miraculous change of heart, and…

549
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,414
reveal the truth…

550
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,542
the truth you're covering up…

551
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,797
I'll be standing by.

552
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,679
You know…

553
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,727
I too used to believe in good and evil.

554
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,315
But life has taught me
that they're mere illusions.

555
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,360
There are simply

556
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,154
the consequences of the choices we make.

557
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,158
I wonder what kind of choice you'll make

558
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,120
once you're pushed
to the limits of your resolve, Soryong.

559
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,624
I'll choose to air the episode as penance.

560
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,171
I want to issue an apology to the viewers
who have always believed in Trigger.

561
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,216
That's the choice I'll make…

562
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,259
President.

563
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,886
I'd think it over.

564
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,722
You might be digging your own grave.

565
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,141
Believe me,
I'm ready to accept consequences.

566
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,105
But are you, sir?

567
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,858
Prepare yourself…

568
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,820
to face the music.

569
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,951
"The Confession."

570
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,078
How's that for the title?

571
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,458
I like it.

572
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,946
What are you doing?

573
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,157
It's what you do
when someone's having a hard time.

574
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,283
Says who?

575
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,160
A communications expert.
Some guy on YouTube.

576
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,253
Why couldn't you reign in
your anger for once?

577
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,756
Why'd you have to do this now,
of all times? Ugh, whatever.

578
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,674
The facial composite is ruined,
thanks to you.

579
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,301
What do you mean "ruined"?

580
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,762
Even with a discount,
it would cost an entire episode's budget.

581
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,014
You think President Koo's
gonna leap to help us now?

582
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,643
You aren't experienced enough
to know this, but…

583
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,730
large companies do something
called "corporate social responsibility".

584
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,067
Get in touch with the gum company
that shot the ad with Cha Seongwook.

585
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,610
They're a big company.

586
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,445
Appeal to their sense of public duty.

587
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,740
Don't reduce our project
to little more than manipulation.

588
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,992
It's not that bad.

589
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:45,208
No way. This is the animal communicator?

590
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,586
Turns out I'm the one
who introduced her to Koo Hyeongtae.

591
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,670
Huh.

592
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,589
Sound like you two were
as close as they say, huh?

593
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:55,551
The man used me,
at the price of a cigarette.

594
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,930
I'm dying to know what he found out
and ended up covering up.

595
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,473
It's driving me crazy.

596
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,392
If one cigarette was all it took,
it's about time we dethroned him.

597
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,852
I mean, I could've been president myself.

598
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:11,025
The "animal communicator" …
Can anyone fill me in?

599
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,112
Listen…

600
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,910
Wow, this is just…

601
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,078
Right?

602
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,330
I'm not sure it's a very good fit for...

603
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,041
All makes… such perfect sense.

604
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,501
- What?
- Hmm?

605
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,836
Dogs know everything.

606
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,213
Everybody knows
they have the purest of souls.

607
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,093
If the animal communicator heard
anything at all from the victim's dog…

608
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,054
that'd be…

609
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,432
- I'm gonna go meet her.
- Huh?

610
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,978
What's wrong?

611
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,021
But once you find
the veterinary clinic director,

612
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,023
you're gonna fact-check to see
if they saw Koo Hyeongtae

613
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,108
back then or not, aren't you?

614
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,443
Right, I… I guess you're right.

615
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,404
Then why don't we find the director,
meet them, cross-check their claims,

616
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,655
two birds, one stone?

617
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,407
That's it!

618
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,164
You're a producer, do whatever it takes.

619
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,040
We'll decide later
whether or not to use it,

620
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,209
just charge in there
and make this happen.

621
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,173
Where and when do I go?

622
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,597
What's that book called again?

623
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,974
The Psychopath Within Us.

624
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,059
Why do you need that?
Can't you just learn from yourself?

625
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,105
Why do we have to carpool?

626
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,273
Hey, Do…

627
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,483
The prosecutor
who let Choi Hoseong out of jail

628
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,153
is out on a national judicial
exchange workshop

629
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,321
slash golfing trip or whatever.

630
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,406
The least I can do
is get an interview with him

631
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,325
since I want Ms. Oh to give me the story.

632
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,995
Right, and how is that any of my concern?
It's got nothing to do with me.

633
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,289
I'mma man up and ask you.

634
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,833
Can you help me?

635
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,960
- What?
- I mean, like…

636
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,421
the place will be crawling
with prosecutors.

637
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,131
I don't wanna walk
into the lion's den by myself,

638
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,674
you know?

639
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,885
Look, I...
We need to have solidarity right now.

640
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,762
That's what Trigger's about, teamwork,
you know what I mean?

641
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,555
So you offered a ride
just to ask for help?

642
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,975
Well, you know, we were going
the same way, so it made sense, right?

643
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,518
Uh, you'll help me, won't you?

644
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,146
I'll drive you anywhere
as fast as you want,

645
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,148
wherever you want, huh?

646
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,734
You won't believe
how fast this goes. Yeah.

647
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,696
Way to brag about your car
while asking for a favor.

648
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,115
Can I listen?

649
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,125
This puppy won't be crying anymore.

650
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,418
Promise?

651
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,838
Let's wrap it up for the day.

652
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

653
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,219
- And that's a wrap, everyone!
- All right, let's clean up.

654
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,850
Nice to meet you.

655
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,562
We're producers
from a Korean TV station named KNS.

656
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,314
Nice to meet you.

657
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,525
W… Welcome.

658
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,194
We thought you'd be in Japan.

659
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,655
I happened to be in the country
on a business trip.

660
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,824
Right. My name is Han Do.

661
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,242
And this is…

662
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,326
Kang Giho.

663
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,828
- Producer at Trigger.
- Oh!

664
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,414
One of our staff members
briefed me on you two.

665
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,873
Oh, right, right, right…

666
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,125
How did you learn to…

667
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,085
I'm a fan of K-drama.

668
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,254
Whoa!

669
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,591
I looked through my records
when I first heard from you.

670
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,138
I usually videotape my sessions,

671
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:31,225
but it seems my camcorder
was broken that day.

672
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,061
So there is no video of that session.

673
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,855
That's unfortunate.

674
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:40,526
Do you not have the footage
that the producer filmed at the time?

675
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,570
Unfortunately, no.

676
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:49,827
Could you tell me if this was
the producer that you met at the time?

677
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,665
Oh my.

678
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,168
He's become very clean-cut.

679
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,465
He looks even younger
and more stylish now.

680
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,632
So…

681
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,055
do you remember your interaction
with the dog at the time?

682
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,934
Bom and I share a similar namesake.

683
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,773
Bom and haru both mean "spring."

684
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,486
What Bom told me was quite shocking.

685
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,364
I still remember everything.

686
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,706
She's terrified.

687
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,375
Can you hurry up and ask the dog?

688
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,584
Get him to tell us what he saw.

689
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,173
We need to move on.

690
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,884
There is a man
whose life could be in danger.

691
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,307
Bom.

692
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,770
Could you tell me what you saw that day?

693
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,479
"It looked like a ball."

694
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,233
To Bom, his head

695
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,863
must have looked like a ball.

696
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,950
Wait, what does that…

697
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,120
What'd she say? Huh?
Why do you look shocked?

698
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:01,750
This is a copy of the notes
I took during that session.

699
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,878
I hope you find it helpful.

700
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,634
Do you know what the killer looks like?

701
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:19,310
The producer at the time
showed me a photo.

702
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,480
I asked Bom if it was the same person,

703
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,523
and he said yes.

704
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,109
Could you tell me…

705
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,949
…if this was her?

706
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,713
I don't remember her face very clearly.

707
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,548
I'm sorry.

708
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,232
For God's sake… Hey!

709
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,483
Try to focus.

710
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:09,443
If I don't score the interview,
that's gas money wasted.

711
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,781
Huh?

712
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,783
Isn't that the guy?

713
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,870
How did I miss that swing?

714
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,080
I gotta use the can.

715
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,373
- You go on ahead. See you in a bit.
- All right, see ya.

716
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,583
- We're over this way.
- Damn it.

717
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,168
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

718
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,218
Man… swoosh…

719
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,678
Hey, uh, Lee Jeonggeun?

720
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,597
- Yeah?
- I'm Kang Giho, producer at Trigger.

721
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,224
You know Choi Hoseong, right?

722
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,560
Uh, we were hoping
we could get a statement.

723
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,687
Oh, for the love of...
Are you kidding me?

724
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,146
You seriously followed me here?

725
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,192
I'd like this to stop now. Okay?

726
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,780
Uh, how did you grant a stay of execution
for Choi Hoseong with a fake diagnosis?

727
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,323
You go way back with his lawyer.

728
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,908
I believe you came up together
in your days

729
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,618
- at the Training Institute.
- Mm-hmm.

730
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,620
What's your name?

731
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,164
K-Kang Giho is my name.

732
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,208
Right. Kang Giho.

733
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,336
Kang Giho.

734
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,047
Listen up.

735
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:16,176
I have… tons of connections
because I went to a nice school.

736
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,428
Is that a crime? Huh?

737
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:20,014
- Which university did you go to?
- Sorry?

738
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,266
Which backwater school did you go to?

739
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,184
You learned
hack journalism somewhere, right?

740
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,228
Some nerve just showing up.

741
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,230
How dare you follow me here?

742
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,115
The… The Gogwang Group family.

743
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,118
And Chairman Park…
Park Seongun of DOQ Industries,

744
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,536
- we know you let them...
- Man, you're kidding me.

745
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,913
Has no one taught you
to be scared of prosecutors? Huh?

746
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,832
Let's see now.

747
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,794
I'll bet… you have
a camera hidden somewhere, huh?

748
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:55,007
If you dare… try and use
whatever clip you're recording,

749
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,176
I'll have you locked up.

750
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,012
Got it? You understand me?

751
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,641
Piece of sh…

752
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,315
Don't be like that, sir. Just one word?

753
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,526
I went to a nice school, just like you.

754
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,531
Well then, you wanna go to jail too?

755
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,075
Crime of intimidation.

756
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,870
Declaring intent to harm in order
to instill fear in another person.

757
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,914
You asshole.

758
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,333
So, um, what's your name, prick?

759
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,959
Intimidation and insult.

760
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,003
Surprising behavior for a prosecutor.

761
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,713
Oh, really, you crazy shithead?

762
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,091
Destruction of property.

763
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,684
Trigger, huh?

764
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,855
How dare you quote the law
to a prosecutor,

765
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,358
you smart-aleck son of a bitch? Hmm?

766
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:02,157
Do you even know…
what "authority to prosecute" is? Huh?

767
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,118
In the Republic of Korea,

768
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,038
even someone who sprays bullets
into the middle of the street

769
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,041
can get off scot-free
if a prosecutor deems him not guilty,

770
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,419
and if a prosecutor
wants to suspend a sentence,

771
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,295
that's simply what'll happen.

772
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,132
All I did… was follow protocol

773
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,259
after the doctor provided
a medical certificate.

774
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,678
All this nuisance over nothing, sheesh.

775
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,774
I only asked for a word,
but the guy just wouldn't stop talking.

776
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,405
Thank you for the interview, sir.

777
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,581
ADDITIONAL OBSERVATION:
BOM IS EXTREMELY STRESSED AND SCARED.

778
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,590
Are you okay?

779
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,469
Well, you know,
we scored the interview, didn't we?

780
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,512
Why wouldn't I be all right? Huh?

781
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,268
It's the recording from earlier.

782
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,948
Can you fill us in on the patient records

783
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,701
- from 2004?
- Hello, New K Veterinary Clinic?

784
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,244
I'm calling
because I'd like to run a fact-check…

785
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,329
The name of the dog was Bom…

786
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,497
The owner's name was Cha Seongwook…

787
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,873
Lunatic Han.

788
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,043
I appreciate the work that
must've gone into translating this, but…

789
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,462
The dog claimed
its owner looked like a ball.

790
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,048
What if Bom saw the man's head

791
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,549
after he was decapitated?

792
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,595
What if Haewon spiked Seongwook's wine
and then murdered and decapitated him?

793
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,138
Bom was describing the man's head.

794
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,349
I'm not saying we rule that out…

795
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,560
what I'm saying is
we need proof to back this up.

796
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,688
All we have are the claims
of an animal mind-reader.

797
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,857
It can't be the foundation of the episode.

798
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,901
This is not Animal Paradise.

799
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,153
All right, how do you expect
to dig up any evidence

800
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,738
on a murder case from 20 years ago?

801
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,241
Once we suggest a new path forward,

802
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,909
I'm sure
the cops will happily take over and...

803
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,161
You wanna throw around claims
to see if they stick?

804
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,496
That's how you'll nail the president?

805
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,081
God…

806
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,251
Ms. Oh, I mean… look at this.

807
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,920
Do you really think we'll find
the clinic director by cold-calling?

808
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,095
Ms. Oh, uh…

809
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,140
What's this?
This is what you were doing all day?

810
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,477
About Lee Jeonggeun, I, uh…

811
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,606
I got an interview.

812
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,277
- You're serious?
- Yes, ma'am.

813
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
You found an angle?

814
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:45,946
Yes.

815
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,741
Uh… since in our last episode,

816
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,035
we covered Choi Hoseong's stalking
and the victim's suffering,

817
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,120
this time, I'd like…

818
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,374
to find out why a monster like this
was able to do it again.

819
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,713
I wanna look at corruption
in the suspension of sentence practices

820
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,799
being abused by the cartel
of prosecutors and lawyers.

821
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,427
I've already gotten permission
from Ms. Nam,

822
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,347
and I'll be extremely cautious,
so as not to cause any repeat trauma.

823
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,227
You did great.

824
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,398
Okay.

825
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,317
Do the follow-up.

826
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,903
- Give it a go.
- Yes.

827
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,155
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

828
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:35,579
Do you happen to still have
any of the records from 20 years ago?

829
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:39,666
Finally, a glimmer of hope
after a series of disappointments.

830
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,834
What's that?

831
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,379
We just heard from the gum company.

832
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,884
"WE CONCLUDED THAT WE WILL BE ABLE
TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE FULL PAYMENT."

833
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,641
I guess our dog enthusiast…
whipped up one hell of a pitch.

834
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,644
I transferred from Soaps.
Least I can do is tell a good story.

835
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,604
But why do you want their help?

836
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,689
Commissioning a gold bust
of Cha Seongwook?

837
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,524
We've come up with a foolproof method

838
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,735
to conjure Cha Seongwook
from 20 years ago.

839
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:10,030
It'll be the most impactful way…
to declare war.

840
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,866
One that can't be torn apart or corrupted.

841
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,499
ANGEL ANIMAL HOSPITAL

842
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,918
REMINDER OF OVERDUE PAYMENT

843
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,711
BET AMOUNT: 5,000,000 WON

844
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,797
BET PLACED: 5,000,000 WON

845
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,679
Clinic hours are over.

846
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,099
Oh, man…

847
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,645
Who are you?

848
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,321
Oh, you're that producer
from way back when…

849
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,782
How'd you find me way out here?

850
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,618
You sold off Gangnam hospital
to cover your gambling debts,

851
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,996
and you moved down here five years ago.

852
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,289
- That right?
- What?

853
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,041
How'd you know that?

854
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,127
Do you still make a killing
off those dogs?

855
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,088
- Huh?
- I know the city pays you

856
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,800
100,000 won for every stray
you take off the street and put down.

857
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,721
This hospital received the most payouts
in the Yeongdong region.

858
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,456
I figured
I hadn't compensated you enough before.

859
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,668
I've never been one to sleep on my debts.

860
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,380
Why don't you take some time off?

861
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,051
And don't give another thought
to all those things in the past.

862
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,511
None of that matters anymore, eh?

863
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,305
Okay.

864
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,640
Good. I'll leave you be.

865
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,645
By the way…
what happened to that dog back then?

866
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,983
Here you go, sir.

867
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,486
"Magnesium Sulfate"

868
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,906
Thanks a lot.

869
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:21,119
Actually, I do remember
packing you a box of animal anesthetic,

870
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,205
seven grams of magnesium sulfate,

871
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,874
and three syringes, three ccs.

872
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,834
You wanted to put the dog down.

873
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,837
Your memory's gotten
so much better all of a sudden.

874
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,673
Oh, I've sold more of those meds
than I can count.

875
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,301
I gave it a respectful send-off.

876
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,515
Now if that's all…

877
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,892
mind if I go?

878
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,060
Yes, of course.

879
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,686
And…

880
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,939
thank you so much for this.

881
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,149
Good night.

882
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,826
You worthless little punks
don't know what it took to get here.

883
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,202
You have no idea.

884
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,387
Go home and get some sleep.

885
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,306
I don't think I can
since I have to check

886
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,392
the vet clinics' certificate of registry,

887
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,894
then go over the preview notes
like Kang asked me to.

888
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,979
For Choi Hoseong?

889
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,188
Yup.

890
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,816
Why don't you…

891
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,484
put your name on that one, Jiyun?

892
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,111
Sure.

893
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,155
Huh?

894
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,826
Mm… like… main writer?

895
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,663
You started working at the network
right after graduating high school,

896
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,874
you've cleaned up
everyone's mess for nine years.

897
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,001
It's high time you were initiated.

898
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:57,674
But your health…
should come before your work.

899
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,551
Make sure you sleep enough.

900
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,821
JY…

901
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,305
I guess us old farts
all had the same idea.

902
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,642
I was gonna ask for you anyway.

903
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,727
And why would you do that, Mr. Park?

904
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,857
So you're transferring to Soaps.

905
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,862
President Koo called me out
to eat with him…

906
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,783
…and asked if you were planning
something else… in secret.

907
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:12,040
Do you know why I stayed here,
in the same job all these years,

908
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:15,085
even though people couldn't care less
about the main writer?

909
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,254
What do you mean, people don't care?

910
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,838
Trigger couldn't function
without Hong Sunnam.

911
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,423
I changed my name to Nahee ages ago!

912
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,676
And yet,
you'll forever be Hong Sunnam to me.

913
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,011
- God, I can't…
- I mean, don't you remember?

914
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,055
Back when I was an assistant,

915
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:30,141
you were the scrawny Hong Sunnam
who'd cry and whine

916
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,269
when you had to run errands
for the producers.

917
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,146
- And now, you're all chub...
- Well, look at you!

918
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,899
Oh, my God, this guy.

919
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:41,194
Man, time sure flies by. It really does.

920
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,947
I get that…

921
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,909
you've been going through a rough patch
because of Ms. Nam,

922
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,495
but I want you to hang in there.

923
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,579
I'm struggling too.

924
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,085
I took pride in the fact that…
my writing was used

925
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,170
to vindicate the wrongfully departed.

926
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:04,509
In this fight club,
where only the most tenacious survive,

927
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,803
it was the pride that kept me going.

928
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,973
But the reality was…

929
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,600
I was just a nameless freelancer,

930
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,436
who didn't even need
to submit a resignation

931
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,479
to leave
all those years of hard work behind.

932
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,483
I want my name out there.

933
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:23,111
I want to be the main character for once.

934
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:26,531
Is that why you told Soryong
about the Seongchun thing?

935
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,742
You wanna run away
and keep me stuck here alone?

936
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,120
I figured she's gonna need
someone by her side.

937
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,002
Thanks for nothing.
It's been a displeasure.

938
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,922
That's all I wanted to say.

939
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,800
How much did they offer you?
I'll match whatever they're paying.

940
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:48,678
- Scrawny Hong Sunnam!
- It's Hong Nahee!

941
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,815
Oh Soryong, Park Daeyong…

942
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,486
hang in there and power through.

943
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,492
Man, Yoon's so stingy with his own money,

944
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:13,036
but he always goes over budget
for our expenses.

945
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,329
Wagyu steak? Seriously?

946
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,705
"SIGNED BY: OH SORYONG"

947
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,805
Can we really air this on time though?

948
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,059
- The finger… you know, one of these.
- The finger?

949
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,062
You and I
are on the same page on most things.

950
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,773
Let's work together and air this episode.

951
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:47,112
What did I say?
I told you she'd hate this, didn't I?

952
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,535
Three, two…

953
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,787
one.

954
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,587
Slept in the edit bay?

955
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,506
Why are you so early?

956
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,550
Well, today's D-Day.

957
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,802
Oh, we're getting
that composite sketch of Seongwook?

958
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:11,970
We are.

959
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,806
Man, I knew
Ms. Hong was stone-cold,

960
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:18,768
but how could she just up and leave us
without even saying goodbye, man?

961
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,729
I really wanted a chance
to work with her scripts.

962
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,690
I just keep clashing with Jiyun
on everything.

963
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:26,234
Nahee's not going anywhere.
I'll bring her back to us.

964
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,694
Seriously?

965
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,446
Why wait? Can you do it now?

966
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,864
No can do, I have work now.

967
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:31,990
Let's head out.

968
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,117
We've got a busy day,
if we're still rehearsing.

969
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,494
All right, Mr. Han.

970
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,706
Let's go.

971
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,925
This is Mr. Han.

972
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,677
He's a coworker of mine.
Introduce yourself.

973
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,889
Han Do. Nice to meet you.

974
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,308
Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

975
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,642
Hi.

976
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,356
You said you made a new poster
for Seongwook,

977
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,484
are we going to watch them
unveil it together?

978
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,735
That's right, sir.

979
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,779
We're gonna see it, here, together.

980
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,409
You see… that screen over there,
the biggest one?

981
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,328
I want you to look after I count down.

982
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,997
All right, sir.
Now close your eyes.

983
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,460
Three…

984
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,546
two…

985
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:33,259
…one.

986
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,333
Oh, look over there!

987
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,296
Oh, wow.

988
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,230
Wow, that's so cool!

989
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,150
Hello.

990
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,443
I've missed you all.

991
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,988
My name's Cha Seongwook.

992
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:39,409
I'm a missing person
who turned 43 this year…

993
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:40,660
if I'm still alive.

994
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,663
Seongwook…

995
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,041
Everyone,

996
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,129
please don't forget about me.

997
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,594
And please…

998
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,222
please try to find me.

999
