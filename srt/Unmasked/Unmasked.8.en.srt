Actually, places like this

Wow, pretty hip ambiance out here, huh?

She's not coming,
she doesn't play games like this.

Seems like you're the one
who doesn't know her well.

I came to give a tip.

That night,

[Han Do] You only got a brief look at her.
And it was late at night.

38
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,254
So how could you possibly tell

39
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,132
whether her nails were burgundy or black?

40
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,759

wore a perfume that was quite strong…

What's your goal?

49

You disappeared for 20 years,
so why show up now?

For the past two decades…

This is Hanju.

Cho Haewon managed to abduct me,

Goodbye party for the main writer?

Wow, we had Hyeongtae,

Oh, Ms. Hong.

183
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,995
I guess you two were out
having a lunch meeting?

184
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,331
[President Koo]
Yup, first time in a while.

185
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,250
On your way to meet Mr. Park?

186
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,837
Goodness, no.
I'm headed to check on ratings.

before turning them on?

-[♪ comical sting]
-Huh?

202
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,557
I… couldn't possibly tell the color
in the dark.

203
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,850
Right?

204
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,062

Come on.

00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,402
Go to Songi or someone else
with that kind of question.

208
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,778
I'm busy, you know?

209
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,655
But I heard Songi's on leave this week.

210
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,907
Thank you.

God, why's that weirdo…
wearing nail polish anyway? [tuts]

213
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,546
Was he… flirting with me?

so much time off.

Don't you want to know why Ms. Oh
showed up at the convenience store?

220

Not the obvious reason.
What she's really thinking.

221

You really think just adding wrinkles
will make people recognize him?

224
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,252
[Soryong] I don't.

225
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,297

"Episode 1,802: DeepFakes' Crosshairs."

227
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,176
It was your story. You should remember it.

228
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,136
Look at you, memorizing stuff.

229
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,679
You're proposing we alter it?

230
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,973
In a recent episode, Mr. Choi used AI

231
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,935
to come up with a facial composite…
of a missing child.

Kang Giho, we can hear you.

234
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,649
[Soryong] I'm sorry they screwed you,
but don't take it out on us.

235
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,985
Ms. Oh, did you see
the recent Exclusives 24 episode?

236
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,320
It's my job to do so, yes.

237
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,658
So, um… uh…

238
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,245
Ms. Oh, since we're on the subject, uh…

239
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,665
do… do you mind putting me
on the Choi Hoseong follow-up?

240
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,293
[awkward chuckle]
You know, since I'll have to

241
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,795
give up on my current story and all.

242
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,298
Are you gonna abandon your story
over a scoop then?

243
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:20,966
You wouldn't be so cavalier

244
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,718
if you'd really poured
your blood and sweat into it.

245
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,887
Come on, you even said you watched it.

246
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,473
I'm not quite sure… what more I can do.

247
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,392
Why should I let you?

248
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,645
What would be the focus of this follow-up?

249
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,647
Uh…

250
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,941
Is there something you've uncovered
or a refreshing take

251
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,818
that makes us see it in a new light?

252
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,528
You need to give me
at least one good reason

253
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,321
that we should air this follow-up.

I won't trust someone
who has no plan at all, so no.

256
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,372
As for you, Lunatic Han,

257
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,748
I'd like you to arrange
a new facial composite

258
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,291
since you proposed it.

-No, I'm not.
-You charge headfirst into danger.

You always chase after the stories,

Why does she keep claiming
to know you so well?

00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,959
So you had a call with her?

345
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,630
Apparently, Daeyong asked her
for Ma Seongchun's contact info.

346
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,883
That's the guy who was
Trigger's chief producer 20 years ago.

347
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,927
I heard they met up already.
You know that?

348
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,012
No. He never mentioned it.

349
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,556
If there's one thing I've learned,

350
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:24,019
it's that personal allegiances
rarely align with profits.

351
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,687
I'm not trying to badmouth Park Daeyong.

352
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,399
I'm just saying
that even the good ones can be gotten to.

353
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,862
If you're really set on putting out
the Seongwook episode,

354
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:37,032
don't trust anyone except yourself.

355
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,078
-Not even you, Nahee?
-Definitely not.

356
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,663
I wouldn't hesitate to backstab you.

357
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,874
I doubt you would've warned me
if that were really the case.

358
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,835
When we talked,

359
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,838
the writer said
Park Daeyong and Koo Hyeongtae

360
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,589
used to be inseparable.

361
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,845
She told me that
Park Daeyong joined Trigger 20 years ago

362
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,389
to cover
for Koo Hyeongtae's sudden departure.

363
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,307
Funny, huh?

364
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,853
I worked alongside him for years
and had no idea.

365
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,563
You're telling me…

366
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,732
-Koo worked on Trigger?
-[Ms. Hong] Uh-huh.

367
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,653
He was on Trigger before abruptly
transferring to the News Department.

368
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,574
Anyway… that's what she told me.

369
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,909
Earlier, I saw Koo and Park.

370
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,870
They'd been getting lunch together.

371
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,913
That was everything that I saw.

372
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,498
Just something to consider.

373
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,375
-[car door opens]
-Hold on a second.

374
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,210
What was the name
of the previous chief producer?

375
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,795
Can you give me his contact info?

376
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,387
[Daeyong sighs]

377
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,099
You're making me uncomfortable.
Is this a staring contest?

378
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,268
Why won't you look me in the eye?

379
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,189
-You hiding something?
-I don't even look my wife in the eye.

380
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,982
Not that I can, since she's abroad.

381
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,775
Is there something you haven't told me…

382
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,194
about the Cha Seongwook case?

383
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,738
What? Come on, what is it?

384
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:58,947
[groans]

385
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,241
I'm having the worst month ever, I swear.

386
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,993
What's wrong with all of you? God!

387
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,369
No way…

388
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,330
Did Seongchun get in touch or something?

389
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,915
And now I get the truth.

390
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,708
Wait, it can't be, the guy's not a blab.

391
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,335
There's no way
he would've mentioned this to you.

392
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,419
Come on.

393
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,213
-[bangs on table] Come on, Park Daeyong!
-Ah! Scared me.

394
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,590
Okay, so maybe I did meet with Seongchun.

395
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,134
-Why's that so wrong?
-We both know there's more to that story.

396
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,595
Okay! Hyeongtae worked on
the Cha Seongwook case,

397
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,138
and he hid the tape before they could air.

398
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,806
So what? Not like it's my fault.

399
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,600
President Koo…

400
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,562
was on that case
while he was with Trigger?

401
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:33,023
Are you going to answer me?

402
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,526
Well, yeah, like I just told you.

403
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,694
[sharp exhale]

404
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,780
[♪ soft suspenseful music playing]

405
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,908
So that's why Mr. Ma couldn't tell me
about this over the phone.

406
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,410
Because President Koo was involved.

407
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,329
Listen, Soryong…

408
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,582
Koo Hyeongtae…

409
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,501
is not the kind of person
we can take down.

410
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:57,631
Frankly, we're all just his employees,
and the guy's in charge of our survival.

411
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,009
When'd you get to be so pathetic, Daeyong?

412
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:02,844
Pathetic?

413
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,722
Hey.

414
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,267
Those who work nine-to-five
lead pathetic lives, okay?

415
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,686
If we wanna survive
and provide for our families,

416
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,771
then living a principled life
is not an option!

417
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,147
Stop it, stop it, listen to me!

418
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,608
You're the chief producer of Trigger.

419
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,237
You just admitted Koo ran off
with the tape right before it aired.

420
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,321
And you forgive him?

421
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,032
What if that tape contained
vital information?

422
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,326
What if it could've changed
the outcome of the case?

423
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,744
What if it had solved it?

424
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,956
That scumbag's drunk on power,
trying to get into politics.

425
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,791
Is staying silent like this…

426
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,377
really what you think you should do?

427
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,920
We both know there's no justice.

428
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,673
Of course not.
That's why we're working on Trigger.

429
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,466
We don't stand a chance on our own,

430
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,593
so let's use Trigger
as our means to fight!

You wanna know what I thought

437
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,320
when they told me
he had less than three months left?

438
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,617
"I can barely afford
my kids' tuition and living expenses."

439

on my severance."

Your father…

449
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,283
can he do chemo?

he has some important information
to give us.

I plan on hearing him out
whether or not you can make it.

460

And then I'll decide…

whether to take it up with the president.

you've done a great job, huh?

515
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,701
-I love your work. [chuckles]
-Oh, thank you, sir.

516
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,540
-[Soryong] One thing, sir…
-[Seongchun] Uh-huh?

517
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,376
[Soryong] I feel like an incident
like someone running off with a tape

518
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,336
should've gone down
in KNS Current Affairs history.

519
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,171
How has no one heard about this?

520
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,173
[sighs] Those were hectic times,

521
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,010
they were suing anyone
who even mentioned Cha Seongwook.

522
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,095
There were only three of us
secretly on the case,

523
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,930
including me and Hyeongtae.

524
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,683
I was so worried about a leak
and losing the episode,

525
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,351
that another producer and I

526
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,063
prepared a decoy episode
to use as backup. God…

527
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,567
So what's this vital piece of info
you wanted to give us?

528
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,819
[sighs]

529
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,322
But Koo Hyeongtae said…

530
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,574
-President Koo…
-Koo Hyeongtae…

531
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,284
Uh…

532
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,494
he told me that there was a witness.

533
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,164
Someone who witnessed
Cha Seongwook's murder.

534
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,625
[♪ dramatic sting]

535
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,463
Hold up. Uh…
So the man's dead? Not just missing?

536
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,632
[♪ uneasy music playing]

537
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,384
Really?

538
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,553
President Koo identified a witness?

539
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,306
Well, actually,

540
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,059
the catch was
that it wasn't exactly your, um…

541
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,353
most typical witness, you might say.

542
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,899
This is Bom,
the dog that belonged to Cha Seongwook.

543
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,275
Bom, Korean for "spring".

544
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,904
Once Cha Seongwook went missing,
his agent jimmied the locks to get inside.

545
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,239
When he walked in, the dog was out there.

546
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,616
Ugh, okay, so?

547
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,618
There's that woman over at Animal Kingdom!

548
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,871
The animal communicator
who is able to talk with dogs.

549
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,916
I'm telling you, when they talk,
a miracle's gonna happen.

550
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,167
-Christ…
-[photo flaps]

551
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,503
This isn't some sketch show. [scoffs]

552
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,672
Anyway, if that were real, don't you think

553
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,465
-the cops would take the dog?
-Come on!

554
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,677
Isn't it our job
as the producers of this show

555
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,055
to try something new,
if it means we can get at the truth?

556
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,766
-[groans]
-I'm not saying we make stuff up.

557
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,519
I'm just trying to say

558
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,854
that this psychic
really can speak with dogs.

559
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:14,359
Dogs that used to bite people
can become calm when she does this.

560
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,819
And they stop biting for good.

561
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,987
Oh, yeah?

562
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,406
[past President Koo]
This dog's apparently dying,

563
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,449
and it's being treated at a clinic nearby.

564
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,660
[past Daeyong] Why'd you want
this animal psychic's address?

565
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,412
[past President Koo]
You'll find out, my man.

566
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,830
Is this for a Trigger story?

567
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,915
Here, take my last cig. You enjoy.

568
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,333
-Oh…
-Thanks.

569
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,170
I certainly will!

570
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,300
[Seongchun] Hey.

571
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,427
-What?
-What's wrong?

572
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,263
Oh, uh… uh, nothing.

573
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,809
I only heard him talk about it.
Never saw the tape with my own eyes.

574
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,395
I went to talk to him again

575
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,814
after he transferred
to the News Department.

576
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,191
I asked for the tapes
of the episode we did,

577
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,568
for the archives.

578
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,486
[scoffs] You know what he said?

579
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,197
That prick was shameless.

580
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,158
-How'd he respond?
-[Daeyong] What was it?

581
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,996
"Seongchun…
you gotta forget Cha Seongwook."

582
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,248
[chuckles, scoffs]

583

[sighs]

584
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,920
Which episode was the one
he tried to hide? What number?

585
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,174
890.

Child Murder in Ungyeong

588
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,817
So…

589
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,445
you're really gonna do this?

590
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,281
You wanna take the president on
in this fight?

591
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,076
Basically, you'll be opening up
the gates of hell.

592
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,537
No turning back.

593
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,665
Those gates opened up 20 years ago

594
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,709
when a rookie producer
ran off with the tape.

595
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:59,172
For all we know, he's covered up
even worse cases than this.

Trigger episode 890.

Do you remember that one?

602
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,699
Why did you do it?

603
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,037
A producer runs off with an episode
before it airs?

604
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,499
Oh, you mean Cha Seongwook?

605
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,627
I simply stopped pursuing that case.

606
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,463
I'd done some digging,
and nothing had turned up.

607
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,465
Digging?

608
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,885
You've dug pretty deep though.

609
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,597
Well, I'm here to…

610
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,475
offer you another chance, President.

A final chance

612
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:58,815
to tell us the truth about
the Cha Seongwook case from 20 years ago.

I'm not addressing the President Koo
sitting in front of me now.

I'm addressing the man
who had a passion for the truth…

Mr. Koo, my predecessor.

If you must know,

619

you try digging it back up.

Fine.

00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,806
I'm formally requesting to interview you.

622
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,684
Episode 890 of Trigger,
the Cha Seongwook incident,

623
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,936
should've been aired
without any interference,

624
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,147
which is why we'll air it properly.

625

Unlike some, I won't be using any decoys,

626

will not be running away.

I too used to believe in good and evil.

But life has taught me
that they're mere illusions.

636
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,360
There are simply

637
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,154
the consequences of the choices we make.

638
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,158

to the limits of your resolve, Soryong.

I'll choose to air the episode as penance.

I want to issue an apology to the viewers
who have always believed in Trigger.

That's the choice I'll make…

644
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,886
I'd think it over.

You might be digging your own grave.

687
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,392
If one cigarette was all it took,
it's about time we dethroned him.

688
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,852
I mean, I could've been president myself.

689
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,145
[knocks on table]

690
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:11,025
The "animal communicator"…
Can anyone fill me in?

691
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,112
[sighs] Listen…

692
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,910
Wow, this is just…

693
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,078
Right?

694
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,330
I'm not sure it's a very good fit for--

695
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,041
All makes… such perfect sense.

696
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,501
-What?
-[Daeyong] Hmm?

697
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,836
Dogs know everything.

698
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,213
Everybody knows
they have the purest of souls.

699
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,093
If the animal communicator heard
anything at all from the victim's dog…

700
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,054
that'd be…

701
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,432
-I'm gonna go meet her.
-Huh?

702
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,600
[Soryong sighs]

703
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,978
What's wrong?

704
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,021
But once you find
the veterinary clinic director,

705
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,023
you're gonna fact-check to see
if they saw Koo Hyeongtae

706
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,108
back then or not, aren't you?

707
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,443
Right, I… I guess you're right.

708
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,404
Then why don't we find the director,
meet them, cross-check their claims,

709
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,655
two birds, one stone?

710
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,407
[snaps fingers] That's it!

711
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:00,700
[Daeyong clears throat]

712
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,164
You're a producer, do whatever it takes.

713
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,040
We'll decide later
whether or not to use it,

714
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,209
just charge in there
and make this happen.

715
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,920
[sharp exhale]

716
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,173
Where and when do I go?

717
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,597
What's that book called again?

718
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,974
The Psychopath Within Us.

719
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,059
Why do you need that?
Can't you just learn from yourself?

720
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,105
Why do we have to carpool? [sighs]

721
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,273
Hey, Do…

722
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,483
The prosecutor
who let Choi Hoseong out of jail

723
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,153
is out on a national judicial
exchange workshop

724
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,321
slash golfing trip or whatever.

725
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,406
The least I can do
is get an interview with him

726
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,325
since I want Ms. Oh to give me the story.

727
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,995
Right, and how is that any of my concern?
It's got nothing to do with me.

728
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,289
I'mma man up and ask you.
[clears throat]

729
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,833
Can you help me?

730
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,960
-What?
-I mean, like…

731
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,421
the place will be crawling
with prosecutors.

732
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,131
I don't wanna walk
into the lion's den by myself,

733
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,674
-you know?
-[scoffs]

734
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,885
Look, I--
We need to have solidarity right now.

735
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,762
That's what Trigger's about, teamwork,
you know what I mean?

736
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,555
So you offered a ride
just to ask for help?

737
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,975
Well, you know, we were going
the same way, so it made sense, right?

738
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,518
Uh, you'll help me, won't you?

739
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,146
I'll drive you anywhere
as fast as you want,

740
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,148
wherever you want, huh?

741
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,734
You won't believe
how fast this goes. Yeah.

742
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,696
Way to brag about your car
while asking for a favor.

743
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,115
Can I listen?

744
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,076
[scoffs]

745
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,125
[in Japanese]
This puppy won't be crying anymore.

746
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,418
Promise?

747
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,838
Let's wrap it up for the day.

748
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,800
-[staff 1] Thank you.
-[communicator] Thank you.

749
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,219
-[in English] And that's a wrap, everyone!
-[staff 2] All right, let's clean up.

750
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,263
[indistinct chatter]

751
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,850
[in Japanese] Nice to meet you.

752
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,562
We're producers
from a Korean TV station named KNS.

753
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,314
Nice to meet you.

754
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,525
W… Welcome.

755
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,194
We thought you'd be in Japan.

756
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,655
I happened to be in the country
on a business trip.

757
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,824
Right. My name is Han Do.

758
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,242
And this is…

759
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,326
Kang Giho.

760
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,828
-[in English] Producer at Trigger.
-Oh!

761
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,414
One of our staff members
briefed me on you two.

762
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,873
Oh, right, right, right…

763
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,125
How did you learn to…

764
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,085
I'm a fan of K-drama.

765
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,254
-[Giho] Whoa!
-[laughter]

766
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,591
[in Japanese] I looked through my records
when I first heard from you.

767
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,138
I usually videotape my sessions,

768
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:31,225
but it seems my camcorder
was broken that day.

769
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,061
So there is no video of that session.

770
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,855
That's unfortunate.

771
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:40,526
Do you not have the footage
that the producer filmed at the time?

772
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,570
Unfortunately, no.

773
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:49,827
Could you tell me if this was
the producer that you met at the time?

774
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,665
Oh my.

775
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,168
He's become very clean-cut.

776
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,465
He looks even younger
and more stylish now.

777
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,632
So…

778
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,055
do you remember your interaction
with the dog at the time?

779
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,934
[in English]
Bom and I share a similar namesake.

780
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,773
[in Japanese]
Bom and haru both mean "spring."

781
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,486
What Bom told me was quite shocking.

782
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,364
I still remember everything.

783
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,283

-[barking]
-[beeps]

785
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,706
She's terrified.

786
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,375
[in English]
Can you hurry up and ask the dog?

787
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,584
Get him to tell us what he saw.

788
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,461
[sighs]

789
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,173
We need to move on.

790
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,884
There is a man
whose life could be in danger.

791
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,846
[deep breath]

792
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,307
[in Japanese] Bom.

793
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,770
Could you tell me what you saw that day?

794
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,147

[Haru in English] "It looked like a ball."

808
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,233
[in Japanese] To Bom, his head

809
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:48,863
must have looked like a ball.

810
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,950
[in English] Wait, what does that…

811
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:56,120
What'd she say? Huh?
Why do you look shocked?

812
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:01,750
[in Japanese] This is a copy of the notes
I took during that session.

813
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,878
I hope you find it helpful.

[rustles]

815
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,634
Do you know what the killer looks like?

816
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:19,310
The producer at the time
showed me a photo.

817
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,480
I asked Bom if it was the same person,

818
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,523
and he said yes.

819
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,109
Could you tell me…

820
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,570
[tapping on phone]

821
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,949
…if this was her?

822
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,713
I don't remember her face very clearly.

823
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,548
I'm sorry.

If I don't score the interview,
that's gas money wasted.

830
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,781
Huh?

831
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,783
Isn't that the guy?

832
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,870
How did I miss that swing?

833
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,080
[prosecutor 1] I gotta use the can.

Hey, uh, Lee Jeonggeun?

-Yeah?
-I'm Kang Giho, producer at Trigger.

841
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,224
You know Choi Hoseong, right?

842
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,560
Uh, we were hoping
we could get a statement.

843
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,687
[Jeonggeun] Oh, for the love of--
Are you kidding me?

844
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,146
You seriously followed me here?

[sighs]

846
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,192
I'd like this to stop now. Okay?

847
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:54,780
Uh, how did you grant a stay of execution
for Choi Hoseong with a fake diagnosis?

848
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,323
You go way back with his lawyer.

849
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,908
I believe you came up together
in your days

850
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,618

-Mm-hmm.

851

What's your name?

K-Kang Giho is my name.

Right. Kang Giho.

Listen up.

856
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:16,176
I have… tons of connections
because I went to a nice school.

857
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,428
Is that a crime? Huh?

858

-Sorry?

Which backwater school did you go to?

860
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,184
You learned
hack journalism somewhere, right?

861
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,228
Some nerve just showing up.

862
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,230
How dare you follow me here?

863
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,941
[♪ somber tense music playing]

864
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,071
[sighs]

865
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,115
[Giho] The… The Gogwang Group family.

866
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,118
And Chairman Park…
Park Seongun of DOQ Industries,

867
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,536
-we know you let them--
-Man, you're kidding me.

868
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,913
Has no one taught you
to be scared of prosecutors? Huh?

869
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,832
Let's see now.

870
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,794
I'll bet… you have
a camera hidden somewhere, huh?

871
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:55,007
If you dare… try and use
whatever clip you're recording,

872
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,176
I'll have you locked up.

873
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,012
Got it? You understand me?

874
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,641
Piece of sh… [tuts]

875
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,315
Don't be like that, sir. Just one word?

876
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,526
I went to a nice school, just like you.

877
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,445
[chuckles]

878
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,531
Well then, you wanna go to jail too?

879
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,075
Crime of intimidation.

880
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:24,870
Declaring intent to harm in order
to instill fear in another person.

881
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,914
[Jeonggeun scoffs] You asshole.

882
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,333
So, um, what's your name, prick?

883
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,959
[Han Do] Intimidation and insult.

884
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,003
Surprising behavior for a prosecutor.

885
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,713
Oh, really, you crazy shithead?

886
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,091

-Destruction of property.

[disbelieving chuckle]

890
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,855
How dare you quote the law
to a prosecutor,

891
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,358
you smart-aleck son of a bitch? Hmm?

892
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:02,157
Do you even know…
what "authority to prosecute" is? Huh?

893
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,118
In the Republic of Korea,

894
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,038
even someone who sprays bullets
into the middle of the street

895
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:11,041
can get off scot-free
if a prosecutor deems him not guilty,

896
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,419
and if a prosecutor
wants to suspend a sentence,

897
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,295
that's simply what'll happen.

898
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,132
All I did… was follow protocol

899
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,259
after the doctor provided
a medical certificate.

900
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,678
All this nuisance over nothing, sheesh.

901
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,774
I only asked for a word,
but the guy just wouldn't stop talking.

902
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,405
Thank you for the interview, sir.

903
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,117
[keyboard keys clacking]

904
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,581
Additional Observation:
Bom is extremely stressed and scared.

905
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,293
[sighs]

906
00:45:58,589 --> 00:45:59,590
Are you okay?

907
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,469
Well, you know,
we scored the interview, didn't we?

908
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,512
Why wouldn't I be all right? Huh?

909
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,268
It's the recording from earlier.

910
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,948
[Moka]
Can you fill us in on the patient records

911
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,701
-from 2004?
-Hello, New K Veterinary Clinic?

912
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,244
I'm calling
because I'd like to run a fact-check…

913
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,329
[Moka] The name of the dog was Bom…

914
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,497
[Jiyun]
The owner's name was Cha Seongwook…

915
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,873
[sighs] Lunatic Han.

916
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,043
[Soryong] I appreciate the work that
must've gone into translating this, but…

917
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,462
The dog claimed
its owner looked like a ball.

918
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,048
-[sighs]
-What if Bom saw the man's head

919
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,549
after he was decapitated?

920
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,595
What if Haewon spiked Seongwook's wine
and then murdered and decapitated him?

921
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,138
Bom was describing the man's head.

922
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,349
I'm not saying we rule that out…

923
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,560
what I'm saying is
we need proof to back this up.

924
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,688
All we have are the claims
of an animal mind-reader.

925
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,857
It can't be the foundation of the episode.

926
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,901
This is not Animal Paradise.

927
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,153
All right, how do you expect
to dig up any evidence

928
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,738
on a murder case from 20 years ago?

929
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,241
Once we suggest a new path forward,

930
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,909
I'm sure
the cops will happily take over and--

931
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,161
You wanna throw around claims
to see if they stick?

932
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,496
That's how you'll nail the president?

933
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,081
God… [frustrated groan]

934
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,251
[Han Do] Ms. Oh, I mean… look at this.

935
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,920
Do you really think we'll find
the clinic director by cold-calling?

936
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:22,005
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Soryong and Han Do sigh]

937
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,095
Ms. Oh, uh…

938
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,140
What's this?
This is what you were doing all day?

939
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,477
About Lee Jeonggeun, I, uh…

940
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,606
I got an interview.

941
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,277
-You're serious?
-[Giho] Yes, ma'am.

942
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
You found an angle?

943
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:45,946
Yes.

944
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,741
Uh… since in our last episode,

945
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,035
we covered Choi Hoseong's stalking
and the victim's suffering,

946
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,120
this time, I'd like…

947
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:57,374
to find out why a monster like this
was able to do it again.

948
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,001
[clearing throat]

949
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,713
I wanna look at corruption
in the suspension of sentence practices

950
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,799
being abused by the cartel
of prosecutors and lawyers.

951
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,427
I've already gotten permission
from Ms. Nam,

952
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,347
and I'll be extremely cautious,
so as not to cause any repeat trauma.

953
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,227
-[paper rustles]
-You did great.

954
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,398
Okay.

955
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,317
Do the follow-up.

956
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,903
-Give it a go.
-Yes.

957
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,155
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

958
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,157
[phone vibrates]

959
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:35,579
Do you happen to still have
any of the records from 20 years ago?

960
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:39,666
Finally, a glimmer of hope
after a series of disappointments.

961
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,834
What's that?

962
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,379
We just heard from the gum company.

963
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,884
"We concluded that we will be able
to provide you with the full payment."

964
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,095
[sighs]

965
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,641
I guess our dog enthusiast…
whipped up one hell of a pitch.

966
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,644
I transferred from Soaps.
Least I can do is tell a good story.

967
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:00,604
[Giho] But why do you want their help?

968
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,689
Commissioning a gold bust
of Cha Seongwook?

969
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,524
We've come up with a foolproof method

970
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,735
to conjure Cha Seongwook
from 20 years ago.

971
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:10,030
It'll be the most impactful way…
to declare war.

972
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,866
One that can't be torn apart or corrupted.

973
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,499
Angel Animal Hospital

[door opens]

978
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,679
Clinic hours are over.

979
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,763
[door closes]

980
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,099
Oh, man… [groans]

981
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:41,645
Who are you?

982
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,321
[vet] Oh, you're that producer
from way back when…

983
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:53,782
How'd you find me way out here?

984
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:56,618
You sold off Gangnam hospital
to cover your gambling debts,

985
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,996
and you moved down here five years ago.

986
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,289
-That right?
-What?

987
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,041
How'd you know that?

988
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,127
Do you still make a killing
off those dogs?

989
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,088
-Huh?
-I know the city pays you

990
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,800
100,000 won for every stray
you take off the street and put down.

991
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,721
This hospital received the most payouts
in the Yeongdong region.

992
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:42,456
[President Koo] I figured
I hadn't compensated you enough before.

993
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,668
I've never been one to sleep on my debts.

994
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,380
Why don't you take some time off?

995
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,051
And don't give another thought
to all those things in the past.

996
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,511
None of that matters anymore, eh?

997
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,305
Okay.

998
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,640
Good. I'll leave you be.

999
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,645
By the way…
what happened to that dog back then?

1000
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,482
[♪ dramatic sting]

1001
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:09,983
Here you go, sir.

1002
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,486
"Magnesium Sulfate"

1003
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,029
[panting]

1004
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:15,906
Thanks a lot.

1005
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:21,119
[Jongsik] Actually, I do remember
packing you a box of animal anesthetic,

1006
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,205
seven grams of magnesium sulfate,

1007
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,874
and three syringes, three ccs.

1008
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,834
You wanted to put the dog down.

1009
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,837
[chuckles] Your memory's gotten
so much better all of a sudden.

1010
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,673
Oh, I've sold more of those meds
than I can count.

1011
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,301
I gave it a respectful send-off.

1012
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,471
[chuckles]

1013
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,515
Now if that's all…

1014
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,892
mind if I go?

1015
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,060
Yes, of course.

1016
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,686
And…

1017
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,939
thank you so much for this.

1018
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,149
Good night.

1019
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,568
[door opens]

1020
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,826
You worthless little punks
don't know what it took to get here.

1021
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,202
You have no idea.

1022
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,506
[Ms. Hong sighs]

1023
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,387
Go home and get some sleep.

1024
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,306
I don't think I can
since I have to check

1025
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,392
the vet clinics' certificate of registry,

1026
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,894
then go over the preview notes
like Kang asked me to.

1027
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,979
For Choi Hoseong?

1028
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,188
[Jiyun] Yup.

1029
