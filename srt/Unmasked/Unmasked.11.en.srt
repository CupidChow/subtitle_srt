- Assemblyman Cho!
- Assemblyman Cho!

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,258
When is Hanju planning to release
their official statement?

3
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,636
Who was Ms. Cho referring
to when she mentioned, "their doing"?

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,930
Do you have any comments
on that recording of your sister?

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,682
What are your thoughts on
the allegations that the Trigger producers

6
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,185
are being pressured by an external force?

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,021
Gosh, uh… you're all doing great work.

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,940
Sir, please help us pass
the Chanbyeol Act.

9
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,191
I'll do…

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:26,818
everything that I possibly can

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,363
to pass this critical legislation.

12
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:30,697
- Hang in there.
- Thank you.

13
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,325
- We could really use your help, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

14
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,079
Uh…

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,874
"JUSTICE FOR CHANBYEOL!
TOUGHEN THE LAWS AGAINST CHILD ABUSE!"

16
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,709
- Good luck.
- Please help us, Assemblyman.

17
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,461
- …protect our children.
- Do the right thing, sir.

18
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,338
Assemblyman, a word!

19
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,467
We demand
that you pass the Chanbyeol Act into law!

20
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:54,137
Pass the law!
Pass the law! Pass the law!

21
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,558
They're filthy, like a virus.

22
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,061
I can't believe they grabbed my hand.

23
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,487

25
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,917
Weren't we expecting this outcome
with the Chanbyeol Act?

26
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,337
We expected that
it would be shot down anyway.

27
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,758
I had an alternate script ready,
just in case.

28
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,513
Flip through it.

29
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,267
They've installed more
since yesterday.

{\an8}"PROPERTY REGISTRY"

32
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,069
I went through everything,

33
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,488
starting with the land sites
registered under Hanju.

34
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,823

CHO HAEWON, CHO JINMAN

39
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,975
This is their family burial plot,
and that's their villa?

40
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,562
Hanju owns over 800 acres
of the forest to the north of that villa.

41
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,647
They own a lot of land.

42
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,690
They're not even old money.
They're fakes. Nouveau riche.

43
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,609
Cho Jinman's great
and great-great grandfathers

44
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,778
received the land for selling out
their country back in the day.

45
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,530
Kids don't care where your money
comes from nowadays.

46
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,616
If you've got the money, you're golden.

47
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,160
Money can rewrite history.

48
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,454
Apparently, they made the cemetery
in the '90s.

49
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,248
It's where Cho Haewon, Cho Taesu,
and the rest of them are buried.

50
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,126
I feel like something's off
about that place.

51
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,670
Where'd you get the footage?

52
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,837
I'm sure it wasn't public.

53
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,298
It was only for employees
on Hanju's intranet.

54
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:54,925
We got a mole though.

55
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,261
Is it Hwang Jinwoo?

56
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,847
If this keeps up,
they might get back together.

57
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,307
- Don't you think?
- No, once you break up,

58
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,767
it's over for good, that's it.

59
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,185
That love never goes away though.

60
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,063
What do you know about love anyway, huh?

61
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,899
You know nothing about love.

62
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,072
Oh, shit!

63
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,410
Mr. Han, have you been
to the national assembly?

64
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,120
What happened
with the Chanbyeol Act?

65
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,413
Shot down as expected.

66
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,873
Damn, I saw that coming. Those bastards.

67
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,251
Whoa, whoa, hey,
what the heck? You can't…

68
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,337
What are you all doing?

69
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:33,505
Get back to work.

70
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,049
Stop hanging out
if it's not for work, okay?

71
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,343
And send back the plant
that's on Soryong's desk.

72
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,428
- Why?
- 'Cause the higher-ups

73
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,929
don't like it, that's why.

74
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,056
- Whoa, Chief, that's a bit...
- That's an order, huh?

75
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,391
Have it sent back today.

76
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,436
Mr. Han, you make sure that episode
gets aired as planned.

77
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,358
Wow, what the hell?

78
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,987
I don't think
Ms. Oh would be cool with that.

79
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,334
Just like that.

80
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,628
You need to go around
at least eight times

81
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,630
in order to get the ice
all perfectly smooth.

82
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm sure you're tired,
all this new kind of work.

83
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,511
Oh, no, I'm doing fine.
This is nothing.

84
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,096
Thanks for showing me around.

85
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,848
I'm a big fan of yours.

86
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,058
It truly is an honor to see you so often.

87
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,394
Ah. Right.

88
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,149
So there are fewer accidents,
when the rink's nice and smooth?

89
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,276
You bet. That's what makes
this job important.

90
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,611
I'll get going now.

91
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,737
All right, see you.

92
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,242
Hello?

93
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:45,994
Is this Ms. Oh Soryong?

94
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,245
Yeah, this is she.

95
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,039
Listen here, you bitch!

96
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,583
If Hanju goes down,
Korea goes down with it.

97
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,918
Who the hell are you to bitch at them

98
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,879
with your little truth-seeking missions
and shitty press conferences?

99
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,963
If you mess with Hanju...

100
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,882
- Don't yell at me, sir. I'm hanging up.
- What the hell did you say?

101
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,966
You freaking...

102
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,597
All right.

103
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,100
How many of you assholes
want to rip me a new one?

104
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,938
That's right, it's Oh Soryong.
Start cussing.

105
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,231
Sorry?

106
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,025
This is Wi Jongu,
reporter in the News department.

107
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,109
Huh?

108
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,987
News… News department?

109
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,616
I saw your press conference
and thought that I should get in touch.

110
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,788
So you're saying they prevented you
from writing an article on this?

111
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay, so he's looking at his phone.

112
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,751
I'm sure you know
how good cameras have gotten.

113
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,005
Anyway, I zoomed in to see
what he was looking at, and then, uh…

114
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,509
Remember last year's Chanbyeol case?

115
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,219
A five-year-old died of ruptured organs

116
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,762
after his step-dad sexually assaulted him.

117
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:46,847
Yeah.

118
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,349
They were voting
on the Chanbyeol Act, finally…

119
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,185
an act against child abusers
that had been pending a year.

120
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,437
And this asshole doesn't vote,

121
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,356
just looks at a pornographic website.

122
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,817
But I wrote a piece on it
and sent it to the desk.

123
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:02,237
- They killed it immediately.
- And what was their reason?

124
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,656
It was completely ridiculous.

125
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,118
Hanju articles were stopped
after President Koo took over.

126
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,662
Cho Taesu's death rumors,
Hanju's tax evasion,

127
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,539
and Cho Jinman's illegal
election activity,

128
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,748
it's all been blocked.

129
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,085
So then…

130
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,547
why'd you come here to tell me this?

131
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,174
As a news guy,

132
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,468
I'm a little embarrassed
coming to you with this

133
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,597
but it looks like your team
has amassed quite a lot of data.

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,974
So why don't we share all of our findings

135
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,851
and work together from here?

136
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,606
I can't do that.

137
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,482
What?

138
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,151
I'm not at Trigger anymore.

139
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,321
Nope, I can't.

140
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,954
At least, not officially.

141
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,210
{\an8}DAEYONG RETAIL

142
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,284
You're here.

143
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,954
Chief, what's going on?

144
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,126
You got me good.
I thought they'd won you over too.

145
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,046
- I'm a half-decent actor, huh?
- Jeez.

146
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,466
Come on, there's CCTV
and watchful eyes all around the company.

147
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,551
One wrong move could be bad.

148
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,845
So, we'll operate here,
as a rogue guerrilla unit.

149
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,723
It's just us two?

150
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,558
Oh, no. We should call for backup.

151
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,143
Who?

152
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,020
Is Ms. Oh coming?

153
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,648
Uh, she should be here any minute now.

154
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,233
Ah.

155
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,401
There you are.

156
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,946
Ms. Hong.

157
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,865
This better be good.
I'm buried in work.

158
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,868
Ooh, what's with all the pretty lights?

159
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,413
There's too many eyeballs at the studio,

160
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
and the chief's father's
in care right now.

161
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,709
Did you get your dad's permission though?

162
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,502
I'm sure he didn't ask.

163
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,003
Let's hope his dad doesn't smack him.

164
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,214
Hey now, I'm the one
who pays the rent these days.

165
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,550
Also, I can't believe
you're working on something else

166
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,051
with what's going on at Trigger.

167
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,053
What's that?

168
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,389
Did someone bring a plant?

169
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,475
Courtesy of Cho Haewon.

170
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,355
Why do you think Cho Haewon
had this plant sent to us before she died?

171
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,732
Why would she do that?

172
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,116
Could she have written her final words
on the petals, you think?

173
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,493
- Not much room for that.
- Hey, you never know.

174
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,495
Some people write on grains of rice.

175
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,164
Whoa, put that down.

176
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,041
It's okay.
I just want to look at it in the light.

177
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,589
Any words?

178
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,636
Nothing there.

179
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,187
What if we smashed it?

180
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,938
Without knowing if it's evidence or not?

181
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,733
- Well, yeah, that's why we smash it.
- Hmm?

182
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,334
- Hey, what… what is that?
- What is it?

183
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,337
There's the boss lady.

184
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,005
Oh, wow.

185
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,257
Why all these lights?
Didn't you say it closed down?

186
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,843
It was a bit drab in here,
so I turned all the lights on.

187
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,845
Turning up late? Bad look for a host.

188
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,264
Ugh, give me a break.
It's a massive ice rink.

189
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,808
You should see it. I'm dead tired.

190
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,351
You're here.

191
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,356
Is it a remote?

192
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,191
Or a key?

193
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,151
It's something like that, right?

194
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,778
Good thinking.

195
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,321
They're so set in their ways,
they would never think

196
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,949
to smash that thing open
in a million years. Nice work.

197
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,368
Was that some kind of jab
at us 'cause we're old?

198
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,828
- Vaguely offensive.
- Okay.

199
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,830
I think I'm gonna get
a nice stone massage.

200
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,790
Don't be like that.
You're not going anywhere.

201
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,250
We're all here now.

202
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,840
I think I'm built for teamwork.

203
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,136
It's just, um…
seeing the team back together,

204
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,514
it just warms my heart,
it's so nice.

205
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,480
This place though.
Kinda feels like a Trigger knock-off.

206
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,606
I think it's neat.

207
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,692
We'll do it right here.

208
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,875
What could it be?

209
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,920
Ms. Hong, you ever seen
something like that

210
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,672
in a past episode of ours?

211
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,592
I can't check without the case files.

212
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,678
Yeah.

213
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,932
Now that you mention it,

214
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,477
I got all our case files right here.

215
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,896
They've all been digitized.

216
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,856
No way.

217
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,275
Wait, so that's why
you kept asking for those?

218
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,777
I'd say I got great foresight, huh?

219
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,655
Had I done it in the open,
I'm sure Koo would've stopped it.

220
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,823
See that?

221
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,284
And that right there's
why I respect the chief.

222
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,911
You know that, right?

223
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,038
So, you're good for something after all.

224
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,916
You thought I became chief
by getting chummy with the bosses?

225
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,959
Ugh, these cheap chairs
are killing my back.

226
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,879
- Could you please get some better ones?
- Does that mean you're in?

227
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,757
Don't be ridiculous.
I can barely finish my script.

228
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,052
- Jang's a handful, isn't he?
- Why'd you have to mention that asshole?

229
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,553
I'm gonna be sick.

230
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,306
You left Trigger
to buddy up with that jerk-off?

231
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,308
We're not buddies!

232
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,852
- So annoying! Ugh, seriously.
- Ah, that's cold.

233
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,147
So you're playing footsie then?
What do you guys like to call it?

234
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,899
- This is your fault! Your fault, Mr. Han!
- Ugh, cut it out!

235
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,485
I'll get nice seats if you stay.
You're even more irritable since you left.

236
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,736
Just stop talking!

237
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,987
- God!
- Why are you freaking out so much?

238
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,239
CHO HAEWON, CHA SEONGWOOK

239
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,406
CHO JINMAN

240
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,908
Cho Jinman is the only one

241
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,993
who's still alive.

242
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,578
I'll take care of this stuff.

243
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,206
Han Do, try to find
where she hid the sculpture.

244
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,959
Head out to the villa, have a look around.

245
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,169
And Chief, find a cop who can authenticate

246
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,088
the disciplinary action
request form, okay?

247
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,383
Who's gonna find out
about the remote thingy?

248
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,467
"SMART KEY? RECORDER? REMOTE?"

249
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,677
That thing…

250
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,972
could be that Haewon's
just trying to mess with us.

251
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,099
I'll look into what it is.

252
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,309
Don't expect too much though.

253
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,896
Samgyeopsal and soju?
It's been a while since we were together.

254
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,064
That's all.

255
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,148
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,621
Has she gotten even scarier?
What do you think?

257
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,707
She's kinda always like that.

258
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,669
She is a bit more excited than usual.

259
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,921
- Can you give me a ride?
- Where's your car?

260
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,047
Oh, I didn't drive here.

261
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,674
Hey, hey, see that?

262
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,301
Soryong definitely drove here.

263
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,429
Huh… that is a bit scary.

264
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,560
Still cool though.

265
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,938
He's just as scary as she is.

266
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,617
It's about time to go back.

267
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,786
Yeah, that's why I'm taking you home.

268
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,373
No, I meant you going back
to our show as a head writer.

269
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,085
The show just isn't the same
without your scripts, Nahee.

270
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,920
Every gun needs a trigger.

271
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,006
Park Daeyong's still there, isn't he?

272
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,841
Fine.

273
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,136
Whether you go back or not,
it's up to you, Ms. Hong.

274
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,389
But me…

275
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,143
I want your writing
to get the respect it deserves.

276
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,856
That sleazeball, Jang, only sees
your writing as a source of income.

277
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,984
All you care about is your writing.

278
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,570
You love people and their stories.

279
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,990
Whether it's fiction or not,

280
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,952
I just want you to think long and hard
about whatever stories

281
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,621
you want to write
and put out in the world.

282
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,415
That's all I got.

283
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,875
Drop me off here.

284
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,335
I'll take you all the way. I don't mind.

285
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,713
If you plan on going back to Trigger,
I'll stay in the car.

286
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,174
If not, I can just get out he... Whoa!

287
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,510
Man.

288
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,097
So quickly. I'm insulted.

289
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,102
At least help me with this.

290
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,854
A photo Cho Jinman was looking at
while at the National Assembly,

291
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,689
but it's not a normal photo.

292
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,150
It's from a website or app,
something online.

293
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,569
I'd appreciate it if you looked into it.

294
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,654
ASAP, okay?

295
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,034
It's nice to catch up.

296
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,619
Christ.

297
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,707
K-drama's future queen. Fighting!

298
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,127
Are you being sarcastic?

299
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,587
Off you go.

300
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,272
It's been so long.
Why did you take off like that?

301
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,445
It's been so long.
Why'd she take off, huh?

302
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,951
Why'd I send that?

303
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,000
What?
Did you want to talk about something?

304
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,469
I've been watering your plant.
Don't worry about it.

305
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,555
Get home safe.

306
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,056
What the heck?

307
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,704
Here.

308
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,080
Go ahead, take it.

309
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,251
I saw they put you down
for another night shift, Ms. Oh.

310
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,046
This is obviously
blatant harassment, right?

311
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,214
Oh, well…

312
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,424
- they want me out of the company.
- Mm-hmm.

313
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,426
The thing is though,
I'm tenacious, you know?

314
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,346
Can't you see how much
your standards are killing me, Ms. Oh?

315
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,264
Come on, just go back to your old job.

316
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,767
Why, sir? I like this place.

317
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,061
I might just settle here for good.

318
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,021
Oh, gosh. Go right ahead then.

319
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,774
Okay then. I'll see you tomorrow.

320
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,900
Okay, see you.

321
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,739
Yes, Mr. Hwang, did you find anything?

322
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,033
This right here
is a proximity-based tracker.

323
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,284
Huh?

324
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,286
Used by European spies
back in the day.

325
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,412
This thing's a classic.

326
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,083
Seeing this device used today
is actually quite fascinating.

327
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,044
Now, I happen to have a pair
that's similar to this on hand.

328
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,462
Check this out.

329
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,173
This type of equipment is always linked
to a counterpart piece

330
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,758
when it's manufactured.

331
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,220
When their counterparts
are within range like this,

332
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,224
the alarm inside will keep getting
quicker and quicker, like this.

333
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,060
But once you put more distance
between them…

334
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,105
…the alarm sounds a little more like…

335
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,608
It should… it should slow down…

336
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,527
give me a sec.

337
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,696
Uh, I think my office is too small.

338
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,781
I'll go outside
to put more distance between them.

339
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,449
- You keep watching.
- Yeah, okay.

340
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,541
Okay, you heard that, right?

341
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,751
- Yeah.
- And now, you see the lights over here?

342
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,129
The lights are gonna blink
faster and faster

343
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,506
the closer the device
is to its counterpart.

344
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,426
So being able to find them
should be pretty easy.

345
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,261
Ah.

346
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,306
Hey, uh, where's the other part
of that set?

347
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,433
So it's a location tracker.

348
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,520
I have stored this sculpture safely away

349
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,315
in our final destination.

350
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,444
I assure you of that, Ms. Oh Soryong.

351
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,864
She wants us to use it.

352
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,415
According to the confidential
document your father left behind

353
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,500
there were four men
who received disciplinary action

354
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,294
for losing the evidence.

355
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,881
Out of the four, one is dead,
and two are still working for the police.

356
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,717
Kim Gyenam, the ringleader,
is now a police station chief.

357
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,303
The fourth one quit the force
and now works security.

358
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,807
So he shared responsibility.

359
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,270
And the one who took a bribe

360
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,522
and destroyed evidence
became a station chief?

361
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,276
Just be glad he's not chief of police.

362
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,447
By asking the police to verify
the files your father left us,

363
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,158
we'd only be tipping them off
on what our next move would be,

364
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,077
so for now, let's just put that on hold.

365
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,329
You'll fact-check everything.

366
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,085
It wasn't easy to get this.

367
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,379
I had to go through an informant of mine.

368
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,463
"COPS RELATED TO CHA SEONGWOOK"

369
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,723
I don't have complete faith in you yet,

370
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,019
but I'll go along, only 'cause I know
that Soryong does trust you.

371
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,481
Don't mess this up.

372
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,068
I started having faith.

373
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,614
In… in me?

374
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,117
No, in myself.

375
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,138
Been seeing you a lot.

376
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,392
Heard you moved back home.

377
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,687
Did our talks about Dad…

378
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,397
stir up some family love?

379
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,523
You crazy?

380
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,277
It's just till I find something else.

381
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,571
What brings you here?

382
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,410
Remember that prick at the funeral?

383
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,120
Is this the guy?

384
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,500
Did you happen to find anything,

385
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,669
something in your dad's vehicle?

386
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,841
Oh, yeah, that's the guy.

387
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,430
Do these guys look familiar?

388
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,728
This guy.

389
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,522
The others were goofing around, talking.

390
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,524
He was the only one…

391
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,486
not saying much, just drinking.

392
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,987
He should have stayed in narcotics

393
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,989
instead of sticking his nose
where it didn't belong.

394
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,073
God…

395
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,584
Bravo to that Mensa memory of yours.

396
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,294
I'm not used to your compliments.

397
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,588
You've changed lately.

398
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,092
- I'll be going now.
- Hey, Do.

399
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:45,846
About what happened…

400
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,974
to your finger.

401
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,144
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,981
You know how scary our father was.

403
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,651
I was too young to know any better.

404
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,279
I'm sorry.

405
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,700
I'll see you.

406
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:12,873
Oh, and…

407
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,542
we're square now.

408
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,572
Hanju's history
is far more bloodthirsty

409
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,615
twisted and ruthless…

410
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,409
…than you can imagine.

411
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,411
If in the near future…

412
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,747
anything happens to me…

413
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,374
don't believe what they tell you.

414
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,127
'Cause they did it.

415
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,332
If you had…

416
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,627
done it when you had a chance,

417
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,920
I wouldn't…

418
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:42,880
No,

419
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:47,009
our Hanju group would not have had
to suffer such indignities.

420
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,346
That make sense?

421
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,432
Don't you think?

422
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,684
President Koo?

423
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,729
Viewers can't get enough of Oh Soryong.

424
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,231
Did she save the country
in a past life or something?

425
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,775
She's one of a kind, for sure.

426
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:05,778
I've already relieved her of her position.

427
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,947
She'll continue her tenure at an ice rink.

428
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,199
I've done my part, Assemblyman Cho.

429
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,203
The Trigger team is not worth our time now
with Ms. Oh out of the picture.

430
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:19,083
And the entire KNS News Department also...

431
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,295
Then you'd better step up

432
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:25,839
and start flapping
that mouth of yours now.

433
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,677
We've got to take a stance
with an official statement.

434
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,012
We need a plan,
or we need to cover this up

435
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,305
with something else.

436
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:36,016
Isn't this what we hired you for, huh?

437
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:43,315
Listen, I am Koo Hyeongtae,
the president of KNS.

438
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,068
In the manipulation of public opinion,

439
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,155
there's nuance to the process,
this isn't high school AV class.

440
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,492
It's much more involved than that.

441
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,207
You got a lot of nerve, don't you?

442
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,046
You're just a glorified
company mouthpiece.

443
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,590
Do your damn job as the company shill.

444
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:11,427
My father gave you that position.

445
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,761
Do you really think

446
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,596
I can't just take it away?

447
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,728
If this isn't covered up
within three days…

448
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,856
…I guarantee you'll be stepping down.

449
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,282
Serve me an abalone.

450
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,544
So you like abalone, huh?

451
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,547
Every once in a while.

452
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,020
Mr. Kim Yonggyun?

453
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,523
What do you want?

454
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,115
Han Do.

455
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,494
I'm a producer with Trigger at KNS.

456
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,998
You investigated the Cha Seongwook case
20 years ago, didn't you?

457
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,000
I've got some questions
to ask you about it.

458
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,719
I'm the son
of the late Detective Han Donghyeok.

459
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,101
You were at the funeral, weren't you?

460
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,153
Cho Haewon said she confessed
to murdering Cha Seongwook,

461
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,321
but it didn't make a difference.

462
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,616
I thought it was open-and-shut.

463
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,078
We only had a piece of the remains,
but she admitted to doing it.

464
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,539
We thought we'd have a chance

465
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,999
once the forensics team delivered us the…

466
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,127
results we asked for.

467
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,754
But the evidence went missing.

468
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,090
Not only that, but

469
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,802
the very next day a bunch
of Hanju lawyers came in.

470
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,930
Less than 24 hours after our arrest.

471
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,060
They shaped the narrative to a forced
confession from police coercion,

472
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,437
and, well…

473
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,692
Detective, if you had told the truth
to anybody...

474
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,860
If I'd done that…

475
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,196
I would have been killed.

476
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,576
I'd heard that Detective Han

477
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,246
was acting on a drug-related tip
on a conglomerate family.

478
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,331
It was Hanju.

479
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,673
I'm sorry about your father.
I'm partially responsible, after all.

480
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,849
Please make sure
not to show my face,

481
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,767
like we agreed.

482
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,436
Of course.

483
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,273
Thank you for speaking up,
even though it took this long.

484
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,402
By the way,

485
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,365
not sure if this would fit
into your episode, but…

486
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,910
I remember something else.

487
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,583
About when Cho Haewon came in
to the station for questioning.

488
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,002
I don't know if it's because
of the family she grew up in,

489
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,837
but despite her young age,

490
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,380
she was composed for someone

491
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,132
who turned herself in for murder.

492
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,386
Did you visit the victim's home
that day intending to murder him?

493
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,514
- No, I didn't.
- She never lost her cool once

494
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:46,183
during her testimony,

495
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,560
or showed any signs of agitation.

496
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,898
As a violent crimes detective,
I've met my fair share of crazies,

497
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,777
but I had never met a girl
who gave off such a strange energy.

498
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,529
I'll ask you,
how much detail should I go into?

499
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,324
But…
when Hanju came to take her back,

500
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,160
- I don't know, it was strange.
- Let go! Let go!

501
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,080
Let go! I killed him.

502
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,456
I thought she'd be happy
to get away with it

503
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,583
after stabbing us in the back,

504
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,504
but it really felt like she didn't want
to be set free.

505
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,758
She seemed really desperate
to get arrested.

506
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,598
- Lunatic Han!
- Huh?

507
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,476
Weren't you working late tonight?

508
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,812
I changed my shift
to get an update on the case.

509
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,563
Hwang told us to come to get, uh…

510
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,941
A location tracker?

511
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,567
Get in.

512
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,953
Wait, this is Cho Jinman's house.

513
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,454
Wh… why would we come here?

514
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,165
They reached out to us first,
wanting to meet today.

515
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:53,500
What the hell?

516
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:58,088
- Hi, I'm Oh Soryong.
- Please wait just a moment.

517
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,894
What was your grand plan if we hadn't run
into each other out there?

518
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,187
What do you mean?

519
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,064
Were you gonna mount a one-woman siege?

520
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,358
I brought you, didn't I?

521
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,777
You really think I'm that reckless?

522
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,363
You could've said
we were headed into enemy territory

523
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,449
so I could've prepared mentally.

524
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,492
You don't need to worry about anything.

525
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,161
I need you to stay with the car.

526
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,580
You're going alone
into the psycho's house? Are you insane?

527
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,459
I've got a custom-made camera,
courtesy of Mr. Hwang,

528
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,960
and I got a stun gun.

529
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,795
And most importantly,

530
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,881
the location tracker.

531
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,716
Keep the doors locked.

532
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,051
I'm not out in an hour,

533
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,553
you come busting in,
but call the cops first.

534
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,430
Wait.

535
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,474
And what if he catches you filming?
What then?

536
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,644
Then we'll hope my head stays attached.

537
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,229
Lock the doors.

538
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:58,106
Wait, Ms. Oh, wait. Come back. Hey, wait.

539
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,155
Why is she like this?

540
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:26,176
I wanted a place
where we could chat in private.

541
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,637
I thought my house was perfect for that.

542
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:33,558
You killed it at that press conference.

543
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,560
Like Wonder Woman, or something.

544
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,730
I'm guessing that

545
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,566
the press can really get on your nerves.

546
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:45,362
It would be good for you to go ahead
and quit this now while you still can.

547
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,782
Why play the hero
and end up destroying both of us

548
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,408
when you could just…

549
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,202
live and let live?

550
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,788
Hmm?

551
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,626
If you need money,
then by all means, feel free to say so.

552
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,840
You think if money motivated me,

553
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,342
I'd have come this far?

554
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,760
Then how about power?

555
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:12,889
Oh Soryong, paragon of justice,
the final bastion of Korean morals.

556
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,100
You've got a good portfolio, right?

557
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:19,938
Sure, you might be on the outskirts
of the company now, working the ice,

558
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:24,234
although I think having you
as KNS president someday,

559
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,819
would be a nice look.

560
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,113
Do you mean that?

561
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,575
Of course.

562
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,869
I'll give you the push you need.

563
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,913
A really big push, at that.

564
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,877
I think we can both agree
that there's just too many

565
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,129
evil fuckers in this world.

566
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,633
So go out there
and interview all of them if you want to.

567
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,469
Go get 'em all locked up in jail.

568
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,181
You'll do that…

569
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,893
if I stop digging

570
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,896
into Hanju's business?

571
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,399
Give and take, eh?

572
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:10,822
Well, that won't do.

573
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,701
'Cause it's the Hanju group itself,

574
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,120
your safe place,

575
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,207
that I want to investigate.

576
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:23,335
I want to see what that rotten stench
is, more than anything.

577
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,423
If you want to see this all through,

578
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:31,426
go ahead, I'll play along.

579
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,268
You know, my sister loves to…

580
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,479
put on a good show.

581
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:43,563
Crazy attention-seeker.

582
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,400
All that talk about how Hanju
killed her and all that,

583
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,028
it was all just part
of the grand performance.

584
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,905
I was nowhere nearby.

585
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,573
I didn't go near the villa that night.

586
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,120
I'm assuming you don't go there often.

587
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,580
Well, it's a villa.

588
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,335
I do go fishing there
every once in a while.

589
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,838
You think I would've let
my sister stay there

590
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,675
if I'd known that's
why she crawled back to Korea?

591
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,220
I would've gotten her a hotel, at least.

592
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:17,514
Would you mind…

593
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,434
telling me if Koo had any part…

594
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,563
or any knowledge or involvement
in the death of your sister?

595
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:26,690
Stop.

596
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,235
This is beginning
to sound like an interview.

597
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,029
Ms. Oh Soryong,

598
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,531
if you film here…

599
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:38,910
and then proceed to release
any of that footage to the world,

600
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,122
I'll make sure we file both criminal
and civil suits against you.

601
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:45,000
You'll be on the hook
for more than you'll make in a decade.

602
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,003
What are you so afraid of…

603
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:53,383
- Mr. Cho?
- I am an assemblyman!

604
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,313
I don't think you know
what it is to be truly afraid yet,

605
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,481
Ms. Oh Soryong.

606
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,820
Would you like to try it?

607
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,449
Shit.

608
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,993
I thought I'm Wonder Woman.

609
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,162
Nothing scares her.

610
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:26,958
You never had any intention
of striking a deal.

611
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,211
I guess that's it then.

612
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:31,755
Get out.

613
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,675
It appears we are speaking
different languages, Soryong.

614
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,471
One more thing, sir.

615
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,901
This.

616
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,236
Do you remember?

617
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,915
Wasn't my first time in assembly.

618
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,084
The Chanbyeol Act vote was that day.

619
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,752
Look.

620
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,506
You seem really distracted.

621
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,974
Damn golf bag keeps falling over.
What a poor design.

622
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,728
That vote happened so long ago.

623
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,689
It could've been a spam message
or something.

624
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,607
I hardly remember the crap I click on.

625
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,195
Hurry up. Get out.

626
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,697
While I'm being nice.

627
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,490
I know the way.

628
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,826
I'll see myself out.

629
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,430
Going around with her is definitely
my ticket to an early grave.

630
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:32,268
I don't even care anymore.
Just please get out safely.

631
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,323
What the…

632
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,660
Why does he have so many golf bags?

633
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,384
What do you think you're doing?

634
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,309
Hmm.

635
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:26,823
Why?

636
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,701
What exactly are you doing?

637
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,247
I don't remember you
wearing glasses before…

638
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,373
I just…

639
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,293
Your house is just so big, I…

640
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,627
I couldn't find the way out.

641
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,673
That doesn't give you permission
to scare me though.

642
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:56,185
Crazy bitch sure finds her way around.

643
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,400
Are you all right?
You're not hurt, are you?

644
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,320
Man, what took you so long? God…

645
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,115
What about the sculpture? Was it there?

646
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,825
No, it wasn't there.

647
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:13,077
I don't know if he hid it,
but it wasn't out.

648
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,580
Where's the other half to this guy?

649
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,665
It was quiet in there as well.

650
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,877
Ms. Oh?

651
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,840
Oh.

652
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,551
This hand…

653
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,511
she got a bit scared, I guess.

654
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,931
Let's just get out of here.

655
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:49,030
You got lucky.

656
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,533
Thanks to that producer whore,
you'll live another day.

657
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,755
Hey.

658
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,049
Let's return the product.

659
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,429
I don't want to hear that bullshit.

660
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,932
I said I wanted it returned, so do it!

661
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:20,061
You listen to what I tell you,
you asshole!

662
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,236
What are you doing?

663
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,497
I have a golf bag
as a gift for the assemblyman

664
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,832
but forgot all about it.

665
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,916
A golf bag?

666
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,168
But he doesn't play golf though.

667
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,467
I guess I mixed up my assemblymen.

668
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,802
All right, thanks anyway.

670
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,268
So the assemblyman,
who doesn't even play golf,

671
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,520
has this many golf bags?

672
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:08,735
Sometimes you get the truth
even when someone's lying.

673
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,237
I do go fishing there once in a while.

674
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,198
Gosh.

Well, it's a villa.

00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,248
I do go…

678
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,958
…fishing there once in a while.

679
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,462
That face says he's hiding something.

680
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,424
- Wait a minute, look at this.
- Huh?

681
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,470
So this here's the villa,
and all this up here is Hanju property.

- Mm-hmm.
- Look, you don't see anything

on the Korean maps.

684
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,351
But if we look at it on a foreign map
where domestic laws don't apply…

685
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,481
What the hell is that? Water?

686
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,815
A lot of water.

Is it broken?

God. Nothing. Not even over here.

If I got to scour the whole Hanju estate,

Ugh, Giho's charming smile

701
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,837
could've come in handy
for getting information here.

702
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,175
He's probably off sulking alone somewhere.

Oh, that's mine.

704

On top of that…

Godori!

All right now. All right, all right now.

707
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,817
And what's next?
That, that, and that as well…

708
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:58,279
All right then, I'll be taking two cards.

I can't believe
I'm going to be on TV at my age.

710
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,203
By the way,
what were you going to ask us again?

711
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,412
I couldn't help but notice

712
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:10,750
that Hanju place,
it's quite a lot of land, isn't it?

713
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,087
Huh? Oh, we aren't allowed
to talk about that area.

714
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,340
Oh, no, this isn't about Hanju.

715
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,218
We were just wondering if there were any…

716
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,262
any good spots for fishing near that area.

717
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,347
- That's all.
- Yeah.

718
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,058
He must be talking about
that rundown reservoir.

719
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,268
Speak on that, sir.

720
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,771
Ah, that place?

721
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:33,481
Well, I'll tell you…

722
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,610
The government checked
that whole area over there

723
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,195
a long time ago.

724
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,573
They say that the water
in that reservoir is highly toxic.

725
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,116
It's toxic?

726
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,118
And since the water is so dark,

727
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,829
even during the day,
when the sun's out,

728
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,374
it makes no difference,
it still feels like night.

729
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:53,960
Now the locals call the place

730
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,920
Phantom Gate Reservoir.

731
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,172
- Phantom Gate Reservoir.
- Sounds scary.

732
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:00,591
The water there is deeper than it looks.

733
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,386
But why wouldn't Hanju
do something about it

734
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,221
if it's so scary?

735
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,847
Exactly.

736
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:08,099
Who knows?

737
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,394
We never went back
over there after that,

738
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,688
so none of us would know.

739
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,398
Hanju's great.

740
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:19,777
They're the ones who, uh,
who created this senior center for us.

741
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,405
Ah, so Hanju built this place too then?

742
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,033
Oh.

743
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,578
This so-called Phantom Gate Reservoir
This so-called Phantom Gate Reservoir

744
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,580
isn't even a registered facility.

745
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:34,500
There are no records of water tests
showing toxicity, either.

746
00:46:35,084 --> 00:46:36,460
City Hall said the same thing.

747
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,088
That is suspicious.

748
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,049
Cho Jinman's been up to something too.

749
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,051
I saw a building crew
headed towards the villa.

750
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,638
We may need more than just us two.

751
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:48,723
Right?

752
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,224
Get Giho for me.

753
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,643
Yes, ma'am.

754
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,729
Thank you.

755
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,273
I am Ms. Oh's right-hand man.

756
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,900
Hey, Ms. Oh needs to borrow your drone.

757
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,111
This?

758
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,404
It's kind of expensive.

759
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,572
Why does she need it?

760
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,865
Uh, well…

761
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,868
How do we know
they're not recording us over there?

762
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,911
Normally, Koo's much more on top
of things going on here.

763
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,496
Exactly, that's why I think

764
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,166
he's watching us right now
through that thing.

766
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,839
- This thing's expensive, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

767
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,176
"AND KOO HYEONGTAE?"

00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,391
Producers!

769
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,311
Apparently, our news outlet's
covering Cho Haewon today.

770
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,645
- What?
- It has been revealed

771
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,648
that Cho Haewon,
the daughter of the Hanju Group Family,

772
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,069
had been suffering from
a psychiatric illness for a long time.

773
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,738
Our very own Lee Jinhyeong
brings you the story.

774
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,658
Our team received medical
records revealing that for over 20 years

775
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,536
Ms. Cho had been suffering
from bipolar disorder.

776
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,663
Frequently showing multiple symptoms

777
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,208
- such as pathological lying…
- That's Koo Hyeongtae's handiwork.

778
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,502
Don't shoot the message,
shoot the messenger.

779
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,129
Doing things old school.

780
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,382
The more he tries to cover it up,

781
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,842
the worse the stench gets.

782
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:07,927
"HANJU LAND DISPLAYS IN

783

You're going in?
You know how dangerous that is?

784
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,306
Now they're saying
she had a psychiatric illness.

785
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,684
We got to do all we can
'cause now they're hitting below the belt.

786
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,812
- You got it?
- Ms. Oh, how'd you think

787
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,814
to fly a drone over the estate, anyway?

788
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898
Someone once told me

789
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,275
about their 21st-century
approach to things.

I got a drone license, you know.

792
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:29,698
Are you kidding me?

793
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,325
What is this? A drama shoot or something?

794
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,869
- We can't play with toys, you guys.
- Hey.

795
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,123
A producer's got to see everything
to uncover the real truth.

796
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,999
This is Hanju here.

797
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,545
They've already destroyed
the best evidence,

798
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,505
and they're great at media warfare.

799
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,132
You sure everything's ready?

800
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,676
Come on, Chief,
don't chicken out over this.

801
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,386
- We've handled worse...
- Okay, enough.

802
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:53,097
All right.

803
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,890
We depart tomorrow

804
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:56,517
at 5:00 a.m.

805
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,876
NO TRESPASSING

806
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,013
Hmm. Are you all set?

807
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,306
- Just give me a sec.
- Okay.

808
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,106
- If you're ready, let's go.
- All right. Let's do it.

809
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,526
Hakuna matata.

810
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,905
It's time to put
your 21st-century method to the test.

811
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,063
That window.
Try to move up to that window.

812
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,029
Uh…

813
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,823
- Inside. Let's go in as far as we can.
- What the heck?

814
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:43,082
Everything got burned to a crisp.

815
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,583
All right, turn around.

816
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,126
Go towards their burial plot.

817
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,065
- No signal from there?
- No.

818
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,277
All right.

819
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,529
Now put us over the reservoir.

820
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,210
I searched every media outlet
and only found one article

821
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,588
on the toxicity
of the Phantom Gate Reservoir.

822
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,464
All other references to the toxic water

823
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:35,217
either directly quoting that article
or referenced it.

824
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,678
But that could mean
that Hanju spread a fake story

825
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,722
about toxic water to make it seem real.

826
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,057
Isn't it more often the other way around?

827
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,560
They must have a reason
to keep people out.

828
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,979
Make sure no one developed
any interest in it.

829
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,064
Nothing obvious is sticking out.

830
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:53,902
I'll try to move down a little
to see if the tracker responds.

831
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,878
You're sure
it was episode 1551, right?

832
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,130
Like I said, yes.

833
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,341
Is this something important?

834
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,428
I've been going over and over the photo
of Cho Jinman that Ms. Oh sent.

835
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,474
I thought I recognized it.

836
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:25,559
Then it clicked.

837
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,357
I was looking into the dark web
and I came across a site

838
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,984
that kidnapped and sold girls to VIPs.

839
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,362
"Virgin Slave," it was called.

840
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:42,534
There's got to be dirt hidden somewhere
among all these case files.

841
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,081
- Ugh, come on, move over a little.
- Ah…

842
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,165
Ugh, jeez…

843
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,594
Couldn't he just say that…

844
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,473
he wasn't aware of what he did
and clicked on something on accident?

845
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,557
No, he can't.

846
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:08,102
You're not able to see
anything on this website

847
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,229
unless you have an account activated.

848
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:14,775
The fact that he's looking at a photo
is proof he's got an account

849
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,735
and that he was logged in to it.

850
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,987
Ugh, what an asshole.

851
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,828
This is one hell of a comeback, Ms. Hong.

852
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,165
I'll let Ms. Oh know right away.

853
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:35,587
That's as far as it'll go.

854
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:37,715
I'm turning around.

855
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,434
They found out where the photo
Cho Jinman was looking at came from.

856
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:50,144
I spotted something.

857
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:04,867
Oh, my God.

858
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,328
We finally found it.

859
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:11,290
So, it must be somewhere underwater.

860
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,169
We can't get anywhere near it
on foot though.

861
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,254
What do we do?

862
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:20,048
- We swim, of course.
- Right.

863
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,133
Huh?

864
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,850
Out of the question! No way, come on!

865
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,227
You didn't hear
the old man say the water's dangerous?

866
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,855
- You know how risky that is?
- Hey, we all knew that was a story

867
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,774
they made up just to keep
people away from there.

868
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,277
Han Do's actually
got a point for once, you know?

869
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,029
We've had some incredibly
close shaves together,

870
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,072
but this one takes the cake, Ms. Oh.

871
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,240
I won't allow it.

872
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,408
No! Over my dead body!

873
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,118
It's not like I'm gonna die.

874
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,454
Come on! You're being so dramatic.

875
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,372
First the parachute and now this?

876
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,333
How can you be so damn irresponsible?

877
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,417
Irresponsible?

878
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:58,295
I've been scuba certified
for eight years now.

879
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,131
So stop worrying
when I haven't even done anything yet.

880
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,301
You're just so stubborn.
There's no getting through to you.

881
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:07,054
I can't believe
you didn't check your tank.

882
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,181
Are you sure you're certified?

883
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,390
I know it's low.

884
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,768
I was filming the algal bloom
in the Nakdong River.

885
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,561
Used up all of the air.

886
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,648
- I forgot to fill it back up.
- Were you alone on that one too?

887
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,274
I had no choice.
The guy I hired was late,

888
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,567
and I was out of time.

889
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:21,902
Wow.

890
00:55:24,196 --> 00:55:25,781
How long will this tank last you?

891
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,075
Around, um…

892
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,202
- 15 min...
- How long, exactly?

893
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,706
10 minutes?

894
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,500
Don't worry, come on.

895
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,168
I'll be out before then.

896
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,003
I'm the woman who soared through the air.

897
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,421
I'm gonna fly through the water too.

898
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:43,590
10 minutes, okay?

899
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,134
10 minutes.

900
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:55,185
Seriously, please don't push it.

901
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,397
Relax as much as you can
to conserve air, okay?

902
00:55:58,981 --> 00:55:59,982
Okay.

903
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,490
Oh, Jesus.

904
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,800
They couldn't really have poisoned
the water, right?
