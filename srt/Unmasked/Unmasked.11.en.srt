[reporter 3] Who was Ms. Cho referring
to when she mentioned, "their doing"?

on that recording of your sister?

[reporter 3] What are your thoughts on
the allegations that the Trigger producers

are being pressured by an external force?

Gosh, uh… you're all doing great work.

the Chanbyeol Act.

We expected that
it would be shot down anyway.

28

Hanju owns over 800 acres

from writing an article on this?

00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,868
Ooh, what's with all the pretty lights?

175
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,413
There's too many eyeballs at the studio,

176
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
and the chief's father's
in care right now.

177
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,709
Did you get your dad's permission though?

178
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,502
I'm sure he didn't ask.

179
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,003
Let's hope his dad doesn't smack him.

180
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,214
Hey now, I'm the one
who pays the rent these days.

181
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,550
Also, I can't believe
you're working on something else

182
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,051
with what's going on at Trigger.

183
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,053
[scoffs] What's that?

184
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,389
[Ms. Hong] Did someone bring a plant?

185
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,475
Courtesy of Cho Haewon.

186
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,355
[Daeyong] Why do you think Cho Haewon
had this plant sent to us before she died?

187
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,732
Why would she do that?

188
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,570
[♪ pensive music playing]

189
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,116
Could she have written her final words
on the petals, you think?

190
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,493
-Not much room for that.
-Hey, you never know.

191
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,495
Some people write on grains of rice.

192
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,164
Whoa, put that down.

193
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,041
It's okay.
I just want to look at it in the light.

194
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,589
Any words?

195
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,636
Nothing there.

196
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,015
[sighs]

197
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,187
What if we smashed it?

198
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,938
Without knowing if it's evidence or not?

199
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:26,733
-Well, yeah, that's why we smash it.
-Hmm?

-[Soryong] What is it?

202
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,337
There's the boss lady.

203
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,005
Oh, wow.

204
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,257
Why all these lights?
Didn't you say it closed down?

205
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,843
It was a bit drab in here,
so I turned all the lights on.

206
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,845
Turning up late? Bad look for a host.

207
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,264
Ugh, give me a break.
It's a massive ice rink.

You should see it. I'm dead tired.

You're here.

210
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,356
Is it a remote?

211
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,191
Or a key?

212
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,151
[Soryong] It's something like that, right?

213
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,778
Good thinking.

214
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,321
They're so set in their ways,
they would never think

215
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,949
to smash that thing open
in a million years. Nice work.

216
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,368
Was that some kind of jab
at us 'cause we're old?

217
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,828
-Vaguely offensive.
-Okay.

218
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,830
I think I'm gonna get
a nice stone massage.

219

Don't be like that.
You're not going anywhere.

It's just, um…
seeing the team back together,

224

it just warms my heart,
it's so nice. [chuckles]

225
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,480
This place though.
Kinda feels like a Trigger knock-off.

I think it's neat.

227

What could it be?

232

Ms. Hong, you ever seen
something like that

233
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,672
in a past episode of ours?

234
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,592
I can't check without the case files.

235
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,678
[chuckles] Yeah.

236
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:22,932
[Daeyong] Now that you mention it,

237
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,477
I got all our case files right here.

238
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,896
They've all been digitized.

239
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,856
-[Ms. Hong] No way.
-[clears throat, chuckles]

240
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,275
Wait, so that's why
you kept asking for those?

241
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,777
I'd say I got great foresight, huh?

242
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,655
Had I done it in the open,
I'm sure Koo would've stopped it.

243
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:38,823
See that?

244
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,284
And that right there's
why I respect the chief.

245
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,911
You know that, right?

246
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,038
So, you're good for something after all.

247
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,916
You thought I became chief
by getting chummy with the bosses?

248
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,959
Ugh, these cheap chairs
are killing my back.

I'm gonna be sick.

253
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,306
You left Trigger
to buddy up with that jerk-off?

254

[angrily] We're not buddies!

255

You're even more irritable since you left.

just trying to mess with us.

Don't expect too much though.

to get the respect it deserves.

your writing as a source of income.

[employee] Here.

346
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,080
Go ahead, take it.

00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,165
[employee chuckles]

348
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,251
I saw they put you down
for another night shift, Ms. Oh.

349
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,046
This is obviously
blatant harassment, right?

350
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,214
Oh, well…

351
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,424
-they want me out of the company.
-Mm-hmm.

352
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,426
The thing is though,
I'm tenacious, you know?

353
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,346
Can't you see how much
your standards are killing me, Ms. Oh?

354
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,264
Come on, just go back to your old job.

355
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,767
Why, sir? I like this place.

356
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,061
-I might just settle here for good.
-[laughs]

357
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,021
-[phone vibrating]
-Oh, gosh. Go right ahead then.

358
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,774
Okay then. I'll see you tomorrow.

359
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,900
Okay, see you.

-[vibrating continues]

361
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,739
Yes, Mr. Hwang, did you find anything?

362
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,033
This right here
is a proximity-based tracker.

363
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,284
Huh?

364
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,286
[Mr. Hwang] Used by European spies
back in the day.

365
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,412
This thing's a classic.

366
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:22,083
Seeing this device used today
is actually quite fascinating.

367
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,044
Now, I happen to have a pair
that's similar to this on hand.

368
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,462
[Mr. Hwang] Check this out.

369
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,173
This type of equipment is always linked
to a counterpart piece

370
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,758
when it's manufactured.

371
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,220
When their counterparts
are within range like this,

372
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,224
the alarm inside will keep getting
quicker and quicker, like this.

373
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,060
But once you put more distance
between them…

374
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,105
-[beeping]

376
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,608
It should… it should slow down…

377
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,527
give me a sec.

378
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,696
Uh, I think my office is too small.

379
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,781
I'll go outside
to put more distance between them.

380
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,449
-You keep watching.
-[Soryong] Yeah, okay.

381
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,704
[beeping weakens]

382
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,541
Okay, you heard that, right?

383
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,751
-Yeah.
-And now, you see the lights over here?

384
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,129
The lights are gonna blink
faster and faster

385
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,506
the closer the device
is to its counterpart.

386
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,426
So being able to find them
should be pretty easy.

387
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,261
[Soryong] Ah.

388
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,306
Hey, uh, where's the other part
of that set?

389
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,433
So it's a location tracker.

390
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:24,520
I have stored this sculpture safely away

391
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,315
in our final destination.

392
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,444
I assure you of that, Ms. Oh Soryong.

393
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,864
She wants us to use it.

394
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,949
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

395
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:44,415
[Daeyong] According to the confidential
document your father left behind

396
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,500
there were four men
who received disciplinary action

397
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,294
for losing the evidence.

398
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,881
Out of the four, one is dead,
and two are still working for the police.

399
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,717
Kim Gyenam, the ringleader,
is now a police station chief.

400
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,303
The fourth one quit the force
and now works security.

401
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,807
So he shared responsibility.

402
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,270
And the one who took a bribe

403
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,522
and destroyed evidence
became a station chief?

404
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,276
Just be glad he's not chief of police.

405
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,447
By asking the police to verify
the files your father left us,

406
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,158
we'd only be tipping them off
on what our next move would be,

407
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,077
so for now, let's just put that on hold.

408
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,329
You'll fact-check everything.

409
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,085
It wasn't easy to get this.

410
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,379
I had to go through an informant of mine.

411
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,463
"Cops related to Cha Seongwook"

412
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,723
I don't have complete faith in you yet,

413
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,019
but I'll go along, only 'cause I know
that Soryong does trust you.

414
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,481
Don't mess this up.

415
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,068
I started having faith.

416
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,614
In… in me?

417
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,117
No, in myself.

stir up some family love?

424
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,523
You crazy?

425
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,277
It's just till I find something else.

426

What brings you here?

427
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,410
Remember that prick at the funeral?

428
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,120
Is this the guy?

429
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:51,500
[Gyenam] Did you happen to find anything,

430
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,669

431
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,841

The others were goofing around, talking.

436
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,524
He was the only one…

437
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,486
not saying much, just drinking.

438
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:19,987

He should have stayed in narcotics

where it didn't belong.

[Han Do] I'm the son
of the late Detective Han Donghyeok.

[♪ tense music playing]

522
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,101
You were at the funeral, weren't you?

523
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,153
Cho Haewon said she confessed
to murdering Cha Seongwook,

524
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:54,321
but it didn't make a difference.

525
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,616
I thought it was open-and-shut.

526
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,078
We only had a piece of the remains,
but she admitted to doing it.

527
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,539
We thought we'd have a chance

528
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,999
once the forensics team delivered us the…

529
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,127
results we asked for.

530
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,754
But the evidence went missing.

531
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,090
Not only that, but

532
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,802
the very next day a bunch
of Hanju lawyers came in.

533
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,930
Less than 24 hours after our arrest.

534
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:25,060
They shaped the narrative to a forced
confession from police coercion,

535
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,437
and, well…

536
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,692
Detective, if you had told the truth
to anybody--

537
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,860
If I'd done that…

538
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,196
I would have been killed.

539
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:40,576
-[breathes deeply]
-[Yonggyun] I'd heard that Detective Han

540
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,246
was acting on a drug-related tip
on a conglomerate family.

541
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,331
It was Hanju.

542
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,673
I'm sorry about your father.
I'm partially responsible, after all.

[Yonggyun] Please make sure
not to show my face,

545
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,767
like we agreed.

546
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,436
Of course.

547
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,273
Thank you for speaking up,
even though it took this long.

548
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,402
[Yonggyun] By the way,

549
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,365
not sure if this would fit
into your episode, but…

550
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,910
I remember something else.

551
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,583
About when Cho Haewon came in
to the station for questioning.

552
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:32,002
[Yonggyun] I don't know if it's because
of the family she grew up in,

553
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,837
but despite her young age,

554
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,380
she was composed for someone

555
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,132
who turned herself in for murder.

556
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,386
[Gyenam] Did you visit the victim's home
that day intending to murder him?

557
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,514
-No, I didn't.
-[Yonggyun] She never lost her cool once

558

during her testimony,

559
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,560
or showed any signs of agitation.

560
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:52,898
As a violent crimes detective,
I've met my fair share of crazies,

561
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,777
but I had never met a girl
who gave off such a strange energy.

562
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,529
I'll ask you,
how much detail should I go into?

563
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:02,324
[Yonggyun] But…
when Hanju came to take her back,

564
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,160
-I don't know, it was strange.
-Let go! Let go!

565
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,080
[Haewon] Let go! I killed him.

566
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,456
[Yonggyun] I thought she'd be happy
to get away with it

567
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,583
after stabbing us in the back,

568
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,504
but it really felt like she didn't want
to be set free.

569
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,758
She seemed really desperate
to get arrested.

Weren't you working late tonight?

573
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,812
I changed my shift
to get an update on the case.

574
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,563
Hwang told us to come to get, uh…

575
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,941

576
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,567
Get in.

Wh… why would we come here?

580
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,165

wanting to meet today.

What was your grand plan if we hadn't run
into each other out there?

What do you mean?

586
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,064
Were you gonna mount a one-woman siege?

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,358
I brought you, didn't I?

You could've said
we were headed into enemy territory

so I could've prepared mentally.

You don't need to worry about anything.

I need you to stay with the car.

You're going alone
into the psycho's house? Are you insane?

I've got a custom-made camera,
courtesy of Mr. Hwang,

595
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,960

And what if he catches you filming?
What then?

the press can really get on your nerves.

and quit this now while you still can.

You've got a good portfolio, right?

Sure, you might be on the outskirts
of the company now, working the ice,

as KNS president someday,

A really big push, at that.

00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,915
Wasn't my first time in assembly.

693
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,084
The Chanbyeol Act vote was that day.

694
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:10,752
Look.

695
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,506
You seem really distracted.

Damn golf bag keeps falling over.
What a poor design.

699
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,728
That vote happened so long ago.

700
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,689
It could've been a spam message
or something.

701
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,607

Going around with her is definitely
my ticket to an early grave. [sighs]

I don't even care anymore.
Just please get out safely.

You're not hurt, are you?

What about the sculpture? Was it there?

737

No, it wasn't there.

I don't know if he hid it,
but it wasn't out.

00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:39,497
I have a golf bag
as a gift for the assemblyman

759
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,832
but forgot all about it.

760
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,916

761
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,168
But he doesn't play golf though.

has this many golf bags?

Sometimes you get the truth
even when someone's lying.

that whole area over there

823
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:42,573
They say that the water
in that reservoir is highly toxic.

00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,116
It's toxic?

825
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,118
[elder 2] And since the water is so dark,

826
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,829

when the sun's out,

The water there is deeper than it looks.

832
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,386
But why wouldn't Hanju
do something about it

833
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,221
if it's so scary?

00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,847
Exactly.

00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,394
We never went back
over there after that,

837
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,688
so none of us would know.

839
00:46:15,982 --> 00:46:19,777
They're the ones who, uh,
who created this senior center for us.

840
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:22,405
Ah, so Hanju built this place too then?

841
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,033
Oh.

[Jiyun] This so-called

There are no records of water tests
showing toxicity, either.

headed towards the villa.

Right?

00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,224
Get Giho for me.

00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,643
Yes, ma'am.

00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,865
Uh, well…

860
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,868
How do we know
they're not recording us over there?

861
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,911
Normally, Koo's much more on top
of things going on here.

862
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,496
Exactly, that's why I think

863
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:15,166
he's watching us right now
through that thing.

864
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,420
"Is she going after Hanju?"

865
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,839
-This thing's expensive, okay?
-Mm-hmm.

866
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,176

869
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,311
Apparently, our news outlet's
covering Cho Haewon today.

870
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,645
-What?
-[reporter] It has been revealed

871
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:39,648
that Cho Haewon,
the daughter of the Hanju Group Family,

872
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,069
had been suffering from
a psychiatric illness for a long time.

873
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,738
Our very own Lee Jinhyeong
brings you the story.

874
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,658
[Jinhyeong] Our team received medical
records revealing that for over 20 years

875
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,536
Ms. Cho had been suffering
from bipolar disorder.

876
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,663
Frequently showing multiple symptoms

877
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,208
-such as pathological lying…
-That's Koo Hyeongtae's handiwork.

878

Don't shoot the message,
shoot the messenger.

You know how dangerous that is?

884
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,306
Now they're saying
she had a psychiatric illness.

885

'cause now they're hitting below the belt.

888
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,898

This is Hanju here.

They've already destroyed

934
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,210
[Giho] I searched every media outlet
and only found one article

935
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,588
on the toxicity
of the Phantom Gate Reservoir.

All other references to the toxic water

937
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:35,217
either directly quoting that article
or referenced it.

938
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,678
But that could mean
that Hanju spread a fake story

939
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,722
about toxic water to make it seem real.

940
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,057
Isn't it more often the other way around?

941
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,560
They must have a reason
to keep people out.

942
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,979
Make sure no one developed
any interest in it.

it was episode 1551, right?

unless you have an account activated.

The fact that he's looking at a photo
is proof he's got an account

964
