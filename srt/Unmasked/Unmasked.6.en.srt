EP06: DREAMING OF LOVE

2
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,793
GR E&C

3
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,008
As per this warrant
issued on March 13th, 2024,

4
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,260
we'll proceed with the search and seizure
of the GR E&C building.

5
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,720
Please everyone,
move aside.

6
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,407
How you doing?

7
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,201
You and Heo Geumran.

8
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,328
Man, you really ran laps around her.

9
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,373
Back when I worked there,
they wouldn't budge on GR articles

10
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,874
no matter how many I wrote.

11
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,377
But you air one episode, and boom,
immediate search and seizure.

12
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,295
You're Mr. Hwang from the Hanju Daily?

13
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,380
Yeah.

14
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,173
Well, you know me.
I'm good at what I do.

15
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,425
Let's get going. We have somewhere to be.

16
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,637
Actually, the GR episode?

17
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,472
I did that.

18
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,057
You did… You? You?

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,935
Okay, um…
I'll… I'll call you, Soryong.

20
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,270
I'll be… I'll be in touch.

21
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,357
Hold on, wait. H-Hang on. Wait!

22
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,192
Listen.

23
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:32,902
Keep your cool.

24
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,697
It's game over
if we lose our composure in there.

25
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,157
I've got a brilliant legal mind though,

26
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,284
and I'll make sure it all goes smoothly.

27
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,035
So why don't you two just, uh,

28
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,745
sit still and look scary?

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,955
Not true!

30
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,250
It's already a clearly established fact
that GR lobbied them!

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,170
I was just calling the whistleblower's
credibility into question.

32
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,505
Remember that this man's a known thief.

33
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,800
You think it's ethical to make a criminal
your key witness in an episode?

34
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,052
Come on! It wasn't solely his claims!

35
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,137
You're laughing?

36
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,597
Our analysis shows they cut the part

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,307
where he stole the 100 million
and that's all!

38
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,684
And the rest of the footage
wasn't tampered with at all.

39
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,936
God! Why am I repeating myself?

40
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,062
- I should be talking to someone…
- Mr. Yeo.

41
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,481
-…who actually listens to what I'm saying!
-Mr. Yeo. Mr. Yeo?

42
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,150
-Mr. Yeo Yuncheol.
-What?

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,575
The issue here…

44
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,704
is that GR illegally bypassed
the Serious Accidents Punishment Act,

45
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,789
resulting in many deaths
that were downplayed

46
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,082
or swept under the rug.

47
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,459
That was the episode's main focus.

48
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,877
As for the driver's footage,

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,087
it was aired briefly
at the end of the show.

50
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:37,008
We've confirmed through analysis
that it contains no erroneous claims.

51
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,551
How many times have I said this?

52
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,223
10 times, including just now.

53
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,683
It would have been better
if your bases were covered

54
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,393
before you went to air.

55
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,312
You knew you were pushing it, didn't you?

56
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,358
If you want to focus on the fact
that our whistleblower embezzled money,

57
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,984
we'd be more than happy to air a rebuttal.

58
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,654
How many times… have we told him that?

59
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:03,409
You seem unwilling to negotiate,
so let's settle this in court.

60
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,372
Let's do that.

61
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,666
You are aware…

62
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,460
that we've been flooded
with tips about GR since we aired?

63
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,087
We've learned
that on the day of the accident,

64
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,756
you tried paying off the victim's family
with 200 million.

65
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,549
You sent a certified letter right away.

66
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,552
-Uh…
-Oh, and how is that ocean-view apartment

67
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,471
you're building
on the Gyeongsangnam-do coast?

68
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,723
Is it safe?
We might pay it a visit next week.

69
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,685
Let's settle this in court…
and keep our show out of it?

70
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,186
-How does that sound?
-Uh…

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
I'm sure our legal team
will take care of all that.

72
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,565
As for us, we'll be airing our show
without any issues.

73
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,817
- Uh, we'll be--
- Let's go.

74
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,068
Uh…

75
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,321
Um… uh…

76
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,699
Ms. Oh? M-Ms. Oh, I…

77
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,203
All right, my client's spoken,
so we'll see you in court.

78
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,288
Thank you.

79
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,251
Okay.

80
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,713
Are you really doing
a follow-up episode for the GR story?

81
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,925
There's no point in exhausting myself
before the results are out.

82
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,302
We'll see how it goes.

83
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,429
Picture Flower Kindergarten?

84
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,472
Did you leave it out 'cause of me?

85
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,269
Well, use it if needed for the follow-up.

86
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,979
As a family rep, I'll allow it.

87
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,441
I'll respectfully decline
your offer to produce it,

88
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,818
since I've got
plenty of other stories to cover.

89
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,322
If you've got so many other stories,
then why are our ratings tanking?

90
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:25,700
That's because viewers aren't interested
in corporate corruption

91
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,036
and, you know,
abuse of workers' rights and stuff.

92
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,121
Haven't you seen the data?

93
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:34,334
My episode rated
a whopping 1% higher than the average.

94
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,587
Ms. Hong has a point though.
We aren't running a charity here.

95
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,131
-Well, it's not my money.
-Wow, so kind of you.

96
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,178
We're public broadcasting,
who else covers this kind of story?

97
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,513
Forget it.

98
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,893
The door is open.

99
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,479
Wait up!

100
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,152
-What the heck?
-What?

101
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,738
-Just now.
-What?

102
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,615
I mean… the way you keep…

103
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,867
-keep elbowing me, what is that?
-I did?

104
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,914
I asked you to warn me before doing that.

105
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,544
Congrats returning from the underworld!

106
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,632
You always wear that
when you go into the Commission.

107
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,841
I'll take you to an outlet

108
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,635
-for something nicer.
-Move, you're in my seat.

109
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,389
Well, at least put a chair in here.

110
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,224
I'm the chief producer here, aren't I?

111
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,601
- Want me to order one online?
- Mm-hmm.

112
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,061
-One with plenty of padding.
-Yes, sir!

113
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,604
And who are you?

114
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,315
She's the junior writer we just hired.
Such a sweet girl.

115
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,735
I'm Park Jinmi.
But call me "Pretty Jasmine."

116
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,320
I'll give this all I've got.

117
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,280
-Ah…
-Have some coffee.

118
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,949
Oh, I don't use single-use items.

119
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,742
I'll make sure to bring you
a real mug next time.

120
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,536
Man, oh man, look at her go.

121
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,788
Chair with padding coming right up.

122
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,123
Great. I just love it. Yep.

123
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,502
Judging by her energy level…
I think she'll last at least a week.

124
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,921
Where's Ms. Hong?

125
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,673
I've been meaning to ask you about that.

126
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,508
No idea. She didn't tell me anything.

127
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,760
I mean, her mother's
the only family she's got.

128
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,387
I hope nothing's wrong.

129
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,184
Hmm… Some good that hospital stay did.
You still have a fever.

130
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,894
I feel okay.

131
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,729
Mom, you should go back to work.

132
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,648
Hey. No mother in her right mind

133
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,443
would leave her kid at home
with a raging fever.

134
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:27,738
You'll know how it feels
when you're old enough to work.

135
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,533
I swear I'm okay, though.
Plus, Grandma's coming.

136
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,911
I know your grandma's coming,
but your mom is your mom.

137
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,247
So I'm gonna stay
right by your side today.

138
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,584
I know… our family is not
the most traditional set-up,

139
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,836
but if we three girls stick by each other,

140
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,796
I know that we can get through
anything at all.

141
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,423
And don't you forget it. Got that?

142
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,383
Here we go again.

143
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,476
The Camellias is a short story
about two teens…

144
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,561
in love.

145
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,771
First, let's outline
some of the key themes…

146
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,238
Ms. Nam…

147
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,949
I'm sorry.
I was somewhere else.

148
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,535
- I'm sorry about that.
- Here's some coffee.

149
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,828
Thank you.

150
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,668
Is this because of…
the letter you got in the mail?

151
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,214
-Yeah.
-And that's why you're here late,

152
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,381
I'm guessing?

153
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,510
I went for an early morning swim today,

154
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,763
-and came back to a slashed tire.
-Hmm?

155
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,849
I took my car to the body shop
and they said someone did it on purpose.

156
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,644
Ms. Nam…

157
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,270
…you should go to the police, okay?

158
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,440
Let's go some place nice for lunch?

159
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,609
Come on.

160
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,653
Hmm… where do you wanna go?

161
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,989
{\an8}MIRAE GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

162
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,288
WITH LOVE
TO MS. NAM GAYEON

163
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,130
I REPENT FOR THE SINS I HAVE COMMITTED

164
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,507
LORD, FORGIVE THE DEVIL IN ME…

165
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,886
Ms. Nam.

166
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,931
- What is that?
- Oh, uh, it's nothing.

167
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:19,809
Hey.

168
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,105
-Hey, why don't I walk you out?
-Oh, um…

169
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,148
Sorry, I have an appointment to get to.

170
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,775
I'll see you tomorrow.

171
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,486
Ms. Nam, hang on.

172
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,827
I'LL KILL YOU

173
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,750
To be clear, he was put in jail
with a life sentence 10 years ago,

174
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,211
and you're saying
you got this letter out of the blue

175
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,464
and you think he might be behind it.
Is that right?

176
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,842
Yes.

177
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,678
So, when you send
a letter out from prison,

178
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,680
it's impossible to send it
without a return address.

179
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,891
And they screen
all the inmates' correspondences.

180
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,686
I understand why you're nervous
about this, but why don't we--

181
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,271
Uh, no, I…

182
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,691
I brought up an incident earlier,
about how my tire was slashed.

183
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,318
I spoke to a mechanic
who told me that it had--

184
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,195
Then you should look at the CCTV footage
to find the perpetrator.

185
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,114
Huh?

186
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,450
If your man had broken out,
it would be all over the news.

187
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,078
You said he was in prison.
It's not like this guy has superpowers.

188
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,581
I doubt he would be able
to scale the prison walls…

189
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:30,004
I'm telling you,
I saw him at the pool!

190
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:32,256
I… hear it…

191
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,925
That song.

192
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,935
I'm sorry to bother you.

193
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,729
Uh, ma'am, just…

194
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,733
Gosh…

195
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,111
CHA SEONGWOOK LIVES

196
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,805
Oh, hi. Good evening, sir!

197
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,228
So, uh…

198
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,189
Thank you, sir.
If you can use this for now.

199
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,440
I'll return this as soon as I can.

200
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm not sure
if anything useful got recorded.

201
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,529
-No need to worry about that.
-Huh.

202
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,947
-Thank you, sir. Have a good night.
-You too.

203
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:18,821
♪ Was it the look in your eyes? ♪

204
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,786
♪ Or was I just imagining it? ♪

205
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,543
Happy now, Ms. Nam?

206
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,109
Help! Oh, God, somebody help!

207
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,487
Help me!

208
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,222
Yes, Ms. Hong?

209
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,859
Ms. Nam, you okay?

210
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,328
Ms. Hong?

211
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,166
Oh, my name's…

212
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,461
Oh Soryong.
I came here after Ms. Hong notified me.

213
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,716
First off, let's get you in the car.

214
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,934
Ah…

215
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,455
Thank you, Soryong.

216
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,209
I'm so sorry.

217
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,586
Don't be.

218
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,213
I'm just so relieved
that you haven't forgotten my number.

219
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,635
Mr. Han!

220
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,971
Ah, jeez…

221
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,433
What's with the honking?

222
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,351
You call that turning?

223
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,563
If you're gonna keep driving badly,
at least switch to an EV.

224
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,815
Not even your boss drives a car like this.

225
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,900
I've told you a million times

226
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,943
that this heap of junk
belonged to my dad, okay?

227
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,320
You joining us, chief?

228
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,405
What do you mean? Another emergency?

229
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,701
This is what police stations are for.
Why'd you bring her here?

230
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,329
Like I've explained to you several times,
they blew her off.

231
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,539
Then you could have taken her
to a shelter or something.

232
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,042
They only let you stay
in the women's shelters

233
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,877
after the cops agree
to register your case!

234
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,503
Then a hotel, I don't know!

235
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,964
I don't wanna be accountable
if something happens to her.

236
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,550
You're heartless. You are a selfish man.

237
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,761
Why don't you just take her
to stay with you?

238
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,513
Why are you dumping your responsibilities
on others, Ms. Esteemed Writer?

239
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,224
This isn't just any crime.
A stalker's out there.

240
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,684
And not just any stalker.

241
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,686
An army deserter terrorist.

242
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,022
And only women live in my house.

243
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,774
Listen to yourself, Daeyong.

244
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,734
I mean,
how do you even know it's that guy?

245
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,905
-Is something going on at home?
-What do you care?

246
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,242
My point is… this building is secure.

247
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,495
At 9:00 tomorrow,
we'll check with the prosecutor

248
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,664
to make sure this guy is still in prison.

249
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,874
So she'll be safest staying here--

250
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,961
This office is a national security
facility in name only.

251
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,588
We weren't even safe
from a fire extinguisher, remember?

252
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,714
Oh, jeez.

253
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,882
WITH LOVE
TO MS. NAM GAYEON

254
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,092
W-What's that?

255
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,970
Unmarked letter.
It was the one delivered to Ms. Nam.

256
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,429
It's from him. I'm sure of it.

257
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,310
-What the…
-Don't wanna leave prints.

258
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,603
Haven't you ever seen this in crime shows?

259
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,568
- I really need reading glasses.
- You see it.

260
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,861
Don't you?

261
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,575
Judging by this talk
of demons and whatnot,

262
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,536
we're dealing with one messed up guy.

263
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,747
But it doesn't exactly seem like
she's the most stable either.

264
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,500
What if this is all just paranoia?
That could screw us.

265
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,168
Just hold on for a little bit.

266
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,713
Give us some time to show you
who this guy is.

267
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,173
Once we do that,
then the ball is in your court.

268
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,637
You're killing me. Seriously.

269
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,265
But what if…

270
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,477
I was imagining things this whole time?

271
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,480
What do we do then, Ms. Hong?

272
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,025
Don't forget that you are the victim here.

273
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,736
He's the one to blame.
Don't fret over the "what ifs."

274
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,363
You've lived through a trauma.

275
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,324
It was so horrific
that seeing things wouldn't be unusual.

276
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,785
You went through something so horrible

277
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,122
and you were alone for so long
after you lost your grandma.

278
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,460
The pain can return at any time
when you've been through a trauma.

279
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,212
Whether it's been 1 year or 10.

280
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,590
So what if you are imagining things?

281
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,676
If that's the case, you need to see
a doctor and focus on healing.

282
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:36,180
If anyone points their finger at you
or calls you insane,

283
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,974
then I'll just break all their fingers.

284
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,398
If I didn't…

285
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,319
have you on my side back then, I…

286
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,947
Eungyeong.

287
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,368
Oh… you changed your name, didn't you?

288
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,955
Yeah. I changed my name.

289
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,542
And even my resident registration number.

290
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,758
Listen. You need to be strong, hmm?

291
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,387
We seem like a mess,
but believe it or not,

292
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,597
we do get things done here.

293
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,519
Get some rest. I'll be back.

294
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,700
MISSED CALL: TEACHER MR. LEE MUO

295
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,207
{\an8}A TERRORIZED WEDDING:
TEACHER STALKED BY CHOI HOSEONG

296
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,145
- Hey, Mom.
- Still at work?

297
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,105
I don't think I can come home today.

298
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,940
How's Jein been doing?

299
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:13,110
Her fever broke.
She's sleeping now.

300
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,990
Lock the door before you head out, okay?

301
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,408
Mm, I will.

302
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,957
Ms. Hong?

303
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,584
How's Ms. Nam doing?

304
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,298
Hmm…

305
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,928
I know that this is a lot to ask,

306
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,680
but I really think that…

307
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,893
we should find the CCTV footage
and then report this incident to the cops.

308
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,147
Sweetie, to be honest…

309
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,191
…I'm afraid this might really be
Choi Hoseong's doing.

310
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,068
I've never heard you
talk like this before.

311
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,654
What's gotten into you? You're scaring me.

312
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,783
10 years ago, when we aired that episode,

313
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,662
he threatened me and the producer
multiple times.

314
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,247
But we had no choice.

315
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,834
The law wasn't gonna keep her safe.
So we did what we had to.

316
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,880
We risked all our lives
to air that episode.

317
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,884
So I can't believe
we're back at square one 10 years later.

318
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,685
I see.

319
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,857
I'll look into it more.

320
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,150
I'LL KILL YOU

321
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,986
If he really wanted to apologize,
he should've sent a handwritten letter.

322
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,321
I mean, come on.

323
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,823
Who does he think he is?
The Korean Dennis Rader?

324
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,868
-Right, Do?
-No idea who that is.

325
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,787
What, you never heard of the BTK Killer?

326
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,165
B stands for bind, T for torture,
and K for kill.

327
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,377
Uh, he killed around 10 people
over the course of 30 years, give or take.

328
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,836
And the crazy bastard kept sending letters

329
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,672
taunting everyone
for failing to catch him.

330
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,549
But the letters caught up to him
and he went to prison.

331
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,801
Uh…

332
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,558
How much longer
do we have to wait?

333
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,686
You can't keep us this late
if it's not work related.

334
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,979
There's this thing called
"communal labor."

335
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,313
It's a beautiful system

336
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,107
in which people help build
better lives for everyone.

337
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,651
I don't recall receiving
any kind of help from Ms. Hong.

338
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,944
GR was all you, huh?

339
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,571
-I was the one who took--
-All right, cut it out.

340
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,407
What's that?

341
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,492
Footage of Choi Hoseong's crime
from 10 years ago.

342
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:28,161
I get that you're cranky
because we called you out late,

343
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,289
but this is the first time
Ms. Hong's asked for anything.

344
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,000
And I know she hates being indebted.

345
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,419
So let's watch, okay?

346
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,840
Now presenting…
husband and wife.

347
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,789
Nam Eungyeong, Teacher

348
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,049
How dare you be with anyone
but me, Ms. Nam?

349
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,622
Ms. Nam!

350
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,868
Eungyeong…

351
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,130
Dongjae!

352
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,009
Oh, God, no!

353
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,791
Now we're finally alone…

354
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,378
Ms. Nam.

355
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,232
Choi Hoseong!
Put your hands where I can see them!

356
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,527
The guy's an absolute psycho.

357
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,281
Jesus Christ, I've got goosebumps. Holy…

358
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,037
One, the defendant turned himself in
and showed sincere contrition.

359
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,166
And two, the victim is still alive
and the crime resulted in only one death.

360
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:04,961
Three, this stalking was an expression
of pure, yet immature emotions.

361
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,882
Four, the defendant has a promising future
as an award-winning and talented…

362
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,301
This is the court's verdict?

363
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,596
God, how did he only end up
with 30 years after doing all that?

364
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,015
Are we sure this guy doesn't have
friends in high places?

365
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,767
His grandpa holds a high rank.

366
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,810
- And he comes from an elite family.
- Damn.

367
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,522
I doubt he'd have gotten a life sentence

368
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,315
if we hadn't aired that episode.

369
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,026
The bias shown against the victim
in this trial was clear.

370
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,405
I feel bad for the victim,
but I'm ready to let this case go.

371
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,616
What?

372
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,786
We saw the same footage, didn't we?

373
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,580
We're talking about
an unstable attempted mass-shooter.

374
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,499
We shouldn't stick our noses in
without the police.

375
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,752
Remember how charging headfirst
into Haven of Trust almost got us killed?

376
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:48,797
Charging in headfirst was what you did
with the cat case.

377
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,966
I'm just saying we should take action
in order to get police backup.

378
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,968
They won't believe us otherwise.

379
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,719
Forget it.

380
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,471
What about you two?

381
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,849
Uh… I, uh…
Thing is, I'm already, um…

382
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,685
a little tied up with my own stuff, and…

383
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:04,271
Okay, let's find the prosecutor
in the morning,

384
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,439
and then check to see
if he's still a prisoner in the system.

385
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,775
If we wait till 9:00
to contact the prosecutor,

386
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,819
how do we even know he'll cooperate?

387
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,613
What if this psycho hunts us down
before we even get that far?

388
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,782
This guy might not even be
Choi Hoseong though.

389
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,284
Exactly!

390
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,785
Why wait around nervously till the morning

391
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,204
when all our answers can be found
in the security footage?

392
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,582
I'm saying let's go to the cops
with evidence.

393
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,166
That way, we take
the minimum safety precautions--

394
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,376
Yeah, exactly.

395
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,714
Why should we go out of our way
to put ourselves in this much danger…

396
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,217
When we won't even
be airing this right away?

397
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,261
Right?

398
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,849
I see you've become a real producer.

399
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,851
Okay. I'll do it alone.

400
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,937
-Wait…
-Go home, everyone.

401
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,981
Hey, Ms. Oh. Uh…

402
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,816
I'll get in touch with my informants
and check to see

403
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,527
- which prison Choi Hoseong is… Ms. Oh.
- Ms. Oh.

404
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,820
Ms. Oh!

405
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,908
Would it kill you to be tactful?
Seriously.

406
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,064
{\an8}HELLO
NAM GAYEON

407
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,483
{\an8}NAM GAYEON
LOCATION: KNS NEW BUILDING

408
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,158
Hello.

409
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,495
Sir, would you mind letting me go over
the parking lot footage from last night?

410
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,621
I can't do that.

411
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:48,208
It's just the minimum proof we need
to put in a request for police protection.

412
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,001
Police or not, I still can't authorize it.

413
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,505
-Okay? All right, go, go. Take this.
-Hey, hey. No, sir. You can have those.

414
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,141
What are you--

415
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,225
What the hell?

416
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,560
What on earth
do you think you're doing, Han?

417
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,978
I just…

418
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,064
The security guard told me
I'd find you here, so…

419
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,234
What happened to letting this go?

420
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,196
Hey, you're the one who's always talking
about how we need teamwork.

421
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,491
I was afraid I might read an article like,
"Trigger Producer Found Dead."

422
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:46,659
So I hurried right over here.

423
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,245
That's a roundabout way of saying
you came because you were worried.

424
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,289
I heard he didn't let you
look at the footage.

425
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,084
Still, it wasn't all for nothing.

426
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,344
-You a detective?
-If I couldn't pull this off,

427
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,971
could I even call myself a producer?

428
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,229
Let's just leave the car here.

429
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,692
We need to let them think they're holding
all the cards, so they come back.

430
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,570
I'm saying we should leave a trap
so they'll slip up.

431
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,240
Think about it,
it's evidence of their crime,

432
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,200
so they'll wanna return and dispose of it.

433
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,285
Well, look at you.
That's a pretty good idea for a change.

434
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,455
The BTK Killer. Ring a bell?

435
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,666
Dennis, um, something…
Whatever, never mind.

436
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,793
-Put this back?
-Do it.

437
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,006
- Right here.
- Here?

438
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,175
Did we really have to come here?

439
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,594
We're here
because the apartment thing was a bust.

440
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,638
Just gotta say,
we wouldn't be here if we hadn't--

441
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,431
Enough with the nagging!

442
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,725
You should leave
if you're gonna keep that up.

443
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,144
Why do you keep following me around
like a puppy?

444
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,106
I mean, if we don't manage
to get the tire slashing footage--

445
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,566
Oh, don't!

446
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,277
Just knock on wood! Cut it out, okay?

447
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,572
"Knock on wood"?
That's such an old person phrase.

448
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,908
SANDOL SWIMMING POOL

449
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,080
Well, aren't we going in?

450
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,209
In this line of work, there are days

451
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,837
when one rejection
begins a series of them.

452
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,967
Hey!

453
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,429
I make a better impression.
You're far too cranky.

454
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,306
You wait in the car.

455
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,561
Ooh, hi there. Hello!

456
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,905
24-HOUR ADULT TOY SHOP

457
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,163
COUPLES' TOYS, LUBE, CONDOMS…

458
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,967
Uh, so here. That's a perfect angle.

459
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,386
- Mind if I take a quick look?
- No, absolutely not.

460
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,347
You'll need
our managing director's approval

461
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,848
to view any of our CCTV records,

462
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,935
but our manager just went on vacation
and won't be back for another week.

463
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,854
If you wanna do things officially,
please come back next week.

464
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,315
And if I come with the police?

465
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,566
You wouldn't accept that either?

466
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,109
Well, of course not!

467
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,695
If we showed the tapes to anybody,
our members would all quit.

468
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,489
- Please, that won't happen.
- No. No, ma'am.

469
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,740
Five minutes.
Just let me see it five minutes.

470
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,283
- You can't come back here.
- Fine.

471
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,078
-I swear, it'll be really quick.
-Real quick or not, the answer's still no.

472
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,955
-Now there's the door.
-I really--

473
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:38,706
I suggest you leave
while I'm still asking nicely.

474
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,167
- All right, all right.
- Exit's this way.

475
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,293
Out the door.

476
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,337
- Goodbye then.
- Goodbye. Thanks.

477
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,218
Han Do?

478
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,763
Lunatic Han?

479
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,732
Welcome.

480
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,403
Uh, you find something?

481
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,701
Is this solely a sex toy shop?

482
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,621
I couldn't help but notice
the man zipping up while leaving.

483
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,081
Are you a cop?

484
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,542
Do I look like a cop to you?

485
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,043
What do you want?

486
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,129
HAN DO, CURRENT AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT

487
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,554
So what? Who the hell cares?

488
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,098
Tri…

489
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,146
So… Whoa.

490
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:48,026
I'd just like to see the CCTV footage.

491
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,236
From the camera out front.

492
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,197
Oh, the CCTV footage?
Man, and I thought…

493
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,116
Uh, let's see now. Uh…

494
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,534
Oh, here it is.

495
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,746
Right here.
Yeah, that's some great footage, huh?

496
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,248
If you're not buying anything,
get out.

497
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,797
I'll buy something if you let me see it.

498
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,132
VVIP KOO HYEONGTAE, KNS

499
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,675
The most expensive item in the store.

500
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,511
Ah… so you're a paying customer?

501
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,888
Which day would you like to check?

502
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,308
- Right there. Stop.
- Okay.

503
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,729
But I mean…

504
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,148
I doubt we'll see his face,
even if it's enhanced.

505
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,067
Oh, I'm sure
you'll be able to figure it out.

506
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,694
Here's the original file, on this USB.

507
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,654
On the house. Here.

508
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,953
All right, eyes over here,
please perk up your ears.

509
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,121
May I have your attention?

510
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,582
Sorry, the sales pitch is important.
It's part of it.

511
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:49,670
Now allow me to introduce you
to something special.

512
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:53,091
GoldPlay, the VIP Bondage Set.

513
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,717
She's a beaut, isn't she?

514
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,344
Finest leather from Italy.

515
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,805
It comes packed in a luxurious box.

516
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,974
Perfectly safe,
but guarantees a comfortably snug fit.

517
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,268
Sadists and masochists
are both welcomed here.

518
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,354
Basically, you kill two birds
with one stone.

519
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,523
Just remember that you might be
one of those birds.

520
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,399
The instructions are real simple.

521
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,567
You bind your partner with love

522
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,694
and then you hit them
and then you hit them again!

523
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,905
Put heart in it. Once you get into it…

524
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,865
…you'll be well on your way
to pleasure paradise.

525
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,452
Now if you purchase this bad boy today,
I can offer you an incredibly good deal.

526
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,037
You actually agreed to buy this?

527
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,000
-How much is it?
-Ah!

528
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,837
-100,000 won?
-Whoa, hold up, hold up.

529
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,632
Sorry about that, I almost swore.

530
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,425
One million.

531
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,554
Uh… you're Trigger producers, right?

532
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,431
Okay. I'll do 800,000.

533
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,642
Uh, I don't know.
I'm not sure if it's the best bang for--

534
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,935
I'll do single payment.

535
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,981
A single pay? Thank you, sir!

536
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,733
He turned out to be quite the guy.

537
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,485
-You're not allergic to metal, are you?
-Nope.

538
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,820
Okay, all right then.

539
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,322
All right,
single payment purchase, let's go.

540
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,324
So, who's the dom and who's the…

541
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,492
Never mind.

542
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,333
That corporate card.

543
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,544
Where'd you get it?

544
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,422
It's not stolen, if you're wondering.

545
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,591
Oh, so the master outfitted
his loyal hound

546
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,634
with a company card.

547
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,681
What is that?

548
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:24,932
I'm warning you in advance.

549
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,226
Nice.

550
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,936
Now that's how you spend their cash.

551
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,813
Great work.

552
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,273
You did great for a change.

553
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,566
Proud of you.

554
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,527
What an unpredictable woman.

555
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,406
{\an8}MIRAE GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL

556
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,456
Hey, um…

557
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,665
Do you know

558
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,918
if something happened to Ms. Nam?

559
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,669
Ah…

560
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:59,508
I'm guessing Ms. Nam didn't tell you
about the letter, did she?

561
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,801
No. What letter?

562
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,555
I, um… wasn't about to say.

563
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,016
I can't betray her trust like that.

564
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,895
Although I really don't think
this is something I should keep to myself.

565
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:15,441
So recently, Ms. Nam received
a letter without a return address.

566
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,318
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Oh.

567
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,527
Good morning.

568
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:20,988
- Oh, morning, Ms. Oh.
- Good morning. Good morning.

569
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,869
Oh, I see a new chair.

570
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,747
I heard you got the footage.
You showed the cops?

571
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,999
I did just now.
Get in touch with the prosecutor?

572
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,960
I did find the one
in charge of Choi Hoseong.

573
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,712
But Ms. Nam has to be the individual
to ask about his status.

574
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,007
Something about talking to third parties
to protect his rights.

575
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,009
-What a load of bull.
-You know how it is in this country,

576
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,803
they care more about offenders' rights.

577
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:45,680
If you want protection,
you gotta break the law.

578
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,100
Where's Ms. Hong and Ms. Nam?

579
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,228
Sweetie.

580
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,938
Are you trying to die?

581
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,276
You've stopped eating and you never smile.

582
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,778
You wanna just wither away like this?

583
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,322
Eating will help you recharge.

584
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,157
And you need that if you wanna fight.

585
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,575
Against Hoseong or anyone.

586
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,372
There's something
I haven't told you, Ms. Hong.

587
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:13,708
What?

588
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,253
That I think
I'm in love again with someone.

589
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,467
And we're gonna get married.

590
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,556
But I'm so scared
that this is happening again…

591
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,976
because of my engagement.

592
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,105
What if the one I love gets hurt again
because of me?

593
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,484
Does that person know about Choi Hoseong?

594
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,489
Ms. Nam.

595
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,159
Get in touch with your partner right now

596
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,577
and explain everything.

597
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,164
And then tell them to go to the police
and ask for protection.

598
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,583
If you can't do it, I will.
Give me your phone.

599
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,418
No! No, you can't!

600
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,713
I… I broke up with them
over the phone yesterday.

601
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,549
We're no longer together.

602
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:06,052
They're safe
now that we're through though.

603
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:09,889
And if I got in touch with my ex again,
Hoseong could find out and…

604
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,656
Ms. Hong?

605
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,991
What is it?

606
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,952
Is something wrong?

607
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,376
Ms. Nam, she…

608
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,797
she's been dating someone new.

609
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,508
And they're engaged.

610
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:50,721
I understand that she's in no place
to be making any major life decisions…

611
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,435
But this… this is all just so…

612
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,606
I know I should have her back
if no one else is willing to…

613
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,275
but I just…

614
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,195
find her so frustrating, and…

615
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,282
…I just feel so mad at myself
for reacting that way.

616
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,703
Nahee.

617
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,456
That's totally understandable.

618
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,043
What you're both feeling
is completely valid.

619
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,753
It isn't.

620
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:24,922
That isn't true.

621
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:29,844
I know how much Ms. Nam had to go through
just to make it this far.

622
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,096
I witnessed it firsthand
right by her side.

623
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,475
But I can't help
but feel annoyed with her.

624
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,728
I just can't help but judge her
for finding a new partner.

625
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,940
I know I shouldn't feel this way,

626
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,235
but these feelings keep on surfacing.

627
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,705
What is it?

628
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,415
-Ms. Hong…
-What's going on?

629
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,250
Oh, my gosh!

630
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,668
What's wrong? What happened?

631
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,795
They just told me…

632
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:07,089
that Choi Hoseong is not in prison.

633
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,967
Oh…

634
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,859
OSEONG NATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

635
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,925
His sentence was suspended?

636
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,052
Man, that prick has to be connected.

637
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,720
How in the hell could this even happen?

638
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,306
I figured we didn't have
the resources to tackle things,

639
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,891
so I put in a word to Ms. Nam's lawyer.

640
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,476
When did you manage to find a lawyer?

641
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,897
Hello, everyone.

642
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,817
Yeo Yuncheol, attorney at law.

643
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,110
Say hello to Mr. Yeo

644
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,821
of the Yeo Yuncheol
Institute of Law Research.

645
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:15,741
As you might now,
we work in-house council jobs on the side.

646
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,409
According to the prosecutor,

647
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,371
the guy's mental faculties
started deteriorating,

648
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,414
less than two years into his sentence.

649
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,416
He started switching between personas.

650
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,919
He'd be lucid and then possessed.

651
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,091
Anyway, uh, he wasn't harming anyone,
so there weren't any issues until now.

652
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,803
But sometime last year,

653
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,430
he started to become violent.

654
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,642
He started hallucinating
and showing signs of delusion.

655
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,019
Apparently, he broke
a correctional officer's arm

656
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,980
and nearly killed another inmate.

657
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,317
They took him to an outside specialist

658
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,945
and diagnosed him
with dissociative identity disorder.

659
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,239
Uh, multiple personality disorder.
as it's known.

660
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,825
Man, my bullshit radar
is pinging like crazy right now.

661
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,076
Anyway, uh,

662
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,246
they paused his sentence
so he could get mental health treatment.

663
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,957
He left prison three months ago
and was admitted to a psych ward.

664
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,667
That's his current status,
and I should note

665
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,752
that his every move
is under 24-hour surveillance,

666
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,838
which means there's zero chance
he's out in public.

667
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,966
I can't believe
they didn't tell her immediately!

668
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,343
Is victim support just an afterthought?

669
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,138
Um, well, that's just
the judicial system's poor management.

670
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,306
Typical.

671
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:23,225
What are the chances that
Choi Hoseong snuck out of the hospital?

672
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,937
Oh, I asked the police
whether that was a possibility.

673
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,023
The only way out is through
three security doors

674
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,150
which are only unlocked with key cards,

675
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,819
and all these cards come
with a unique serial number.

676
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:36,155
Which automatically logs the time
their carriers enter

677
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,656
and exit the facility.

678
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,117
They insisted that breaking out
of that place is impossible.

679
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,077
Even if you're mentally sound.

680
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,329
The prosecutor checked the records

681
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,415
of everyone who's entered and exited
and found nothing suspicious.

682
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,255
Everyone, you all know me.

683
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,590
So I insisted.

684
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,468
I've got the magic touch with the police

685
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:01,764
and I got them to give me a photo
of Choi Hoseong taken today!

686
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,224
And, uh, this…
this stays between us, by the way.

687
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,810
If this gets out,
there'll be hell to pay, I'm serious.

688
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,395
What the heck?

689
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,105
He looks like a totally different person.

690
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,066
He looks nothing like the guy
we were talking about.

691
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,359
An accomplice?

692
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,444
It'd be typical of Choi Hoseong
to enlist someone else.

693
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,779
And the CCTV footage?

694
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,198
When can the police provide us
with the report on the tire slasher?

695
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,366
Well, they're…

696
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,784
dealing with way too many cases right now.

697
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,620
Oh, by the way, Ms. Oh,
the thing you did with the CCTV,

698
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,871
that was a genius move.

699
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,916
Thanks to that, the police will be placing
both Ms. Nam and her fiancé

700
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,084
under personal protection.

701
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,127
She said
she won't stay with her fiancé.

702
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,381
Although I don't feel comfortable
taking the police's word for it

703
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,216
and sending her back home alone.

704
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,677
Well, letting her stay with you
for the time being…

705
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,304
would be an awful idea.

706
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,933
She could stay with me.

707
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,311
You serious?

708
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,230
Well, I have no family or kids.

709
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,565
And my dad's at his own place
so it's practically empty.

710
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,693
As long as Ms. Nam's okay with it,

711
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,736
I wouldn't mind at all.

712
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,071
Oh, sweetie.

713
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,948
You'll explain everything to her?

714
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,036
I'll head over to the facility
where Choi Hoseong's being held

715
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,914
and check and see if it'd be okay for us
to air an episode on him.

716
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,457
So please stay with her until I get back.

717
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,254
What are you doing?

718
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,382
What's with this box?
Looks like high-end leather.

719
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,925
-Did you open it?
-No.

720
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,176
Seems like you know what it is.

721
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,344
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

722
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,512
- I don't.
- What's in there?

723
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,888
Hands off.

724
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,140
Why?

725
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,101
You know what? I was gonna resell it.

726
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,603
So if either of you wants it,

727
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,148
I can offer you a pretty great deal.

728
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,191
White Day special.

729
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,444
Cash only.

730
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,988
Whoa. White Day is today. March 14th.

731
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,782
Right, White Day.
Let's see the goods first.

732
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,370
All eyes over here and perk up those ears.

733
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,706
Now, without further ado
I'd like to present

734
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,584
GoldPlay VIP…

735
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,669
bond villain thingy.

736
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:56,837
What?

737
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,131
With its snug fitting restraints,

738
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,675
the two of you can tie each other up,
beat each other up…

739
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,719
Birds are involved.

740
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,263
H-How does that work?

741
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:07,681
-Is that a good thing?
-Yeah, is it?

742
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,516
-Paradise.
-What…

743
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,060
- Huh?
- Just take a look, God.

744
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,865
900, 950…

745
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:26,658
Million.

746
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,467
You've been putting that card to good use?

747
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,596
Have there been no new developments
with Cha Seongwook,

748
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,348
or have you backed out of our deal?

749
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,186
I was actually just on my way up
to talk to you about that.

750
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,483
Looking forward to it.

751
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,319
CHOI, MALE, 31 YEARS OLD

752
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,928
Dduddu, I told you I was gonna get mad
if you peed, didn't I?

753
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,513
I told you we were gonna get it.

754
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,724
Dduddu went peepee!

755
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,247
Why are you already asleep, huh?

756
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:00,085
I've brought you something interesting.

757
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,246
-Oh, hang on a minute.
-As I've I told you, the higher-ups say

758
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,956
we're not allowed to let in
members of the media!

759
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,166
Come on!

760
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,751
Define higher-ups. Who are they?

761
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,712
Believe me, Choi Hoseong's been a headache
ever since he arrived.

762
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,464
-There are many rules in place for him.
-Whose rules?

763
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,882
Who's giving you such a hard time?

764
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,216
Obviously…

765
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,261
-Ugh, just leave! Come on!
-Whoa, hey, hold on!

766
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,858
Why are you here alone? Jiyun?

767
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,526
The producers already headed out.

768
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,947
And everyone else went home
since it's White Day.

769
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,448
Where's the new writer?

770
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,659
That kid.
Can you believe she quit on day two?

771
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,452
-That's a new Trigger record.
-Wow.

772
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:19,247
And some incel sent me a text asking
why we have to look after the victim

773
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,666
when we're not running a women's shelter.

774
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,754
I feel like…

775
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,633
the world's becoming
less and less hospitable.

776
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,635
It's a real shame.

777
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,809
Trigger, investigative journalism.

778
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,771
O… kay. Hold for a moment?

779
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,898
-Hey, Ms. Oh.
-Mm?

780
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,525
The victim's…

781
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,360
fiancé is waiting downstairs.

782
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,697
I'm sorry for coming here unannounced.

783
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:55,200
I kept asking her to tell me where she was
but she wasn't answering.

784
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,037
I know I'll only make things
harder for her if I show up,

785
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,333
so please, if you don't mind,
could you give this to her for me?

786
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,629
Please make sure

787
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,674
to tell Gayeon that the police and I…

788
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,552
will keep her safe no matter what.

789
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:14,678
Please, ma'am.

790
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,972
Yeah. Of course I will.

791
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,609
Lunatic Han?

792
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,862
What are you doing here, Do?

793
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:33,989
Ms. Oh.

794
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,158
Are you all right?

795
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,951
Huh? Yeah, I'm totally fine.

796
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,038
It's just, Giho told me
something… happened to you.

797
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,122
Something like what?

798
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,623
No idea.

799
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:46,960
Why are all the lights off?

800
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,937
Door open.

801
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,732
♪ Happy birthday… ♪

802
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,197
What did I say?
I told you she'd hate this, didn't I?

803
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,116
Seriously?

804
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,910
You lied to him so he'd come
despite everything?

805
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,287
Well, I figured he wouldn't come
unless we said that.

806
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,371
I should have just stabbed you.

807
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,040
This is enough, right?
If not, we'll order…

808
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,793
Oh my, what are you guys doing?

809
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,253
What is all that?

810
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,214
Oh, well, uh…

811
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,674
Baek Songi was worried
that there were only women here.

812
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,676
- So she kept begging me to come.
- No, chief was the one who wanted to!

813
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,886
He was worried--

814
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,432
Uh… Anyway, what's with the cake?
Is it someone's birthday?

815
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,561
It is. March 14th.
White Day is Ms. Oh's birthday.

816
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,650
Come on.

817
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,361
We all showed up here,
at least blow out a candle.

818
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,612
And it's a sugar-free cake.

819
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,781
Ah, a sugar-free cake. I love it.

820
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,076
-Thank you, Giho.
-Well, you know…

821
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,371
Well, well, look at you, look at you.

822
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,999
Before we begin,
I'd like to recognize Park Daeyong.

823
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,543
Because he was so worried
about us and Ms. Nam,

824
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,128
he whipped out his credit card
for the very first time.

825
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,213
Ah, a gentleman. Applause!

826
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,714
Oh man, come on.

827
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,260
It's all thanks to you
that we're having dinner together.

828
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,970
Yeah, I know, right?

829
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,514
I don't know why it's been so hard for us
to all have dinner.

830
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,349
Well, maybe if you'd pay for it…

831
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,852
I wanna say though,
I think the way we support each other…

832
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:29,187
more than anything,
the way we support each other

833
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,730
is what keeps up together.

834
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,734
I've actually never had
a birthday party at home.

835
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,861
So thanks, Ms. Nam.

836
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,532
Maybe I notice it because…
I've been on my own for so long,

837
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,743
but you guys seem like a family.

838
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,829
And I'm so happy for you all.

839
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,038
In a way, I'm just like you.

840
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,374
You're one of us.

841
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:51,126
You're family as well.

842
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,920
And you've been with us
longer than Mr. Kang or Mr. Han here.

843
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:00,802
Those eyes.

844
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,013
You.

845
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,809
They're not the eyes you had
when you started out as our nepo-hire.

846
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,019
Nepo-hire?

847
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,564
-Hmm?
-Blow hard.

848
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,357
-Blow hard?
-Huh?

849
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,484
Why you…

850
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,069
Oh, the candle.

851
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,779
God, you scared me.

852
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,199
I almost punched you.

853
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,867
All right, let's all do it together.

854
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,077
One, two, three.

855
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,756
I'm sorry I didn't know
what you were going through.

856
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,341
And thanks for staying strong.
We'll talk when you're ready.

857
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,637
Come in.

858
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:46,806
Oh.

859
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,059
I hope
we didn't make you uncomfortable.

860
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,644
Oh, no, not at all.

861
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,145
This is for you.

862
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,023
Your boyfriend asked me…

863
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,442
to get it to you no matter what.

864
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,283
Let's live a long life.

865
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,037
One filled with joy and laughter.

866
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,671
Yeah.

867
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,221
Ugh, one watch
is barely enough to keep her safe.

868
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,306
Your response time will be slow
if you're far away.

869
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,059
I don't care who, but one of you
should stand guard, huh?

870
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,395
I'm sorry, but I really do have
tons of work to catch up on.

871
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:36,856
How about you, Mr. Han?

872
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,484
- Are you busy?
- Oh, he's not busy.

873
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,487
All right then, I'll come over tomorrow.

874
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,863
Happy?

875
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,366
No thanks. You guys'll just crowd around
and get in the way.

876
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,826
Look at you so tough.

877
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,370
Let's take a group photo
and then head home. Come on.

878
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,372
-A photo? That's so old-fashioned.
-So corny.

879
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,291
You head home.

880
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,836
Three, two…

881
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,255
one.

882
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,095
- Good night.
- Bye, everyone.

883
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,516
- Hey, Baek Songi.
- Yes?

884
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,852
I need to stay up and go over
the Choi Hoseong files.

885
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:16,896
This is the dashcam footage taken
near Seongwook's father's house.

886
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,982
Can you check to see
if the punk who scribbled that graffiti

887
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,066
was caught on camera?

888
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,485
-Yes, ma'am.
-See you.

889
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,446
See you.

890
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,655
Kang Giho.

891
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,781
-Yeah?
-Give her a ride.

892
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:27,866
Oh, okay.

893
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,326
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

894
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,210
Let's go back.

895
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,179
Tastes good, huh? Can I?

896
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,519
I'm just kidding.

897
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,314
It's a birthday gift.

898
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,624
Aren't you leaving?

899
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,931
There's something I wanna tell you.

900
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,309
What?

901
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,356
What?

902
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,779
I'm Dr. Trigger.

903
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,604
Oh…

904
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,401
See you later.
Mommy's off to work.

905
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,993
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING: OPEN UP.

906
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,121
OPEN THE DOOR.

907
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:41,332
COME ON, JUST ONCE. I'M AT THE DOOR.

908
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,045
Seriously.

909
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:51,968
What do you want?

910
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:04,147
You and your antics. Jesus.
