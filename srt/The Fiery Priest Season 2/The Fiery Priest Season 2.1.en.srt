00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,253
The Fiery Priest Season 2

00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,623
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,875
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,281
Boss

8
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,785
Hey!

9
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,292
Where's the youngest?

10
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,133
Hurry up and get out.

11
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,384
Jeez.

12
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,971
- Hurry up.
- Easy.

13
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,807
He'll get hurt.

14
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,683
Cheonu.

15
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,393
Venerable Abbot!

16
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,062
Are you hurt?

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,939
No, I'm okay.

18
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,235
I'm not that heartless.

19
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,654
I wouldn't have harmed such a young monk.

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,324
I just taught him a little lesson.

21
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,285
You didn't go around telling anyone,
did you?

22
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,496
I didn't,

23
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,457
so let him go.

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,542
Come on now.

25
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,752
Did you forget our deal?

26
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,381
We set fire to this temple,
and you all leave.

27
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,883
Then we'll let him go.

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,432
You people!

29
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,435
You will all be punished!

30
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,562
Listen, sir.

31
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,274
Only those who are weak get punished.

32
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,485
That's easier for the higher powers too,
you see.

33
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,446
Damn it.

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,366
Who the hell is smacking that woodblock?

35
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,369
Guys.

36
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,453
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,080
Find who it is and bring them here.

38
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,707
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,841
Hey, go up and get them.

40
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,925
Yes, sir.

41
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,059
Get up.

42
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,603
Give me that.

43
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,065
I said get up!

44
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,048
Sir! Sir!

45
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,761
What's going on?

46
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,804
Hey, Pork Jowl.

47
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,474
D-Did you fall?

48
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,810
Did you get beaten up by a monk?

49
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,022
I… I was beaten up…

50
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,737
All living beings
commit misdeeds with their bodies,

51
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,865
speech,

52
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,159
and minds.

53
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,828
By slandering noble people,

54
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,581
they create negative karmic ties
through wrong views and harmful actions.

55
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,974
Therefore, when their lives end,
they will surely go to hell.

56
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,856
Homage to Amitabha Buddha.

57
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,943
What is this, a musical?

58
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,572
Look at your mugs.

59
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,491
It's like a cure for low blood pressure.

60
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,452
Since when did such a bold monk
join the temple?

61
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,037
How useless.

62
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,872
-Hey, Shin Hodeung.
-Come on.

63
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,500
It's Shin Hodong, not Hodeung.

64
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,129
Like the famous television host,
Kang Hodong.

65
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,964
Potato, potahto.

66
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,132
That's not the point!

67
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,633
Anyway,

68
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,219
I heard you're trying
to burn the place down and take over.

69
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,930
You're trying to build a luxury shitty…

70
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,642
Damn it! City-view. City-view!

71
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,060
Luxury…

72
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,897
Luxury… All right, let me start over.

73
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,107
What's with him?

74
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,776
I heard you're trying
to burn this place down

75
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,904
and build
a luxury city-view townhouse here.

76
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,615
How will you split it
with your puppet master,

77
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,992
Assemblyman Kwon Namcheol?

78
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,456
How do you know all the details?

79
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,875
Buddha knows all the details.

80
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,668
Right?

81
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,670
All right.

82
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,964
I'll show you mercy
since Buddha is watching.

83
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,217
If you promise to stay away from here
and live a kind life,

84
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,094
I'll let this slide.

85
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,014
Come on, we're not some villains
in a teen movie.

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,725
Guys.

87
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,352
Get rid of him.

88
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,686
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,740
Looks like we have a lot of passengers
on the express lane to hell today.

90
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,786
Let's see. Two, four, six, eight…

91
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:26,260
Get your weapons!

92
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,554
Let's do this.

93
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,101
Oh, jeez.
I thought you were going for me.

94
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,186
-Come here, Cheonu.
-Come on.

95
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,604
Goodness.

96
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,797
What kind of monk has a full head of hair?

97
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,843
Me. I do.

98
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,678
I'm a long-haired monk.

99
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,566
Wait right there.

100
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,364
He put his weapon down.

101
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,283
Now's the time!

102
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,956
Are you going to take turns fighting him?

103
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,875
Just attack him all at once!

104
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,659
Hang on.

105
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,136
Come here.

106
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,305
Uh…

107
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,228
Wait, wait!

108
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,397
You're a priest, right?

109
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,067
Then you can't do this.

110
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,529
It's not okay for a priest to hurt people.

111
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,947
I'll hurt you even more

112
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,325
because there's no guarantee
that you guys will go to hell.

113
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,244
Father Kim.

114
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,538
I think this is enough.

115
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,830
All right, Abbot!

116
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,250
Okay, we're done here.

117
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,001
Listen to the abbot.

118
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,046
-Buddha is also watching…
-Wait, wait, wait!

119
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,382
Uh…

120
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,843
Listen to that.

121
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,137
The bell rang.

122
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,065
You two are really in sync today.

123
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,152
The Lord and Buddha…

124
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,029
are telling me to beat you up.

125
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:55,970
The Fiery Priest Season 2

126
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,016
All right, Seoul is mine now.

127
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,642
Why aren't you paying?

128
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,228
I just paid one million won.

129
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,440
No, you didn't.
You only paid 800,000 won.

130
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:12,153
Come on,
I even counted the bills before I paid.

131
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,615
No, you didn't. You only counted.
You didn't pay the full price.

132
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,950
Look carefully.

133
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,537
Hmm?

134
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,374
Sister Kim, here you go.

135
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,086
Oh, goodness. I wonder how that got there.

136
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,963
See? I told you!

137
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,883
Sister Kim, you're a liar!

138
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,676
-Liar!
-Liar!

139
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,303
-You're a liar!
-You're a liar!

140
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,513
- Oh, goodness me.
- You're a liar!

141
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,933
Here. Let's have a snack.

142
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,729
Please forgive my sins,

143
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,232
including adultery
and the ones that I haven't confessed yet.

144
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,361
Did you confess to your wife
and ask for forgiveness?

145
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,488
Well… no.

146
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,659
I'd feel better asking
for God's forgiveness before my wife's.

147
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,160
Step out for a second, will you?

148
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,455
I can't show my face like this.

149
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,583
You think the Lord
is some sort of forgiving machine?

150
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,378
You can't just sin, give an offering,
and ask for forgiveness!

151
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,130
Forgive me!

152
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,009
Honorary police officer
Gudam-gu

153
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,094
Hey.

154
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,637
Listen up.

155
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,265
Enough modifying your motorcycles.

156
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,810
We're going to get complaints
because of the noise. Got it?

157
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:26,894
Yes, sir.

158
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,230
Also, don't put up fliers at the new

159
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:33,693
Gudam Etude Handong Chablis Happy View
City Apartment, all right?

160
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,570
Especially Chinese and fried chicken.

161
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,489
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

162
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,366
All right.

163
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,285
And lastly,

164
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,998
Gudam deliverymen
always follow the traffic rules.

165
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,875
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

166
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,087
Safe deliveries today, everyone.

167
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,797
Good luck.

168
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,425
Good luck.

169
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:00,010
All right, all right.

170
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,429
Please stop following me around.

171
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:05,015
I told you to restock these promptly,
didn't I, Deogu?

172
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,517
I'm sorry, Manager Kim.

173
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,103
Some campers bought a whole bunch at once.

174
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,188
Why don't you throw out the food waste?

175
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,233
Do you like the smell or what?
Come on, Deogu!

176
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,695
Deogu!

177
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,238
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

178
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,948
Do you have a boyfriend?

179
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,867
Could I have your number?

180
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,536
-Well…
-I'm not a bad person.

181
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,954
Wow.

182
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,923
Man, that shot was on a rope.

183
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,267
Hey, Detective No.

184
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,144
Is everything all right?

185
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,938
Is that so?

186
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,649
I'll be on my way.

187
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,203
You didn't have to honk at me!

188
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,872
My ears are super sensitive.

189
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,417
Excuse me, would you like a beating
to toughen up your ears?

190
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,671
It only makes sense for me
to be suspicious.

191
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,133
Still, how could you steal
in broad daylight?

192
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,845
That car stole my heart first!

193
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,930
Hey.

194
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:30,851
You want to get a beating full of love
by Team Leader Gu Daeyoung?

195
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,729
I'm sorry.
I admit to stealing the car.

196
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,481
There we go. How easy was that?

197
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,983
That's all we needed. Sign your name here.

198
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,693
- Just sign it.
- Okay.

199
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,778
Sure.

200
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,321
We live in a world full of people.

201
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,532
It's normal to have petty criminals.

202
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,284
Gudam-gu, a place with no violent crimes.

203
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,662
A true oasis of peace!

204
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,707
Real peace!

205
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,422
Today, we will be discussing
the pressing issue

206
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,050
of human rights for the homeless in LA.

207
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,134
Wait.

208
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,554
Hasn't the county government
already opposed the rule

209
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,556
in emphasizing the right of the homeless?

210
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,766
Unfortunately, that is the case.

211
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,977
Wait a minute. Where's Kyungsun?

212
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,522
Seems like
she's absent pretty often these days.

213
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,151
That, actually, um…
she's been feeling homesick lately,

214
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,362
so she's taking time off.

215
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,614
Homesick?

216
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,123
Your martini, ma'am.

217
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,499
Enjoy.

218
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,970
Mmm.

219
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,599
Hello, miss.

220
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,352
If you don't mind,
could I treat you to a drink?

221
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,025
Sure.

222
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:11,327
Episode 1

223
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,411
You were beaten up?

224
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,495
You see this?

225
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,205
You can't lie.

226
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,374
So you were assaulted?

227
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,170
We were assaulted by that thug priest
out of nowhere.

228
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,505
Right, right.

229
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,257
Is that true?

230
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,802
How could a priest hit anyone?

231
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,262
In this day and age?

232
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,222
A priest shouldn't lie.

233
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,642
He beat us to a pulp.

234
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,727
We could've easily struck back.

235
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,646
But we respected Buddhist beliefs.

236
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,148
You know,
Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence.

237
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,360
We know him.

238
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,445
Damn it.

239
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,529
What the hell?

240
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,531
Who the hell was that?

241
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,741
Gandhi was a Hindu.

242
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,868
And mind your manners to the detectives.

243
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,287
-Sit down.
-Why are you only picking on me?

244
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,792
According to the priest
and the monks' statements,

245
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,669
you said you were going to
set fire to the temple.

246
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,379
Set fire?

247
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,131
Please, I said my heart was on fire
with Buddha's mercy.

248
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,050
Jeez.

249
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,344
Assemblyman Kwon Namcheol

250
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,687
-Sir!
-Sir! Be careful!

251
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,896
Are you okay, sir?

252
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,649
- Jeez.
- Who ordered ox bone soup?

253
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,733
It smells good.

254
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,361
Assemblyman Kwon isn't picking up, is he?

255
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,905
It seems like he's completely cut you off.

256
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,573
What are you talking about?

257
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,284
Worry about yourself, you thug priest!

258
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,037
How dare you call me that,
you tattooed pig?

259
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,122
Hey, get him.

260
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,540
- What is this?
- Monk Hyojeong.

261
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,171
Hey, call him.

262
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,548
Call Namcheol.

263
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,591
Call him!

264
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,344
What now?

265
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,684
Everything that happened today
is on there.

266
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,396
We set fire to this temple,
and you all leave.

267
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,065
Then we'll let him go.

268
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,943
What?

269
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,904
How does a monk know
how to use high-tech technology?

270
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,287
Why is a monk using such technology?

271
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,247
What are you? You're not a monk, are you?

272
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:21,790
You're an impostor.

273
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,502
Sir, we have a call
from the cardinal's secretary priest.

274
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,004
The cardinal?

275
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,173
What's a cardinal?

276
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,382
As in the cardinal we know?

277
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:31,967
Yes, it's his secretary.

278
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,846
Look at that punk drinking water.

279
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,556
You thug priest!

280
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,934
Dedicated Jongnam Police Station!
Ensuring Citizens' Happiness!

281
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,478
- Hey, Park Cheonu!
- Lee Sangyeon!

282
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,606
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

283
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,066
Did they hurt you?

284
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,567
Father Kim took care of everything.

285
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,694
That's such a relief.

286
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,780
I told you, didn't I?

287
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,365
Father Kim will help anyone
regardless of their religion.

288
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,867
You were right.

289
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:02,706
So you caused him inconvenience
to help out a friend.

290
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,666
Not at all.

291
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,960
I was only helping out another believer.

292
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,295
If it weren't for Sangyeon,

293
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,963
I wouldn't have known
about Gudam Temple's hardships.

294
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,340
Father Kim.

295
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,634
Thank you so much.

296
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,885
Not at all.

297
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,347
Thank you for being brave, Sangyeon.

298
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,431
Of course.

299
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,392
Come visit the church sometime.

300
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,602
Okay, I will.

301
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,854
We have great snacks there.

302
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:28,315
To be honest,
the snacks at the temple are the best.

303
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,360
Hey, you. Come here.

304
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,112
We'll get going then.

305
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,697
-See you, Cheonu. Text me.
-Okay.

306
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,241
It hurts.

307
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,742
I'm going to tell on you to Sister Kim.

308
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,452
I'm hungry.

309
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,620
I want tteokbokki.

310
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,040
- You crave that every day.
- Because it's so good.

311
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,504
I made up my mind

312
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,591
from the moment I received
sacramental education from you as a kid

313
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,677
to become a priest like you.

314
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:58,679
What kind of priest am I?

315
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,556
You have a strong sense of justice,

316
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,475
-you fight well…
-Go on.

317
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,144
You're smart…

318
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,396
Actually,

319
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,023
I don't want your temper.

320
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,945
My heart.

321
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,905
What's wrong? Are you okay?

322
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,449
- Hmm? Sangyeon.
- I'm just kidding.

323
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,664
Hey! You scared me!
You almost sent me to the Lord!

324
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,048
Jeez, you scared me to death.

325
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,425
Is your heart okay?

326
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,719
Of course, it's much better now.

327
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,429
I can even run now.

328
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,265
Don't overdo it. Your mom will be worried.

329
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,349
Okay.

330
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,185
Father Kim!

331
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,816
Hi, Mr. Gu Daeyoung.
Or should I call you "Young Gu"?

332
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,319
Hey, holy altar boy Lee.

333
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,821
What's going on with Gudam Temple?

334
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,324
It's been taken care of, so stop frowning.

335
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,784
I'm late for my academy.

336
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,869
- Darn it.
- Go, go.

337
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,371
See you at Sunday Mass.

338
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,332
-Bye, Young Gu.
-Bye.

339
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,625
See you on Sunday, holy altar boy Lee.

340
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,793
Don't run. You'll trip.

341
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,505
-Father Kim.
-Have some hog maw, your favorite.

342
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,674
That's not what's important…

343
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,469
Hog maw to go, please.

344
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,971
This is good.

345
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,556
-It's good, right?
-It's delicious.

346
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,350
-You pay.
-What?

347
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,852
-Why should I pay?
-You asked for takeout.

348
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,187
Is the food ready for takeout?

349
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,233
How many times have I told you

350
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,109
to only cause trouble in Gudam-gu?

351
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,778
That's the only way I can cover for you.

352
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,863
Believers should help each other out.

353
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,699
Not by completely ruining
the face of 14 men.

354
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,826
- That's like taking down an organization!
- Hey!

355
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,788
You went golfing on duty, right?

356
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,290
I only went for half an hour
during my lunch break.

357
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,501
I need to maintain a work-life balance!

358
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,213
Living the good life, huh?
Or should I say the "Gu" life?

359
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,173
As if.

360
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,092
That's just what it seems like.

361
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,012
On the outside, I'm the complacent leader
of the Violent Crimes Team.

362
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,015
But in reality, I fight against injustice
alongside Kim Haeil.

363
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:09,810
-I'm the Night Guy.
-How childish.

364
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,604
What kind of nickname is that?
That was terrible.

365
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,481
-Stay away from me.
-Then what? Night Gown?

366
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,942
And plus, I'm your com--

367
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,318
Hey!

368
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,408
Oh, right. It's top secret.

369
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:25,867
Shh.

370
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,832
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

371
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,376
Amen.

372
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,336
Please enjoy.

373
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,463
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

374
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,923
Here you go.

375
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,551
-Eat up.
-Have more rice.

376
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,719
Are you not eating, Father Kim?

377
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,013
I already ate. Don't worry about me.

378
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,180
-Okay.
-I see.

379
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,640
Oh, right.

380
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,144
Father Kim, you should've taken me
with you to Gudam Temple.

381
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,896
It would've been nice to get the exercise.

382
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,275
You were on the clock.

383
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,193
And you need to cut back on working out.

384
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,654
He's right.
Don't get involved unnecessarily.

385
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,905
You'll lose all your muscle.

386
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,240
-Just stay put.
-Okay.

387
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,409
Team Leader Gu,
you're slacking off these days.

388
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,910
It doesn't seem like an act either.

389
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,079
Totally. He's lost his touch
after getting promoted.

390
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,414
Come on.

391
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,707
You guys will never understand

392
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,877
the struggles I face as a police officer
and a Night Guy.

393
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:22,507
By the way, I wonder how Prosecutor Park
and Detective Seo are doing.

394
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,759
I know.

395
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,844
I wonder if Geezer Park
is actually studying in LA

396
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:26,970
or just hanging out.

397
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,513
I'm sure she's studying.

398
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,515
You can tell she's the type to study hard.

399
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,017
Come to think of it,

400
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,728
it's already
Father Lee Yeongjun's fifth memorial Mass.

401
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,813
You're right.

402
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,149
But it still feels like he's with us.

403
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,817
I feel the same way.

404
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,486
It's like he's always with me,

405
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,238
patting me on the shoulders.

406
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:50,535
Gudam-gu has become a true oasis of peace,
thanks to Father Lee and Father Kim.

407
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,996
Let's maintain the peace.

408
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,708
Stop it!

409
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,543
Take it back!

410
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,254
What's the matter?

411
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,425
Don't say things
like "true oasis" and "peace."

412
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,928
Something unsettling always follows.

413
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,556
Don't say it!

414
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,725
Take it back!

415
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,728
-Take it back!
-Take it back!

416
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,107
You're all believers of the Lord.
What are you doing?

417
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,025
Take it back! Take it back!

418
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:24,861
I take it back!

419
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,406
Why did I say such things?

420
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,077
Gosh, I feel sick.

421
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,709
-Take it back!
-I take it back.

422
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,400
Hey, can we talk for a second?

423
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,652
Third year at Gudam Middle School,
Lee Sangyeon.

424
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,533
- Come here!
- Just come already!

425
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,047
Hey, you know me, right?

426
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,260
No.

427
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,887
Yeah, you do.

428
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,642
You saw me there last night, didn't you?

429
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,897
Hey.

430
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,400
-Okay.
-Okay.

431
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,611
- Let go of me. Let go!
- Let's go eat!

432
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,370
Mmm.

433
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,248
What do you say…

434
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,167
we go to Cancún next week together?

435
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,294
-Cancún?
-Mm.

436
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,962
Oh.

437
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,509
Don't you think it's a bit soon
for us to go on a trip together?

438
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,593
I mean…

439
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,054
we're just now getting to know each other.

440
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,474
Trust me. It'll just be a fun getaway.

441
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,518
You and me.

442
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,853
Well,

443
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,897
I mean, in Korea,

444
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:28,818
we say you have to be really in love
before traveling together.

445
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,404
Traveling is the best way to fall in love.

446
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,616
This guy is really going for it

447
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,034
when we've only just met.

448
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,410
What's that mean?

449
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,957
I just said I bet it'll be so romantic.

450
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,251
Mm-hmm. I agree.

451
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,975
Here's your main dish, filet mignon,
cooked to medium rare.

452
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,560
Thank you.

453
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,769
Enjoy.

454
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,563
Move! Go, go, go!

455
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,856
Stop right there, DEA!

456
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,484
Down, down, get on the ground! Freeze!

457
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,986
- What the…
- Freeze!

458
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,989
Am I
getting sliced up instead of the steak?

459
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,073
Stop right there.

460
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,033
You're under arrest for drug trafficking

461
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,660
and first-degree murder.

462
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,954
- Everyone, out!
- What's going on?

463
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,706
- Is it like a special event?
- Out!

464
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:23,790
Hurry.

465
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,797
What's he waiting for?

466
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,048
Put up your hands and…

467
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,593
So he had a different plan.

468
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,754
Freeze!

469
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,130
Drop your guns.

470
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,176
-Drop them!
-Drop, drop, drop, drop.

471
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,525
Move it!

472
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,862
-Move, move. Move.
-Move!

473
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,089
Suspect is down.
All clear.

474
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,841
-Hands in the air.
-Don't shoot, don't shoot.

475
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,719
I said don't shoot!

476
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,180
Korean, Korean.

477
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,099
I don't know him.

478
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,517
I don't know this man.

479
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,227
I've never seen him before.

480
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:09,604
Do you know kimchi?

481
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,025
I love Korea. Mini heart.

482
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,992
No, no, no, no, no…

483
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,453
How many times do I have to say no?

484
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,623
We only met twice and just ate together.

485
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,251
Is that what he told you, right?

486
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,211
Can't trust what that guy says.

487
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,755
Not if you two are on the same side.

488
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,049
What?

489
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:42,762
Hey, I'm a prosecutor
of the Republic of Korea.

490
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,432
Why would I be
on the side of a drug cartel?

491
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,143
I hear the key figures of the cartel

492
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,146
are the police, judges, and…

493
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,064
prosecutors.

494
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,192
I don't know anything
about the situation in this country,

495
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,903
but it's not that in Korea, okay?

496
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,656
Well, we'll have to investigate then, huh?

497
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,241
See whether or not it's true.

498
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,371
This is so annoying.
I haven't even eaten anything yet.

499
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,584
If you don't release me quickly,

500
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,919
it will cause problems
between our countries

501
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,088
and Ministries of Justice!

502
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,507
Hey, that's none of my concern.

503
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,344
You are to remain here
until the investigation is completed.

504
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,512
You got that, right?

505
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,975
Gosh, my blood pressure.

506
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:35,607
This darn son of a gun.

507
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:38,318
Kim Haeil

508
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:08,932
We would like to invite you,
Father Michael Kim Haeil,

509
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,475
as an instructor at Busan Major Seminary.

510
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,605
We sincerely ask you
to reconsider your decision.

511
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,816
We at the Catholic Diocese of Busan

512
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:21,903
believe that you are truly needed
at Busan Major Seminary.

513
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,449
We hope that you can be a guiding light
for aspiring priests.

514
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,040
Busan
Busan

515
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,071
-This…
-We have tons of those.

516
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:19,127
-Goodness.
-Hey, long time no see.

517
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,491
Hey, pretty.

518
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,203
You want to join me for some soju?

519
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,463
Get lost,
unless you want a hole in your mouth.

520
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,386
-Ma'am, lots of steamed lung, please.
-Sure.

521
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:18,394
Forget about piercing holes
in people's mouths, and let's go eat.

522
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,229
Why are you so late?

523
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,440
The guy I was supposed to meet with
came late.

524
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,860
I'm sorry, okay?

525
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,487
Let's go. Come on.

526
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,073
I want to go to that club too.

527
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,741
You can't.

528
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,827
Things are about to get real messy in…

529
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,207
All right, all right. Let's go.

530
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,000
Heidi.

531
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,878
I told you I don't like
Heidi, Girl of the Alps.

532
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,714
-Call me that again, and I'll kill you.
-Okay.

533
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,594
-Should we go eat raw fish?
-I want beef.

534
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,639
Let's go.

535
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,016
-Let's go.
-Stand back, stand back.

536
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,519
Emergency, emergency. It's the police.

537
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,980
-Emergency, emergency. Out of the way.
-Move.

538
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,483
Let go.

539
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,319
Stop it.

540
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,666
This way!

541
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,084
- Move!
- What the hell?

542
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,425
Damn it!

543
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,193
Would you like some peaches?

544
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,195
I have diabetes.

545
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,784
Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office

546
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,370
Busan Cooperative Fish Market Annex

547
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,331
Nam Duhun
Supreme Prosecutors' Office

548
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,559
You should've just partied in Seoul.
Why come all the way here?

549
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,729
What's a petty prosecutor
like you doing here?

550
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,691
Go get a higher-up.

551
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,776
Oh.

552
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,779
I'm the departmental chief prosecutor.

553
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,781
I look rather young, don't I?

554
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,116
I guess
they just hand out promotions here.

555
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,121
Sir.

556
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,040
Did someone die?

557
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:48,086
Your friends hurt their heads,

558
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,089
and your partner was in a critical state
but woke up not long ago.

559
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,841
You didn't tell my father, did you?

560
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,761
There's no need to.

561
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,472
He's busy busking
at the National Assembly.

562
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,183
Busking is playing music in the street.

563
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,937
Your father is engaging in a filibuster,
a legal obstruction of proceedings.

564
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,232
Whatever it is,
he can't pick up because he's busy.

565
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,485
Oh. Here, here, here.

566
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,616
Apparently, he didn't even last an hour.

567
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,828
What excuse did he use
on the reporters this time?

568
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,204
What was it again?

569
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,831
Otolithiasis?

570
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,125
He said he was dizzy because of it.

571
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,376
He's lying.

572
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,712
All right, let's take a look.

573
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,970
Heroin, LSD, ketamine…

574
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,055
Gosh, even casanine.

575
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,598
You did everything.

576
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,937
Well, I always like to try a wide variety.

577
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,026
Are you happy, you idiot?

578
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,778
Try this too.

579
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,740
Damn it.

580
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,621
You're going to let me go anyway,
so what was that for?

581
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,540
What are you staring at, punk?

582
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,543
I ought to pluck your eyes right out.
Sit down.

583
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,715
Where's your attorney?

584
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,926
They can't catch a flight right now,

585
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,596
so they're going to catch
the first flight tomorrow.

586
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,264
Stop with the nonsense.

587
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,018
Have them arrive in two hours
unless they want to see you behind bars.

588
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,687
I'm sure there are celebrities in Busan.

589
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,315
-Just frame one of them, and--
-You idiot.

590
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,401
You think celebrities do drugs
out in the open?

591
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,111
Jeez, my eyes sting.

592
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:40,865
Listen carefully.

593
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,826
We can't just frame them for nothing.

594
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,871
We need to come up with something.

595
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,957
Do you not get it?

596
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,340
New Era Unification Party
Chairman Kim Mancheon

597
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,300
I feel bad for your father.

598
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,384
Wait.

599
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,388
Hello, sir.

600
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,768
I'm Nam Duhun of the Busan
Southern District Prosecutors' Office

601
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,144
Violent Crimes Division.

602
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,147
Yes.

603
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,904
The great Kim Mancheon

604
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,865
didn't do so well raising his son.

605
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:27,078
It seems like
Boss Park laid it out perfectly for you.

606
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,414
He gives them drugs,
then stabs them in the back.

607
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,417
He sure is diligent, isn't he?

608
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,544
Right.

609
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,673
Is he doing as I said?
I told him to wrap things up in Seoul.

610
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,093
According to him, he is,
but I'll look into it again.

611
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,054
Where is he distributing the drugs
in Seoul again?

612
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,305
Gudam-gu, sir.

613
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,140
-Gudam-gu?
-Yes, sir.

614
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,062
Tell him not to get cheeky
and wrap it up immediately.

615
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,146
Yes, sir.

616
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,319
Is Park's new boss the real deal
or just the bankroller?

617
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,281
From what I could tell,
he seems like the real deal.

618
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,951
I guess he's the real deal
if Park of the Yongsa Gang works for him.

619
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,202
From what I heard,

620
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,455
he used to do quite well
selling drugs in Southeast Asia.

621
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:15,209
Drug dealers in Southeast Asia
are no joke.

622
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,128
I hear they're something else.

623
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,671
They do whatever they want.

624
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:23,342
We'll make sure to teach them a lesson
the second they arrive in Korea.

625
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,844
Don't be ridiculous.

626
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,387
Just watch out for yourselves,

627
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,347
you money-sucking cops.

628
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,686
Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office
Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office

629
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,895
There he is!

630
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,440
-What do you think about the situation?
-Could you please say a word?

631
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,860
Any word from your father,
Chairman Kim Mancheon?

632
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,278
Kim Inseok, the son

633
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,988
of the New Era Unification Party Chairman
Kim Mancheon,

634
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,824
has just been released on bail
after being arrested

635
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,784
for charges of habitual drug use
and aggravated assault.

636
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,996
The Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office revealed

637
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,582
that Lee,
a Korean-American and friend of Kim,

638
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,084
secretly spiked Kim's drink with casanine

639
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,171
and was the primary instigator
of the aggravated assault.

640
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,382
However, some are raising concerns
about fairness--

641
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,177
Is this all true?

642
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:11,182
Yes, sir. Lee has a record of drug use
and assault in New York as well.

643
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,769
Not all investigations
can be completely fair.

644
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,814
However, the public perceives
controversy itself as unfair.

645
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,776
Our priority

646
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,111
is to achieve absolute fairness.

647
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,616
Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

648
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,242
Good.

649
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,786
-You can go now.
-Yes, sir.

650
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,666
"Our priority
is to achieve absolute fairness."

651
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,460
What a load of crap.

652
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,254
The world isn't what it was before.

653
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,342
"It's fair when I do it,
but unfair when others do it."

654
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,135
How ridiculous.

655
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,887
Monsignor Lee Yeongjun 5th Memorial Mass

656
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,222
Goodness,
they don't have to run.

657
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,433
Hello.

658
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,268
What's the matter?

659
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,686
Father Kim.

660
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,898
Stop it, Songsak.

661
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:01,982
-Stop!
-Stay still.

662
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,568
Darn it!

663
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,737
I'm not even surprised anymore.

664
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,905
Hello.

665
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,824
-Hello.
-Hello.

666
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,243
He hasn't changed at all
in the past five years.

667
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,078
Hey, hey. My goodness.

668
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,746
Here.

669
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:17,540
I'm sorry.

670
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,208
Wipe your mouth.

671
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,254
Gosh, Detective Gu.

672
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,839
What's with the frown?

673
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,758
I miss Animal Farm every week.

674
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:31,053
If you want to go to heaven,
watch the rerun.

675
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,763
And don't doze off during Mass.

676
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,931
I won't.

677
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,558
I'll be in REM sleep.

678
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,059
You little…

679
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,815
By the way, what are you going to do
about the instructor position

680
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,817
at Busan Major Seminary?

681
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,778
I'm not sure
I have much to offer the students.

682
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,489
All I'd do is discipline them.

683
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,159
If you were to become their instructor,

684
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,413
it'd be a daily journey
to Golgotha for them.

685
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,419
Sangyeon. Lee Sangyeon?

686
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,962
Antonio.

687
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,046
Oh.

688
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,674
Sister Kim. Father Kim.

689
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,468
Goodness.

690
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,137
I heard from your mother earlier

691
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,931
that you weren't coming
because you weren't feeling well.

692
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:17,433
I'm okay.

693
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,059
You can take today off.

694
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,312
James will stand in for you today.

695
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,856
It's okay. I can do it.

696
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,149
Listen to Father Han.

697
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,027
You don't look well.

698
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,111
I'm fine.

699
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,030
I'll head inside.

700
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:39,997
Sangyeon.

701
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,707
You don't have to push yourself.

702
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,167
I'm okay.

703
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,753
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

704
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,465
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

705
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,390
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

706
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,267
Amen.

707
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,019
The Lord be with you.

708
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,064
And also with you.

709
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,204
I once asked
Father Lee Yeongjun this question.

710
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:24,667
"What kind of world do you wish to see?"

711
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,462
And his answer was,

712
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,924
"A world where I don't seek the Lord."

713
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,886
A world where the weak
do not see themselves as weak

714
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,471
and thus do not seek the Lord,

715
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:38,931
and ultimately,

716
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,811
all clergy become free of their duties.

717
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,192
What do we have to do
for such a world to exist?

718
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,946
-We need to…
-We need to live diligently.

719
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,739
In order for such a world to exist,

720
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,367
we must all become equal.

721
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,411
Uh…

722
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:03,330
There are many forms of equality,

723
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,084
but there is one
that I believe is most important.

724
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,921
It's the equality of punishment.

725
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,304
Everyone should be punished equally
for committing a sin,

726
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,973
whether they have power or not.

727
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,809
Why should the severity vary
based on one's power?

728
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,522
Punishment isn't some wild-caught fish!

729
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,024
Why should the weight differ at all?

730
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,069
If this situation persists,

731
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,573
this problem will never go away. Why?

732
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,243
Because deep down, people want inequality.

733
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,829
They themselves want to be at the top!

734
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,414
Am I wrong?

735
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,041
Am I?

736
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,834
Please speak up.

737
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:52,087
Show of hands for those who disagree.

738
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,922
If you've never thought such a thing…

739
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,970
Liar. You liar!

740
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,222
Detective Gu, go back to sleep.

741
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,813
I misspoke to a believer.

742
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,982
Please forgive my sins

743
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,027
and give me the courage
to fight against myself.

744
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,153
Amen.

745
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,285
The body of Christ.

746
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,787
-Amen.
-Amen.

747
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,372
The body of Christ.

748
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,456
- Amen.
- Amen.

749
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,000
The body of Christ.

750
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,002
Amen.

751
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,545
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

752
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,467
- Amen.
- Oh, no!

753
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,302
-Sangyeon!
-Antonio!

754
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,054
- Oh, no.
- What's going on?

755
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,972
- Someone fainted.
- Sangyeon!

756
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,558
Sangyeon. Sangyeon!

757
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,352
Wake up, Sangyeon.

758
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,561
-Sangyeon!
-Sangyeon!

759
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,522
This is Gudam Church.

760
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,524
- Put him on my back.
- Please help.

761
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,858
-Please help.
-Be careful.

762
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,235
-Please step aside.
-Here.

763
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,945
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

764
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:01,824
Please move aside!

765
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,208
- He has congenital heart disease.
- Check his BP.

766
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,292
Charge to 200 joules.

767
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,920
- It's charged.
- One, two. Step aside. Shoot!

768
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,173
- It's charged.
- Shoot.

769
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:20,676
Shoot.

770
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,149
It's my sin.

771
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,236
I brought him into this world ill.

772
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,114
Sister.

773
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,658
Don't say that.

774
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,369
There is no such sin in the world.

775
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,580
Don't worry. He'll be okay.

776
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,543
Doctor.

777
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,086
How's Sangyeon?

778
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,298
He suffered brain damage
due to cardiac arrest caused by shock.

779
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,258
He's in a coma.

780
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,342
What?

781
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,514
He's not brain-dead, right?

782
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,516
No, he's not.

783
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,186
However, his chances
of regaining consciousness are very low.

784
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,692
Sangyeon.

785
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,821
Oh, no, Sangyeon.

786
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,578
Oh, no.

787
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:48,764
Hello.

788
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,975
I'll be the altar server starting today.

789
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,061
My name is Lee Sangyeon,
also known as Antonio,

790
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,730
and I'm in Grade 2, Class 3
at Gudam Elementary School.

791
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,482
Nice to meet you, Sangyeon.

792
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,527
Is this uncomfortable?

793
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,196
No, it's okay.

794
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,616
But my neck itches a little.

795
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:10,661
You'll get used to it.

796
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:11,745
Don't worry.

797
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,456
I look forward to your assistance,
Antonio Lee Sangyeon.

798
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,875
-Thank you.
-Sure thing.

799
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,461
Can you tell me what comes next,

800
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,546
Antonio Lee Sangyeon?

801
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,552
I wonder why he's so tired.

802
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,388
What do you need
to fight off your sleepiness?

803
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,472
The will!

804
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,351
You need it to resist sleeping
even when you're tired.

805
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,529
Rebound.

806
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,253
I just had a talk with the doctor.

807
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,880
What do we do?

808
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:03,964
What is it?

809
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,013
They did a complete checkup
because he has a heart disease,

810
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,264
and the cause of the shock…

811
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,017
was a hepanyl overdose.

812
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,687
What's that?

813
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,480
Shh.

814
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,152
It's a type of drug.

815
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:26,904
Sorry?

816
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,739
What?

817
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,324
Did you say drug?

818
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,700
Yes.

819
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,663
Are you saying Sangyeon did drugs?

820
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,757
I see everyone's here.

821
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,675
- Hello, sir.
- Take a seat.

822
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,762
Cho, I know you're short-staffed,
so we'll cover for the narcotics team.

823
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,430
That'd be great for us.

824
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,140
We need to track down the seller first,

825
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,392
so we need to look into the school
and its surroundings.

826
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,603
Can your team do that?

827
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:02,439
But it's the weekend,
so we can only start tomorrow.

828
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,816
Okay,
then we'll collect CCTV footage

829
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,109
from his school and home

830
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,361
and retrace his route.

831
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,445
Yes, sir.

832
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,073
By the way, we couldn't find his phone.

833
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,534
He might've lost it,
or someone might've stolen it.

834
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,829
Check his social media, internet searches,
and cryptocurrency holdings.

835
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,748
Most transactions these days

836
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:22,334
are done through social media
and the dark web using cryptocurrency.

837
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,877
As for the sellers,

838
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,047
they usually target CCTV blind spots
or do drop-offs at marked locations.

839
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,424
So it's highly likely
that they won't appear in the footage.

840
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,303
How does a priest know so much about this?

841
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,846
He's very knowledgeable.

842
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,098
You heard him, right?

843
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,308
- Dismissed. Father Kim!
- Goodbye, sir.

844
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,727
Your strawberry smoothie is ready.

845
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,355
The strawberries were too cold last time.

846
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,399
It made the drink really icy.

847
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,276
The strawberries aren't
as frozen today, so it should be fine.

848
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,279
What is this?

849
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,531
It's so smooth.

850
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,241
It's perfect. Have a good day.

851
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,494
Drugs have become
a serious social issue worldwide.

852
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,747
Recently, a highly hallucinogenic
and addictive drug

853
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,041
has been secretly spreading
among teenagers in our country.

854
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,794
A teenager in Gudam-gu
is in critical condition

855
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,672
after consuming hepanyl,
leaving the public in shock.

856
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,674
-Gudam-gu?
-Lee fainted during Mass…

857
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,426
-You're kidding me.
-…at Gudam Church

858
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:13,552
from a drug-induced shock

859
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,345
and is now in critical condition
at the hospital.

860
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,557
-I knew this would happen!
-To this, Gudam Police…

861
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,475
Middle schooler collapses from drug shock
at Gudam Church

862
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,478
It says hepanyl usage
led to a heart attack and cardiac arrest,

863
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,397
which led to brain damage.

864
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,860
It says the shock was worse
because of his congenital heart disease.

865
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:34,114
What kind of kid with a heart disease
gets his hands on drugs?

866
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,867
New Era Unification Party
Chairman Kim Mancheon

867
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,788
Yes, Chairman Kim. It's me.

868
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,458
Goodness, Prosecutor Nam.

869
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,877
I was going to give you a call.

870
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:49,546
Good work.

871
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:52,632
I'll send him to the States
when he comes back to Seoul.

872
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:53,842
Right.

873
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,553
I think it's best that you do that.

874
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,806
By the way, sir.

875
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,808
Do you, by any chance,

876
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,935
know anyone
in the Drug Investigation Division

877
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,312
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

878
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,773
Yeah, I do.

879
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,025
Do you need someone high up?

880
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,485
Yes, sir.

881
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,528
That's no problem.

882
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:17,199
They're all my juniors.

883
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,909
Well, in that case,

884
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,495
could you help me out this time?

885
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:24,581
There's not much on his social media.

886
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,750
It's just stuff
about studying and academies.

887
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,170
Check if he has another account
just in case.

888
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,254
Okay.

889
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,423
Excuse me.

890
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:35,217
How can I help you?

891
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,095
We're from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
Drug Investigation Division.

892
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,013
I see.

893
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,973
What brings you here?

894
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:45,727
We're here to take over
the hepanyl drug case.

895
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,895
What?

896
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,021
Take over?

897
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,314
What are you talking about?

898
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,608
Why would they take over the case?

899
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,861
Don't they handle drug deals, smuggling,
and distribution over five million won?

900
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,530
Apparently, there was already a team

901
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,907
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
investigating this case.

902
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,576
They say it's linked
to a large-scale drug smuggling case.

903
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,995
They make up reasons for everything.

904
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,330
But wouldn't it be more efficient

905
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,666
for the local jurisdiction
to investigate this case?

906
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,209
It seems to involve a local crime group.

907
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,545
That's what I told them.

908
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,421
But they were very adamant,

909
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:14,548
and they said
they were following the rules.

910
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,219
Why…

911
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,473
are they always like this?

912
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,517
This is driving me insane.

913
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,561
We have to see this through
for Sangyeon's sake.

914
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,730
From what we know so far,
he has no connections to a drug cartel.

915
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,942
There's no way he would've
voluntarily consumed the drug.

916
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,777
That's what I hope too.

917
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,737
But you never know with kids these days.

918
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,447
I've known him since he was young.

919
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,700
He never missed a single Mass.

920
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,912
He may be young,
but he's not easily influenced like that.

921
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,706
Holy altar boy Lee…

922
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,333
is a good kid.

923
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,885
I don't like this feeling.

924
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,262
It's as if a bidet was aimed
at my right butt cheek.

925
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,181
No, it's more like the toilet exploded.

926
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,432
Do you have any leads?

927
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,936
Local police should investigate
drug cases like this

928
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,813
due to the prevalence
of small local crime groups.

929
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,191
Exactly, they're petty
compared to large organizations.

930
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,985
But those at the Prosecutors' Office
are acting like

931
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,486
they're after a major drug lord.

932
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,863
You're right.
They're unnecessarily secretive

933
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,364
and quick to take control.

934
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,825
They're either trying to stop something
from getting exposed…

935
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,493
Or they're trying to cover something up.

936
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:33,251
Anyway, either way, somehow,
we'll find out tomorrow.

937
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,586
If they're actually investigating,

938
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,214
they'll look into Sangyeon's house,
school, and neighborhood.

939
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,758
If our assumption is correct,
there will be no media coverage.

940
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,259
It'll be completely silent.

941
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:48,266
Gudam Brother Fishing

942
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,976
You idiot. Hey.

943
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,147
Damn it, that hurts.

944
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,650
Why is your skin so thick?

945
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,401
I'm sorry, Gerald.

946
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,655
From what I heard,

947
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:04,115
that kid has congenital heart disease.

948
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,159
I really didn't know.

949
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,452
Please forgive me.

950
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,204
Next time,

951
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:12,540
make sure to either kill
or bury kids like that.

952
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,251
Got it, Sitae?

953
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,710
Okay.

954
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,761
By the way,
is it okay to continue selling?

955
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:28,139
The people in Busan told me not to,
but just keep at it.

956
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,432
Okay.

957
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,226
But it was even on the news.

958
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,978
-What if we get caught?
-Hey.

959
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,397
The worst that can happen
is you go to juvie.

960
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,276
Sitae, the law is on your side.

961
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,611
Got it.

962
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,753
Gudam-gu teenager hepanyl

963
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,465
News

964
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,011
Gudam Middle School teenage boy…

965
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,721
This article has been deleted
at the publisher's request.

966
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,353
Darn it.

967
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,064
Do you know the kid from our school

968
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,357
who got caught using drugs?

969
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,026
Is that true?
They're not rumors?

970
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,279
If they were, why would a kid
like Lee Sangyeon skip school?

971
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,488
It's Lee Sangyeon?

972
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,698
I heard he'd get high at school.

973
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,326
I dug through his locker
because I was curious.

974
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,037
- Did you find drugs?
- No, the teacher caught me.

975
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,208
So he's been doing well in his studies
because of the drugs?

976
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:41,421
Yeah. Apparently, someone saw him
all drugged up last time.

977
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,505
Hey.

978
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:45,550
Who saw the comments on social media?

979
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,760
-I saw them.
-I did.

980
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,512
Apparently, his older brother
used to do drugs too.

981
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,597
Seriously?

982
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,099
Yeah, they're total druggies!

983
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,392
Hey!

984
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,107
Who does well in school because of drugs?

985
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,609
Tell me.

986
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:07,113
Who exactly is giving you
all this information?

987
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:10,784
Give me a name!

988
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:13,828
You, over there.

989
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,747
Comment on your school's social media

990
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,833
and mention
that Sangyeon is an only child.

991
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,714
Sure.

992
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,259
We don't know
if Sangyeon actually did drugs or not.

993
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,929
Strangers can criticize
without knowing the truth.

994
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,681
But you're his friends.
Shouldn't you stand up for him?

995
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,156
You should transfer, you druggie

996
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,075
Is it fun to have something to criticize

997
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,828
rather than bothering to know the truth?

998
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,164
How pathetic of you.

999
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:02,293
Blindly criticizing someone
is no better than doing drugs.

1000
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,797
It feels good, doesn't it?

1001
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,509
But the second you start doing it,

1002
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,928
you miss your chance…

1003
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,014
at becoming a decent person.

1004
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,645
Father Kim!

1005
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,900
You're Father Kim Haeil, right?

1006
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:32,031
Sangyeon always told me
that you're his role model.

1007
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,202
The day before Sangyeon fainted,

1008
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,121
we talked on the phone.

1009
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:43,543
He called me on his landline
because someone had taken his cell phone.

1010
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,837
What did he say?

1011
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,672
Jang Sitae.

1012
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,632
Jang Sitae.

1013
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:53,470
It sounded like he was in a lot of pain

1014
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,014
and just kept repeating "Jang Sitae"
before hanging up.

1015
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:58,641
He didn't say anything else?

1016
00:57:58,725 --> 00:57:59,893
No.

1017
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:00,977
Jang Sitae.

1018
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,730
It sounds like someone's name.

1019
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:07,150
-Do you know this person?
-No, not at all.

1020
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:08,985
I see.

1021
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:11,863
Did you tell anyone else about this?

1022
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,114
No.

1023
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,116
Thanks for telling me.

1024
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,327
I'm glad he has a friend like you, Wangyu.

1025
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,829
One second.

1026
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,624
Night Guy

1027
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,918
Hello?

1028
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,045
Father Kim, where are you?

1029
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,379
None of your business. What is it?

1030
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,590
Come to the church.
I have something to show you.

1031
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,758
Right now?

1032
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:38,556
Drop-off

1033
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,935
Drug transaction

1034
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,271
What's all this?

1035
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,940
Uh…

1036
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:49,567
I asked Songsak to do something for me.

1037
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,944
Songsak, can you do me a favor?

1038
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,278
I need the deliverymen to--

1039
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:54,989
Deal.

1040
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,914
Are you ready?

1041
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,457
Yes!

1042
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:06,543
Let's go!

1043
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:12,799
I told them
to take pictures of anything suspicious

1044
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,968
while they were on duty.

1045
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:18,680
Especially if they see anyone
doing anything in a dark alley.

1046
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,767
People often do sketchy things
away from their homes.

1047
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:25,228
You see them taking things out,
all suspicious.

1048
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,272
The weather is just great.

1049
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:33,027
I told them to take pictures
of everything and anything suspicious.

1050
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,696
Look at you, Team Leader Gu.

1051
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,822
So you weren't slacking off.

1052
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:36,990
I told you so.

1053
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,074
I'm the Night Guy.

1054
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,242
Yeah!

1055
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,368
Good work, Songsak.

1056
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,120
Not at all.

1057
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,539
I'm Gudam's honorary police officer,
after all.

1058
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,749
It was my plan. You should compliment me.

1059
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:51,713
Are there really this many people
doing drugs in Gudam-gu?

1060
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:54,799
Those who took over the case
are intentionally not investigating.

1061
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,552
This is how much we found
with minimal investigation.

1062
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,345
I'm sure they know this too.

1063
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,307
They investigate other cases.
Why aren't they investigating this one?

1064
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,144
Calm down. We'll look into it.

1065
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,272
-Father Han.
-I'm sorry.

1066
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,691
It's okay. We'll look for the guy
who sold the drugs to Sangyeon first.

1067
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:15,236
By the way, why are we investigating
such a scary case?

1068
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,030
You want to know why?

1069
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,450
Same reason as five years ago.

1070
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,619
Because those who are responsible
aren't investigating it.

1071
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,829
Then we should investigate.

1072
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:28,124
-Like old times!
-Like old times, here we go!

1073
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:31,252
Now, what do we do?

1074
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:34,088
I'm sorry.

1075
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,926
Just keep an eye
on the locations in these pictures.

1076
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,267
- Have you been well?
- Hello.

1077
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,020
Those who do drugs
are bound to do them again.

1078
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,813
The suppliers will show themselves.

1079
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,238
-Hey, babe. Were you waiting for me?
-You're here.

1080
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,160
Darn you.

1081
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,580
Come on.

1082
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,874
I didn't need to see that.

1083
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:18,925
Hello.

1084
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:23,179
My vision is blurry.

1085
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,557
Oh.

1086
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,147
What's a student doing at this hour?

1087
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,696
Okay.

1088
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,575
The devil's powder?

1089
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,245
Got you.

1090
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:54,293
Nice.

1091
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,046
- It's fresh.
- Thank you.

1092
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,467
One, two, three, four, five…

1093
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,262
-I don't know!
-Just do it later.

1094
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,806
We've reached the climax,
so stop racking your brain

1095
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,057
and just enjoy the feeling.

1096
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:09,308
All right.

1097
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:11,561
Let's do it later!

1098
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:15,022
-Make it rain!
-Yeah!

1099
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:17,108
Hey, drink up.

1100
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,735
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1101
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:20,570
Sitae!

1102
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,657
Sitae!

1103
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,245
What? Did we teleport
to a church or something?

1104
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,622
Jang Sitae!

1105
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:35,084
It's basic manners
to respond to an adult.

1106
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:36,919
What are you on about?

1107
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,216
-Are you the drug seller, Sitae?
-Yeah, that's me.

1108
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,595
-Are you a priest?
-Yeah, that's me.

1109
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,265
Why do you have those?

1110
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,393
They're mine.

1111
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,358
I got these for him as a birthday gift.

1112
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,256
You little punks.

1113
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,175
Don't you have adults to buy you gifts?

1114
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,018
I wouldn't recommend going that way.

1115
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,855
-Out of my way!
-Move!

1116
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,235
Damn it!

1117
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:45,780
Who are you?

1118
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:47,114
Me? Night Guy.

1119
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,533
You should be honored.

1120
01:03:49,283 --> 01:03:51,786
I'm Songsak Thekarattanapurasat.

1121
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:58,459
You're the one
who gave the drugs to Sangyeon, right?

1122
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,379
Who's Sangyeon?

1123
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,757
Yes, it was me!

1124
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,599
He didn't buy them, did he?

1125
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,979
We both just got unlucky.

1126
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,313
Unlucky?

1127
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,066
I was selling drugs
to someone else that day.

1128
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,944
No one was tailing you, right?

1129
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,363
It was supposed to be a drop-off,

1130
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,448
but we couldn't find a spot.

1131
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:31,951
So we met up with the buyer in person.

1132
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,035
But…

1133
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,453
Spread the word at school.

1134
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:35,788
Okay. Thank you.

1135
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:37,415
Hey.

1136
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:39,292
- Damn it.
- What the hell?

1137
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,326
-Damn it!
-Get him!

1138
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,037
Shit.

1139
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:29,050
Gudam Middle School,
Year 3, Class 4, Lee Sangyeon.

1140
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,138
We could've been good friends
if you hadn't run away.

1141
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,514
Don't you agree?

1142
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,767
I deleted all the pictures.

1143
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,185
It's no use.

1144
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,228
It'll all be recovered through forensics.

1145
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,189
- Just get rid of it.
- Ah.

1146
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,107
Right, forgot about that.

1147
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,609
Sorry in advance.

1148
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:51,489
You guys…

1149
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,325
will all get caught one day.

1150
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,077
You're a brave one, aren't you?

1151
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,579
We won't beat you up.
Why would we waste our energy?

1152
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,081
Instead…

1153
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,458
you're on our side now.

1154
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,671
Hey.

1155
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,924
- Let go of me. Let go!
- Let's go eat!

1156
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:14,720
It's good stuff.

1157
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,185
- Eat it.
- That's it.

1158
01:06:21,268 --> 01:06:22,687
Swallow it.

1159
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:29,819
Run!

1160
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:05,896
Why did you do it?

1161
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:07,690
Because…

1162
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,276
they get addicted and come back for more.

1163
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:12,528
That's how they become true druggies!

1164
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:14,447
Right?

1165
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,324
You guys are absolute trash.

1166
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:20,077
Is being shameless the trend these days?

1167
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,370
The most important question is…

1168
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,748
who's your supplier?

1169
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,708
Please don't ask that.

1170
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,627
-That's the only question I have.
-I'm dead if I tell you!

1171
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,880
I promise you that if you don't tell me,

1172
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,715
I'll be the one to kill you.

1173
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:33,799
Come on.

1174
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:36,594
There's no way
a priest would kill someone.

1175
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,280
-The evil spirit of death has awakened!
-What's he doing?

1176
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,324
We're all dead!

1177
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:01,535
-Father, you can't let the spirit awaken.
-We're going to die?

1178
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,954
Many have already died, Father!

1179
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,831
Father, no!

1180
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,001
Listen.

1181
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,046
You think psychopaths can't be priests?

1182
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,006
Take a look at that one.

1183
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,883
He's dying to go to hell.

1184
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:18,052
No human can hit their own head like that.

1185
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,471
There he goes again.

1186
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,431
He's going to come for you next.

1187
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,100
Be gone!

1188
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,018
-Here he comes.
-Go away!

1189
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,394
One, two…

1190
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:30,439
Three. Father Kim, we're ready.

1191
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,025
Be gone, evil spirits! Go away!

1192
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,528
Gerald!

1193
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,035
Did you just say "jerk"?

1194
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,411
I-I didn't.

1195
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,747
The supplier's name is Gerald.

1196
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:49,834
G-E-R-A-L-D.

1197
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:50,918
Gerald.

1198
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:53,712
Is the spelling correct?

1199
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,102
What is it?

1200
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:13,190
We'd like to ask you something.

1201
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,944
Watch out!

1202
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,781
Go easy!

1203
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:23,450
- We didn't get any answers out of him yet.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1204
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:24,910
I think this is the place.

1205
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,791
You're so passionate.

1206
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,585
- Hey, kid.
- Yes?

1207
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,461
Come here.

1208
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,926
-Get inside.
-Okay.

1209
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:46,891
You're dead if you run away.

1210
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,684
Okay.

1211
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:55,482
Oh.

1212
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,942
We're looking for someone.

1213
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:58,611
Where's Gerald?

1214
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,112
What is he, your friend?

1215
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:04,116
-Who are you?
-Put out the cigarette, you punk.

1216
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:06,619
We're the police.
We're here for Gerald, you punk.

1217
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,287
Damn it.

1218
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,664
- Get out here!
- Is he offended?

1219
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,087
Bring it on.

1220
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,765
Oh. We're quite in sync today.

1221
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:30,142
Oh. I'm going to look for Gerald.

1222
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,644
-You take care of them.
-Go on.

1223
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,479
Gerald!

1224
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:34,855
Bring it on.

1225
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:42,947
Darn it. Wait.

1226
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,156
- Let's try that again.
- Again?

1227
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,284
Gerald, where are you?

1228
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:55,751
Ah. I'm just looking for someone.
What a warm welcome.

1229
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,170
Hey, get your weapons!

1230
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,133
Do you know where Gerald is?

1231
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,189
I've got a Night Head.

1232
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,830
Let's see if you can headbutt this.

1233
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:33,998
Try it!

1234
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,167
Father Kim!

1235
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:39,920
Father Kim!

1236
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,339
- Get down.
- Oh.

1237
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:49,638
Ah, Father Kim.

1238
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,308
-You okay?
-My back hurts now.

1239
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,478
Damn it.

1240
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,563
Who the hell are you?

1241
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,531
Gerald!

1242
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,524
Oh, shit.

1243
01:12:49,948 --> 01:12:51,283
Who is it? A cop?

1244
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,369
No, he's not a cop.

1245
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:55,245
He looks like the Grim Reaper.

1246
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,623
What are you saying? Get the car ready.

1247
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,133
He's here. He's here.

1248
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,532
Are you Gerald?

1249
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:34,743
Oh, jeez.
You really do look like the Grim Reaper.

1250
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,541
Cut the crap, Gerald.

1251
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,385
You should've done
some mental imagery training.

1252
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,103
Never watched Oldboy, have you?

1253
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,313
With all due respect…

1254
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:05,983
…please don't hurt me!

1255
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,904
Back up.

1256
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,031
And back down you go.

1257
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,450
896.

1258
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,953
Can't you read the room?

1259
01:14:18,036 --> 01:14:19,371
897.

1260
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,250
898.

1261
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:25,961
899.

1262
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:29,173
That's the end of your ride. 900.

1263
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,257
Seriously.

1264
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:32,926
I really don't know.

1265
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:37,431
I just received a text
before I get sent the goods.

1266
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:38,557
Hey.

1267
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,017
That doesn't make any sense.

1268
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,644
Why would they send you drugs
when they don't even know you?

1269
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,730
That's how it works these days.

1270
01:14:45,355 --> 01:14:47,608
They do a background check on the dark web

1271
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:49,193
and if they think we're fit for it,

1272
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:52,779
they send us the goods
and we build credit.

1273
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:57,034
- Hey, squat properly!
- I'm sorry, sir.

1274
01:14:57,117 --> 01:14:58,619
- You little brats.
- I'll do better.

1275
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,289
What about the phone number?

1276
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,001
Phone…

1277
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:07,669
Ah. Oy.

1278
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:11,632
Wake up!

1279
01:15:13,425 --> 01:15:15,135
- Continue.
- Gosh, that scared me.

1280
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:19,306
Phone number.

1281
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:20,849
It changes every time.

1282
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,976
They use at least 20 to 30 burner phones.

1283
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:26,605
They have an emergency system in place
and are on standby 24/7.

1284
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,106
What are you, the fire station?

1285
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:30,817
All you do is sell drugs.

1286
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:34,780
This is the least we can do
to make a living for ourselves.

1287
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,532
Anything else you can tell us?

1288
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:38,367
Perhaps the name of the organization
or a nickname?

1289
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,495
I don't know. I told you, I don't know.

1290
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:43,622
This little…

1291
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,668
I'm really dizzy.

1292
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,752
Hang in there.

1293
01:15:49,586 --> 01:15:50,587
Once the blood stops flowing,

1294
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:53,131
you'll start feeling hazy
and die without any pain.

1295
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,009
It was short-lived,
but thanks for a fun and nasty time.

1296
01:15:58,762 --> 01:15:59,763
I know.

1297
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:01,890
Why don't we go watch some TV?

1298
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:04,476
-Let's take this popcorn with us.
-Sounds good.

1299
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,646
There's more downstairs. I'll bring it.

1300
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:10,440
Hey, watch your form.
Let's go.

1301
01:16:10,524 --> 01:16:12,693
How long
do we have to do this for, Father?

1302
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,070
Busan Fire Eel!

1303
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:25,122
What else do you know?

1304
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:28,250
I swear that's all I know. Busan Fire Eel.

1305
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,919
They never revealed their nickname to me.

1306
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:35,048
But they accidentally mentioned it
while chatting on the dark web.

1307
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:37,593
And I pretended not to notice.

1308
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:51,064
Busan Fire Eel?

1309
01:16:52,524 --> 01:16:54,359
The name sounds very tasty.

1310
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,444
Are they from Gijang?

1311
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,780
Busan Fire Eel, huh?

1312
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:15,213
Freeze!

1313
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,257
We're from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
Drug Investigation Division.

1314
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:18,508
If you move, we'll…

1315
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,637
What's all this?

1316
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:37,444
You might want to go downstairs.

1317
01:17:37,527 --> 01:17:38,528
What's the matter?

1318
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:41,365
Reporters have appeared out of nowhere.

1319
01:17:42,157 --> 01:17:43,200
What?

1320
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:50,707
Damn it.

1321
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,711
That doesn't make any sense.

1322
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,005
If it's neither the police
nor the prosecution,

1323
01:17:57,089 --> 01:17:59,841
how did three people catch
a drug ring of 18 people?

1324
01:17:59,925 --> 01:18:00,926
Who are these people?

1325
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,552
According to these guys,

1326
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,971
one was disguised as a priest,

1327
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,140
another one seemed like
a Southeast Asian gang member,

1328
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,434
and the other…

1329
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,103
…looked rather rough.

1330
01:18:12,396 --> 01:18:13,980
What are they, a traveling theater troupe?

1331
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:17,109
Jeez. All right.

1332
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,278
Send my regards
to the director too, please.

1333
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:24,282
And as for the guys you caught today,
we'll take care of them.

1334
01:18:24,825 --> 01:18:26,118
Good work.

1335
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:30,997
Who are these bastards?

1336
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:38,839
Lord,

1337
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:41,299
please save Sangyeon from this pain,

1338
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:44,219
and help him recover

1339
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,473
so that he can stand before you
in good health.

1340
01:18:49,349 --> 01:18:51,727
In Jesus' name we pray.

1341
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,021
Amen.

1342
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:34,060
Don't just smile like that.

1343
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,480
Tell me the truth.

1344
01:19:36,813 --> 01:19:38,440
What is the Lord saying?

1345
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,612
Is there a reason
why he's putting Sangyeon through this?

1346
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,155
Is there?

1347
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,324
Why Sangyeon, of all people?

1348
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:51,328
Get some rest.

1349
01:20:02,839 --> 01:20:04,257
Come on now.

1350
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:07,219
I knew you'd do this. I just knew it!

1351
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:09,304
You never just let it slide, do you?

1352
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:10,847
Father Lee!

1353
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,474
Seriously.

1354
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,227
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1355
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:24,069
So what now? Do we keep going or not?

1356
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,445
Either way,

1357
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:29,783
you caught the guys
who put Sangyeon in that state.

1358
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:33,245
You even found out who the supplier is,
so I think you've done enough.

1359
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,166
Well…

1360
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,001
What's bothering you?

1361
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:43,964
Just say it, will you?
This is so frustrating.

1362
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:47,592
What would…

1363
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,180
Father Lee have done
in a situation like this?

1364
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,519
We've been with you long enough
to know what that means.

1365
01:20:57,602 --> 01:21:02,148
There's only one thing
that question can imply.

1366
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:04,693
It means you're going to
get yourself involved

1367
01:21:04,776 --> 01:21:05,777
in something dangerous.

1368
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:07,487
You're going to do as you please.

1369
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:09,155
Even if we try to stop you!

1370
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:11,533
You're going to see it through
no matter what!

1371
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:12,701
That's what you're saying!

1372
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:17,873
Everyone.

1373
01:21:18,623 --> 01:21:21,167
You all know me too well.

1374
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,254
-Father Kim!
-Father Kim! Where are you going?

1375
01:21:24,337 --> 01:21:27,257
-Father Kim!
-Where are you going?

1376
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:34,472
Busan Fire Eel…

1377
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:36,850
is probably in Busan, right?

1378
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:38,393
-Come on.
-Come on.

1379
01:21:38,476 --> 01:21:41,104
Obviously! Where else would they be?

1380
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,778
Gu Daeyoung!

1381
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:49,988
-Detective Gu!
-Sister Kim.

1382
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:51,448
-That's not what's important!
-Sister Kim.

1383
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:54,492
- Come here!
- Sister Kim, calm down.

1384
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:00,749
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm not wrong, am I?

1385
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:04,502
-Busan Fire Eel, so Busan.
-Don't you realize how dangerous it is?

1386
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:07,380
-I only spoke facts!
-You should be stopping him!

1387
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:10,884
-Busan Fire Eel, so Busan!
-That's not important!

1388
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:13,219
Father Kim!

1389
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:18,308
Hello, Gwangalli Beach

1390
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,152
Busan Station

1391
01:24:20,388 --> 01:24:23,391
#Sometime five months ago
with the Gudam Crew

1392
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,476
This looks great.

1393
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:26,561
- This one's ready, Father Han?
- Yeah, just flip it.

1394
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,229
Father Kim!

1395
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:31,066
Try this.

1396
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:33,068
Nice. Oh Yohan!

1397
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:34,986
For me.

1398
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:38,948
-Oh, come on.
-Mmm!

1399
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,700
You can eat the vegetables.

1400
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:41,785
Hmm?

1401
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:43,578
But I like sausage.

1402
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:45,413
It's hot.

1403
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:54,214
Oh, no.

1404
01:24:55,381 --> 01:24:57,717
You should've been careful.

1405
01:24:57,801 --> 01:24:58,802
Hey!

1406
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:00,553
My eye…

1407
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:03,431
- My mistake.
- Is my eye okay?

1408
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:05,892
Oh, no, I think it's going to swell!

1409
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:07,268
Mistake, mistake.

1410
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,689
Father Kim.

1411
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:13,942
Why'd you pick that up? Put it down.

1412
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:16,694
Mistake?

1413
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,404
It was an accident.
Put that down.

1414
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:20,156
Father Kim.

1415
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,575
Father Kim!

1416
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:27,789
Oh, please stop.

1417
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:29,833
Goodness.

1418
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,962
Don't come this way. Stay away.

1419
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:35,713
You're going to get hurt!

1420
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:53,815
Calm down. My mistake.

1421
01:25:58,027 --> 01:26:00,113
A zombie?

1422
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,955
- I'll pull that out for you.
- Oh, no!

1423
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:10,832
Don't turn around!

1424
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:15,670
-Hurry up and take it out!
-No, leave it in!

1425
01:26:15,753 --> 01:26:17,672
-Don't come here!
-Stay away!

1426
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:19,966
Please don't come closer!

1427
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:21,426
- That's disgusting!
- What do we do?

1428
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:27,682
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1429
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:30,268
It's too dangerous for you to join me.

1430
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:32,604
I'll take care of this by myself.

1431
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:34,147
Jeez, Kim Haeil!

1432
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:35,398
Just you wait.

1433
01:26:35,481 --> 01:26:38,568
Did Father Kim call?

1434
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:40,778
Let's think of something!

1435
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,697
Who are they?

1436
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,032
You as an instructor?

1437
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,910
Why?
Can't I be an instructor?

1438
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:49,329
This is Father Michael Kim Haeil,

1439
01:26:49,412 --> 01:26:51,706
your life guidance instructor.

1440
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:53,791
Starting tomorrow morning,
we will begin a hellish training regimen!

1441
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:56,294
What is this?

1442
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:58,296
You must be
really scared of him, Boss Park.

1443
01:26:58,379 --> 01:26:59,839
Sir, sir!

1444
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:00,924
Hello, sir!

1445
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,842
He's on a whole other level.

1446
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,178
He's a true warrior and hero.

1447
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,721
Just do as I say.

1448
01:27:06,804 --> 01:27:07,847
Let's focus on our luxury items.

1449
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:11,309
Get off your high horse
and just do as I say.

1450
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:13,895
Things are different
in the drug rings these days.

1451
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:16,814
- They can't do anything?
- Sorry?

1452
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:18,191
Did you find out where Fire Eel is?

1453
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:19,901
Hallelujah!

1454
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:22,070
I found someone who knows him very well.

1455
01:27:22,153 --> 01:27:23,655
-Fire Eel?
-Fire!

1456
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:26,241
So where is that piece of trash?

1457
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:27,575
Can you say that as a priest?

1458
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,369
-A priest isn't a thug.
-Let's go!

1459
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:30,828
That's it.

1460
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:33,081
-Wait, wait, wait! No, wait!
-That's what I want to hear.

1461
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:34,999
-Fire Eel!
-Sir!

1462
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:39,379
-You're taking it off?
-Yeah, I've been too exposed.

1463
01:27:39,462 --> 01:27:41,089
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.

1464
01:27:41,172 --> 01:27:44,550
- Get lost.
- I'm here to fight against heresy.

1465
