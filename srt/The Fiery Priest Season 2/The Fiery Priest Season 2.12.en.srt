00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,253
The Fiery Priest Season 2

2
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,164
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,415
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,666
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,545
- They're here!
- The car's here.

8
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,130
They're here. They're here.

9
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,089
I'm very disappointed, Chairman Kim.

10
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,425
How could you let things get this bad?

11
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,677
This is nothing.

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,808
All you have to do is stick to the script.

13
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:43,186
Still, this thing is being broadcast
to the whole nation.

14
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,021
How embarrassing.

15
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,065
Oh, come now.

16
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,652
Prosecutor Nam, you know how this goes.

17
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,322
A hearing is just a performance.

18
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,282
You just need to put on a good show.

19
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,784
He's right.

20
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,411
The outcome's already decided.

21
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,497
Even so,

22
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,584
if the other side lands a good punch,
I'll get bruised.

23
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:11,381
If I get bruised,
the two of you will be bloodied.

24
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,008
Prosecutor Nam, I'm Kwon Namcheol.

25
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,343
I know how to get things done.

26
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:19,139
Really? Is that why you thought
to set fire to Gudam Temple?

27
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,932
Is it?

28
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,978
Make no mistakes.

29
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,771
None.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,608
I'm off.

31
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,995
How dare that dog
talk to a veteran Chairman that way?

32
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,121
Leave him be.

33
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,000
He's a dog with his teeth
around our throats.

34
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,254
Departmental Chief Prosecutor Nam Duhun

35
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,548
Hello.

36
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:04,184
-Father Kim. Just ignore him.
-Hey, he just--

37
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,853
- Order in the assembly.
- Take a seat.

38
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,647
The Special
Investigative Committee's hearing

39
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,484
on investigating allegations
of collusion with a drug cartel

40
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:18,239
and reduction of drug crime charges
for children of high-ranking officials

41
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,699
will now begin.

42
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,328
Chairman Yeom!

43
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,872
You better apologize now!

44
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,416
Apologize? For what?

45
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,628
We've just started.
What do I have to apologize for?

46
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,632
The color of your necktie
clearly indicates party ties.

47
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,842
Are you really making a big deal
about color?

48
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,594
Apologize now!

49
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:44,224
My daughter said
that real men wear neon green.

50
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,391
Don't take it the wrong way.

51
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,018
"Men wear neon green"?

52
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,104
Are you trying to emphasize
the gender divide?

53
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,608
My personal color is winter cool.

54
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,692
Personal color?

55
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,904
So now you're just blatantly showing
your true colors, aren't you?

56
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,322
Apologize now!

57
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,658
Damn it.

58
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,958
Witness, please take the oath.

59
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,126
"The oath."

60
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,963
"I solemnly swear
that I will tell the truth

61
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,216
in the National Assembly's investigation
on Prosecutor Nam Duhun's

62
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,968
alleged collusion with a drug cartel

63
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,388
and reducing drug crime charges
for children of high-ranking--"

64
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,515
Hold on. Prosecutor Nam?

65
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,101
Aren't you taking the oath?

66
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,229
Ah…

67
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:35,275
Unfortunately, I will not be able
to take the oath at this time.

68
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,110
What are you saying?

69
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,945
Are you kidding me right now?

70
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,613
Who do you think you are?

71
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,240
It's not that.

72
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,742
In specific situations,

73
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,828
like taking an oath
or swearing on something,

74
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,750
I faint due to the stress under pressure.

75
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,128
We'll wake you up if you faint.

76
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,380
Stand up and take the oath.

77
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm sorry, but this isn't a joke.

78
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,303
Once I wake up after fainting,

79
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,514
I'll spend two to three days
in a panic state

80
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,850
and will be completely unable to testify.

81
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,476
Cut the crap.

82
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,895
Who in the world has those symptoms?

83
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,772
You're making this up.

84
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,940
Father Kim.

85
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,066
That little…

86
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,572
I'll show you my doctor's diagnosis
regarding my symptoms.

87
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,580
"Reflex mediated syncope."

88
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,540
"Situational syncope"?

89
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,669
Aren't you sick and tired

90
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,713
of always having to show up
to these hearings in a wheelchair

91
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,465
or with some kind of doctor's diagnosis?

92
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,467
- This is nonsense!
- Excuse me!

93
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,093
Will you quiet down?

94
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,970
-I…
-Apologize now!

95
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,264
Why are you so obsessed with apologizing?

96
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,515
And I'm not the one to apologize.

97
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,434
The one who hasn't taken the oath should!

98
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,810
How dare you talk back to us?

99
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,188
-Be quiet.
-Watch your mouth!

100
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,773
Let's all settle down.

101
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,816
Father, please be quiet.

102
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,234
You can talk when you take the stand.

103
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,778
Okay.

104
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:05,948
Chairman Yeom, will you allow him
to get away with such brazen behavior?

105
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,326
What's brazen about it?

106
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,370
It's his right to refuse the oath.

107
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,662
Apologize now!

108
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,331
Order, order.

109
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,958
If a witness's reason
for not taking an oath

110
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,169
is deemed invalid in the future,

111
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,714
there will be a penalty
for refusing to take it.

112
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,218
Of course. I completely agree.

113
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,220
Wow, he's really something.

114
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,680
Let us continue the oath

115
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,099
without Prosecutor Nam Duhun.

116
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,810
"…and will accept the penalty of perjury."

117
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,686
"Witness Park Kyungsun."

118
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,902
On what grounds are you indicting
Prosecutor Nam Duhun?

119
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,988
I've submitted
over 300 pages worth of documents.

120
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,575
But aren't they all
just one-sided allegations?

121
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,369
There's no solid proof.

122
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,705
Isn't that why we're holding this hearing?

123
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,290
How dare you run your mouth like that?

124
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,750
Apologize now!

125
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,092
In order to help you all understand,
I've prepared a video.

126
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,595
What sort of video is it?

127
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,016
It's titled, "Go to hell, Nam Duhun."

128
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,270
Witness!

129
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:20,565
Are you joking right now?
This is a serious hearing!

130
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,941
Apologize now!

131
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,485
I'm sick of you telling me to apologize.

132
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,197
When you watch this video,

133
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,367
you'll see that Nam Duhun is total trash…

134
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,000
…that he is a bad person.

135
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,043
Start the video!

136
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,886
- Is that true?
- Yes.

137
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,220
Prosecutor Nam…

138
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,475
threw soju
over Chief Prosecutor Park's frozen body.

139
00:07:55,558 --> 00:08:00,146
How could someone do such a thing?

140
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,065
There's something in this honey jar.

141
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,400
Take a look.

142
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,568
"What's behind this honey jar?"

143
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,403
"Tails of Tales
Go to hell, Nam Duhun"

144
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,747
What is this?

145
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,459
A photo
of Chief Prosecutor Park's frozen corpse.

146
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,171
This is fake, right?

147
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,464
It's not real, is it?

148
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,674
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's real.

149
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,512
An undercover detective
who was investigating the drug cartel

150
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,263
secretly took that photo.

151
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:40,645
How could such a terrible photo
only just come to light?

152
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,146
This isn't all.

153
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,733
The way they got rid of the body
is so cruel,

154
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,985
it's hard to even put into words.

155
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,696
They disposed of it at a sturgeon farm.

156
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,449
A sturgeon farm? Then…

157
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,952
"Chief Prosecutor Park's body
was disposed of at a sturgeon farm"

158
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,413
I can't hear any more of this.

159
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,416
Then we'll look at the rest of his crimes
through this video.

160
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,255
Please hit play.

So what was that?

200
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,137
As I said earlier,

201
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,764
"Go to hell, Nam Duhun."

202
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,226
Go to hell, you bastard.

203
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,574
Live broadcast
of Prosecutor Nam Duhun's hearing

204
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,201
It's nice to finally see your face.

205
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,631
How's security?

206
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,884
It'll be hard for our vehicle
to even get close.

207
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,595
Security is tight in this country.

208
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,388
It'll be worse
when we get to the main building.

209
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,307
There's no way
to avoid the metal detectors.

210
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,103
All we have to do is get in.
Then we can go all out.

211
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,813
It's what we've always done.

212
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,192
It doesn't matter
if there are 100 of them.

213
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,277
We can take them all.

214
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,405
Prosecutor Nam Duhun.

215
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,494
Why are you being suspected
of colluding with a drug cartel?

216
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,456
The Uma Police Violent Crimes Team and I

217
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,626
were undercover,
investigating a drug ring.

218
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,170
I approached the head, Kim Hongsik,

219
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,924
to take him and all his suppliers
in Southeast Asia down.

220
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:27,807
The real undercover work was done by me,
Team Leader Gu Jayoung, and Bing Sangu.

221
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,891
In that process,

222
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,101
we found out about the relationship
between Nam and Kim Hongsik.

223
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,896
So for the purposes of your investigation,

224
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,107
you pretended to be
a rotten, corrupt prosecutor.

225
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,069
Wow, that is just brilliant.

226
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,695
Brilliant? As if.

227
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,614
It's not an act.
He really is rotten!

228
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,157
Look at him.

229
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,201
He's more than rotten,
he's basically fermented.

230
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,871
Don't you see how moldy he is?

231
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,040
- He's covered in it!
- Witness.

232
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,750
Raise your voice again,

233
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,418
and you'll be required
to take a 10-minute break.

234
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,422
All right.

235
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:04,260
I was also undercover at the Busan
Southern District Prosecutors' Office,

236
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,929
and I can confirm
Nam and Kim's relationship.

237
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,058
Prosecutor Nam even tried
to set me up with Kim.

238
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,394
Does it look like I'm on a dating show?

239
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,605
Prosecutor Nam threatened me
by the seaside.

240
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,275
He said if I kept looking into him,
he'd retaliate.

241
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,735
I was taken aback
by how natural it was for him.

242
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:25,698
It was as if he'd taken a course
on threatening people.

243
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:29,201
Please refrain
from any statements unrelated to the case.

244
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,996
Is it true that he threatened you?

245
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,624
Why would I be standing here
if I were going to lie?

246
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,710
I found the location

247
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,421
where the honey jar files
were kept and sent from.

248
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,923
Where were the files sent?

249
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,800
We're in the middle of confirming.

250
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,345
But the transmission range isn't far,
so we're searching the area.

251
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,513
So there's no way to prove

252
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,933
whether the honey jar files
are real or not?

253
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,103
-What do you mean?
-She said they're in the jar!

254
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,105
Then show them to us!

255
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,732
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

256
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,776
I understand you were undercover,

257
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,739
but you never received money or valuables
from the drug cartel, did you?

258
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,782
I know I was undercover,

259
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,368
but I'd rather die
than take money from a criminal.

260
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,037
I did not accept a single thing.

261
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,081
You held onto your integrity
throughout all that.

262
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,000
You're truly admirable.

263
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:22,087
A public official without integrity
is nothing but a corpse.

264
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,215
Please call the cops.

265
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,553
A corpse has been found at a hearing.

266
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,888
Wow, look at that corpse.

267
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,474
Integrity?
Don't be ridiculous.

268
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,643
Conspiring to murder
Chief Prosecutor Park Byeongil

269
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,478
of the Busan District Prosecutors' Office.

270
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,562
Explain yourself.

271
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,774
Did you really take his body…

272
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,444
…and feed it to sturgeons?

273
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,489
That is absolute fabrication and slander!

274
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:54,328
Chief Prosecutor Park
is currently missing.

275
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,039
Even at this very moment,

276
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,125
his wife and family

277
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,505
are desperately hoping
for his safe return.

278
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,924
Chief Prosecutor Park

279
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,760
was an irreplaceable colleague

280
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,224
and someone
who I deeply respected and looked up to.

281
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,563
Stop squeezing out tears!

282
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,191
Chairman Yeom, don't fall for it.

283
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,985
His nickname is Faucet.

284
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,445
He even cries when he eats a good meal.

285
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,614
He's not an orange.
He's not squeezing anything out!

286
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,283
He's an emotionally sensitive person.

287
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,244
He's feeling his feelings!

288
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,831
Again, if you raise your voice,
it's a 10-minute break.

289
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,834
Will you even listen if she speaks softly?

290
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,962
And we're telling the truth.
Why should we take a break?

291
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,296
Oh, stress.

292
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,881
I should've taken
herbal meds for my nerves.

293
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,925
According to the accuser,

294
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,094
you have "honey jar" files

295
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,971
with compromising information
on high-ranking officials.

296
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,682
Is it true? They exist, don't they?

297
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:02,896
I swear on my parents and my honor.

298
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,316
They absolutely do not exist.

299
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,027
You bastard.

300
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,821
How could you sell out your parents,
no matter how ignorant you are?

301
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,489
If you were in my family,

302
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,992
we'd have you excavated
right out of the family register.

303
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,869
You can't call him a bastard!

304
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,996
It's not a crime to be ignorant.

305
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,706
What are you, a heavy equipment operator?

306
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,833
He called a bastard a bastard.

307
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,626
What should he have called him?
An ass turd?

308
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,628
Also, it's not a crime to be ignorant,

309
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,297
but it is a crime to be evil!

310
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,965
-He's right!
-Listen to yourself.

311
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,727
How many minutes are left?

312
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,646
Seven minutes.

313
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,524
It's only a two-minute penalty
in handball.

314
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,861
Any way we can play by handball rules?

315
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,905
Then what about ice hockey? Five minutes?

316
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,203
He's certainly quiet.

317
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,538
Why'd you have to call him a bastard?

318
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,874
Well, he's not wrong.

319
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,377
If that bastard had a bastard son,
he'd sell him out too, that bastard.

320
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,380
Why does it feel like
nothing we say is getting through to them?

321
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,174
It felt weird from the start.

322
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,968
They were oddly warm and friendly
with each other, like heaven.

323
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,099
Well, we'll just have to push
until we get through, won't we?

324
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,266
Yes!

325
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,688
Prosecutor Nam Duhun
threatened me multiple times

326
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,108
to remove myself
from the drug investigation.

327
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,694
What kind of prosecutor conducts
an undercover investigation on his own

328
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,863
without any police involvement?

329
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,118
He cut off my legs

330
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:43,288
and threatened to do the same
to my son and my grandchild.

331
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,332
How much do you know

332
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,710
about the relationship
between Prosecutor Nam and Kim Hongsik?

333
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:52,131
I don't know much
about their relationship,

334
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,217
but Prosecutor Nam said
that if I didn't cooperate,

335
00:18:56,093 --> 00:19:00,430
he'd accuse me
of tax evasion and smuggling…

336
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,477
S-Sucheol…

337
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,438
My grandson.

338
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,872
Let me clarify.

339
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,082
Kim Hongsik is the bad guy.

340
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,169
Prosecutor Nam has nothing to do with him.

341
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,880
Mr. Yong? Speak the truth.

342
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,591
I am speaking the truth.

343
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,469
Mr. Yong, why are you
suddenly acting like this?

344
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,521
Lee Eungsu from customs,

345
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,856
please say a word.

346
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
I have nothing.

347
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,529
You said you'd testify

348
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,407
on the bribes made to the upper officials
and Nam Duhun's threats.

349
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,701
What are you talking about?

350
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,495
I came here to say
that I don't know anything.

351
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,957
Please speak the truth.

352
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,002
The comfort of a lie is merely temporary.

353
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:13,837
Mr. Lee.

354
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,881
Mr. Yong.

355
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,231
We'll conclude the hearing
as the last witness has taken the stand.

356
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:34,733
We'll resume tomorrow.

357
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,491
We're already in a tough spot.

358
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,243
Who knew Mr. Yong would pull that move?

359
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,412
When did his family
come back from America?

360
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,833
Did Mr. Lee back out because of Mr. Yong?

361
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,336
We weren't thorough enough.

362
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,547
We should've thought to protect
his family as well.

363
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,133
The hearing's not easy, is it?

364
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:04,429
So why'd you start a game
you can't even win?

365
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,850
You seem pretty easy to play.
It's fun for us.

366
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,728
Hey, bastard.

367
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,355
How long do you think you'll hold out?

368
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,774
I wouldn't have gone to such lengths

369
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,484
if I didn't think
I could make it all the way.

370
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,944
How can you live

371
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,696
without the slightest bit
of fear or a conscience?

372
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,197
Oh, please.

373
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,490
Look here.

374
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,909
That's the problem with you believers.

375
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,079
You have too much blind faith
in history and conscience.

376
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,331
"History will judge you."

377
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,792
"Future generations
will be ashamed of you."

378
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,461
That kind of talk doesn't work on me.

379
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,005
The hell does that matter?

380
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,300
This is the most obnoxious
I've ever seen you act.

381
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,803
Dear ladies and gentlemen
of the traveling theater troupe.

382
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:49,057
Do you think the people out there
who are even worse than me

383
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,977
care about history or future generations?

384
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,148
Even if they were posthumously executed,
they wouldn't bat an eye.

385
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,403
"I've lived a life of fame and fortune."

386
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,198
"Who cares
if they chop off my bones or head?"

387
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,493
"So what?"

388
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,664
"It's over when you're dead."

389
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:14,958
That's what they think.

390
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,798
Can someone like him be redeemed
according to God's will?

391
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,427
I'm not sure. Let me ask, hold on.

392
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,970
Hold on, hold on!

393
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,431
Wait!

394
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:36,104
God said you can keep living
the way you are.

395
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,358
Wow, does the Lord have a cell phone?
That was quick.

396
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,194
Does God give up on any of his children?

397
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,863
Yeah, he says this one had his fingers
in the cookie jar.

398
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,239
We can ditch him.

399
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:53,747
Oh, now I get it.
That explains everything.

400
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,998
Perfectly.

401
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,335
See you tomorrow, cookie fingers.

402
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:06,968
Seems like God doesn't care about
what my fingers get up to.

403
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,939
What's that?

404
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,867
Just thinking about Nam Duhun
makes my blood boil.

405
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,328
How's he so shameless?

406
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,663
Tell me about it.

407
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,753
Why is this so good?
The flavor is timeless.

408
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,838
Really?

409
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,425
Mmm!

410
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,094
This even cures hangovers.
That's why it's so good.

411
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:51,221
This is relieving the stress of today.

412
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,056
This is absurd.

413
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,058
You gave them police reports,
witness testimonies,

414
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,435
and evidence material.

415
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,895
But why won't they believe you?

416
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:04,484
Isn't that plenty of evidence
to have Nam Duhun locked up by now?

417
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,778
It honestly seemed like
they were protecting him.

418
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,073
Prosecutor Park, is it always like this?

419
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:14,119
I'm so mad
that I can't sit through the hearing.

420
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,455
I'd say it's fairly common.

421
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,916
The lies of the powerful become the truth,

422
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,171
and by contrast,
the truth of the weak becomes lies.

423
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,047
How can that be?

424
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,216
Then who protects the truth of the weak?

425
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,469
That's what we're trying to do.

426
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,889
She's right. And we have
someone powerful backing us up.

427
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,976
I get that we have him,
but how will we get through tomorrow?

428
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,227
I'm getting a call.

429
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,523
Oh, it's my aunt.

430
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,901
Hey, Auntie.

431
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,362
Are you serious?

432
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,333
Where's my chauffeur?

433
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,550
You're handsome in person.

434
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,053
Let's go for a drive.

435
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:14,763
How dare you…

436
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:22,103
Second day of the hearing

437
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,315
I'm watching you.

438
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,864
Is this a new watch?

439
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,824
Is Assemblyman Lee Hongok still not here?

440
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:39,579
Yes, he's running late
because he's stuck in traffic.

441
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,207
Tell him to apologize when he arrives.

442
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,799
We will begin for now.

443
00:25:55,136 --> 00:26:00,141
As party chairman,
I wanted to testify voluntarily

444
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:04,271
so that I could clear up
this whole situation.

445
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,815
As you well know,

446
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,569
the government and our party
have worked tirelessly

447
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,153
to eradicate drugs in this country.

448
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,324
The government, the Prosecutors' Office,
and the New Era Unification Party

449
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,620
joined forces to create
an undercover investigation operation.

450
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,581
And the head of command

451
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,918
was none other than Prosecutor Nam Duhun.

452
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,545
Chairman Kim.

453
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,590
Then what are these charges
against your son, Kim Inseok,

454
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,133
regarding drug use?

455
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,886
Was this part of
the undercover operation as well?

456
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,638
That's exactly right.

457
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:43,893
Drug cartels target
the children of people like us.

458
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:49,608
My son bravely sacrificed himself
to lay out a trap for the drug ring.

459
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,736
A trap for the drug ring?

460
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,197
More like for the nation's citizens.
Who would believe this?

461
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,619
I'm sure it's hard for you to believe.

462
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,246
But these are the facts.

463
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,623
- "The facts…"
- Prosecutor Nam

464
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:07,626
was the one
who crafted this extraordinary plan.

465
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,838
So really,
we should be giving him an award.

466
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,341
What are we doing right now?

467
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,259
This is slander and entrapment.

468
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,596
Chairman Kim,
this is absolutely ridiculous.

469
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,349
Do you believe
our citizens are no smarter than animals?

470
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,059
It's worse than that.

471
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,102
They see them as complete idiots.

472
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,687
You're being totally…

473
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,315
Witnesses, you're out of line.

474
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,611
Any further disruptions and all of you
will be removed from the hearing.

475
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:38,073
I mean, we just…

476
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:39,157
Jeez.

477
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,872
National Assembly Building

478
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,249
You're late, Assemblyman Lee.

479
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,794
There were some reckless drivers
on the road.

480
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,796
Who's that next to you?

481
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,508
You don't know?
This is the eldest son of the Babel Group.

482
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,176
He came to observe the hearing.

483
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,929
I apologize, sir. Go on ahead.

484
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,478
Witnesses, listen carefully.

485
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:13,525
The nation's sense of justice
and morality in this new era

486
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:18,947
is all thanks to our upright government.

487
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,283
If you leave your laptop in a café,
no one steals it.

488
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,620
No one touches your delivery packages
left in the hallway.

489
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,914
There's no other nation like us.

490
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,375
You're right.

491
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,545
There's no other nation

492
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,547
where people like you
try to suppress the truth.

493
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,549
Father Kim.

494
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:42,470
This National Assembly
is just as holy as the church.

495
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,805
Watch your language.

496
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,808
A holy National Assembly?

497
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,686
A holy National Assembly…

498
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:56,276
If no one steals a laptop or a package,

499
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,986
does that mean it's a safe country?

500
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,575
A truly safe country…

501
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,329
is one that guarantees the truth.

502
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,876
It's not just people
that can be slaughtered.

503
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,921
This nation is slaughtering the truth,
justice, and history,

504
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,883
and blameless citizens
are the ones paying the price.

505
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,967
Do you understand?

506
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,719
He's right.

507
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,556
The truth alone
is the greatest safety and stronghold.

508
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:31,060
Exactly, so please stop
telling these lies. It's frustrating!

509
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,149
Witnesses, particularly Father Kim.

510
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,818
I've been
watching you closely since yesterday,

511
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,238
and your intentions are suspicious.

512
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,157
You seem politically motivated.

513
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,242
Who's backing you--

514
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,702
Chairman Kim!

515
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:52,874
Does caring about society
make me "politically motivated"?

516
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:57,045
Do the citizens who care about our country
have forces backing them?

517
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,923
Explain yourself.
Is that what you're implying?

518
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,971
Thank you for your statements.

519
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,599
You're dismissed. Please leave the hall.

520
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,518
Wait!

521
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,021
To end our hearing with a bang,

522
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,899
we'll now commence
the honey jar opening ceremony.

523
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,742
You all put on quite a show
until the very end.

524
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,494
Hey, take those with you.

525
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,746
Come on out.

526
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,918
Hey, hey.

527
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,419
Come on.

528
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,966
Are you bluffing?

529
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,760
Are you just messing around
without any evidence?

530
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,804
Please don't mess around.

531
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,391
Hurry up and go to hell, Nam Duhun.

532
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,517
Cue!

533
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,145
Don't worry, Chairman Kim.

534
00:30:56,604 --> 00:31:00,441
I'll make sure to get a reduced sentence
for your son.

535
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,027
I'd be very grateful.

536
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,447
By the way, what drugs had he taken?

537
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,158
Well, he seems to like a wide variety.

538
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,912
Hepanyl, kasanin, the works.

539
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,789
That damn bastard.

540
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,918
I'm so sorry, Prosecutor Nam.

541
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,795
Is there anything I can do for you?

542
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,465
Of course not.
Your trust is what matters to me.

543
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,217
About Prosecutor Park.

544
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,595
Don't you need to take action?

545
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,014
It's already taken care of.

546
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,850
He'll be reborn as caviar.

547
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,393
"Phone call recording
between Nam and Chairman Kim"

548
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,396
Take a good look, everyone.

549
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,691
These are the honey jar files
we've been talking about.

550
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:42,984
What's happening?

551
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,363
Guess the honey jar
wasn't sealed tightly enough.

552
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,243
Starting today, Kim Mancheon
is gonna be shaking in his boots

553
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,537
every time he sees me.

554
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,415
I've caught a big one.

555
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,334
What a fishy smell!

556
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,920
So fishy.

557
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,134
Chairman Kim.

558
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:21,397
What is the source
of these honey jar files?

559
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,774
The source?

560
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,442
They were at his house.

561
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,406
What's that?

562
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,406
What's that?

563
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,991
We'll head out.

564
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,743
- Thank you.
- No problem.

565
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,456
Is there anything more?

566
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:41,834
I think this is from next door.

567
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,544
Next door?

568
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,306
This is a familiar scene.

569
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,354
Team Leader Gu,

570
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,857
this isn't a company residence.
It's privately owned.

571
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,526
The owner is Nam Duhun.

572
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,569
I knew it.

573
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,990
Honey jar!

574
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,201
We've finally found it!

575
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,957
We've got him. Let's go!

576
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,834
Yeah!

577
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,420
Nam Duhun, you bastard.

578
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,047
The files were sent to this room.

579
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,384
It wasn't even 100 meters away
from where he was transmitting.

580
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,428
Wow, seriously?

581
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,014
The heavens helped us.

582
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,182
How did you find it at this moment?

583
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,393
There are
about 50 to 60 high-ranking officials

584
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,853
listed in this document.

585
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,397
Will this information
turn the nation upside down, Auntie?

586
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,149
It won't just be turned upside down.

587
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,192
It'll be doing
a double airborne somersault.

588
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,366
People who colluded with Nam

589
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,410
Park Gitae, Kim Inyong, Kwon Namcheol,
Kang Ikja, Mu Jinhae…

590
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,082
Chairman Yeom

591
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,295
and respectable citizens of this nation,

592
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,839
this is all fabricated.

593
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,592
Those were AI-generated deepfakes!

594
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,802
So your fingerprints
found on the storage devices

595
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,221
were also deepfakes?

596
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:22,268
They must've gotten my fingerprints
from a mug or something.

597
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,896
You've watched too many movies.
Your imagination's running wild.

598
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:28,316
Just fess up and admit that you did it.

599
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,526
You total conmen.

600
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,071
The whole nation is watching.
Aren't you embarrassed?

601
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:37,492
Even if I get a hole in my head,
I'll never admit to anything.

602
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,497
I apologize…

603
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,551
Everyone, be quiet.
Sit in your seats.

604
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,888
Isn't that the guy we know?

605
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,515
Well, he came out of nowhere.

606
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,059
Sit down.
Remain calm and you won't get hurt.

607
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,519
Who are you?

608
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,603
Me?

609
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,230
I'm here to collect a debt.

610
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,773
Is there a creditor here?

611
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,066
Who is it? Hurry up and pay--

612
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,653
I said be quiet.

613
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,154
What don't you understand about that?

614
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,531
Okay.

615
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,748
Hey, Kim Hongsik.

616
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,875
Your face is being broadcast
to the whole nation.

617
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:32,547
I know, and that's why I'm putting on
a good show for them.

618
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,590
Don't do anything stupid.

619
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,135
If you try to pull anything,
you'll all get killed.

620
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,220
The guards will be here in 60 seconds.

621
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,014
59, 58, 57…

622
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,641
Then I'll finish this in six seconds.

623
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,143
Including you three.

624
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,827
Chairman Kim.

625
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,414
You better think carefully.

626
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,541
The whole nation is watching.

627
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,336
If you kill me right now,

628
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,756
you're a heinous murderer
whose actions are unforgivable.

629
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,050
"Chairman Kim"?
Don't give me that bullshit.

630
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,595
You need to repay the debt
for my brothers.

631
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:24,599
What happened to them
was because of an airplane door, not me.

632
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,559
But I can't shoot an airplane door, can I?

633
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,355
Dear citizens.

634
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,610
This drug cartel is pure evil!

635
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,366
Who is he talking to?

636
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,995
-The camera's not even on.
-Is he an idiot?

637
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,163
He's a smart idiot.

638
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,833
Go to hell.

639
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,601
What's going on?

640
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,232
My goodness.

641
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,527
I really thought
I'd get a hole in my head.

642
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,615
The first bullet was live
and the rest are fake?

643
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,659
Did you buy that
from Dogbowl from Incheon?

644
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,746
Please reach out to us again.
We're always happy to assist.

645
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,539
Who's Dogbowl?

646
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,625
They sell fake weapons in Incheon.

647
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,709
Only the first bullet is live,

648
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,503
but it's so realistic
that even experts get fooled.

649
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,215
- They all get fooled.
- Poor Hongsik.

650
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:43,052
You really got had by a Korean scammer
in this critical moment.

651
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,470
Goodness gracious.

652
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,806
Huh?

653
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,813
This is all being broadcast,
as Prosecutor Nam said.

654
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,690
Let's just go quietly, Hongsik.

655
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,484
If I go quietly,
that's a global embarrassment.

656
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,778
You and Nam Duhun both committed crimes.

657
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,405
Isn't it only right
to be globally embarrassed?

658
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,455
Live footage of witness
and infiltrated drug lord face-off

659
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,541
- What's going on?
- What's that?

660
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,875
He's the drug lord.

661
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:17,712
Hearing turns into an octagon ring

662
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,887
You bastards.
Trying to start a fight here?

663
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,318
You're nothing but thugs.

664
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,864
The nation is watching--

665
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,408
You talk way too much.

666
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:51,078
- Jeez.
- Where you running off to, you little rat?

667
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,498
-I'm no rat.
-What?

668
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,791
I don't even have whiskers.

669
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,626
- What?
- Shut that damn mouth of yours.

670
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,796
This hearing is legendary.

671
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,299
It'll go down in history!

672
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,730
Father Kim!

673
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,997
Yeah!

674
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,166
-Yeah!
-You did it!

675
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,127
- Wow, that was crazy.
- No way.

676
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,213
- That was amazing.
- Drug lords are nothing.

677
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,507
- That was so good.
- He's done for.

678
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,717
Great job!

679
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,138
Freeze!

680
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,640
Don't move.

681
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,016
Freeze.

682
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,481
Kim Hongsik.

683
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,317
Korea's not easy, is it?

684
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,033
Hey, Kim Hongsik.

685
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,246
At least you didn't end up
getting stabbed.

686
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,914
Be content with that.

687
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,630
Over here! There's one here too.

688
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:25,923
You're right.

689
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,136
- Come with us.
- Let go of me!

690
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,355
How dare you touch me?

691
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:46,277
Pompous till the very end.

692
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,418
Stop it, stop it!

693
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,796
How can you be applauding right now?

694
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,840
Who do you think caused this mess?

695
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,385
They're just clear and empty-headed.

696
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,095
Really? They look as thick as makgeolli.

697
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,681
You mean rice wine?
At least that's rich and tasty.

698
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,892
- And sweet.
- Right.

699
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,812
Anyway, how many times have I told you
not to overdo it?

700
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,981
-You're killing me.
-I took my meds today.

701
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,524
Still, great work today.

702
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,319
There you go!

703
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,071
Well, thank you
for the live survival reality show.

704
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,281
It was a blast.

705
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,908
It was very entertaining.

706
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,409
Bye!

707
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,161
All right,
let's get out of here.

708
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,038
-Here, take this.
-Thank you.

709
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:53,802
We will now adjourn the Special
Investigative Committee hearing.

710
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,770
In what could've ended
in a fruitless stalemate,

711
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,940
we witnessed a rare display
of bipartisan cooperation

712
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,733
to refer all involved
in the corruption scandal

713
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,569
-to the Ethics Committee…
-There he is again.

714
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,864
Someone ought to teach him a lesson.

715
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,908
All involved in the corruption will be…

716
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,869
Ki Deokgi!

717
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,885
Read forward, it's Ki Deokgi.

718
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,887
Read backward, it's Ki Deokgi.

719
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,353
Read forward, it's Ki Deokgi.

720
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,230
Read backward, it's Ki Deokgi.

721
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,482
-Wow.
-Wow.

722
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,696
Now that I think about it,

723
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,448
Polka Dot was returning the favor.

724
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,785
You two found her body
and allowed her to rest in peace.

725
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:04,373
Does this make sense
from a Catholic viewpoint?

726
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,457
Right?

727
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,501
It's more like we were in a horror story.

728
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:12,089
The Lord brought desperate people together
and helped us achieve our goals.

729
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,924
We desperately sought out the truth,

730
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:16,218
and she desperately wanted
to join the Lord in heaven.

731
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:21,432
Hearing it put that way
is saddening yet heartwarming.

732
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:25,936
The Lord always watches over us,
regardless of the situation.

733
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,187
Exactly.

734
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,149
I won't fall asleep at Mass anymore.

735
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,358
I don't need to watch Animal Farm.

736
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,818
Don't kid yourself.

737
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,445
-Are you being for real?
-For real.

738
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:35,821
- There they are!
- There!

739
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,909
Prosecutor Park,
a word on how you're feeling?

740
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,286
I'm hyped!

741
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,124
Phoenix Sun!

742
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,460
Let's get it!

743
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,214
Gosh, I'm tired.

744
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,968
-Great work, Father Kim.
-Great work, all of you.

745
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,262
Shall we go for some raw yellowtail?

746
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,347
Sounds great.

747
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,224
I agree.
Raw foods help generate new flesh.

748
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,934
Is there someone among us
who needs new flesh?

749
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,019
It's me.

750
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,854
- Why?
- Wait.

751
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,524
Hey, the fautores!

752
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,609
It is.

753
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,111
What perfect timing.

754
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,155
- Great timing.
- We…

755
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,575
- Why are you only getting here now?
- We…

756
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,160
- We… just…
- Huh?

757
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,206
There was crazy traffic
on the way to Yeouido.

758
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:30,209
We didn't want to ride the subway
wearing these outfits.

759
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,253
- What's wrong?
- Father Han, are you okay?

760
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,131
Fast and Furious.

761
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,758
I'm sorry about that.

762
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,844
You didn't have to drive so recklessly.

763
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,179
Furious, I see.

764
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,972
Is it over?

765
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,808
Yes, as you can see.

766
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:46,892
What?

767
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:51,105
Then I'll take this off.
It's making me really sweaty.

768
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,731
I will as well.

769
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,608
Let's all go eat raw yellowtail together.

770
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:58,320
We haven't even done anything today.

771
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:05,244
There is one thing
that I was hoping you two could do.

772
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,665
What is it?

773
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,167
What's your affiliation?

774
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,045
Who's your immediate superior?

775
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,256
Talk to me.

776
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,634
You think I'll be in there for long?

777
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,554
Life is all about one shot.

778
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:24,930
You better think--

779
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,145
Oh, jeez. What the…

780
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,814
What is this?

781
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,943
What's this throbbing pain I'm feeling?

782
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:48,704
A hwatu card?

783
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,665
Those traveling theater troupe bastards.

784
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,168
Where are you?
Where are you hiding?

785
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,128
- Come out, you bastard!
- He's over here!

786
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,671
Come at me!

787
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,758
-Just hurry up.
-Take me to the hospital first.

788
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,384
I need treatment!

789
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,677
Let's just go.

790
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,637
Do I not have rights?

791
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,681
-Come on.
-You imbeciles!

792
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:13,520
It's a case that Gen Z
would describe as "completely cooked."

793
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,522
Honey Jar-gate.

794
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,483
A case involving a drug cartel,
a corrupt prosecutor,

795
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:21,737
and the hidden crimes
of high-level officials.

796
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,031
Although both parties
acknowledge mutual fault

797
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,033
and are trying to gloss over this
without consequence,

798
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,327
the nation's citizens seem unsatisfied.

799
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,913
The most important fact
is that this huge scandal was uncovered

800
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:35,876
by a priest, a prosecutor,
and a detective.

801
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,505
How long will South Korea continue
to place the burden of justice

802
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,839
on those without power?

803
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,222
100 billion?

804
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,556
"Transfer the amount
to the national treasury"

805
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,225
Thank you.

806
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,185
I hope you become rich,
but only in your dreams.

807
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,353
Thank you.

808
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,690
What are you doing?

809
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,402
Do you want it that badly?

810
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,071
Where are you going?

811
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,534
-He does want it badly.
-What's wrong with him?

812
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,952
Control yourself.

813
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,161
Get back here!

814
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,622
Goodness.

815
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:18,335
-Goodbye!
-Now it's really over.

816
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,880
We gave Hong Cheolbeom's money
to the government five years ago.

817
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,383
Now it's the same
for Kim Hongsik's money.

818
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:27,386
Why does it all have to go
to the government?

819
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,721
Can't we just take a teensy bit of it?

820
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,473
Where would you use it all?

821
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:33,600
It's not about having somewhere to use it.

822
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,936
It's more like a commission.

823
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,480
If we're going to work,
we have to get paid, don't we?

824
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,400
You're right. We've been spending
our own money all this time.

825
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:44,444
Now that I think about it,
I've taken out all my savings.

826
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,489
Me too. I even made an overdraft account
for Night Guy activities.

827
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,866
Stop it!

828
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,661
Stealing candles to read the Bible
doesn't make it right. Got that?

829
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,539
-Come on.
-He's so uptight.

830
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,250
We could skim off just 1%.

831
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,626
Or even just 0.5%.

832
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,754
Or what about right in between? 0.75%?

833
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,923
- Let's go!
- For a commission fee,

834
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,967
- that's minuscule!
- Totally!

835
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,760
- No way!
- Father Kim!

836
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,769
We have faced many threats
from the forces of evil

837
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,731
and came close to suffering greatly
at their hands.

838
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,816
There were even times
when we were on the verge of death.

839
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,569
But the Lord reminds us

840
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,070
not to be afraid.

841
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,157
He sent us help…

842
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,242
…and showed us how to deal with evil…

843
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,369
"The Lord's tools that blocked Satan"

844
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,622
This is footage
from a police officer's bodycam

845
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,333
from last month's drug ring crackdown
in Busan.

846
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,960
These students from Busan Major Seminary

847
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,046
risked their lives to help the police

848
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,632
and played an essential role

849
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,800
- in taking down the vicious drug ring.
- Guts!

850
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,470
Let's go, Chae Dou!

851
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:56,308
The seminary's dean fought
tooth and nail alongside these students.

852
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,394
Their noble resistance
and sacrifice against injustice

853
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,605
have deeply moved not only Catholics

854
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,774
but the entire world.

855
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,859
2025 New Student Application Overview

856
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,486
Competition rate: 5.8:1

857
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:18,538
Dear God, please send me
a less fervent angel next time.

858
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,131
Oh, right. Don't forget.

859
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:31,051
Make sure to choose another taekwondo lead
before your ordination.

860
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:34,846
I probably won't be ordained
as a priest because I'll be kicked out.

861
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,348
You won't be kicked out.

862
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,141
You're a warrior of the Lord.

863
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:42,229
And that's a badge from God
for fighting against evil.

864
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,857
This is from Rockfish, not God.

865
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,318
And bruises fade.

866
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,445
If it fades,
fight again and make some new ones.

867
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,948
A badge isn't something
that's one and done.

868
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,326
You're right, but…

869
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,372
Why am I so angry?

870
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,874
-At me?
-No.

871
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,880
Here. Put this on your desk.

872
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,134
What is it?

873
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,844
A small gift from me

874
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:16,263
to activate
the fighting spirit of a warrior of God.

875
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,227
My fighting spirit sure is burning,

876
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,187
Father Kim.

877
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,984
Neck slice!

878
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,028
Let's go, Chae Dou!

879
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,531
Let's go!

880
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,202
"Congratulations Gu Daeyoung
and Gu Jayoung on the Commissioner Award"

881
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:39,202
"Congratulations Gu Daeyoung
and Gu Jayoung on the Commissioner Award"

882
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,455
Why'd they do all this?

883
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,123
My goodness.

884
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,209
It sure has been a long time.

885
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,545
Mm!
The smell of home.

886
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,090
This is so uncomfortable.

887
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:56,303
It makes the elders proud
when we come all dressed up.

888
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,722
What is there to be proud of?

889
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,848
There's a lot.

890
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,892
The youngest-ever leader
of the Uma Police Narcotics Team,

891
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,060
Gu Jayoung.

892
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,854
Oh, come on. It's not that big of a deal.

893
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,316
Okay, follow me, little Daeyoung.

894
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,527
Why are you suddenly
talking to me like that?

895
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,862
What?

896
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:17,574
We're back with family.
Respect the age hierarchy!

897
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,451
Follow me.

898
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,119
I'll carry that for you, Auntie.

899
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,537
That's a good boy.

900
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:27,709
You called for me,
Chief Prosecutor?

901
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,044
From the looks of it,

902
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,880
you don't seem to regret it one bit.

903
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,216
Not even 0.0000001%.

904
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,469
You know that you've got
a target on your back now, right?

905
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,387
I'm well aware, sir.

906
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,141
I've caused an uproar
in Sejong, Seocho, Yeouido, and Yongsan.

907
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,851
Who wouldn't want to shoot me dead?

908
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,728
It'd be better if that were possible.

909
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,357
That's why you're such a pain!

910
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,653
If you have a lot of kids,
you're bound to have one joker.

911
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,405
Don't you realize
how immature you're being?

912
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,367
Acting mature
only makes you overly cautious.

913
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:01,827
Prosecutor Park.

914
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,287
Once you get older,

915
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,207
you start to see things.

916
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,752
Are you talking about those polyps
they remove during a colonoscopy?

917
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,170
I got one removed recently.

918
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,630
Prosecutor Park!

919
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,801
I knew you'd act this way.
That's why I've brought this.

920
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,931
My resignation letter.

921
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,351
Goodbye, everyone!

922
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:31,857
God, that was refreshing!

923
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:32,983
Ow!

924
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,442
I feel amazing!

925
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,529
I just quit.

926
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,030
Jealous, aren't you?

927
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:43,118
You guys should quit too. Give it up!

928
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,661
Follow me!

929
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:47,914
Oh, my knees.

930
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,251
They're so stiff every morning.

931
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,669
- Sister Kim.
- Yes?

932
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:56,006
-You forgot to take this, didn't you?
-Oh, you're right.

933
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,674
I'll get one for you.

934
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,967
Thank you.

935
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,386
I forgot to take one.

936
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,804
Here you go.

937
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,182
-Thank you.
-And one for me.

938
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,434
Shall we take it?

939
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,401
You won't be able to continue
your fautor duties at this rate.

940
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,111
No way.

941
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,989
I'm going to keep taking care of my body

942
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,742
and be a fautor
until well into my sixties.

943
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,285
Don't you worry.

944
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,914
Hurry, come quick!

945
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,040
They're here!

946
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,374
Already?

947
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:35,086
Let's hurry up and go out to greet them.

948
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,340
- Goodness. Out of my way!
- Sorry!

949
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:41,343
She'll definitely be a fautor
for a long time. Wait for me!

950
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,512
"The bellator Kim Haeil

951
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,182
and his faithful comites

952
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:51,645
have fulfilled their mission
of making the world brighter

953
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:57,359
and have once again
widely spread the Lord's will.

954
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,569
Thus, I, Francesco,

955
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,113
another servant of God,

956
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:06,076
extend my heartfelt gratitude
to my friends

957
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,120
and offer a token of friendship."

958
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,708
Thank you. Thank you.

959
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,318
- Come on.
- Hey now.

960
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,528
Don't be like that.

961
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,951
- Let's look at it together.
- Come on.

962
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,370
- Hold on.
- Let's look at it all together.

963
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,998
-Come here quickly.
-Come on.

964
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,378
-Sit down.
-Take a seat.

965
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:01,214
-Stay there.
-No… My coat…

966
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,050
-Come on.
-Sit down, sit down.

967
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,593
There we go.

968
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:08,263
-Watch out, I got my hair done!
-Stop pushing!

969
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,473
-I just got it done.
-Yohan, don't push!

970
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,891
I was just breathing!

971
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,519
- Hey, copy me.
- Move over.

972
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,646
Good. Now hold your breath
for five minutes.

973
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,733
Five minutes?
You're basically telling him to die.

974
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,402
-How about just three minutes?
-Hey! Scoot over.

975
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,487
Three minutes? I hate that.

976
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,947
My goodness. Stress!

977
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,949
-I told you I didn't want to do this!
-We're ready!

978
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,826
-Here we go.
-Jeez.

979
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,162
- I'll take the photo now.
- He's taking it.

980
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,289
One, two, three!

981
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,874
Comes!

982
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:43,506
Together forever

983
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,091
Let's do it.

984
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,678
Let's stay together forever.

985
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,725
You didn't have to put me in there…

986
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:09,407
"Insi…" What does this say?

987
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:11,159
Is this a curse word?

988
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:15,580
- Cheers, everyone!
- Cheers!

989
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,754
-That's refreshing.
-Nice.

990
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:25,840
-Gudam-gu is most beautiful at night.
-You're right.

991
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,550
We've finally reached
a true oasis of peace…

992
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:28,760
Don't jinx it!

993
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,221
-Watch your mouth.
-Right. I take it back.

994
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,973
Father Kim,
how long will you be gone to the Pope?

995
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:37,560
Just two weeks.
The food doesn't sit well with my stomach.

996
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,312
Since I quit, should I go with you?

997
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,022
I've never been to the Vatican.

998
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,524
Oh, I'm unemployed too. Take me with you.

999
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,900
Unemployed?

1000
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,027
Why are you unemployed?

1001
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,363
I got fired over text 10 minutes ago.

1002
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,657
-How?
-You just got an award.

1003
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,075
-What happened?
-Seriously.

1004
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,994
They can't resist the pressure
from the higher-ups. I'm fine.

1005
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,079
I'm okay.

1006
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:58,540
Darn it…
Then that's perfect.

1007
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,500
-Let's go. Let's all go.
-Let's. Let's go.

1008
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:01,793
Hold on.

1009
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,295
You have your mortgage
and your car payments.

1010
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,881
I don't need them.
I'm letting go of all material wants.

1011
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,217
If that's what you wanted,
you should've become a monk.

1012
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,137
Want me to introduce you to
the Gudam Temple abbot? He's a good guy.

1013
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,472
No way. I can't live without meat.

1014
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,766
Should I open up my own firm?

1015
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,893
I'm a total celebrity now.

1016
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:21,604
Oh! Then I'll be your first employee.

1017
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,399
-Deal!
-That law firm won't do too well.

1018
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,359
You'll only take cases
that don't make money.

1019
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,279
You're right about that.

1020
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,072
What will I do for a living?

1021
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,615
What will you do?

1022
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,578
Yes. That.

1023
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,789
-That, that!
-What?

1024
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:43,376
What about working to fight
for justice and the weak?

1025
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,253
-I do work.
-Not that.

1026
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,673
What, you want me to join
the National Assembly?

1027
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,467
-Yeah, yeah, that!
-Yeah!

1028
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,969
Why are you suggesting the impossible?

1029
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,345
It's possible.

1030
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,264
With your fighting spirit
and us supporting you,

1031
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:58,600
-we got this.
-We got this.

1032
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,394
What the heck are you talking about?

1033
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,063
Why are you trying to butter me
into doing something?

1034
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,524
Sounds like it worked.

1035
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,776
We're not buttering you up. We're serious.

1036
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,862
-Jeez.
-It fits your current public image.

1037
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,031
People think of you as a fighter!

1038
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,365
You'll have a second term, a third term,

1039
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,367
and eventually become a minister.

1040
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,452
And after that…

1041
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,457
You always put the cart before the horse.

1042
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,417
I can hit you both.

1043
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,044
I don't care, I'll still say it.

1044
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,337
This is your fate.

1045
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,631
- Your God-given fate!
- He's right.

1046
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,967
The Lord has nominated you
to work for him.

1047
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,053
-Exactly. Send Park Kyungsun…
-To the National Assembly!

1048
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,889
Cut it out, you two!

1049
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,975
Why would I do that? Sounds like a pain.

1050
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,227
I'm not doing it.

1051
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,436
I'll ne…

1052
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,731
ver do that. Never.

1053
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,815
Number five!

1054
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,486
♪ Park Kyungsun's the one for the job ♪

1055
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:53,905
♪ She'll make Gudam-gu happy ♪

1056
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:57,659
I'm not afraid of any external pressure!

1057
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:58,743
"Park Kyungsun protects Gudam-gu"

1058
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,455
We're done with political stress.

1059
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,667
I'm Park Kyungsun, candidate five,
and I can do it!

1060
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,710
-She can do it!
-Yay!

1061
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,295
A clean, honest government.

1062
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,797
Let's go!

1063
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,091
Park Kyungsun for Gudam!

1064
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:15,260
With the general election just a day away,

1065
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,387
there are
many highly competitive districts.

1066
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,180
In particular, in Seoul's Gudam-gu,

1067
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,599
the New Era Unification Party's
newly redistricted

1068
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:22,850
three-term candidate Lee Hongok,

1069
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,727
and independent candidate Park Kyungsun

1070
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,982
have approval ratings
of 39.1% and 38.9%, respectively.

1071
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,651
It's a close battle.

1072
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,444
Park Kyungsun is a fiery prosecutor

1073
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,780
who exposed Honey Jar-gate
to the world.

1074
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,615
After more or less
being fired from her job,

1075
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:40,493
she received widespread support
after announcing her campaign,

1076
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,328
shaking up the political world.

1077
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,914
Have a refreshing day!

1078
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:49,544
Why is the time crawling by?

1079
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,213
Should we pray
before they announce the results?

1080
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,965
No, we can't.

1081
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:58,803
If we beg for things outright,

1082
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,597
he won't listen to us.

1083
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,599
-You know?
-Right?

1084
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:03,766
Oh!

1085
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,310
My goodness.

1086
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,186
I just remembered that this morning…

1087
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,857
I prayed for the election.

1088
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,942
Father Han…

1089
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,364
- Goodness me.
- One minute left. Just one minute.

1090
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,617
"We will soon share the results
that will change the nation"

1091
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,452
We'll begin the 60-second countdown

1092
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:24,412
until the exit polling results.

1093
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,290
I didn't think I'd get nervous,

1094
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,834
but I'm shaking from head to toe.

1095
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,628
Let's try to relax as we wait.

1096
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,005
You look the most nervous
out of all of us.

1097
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,132
I'm nervous. I'm going to the restroom.

1098
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,508
Hold it in.

1099
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,135
Or just keep drying it little by little
like me.

1100
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,261
That's disgusting!

1101
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,554
Yohan…

1102
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,891
- We'll announce the exit poll results…
- All right, get ready!

1103
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,017
…in 10 seconds.

1104
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,312
Ten, nine, eight…

1105
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,689
Seven, six…

1106
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,484
Five, four, three…

1107
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:56,611
two…

1108
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,196
- What's going on?
- What?

1109
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,532
-Yohan!
-Damn it, Yohan!

1110
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,409
You damn pig!

1111
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,335
Looking back on everything,

1112
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:16,255
it wasn't miracles
that made the impossible possible.

1113
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,593
When injustice becomes law,
justice becomes obligatory.

1114
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,890
The real miracle was
regular people refusing to remain silent

1115
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:28,851
and willingly taking on
the responsibility.

1116
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,399
Every moment we spent together
was a miracle.

1117
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,860
We took responsibility through action,

1118
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,363
and though we fell, we always got back up.

1119
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,825
In the end,

1120
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,576
the true miracles came to those

1121
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,455
who regarded every moment of a life
that respects justice as a blessing.

1122
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:56,129
Our faith and courage
continue to stay with us

1123
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,674
and remain the calling of the fiery people

1124
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:01,592
who have the will and hope
to change the world.

1125
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:08,141
Today, I continue to pray
that morality and justice

1126
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,185
will forever shine like the stars.

1127
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,359
Dear God…

1128
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,574
thank you for always giving us
the strength to fight.

1129
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,922
- Please let me go.
- It's okay.

1130
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,049
- It'll be over soon.
- Good, good.

1131
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,426
Hold still!

1132
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,428
- Hold onto her!
- Come on!

1133
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:48,222
- Can't you do it right?
- Please!

1134
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,767
- I want to go!
- You're fine.

1135
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:54,979
-What was that?
-What?

1136
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,068
-Did we hire an actor?
-No.

1137
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,448
Hey!

1138
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,701
Are you the ones
making sexually exploitative videos?

1139
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,787
-Who the hell is he?
-You called him, didn't you?

1140
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:14,248
-Dude.
-Just hold on a sec, I'll save you.

1141
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,667
- You little bastards.
- Damn it.

1142
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,428
Why, you little…

1143
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,681
- Damn it…
- Please help me!

1144
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,159
-Hey, lock the doors.
-Hey.

1145
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,786
- Help me!
- Lock them.

1146
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,755
Hey, lock the doors!

1147
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,595
Get ready to get on
the express lane to hell.

1148
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,597
Uh…

1149
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,141
Scoot back. A bit more.

1150
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,393
Not you guys.

1151
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:16,978
You'll be out in no time.

1152
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:22,233
I used to pack
quite a punch back in the day.

1153
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:39,625
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1154
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,545
Thanks to Park Jiil
for his special appearance

1155
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:48,467
Thanks to Park Jiil
for his special appearance

1156
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,135
Sweeper Gang

1157
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:31,946
- One, two, three!
- Again?

1158
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,531
Comes!

1159
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,331
The Pope is asking
for you, Father Michael.

1160
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:46,961
As always, you and your comites
have made a significant contribution

1161
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:51,298
to bringing light to the world.

1162
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:55,094
But there are still many places

1163
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,555
that are waiting for you, Bellator.

1164
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,808
Your help is needed.

1165
01:07:01,267 --> 01:07:02,810
With that being said,

1166
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,979
you need to go to the Vatican.

1167
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:07,773
To the Vatican?

1168
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,316
Yes, that's right.
