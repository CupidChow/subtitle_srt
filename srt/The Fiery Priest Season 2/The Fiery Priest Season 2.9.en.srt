The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,879
Episode 9
Stand Up Again

8
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,937
Retreat!

9
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,481
Retreat!

10
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,565
Come on!

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,568
Father Kim!

12
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,487
They're running away!

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,989
Don't run away!

14
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,873
Father Kim…

15
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,350
Father Kim…

16
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,978
-Father Kim.
-Father Kim!

17
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,940
Father Kim!

18
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,233
-Father Kim!
-Father Kim.

19
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,026
Father Kim. Father Kim!

20
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,486
Father Kim!

21
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,363
-Are you okay, Noah?
-Call 911.

22
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,614
Call 911!

23
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,199
-Hurry.
-Okay.

24
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,753
Hello?

25
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,005
This is the Busan Major Seminary.

26
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,217
Please hurry.

27
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,278
That's not what I'm talking about.
I mean things that no one knows about.

28
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,363
Why would something like that be here?

29
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,953
Then it must be this room.

30
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,747
They must've installed a lock
because there's something in here.

31
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,458
Look for a crowbar
so we can open the door.

32
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,543
Okay.

33
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,547
What are you looking for?

34
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,259
Are you in an escape room?

35
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,262
Oh…

36
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,141
We were taking a walk and lost our way.

37
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,686
Jeez, this ship is really big.

38
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,897
It is, isn't it?

39
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,441
You've got some pretty big nerve too,

40
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,067
Team Leader Gu Daeyoung.

41
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,746
How many times do I have to tell you
that I'm not that detective?

42
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,873
You guys even checked.

43
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,666
You little!

44
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:32,545
I did some thinking.

45
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,673
On a fine spring day
with forsythias in full bloom,

46
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,010
you probably had a relative
who looked exactly like you

47
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,678
pretend to be you.

48
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,972
Perhaps an uncle.

49
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,849
But you see,

50
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,728
he's most likely older than you,
so he probably made himself look younger.

51
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,356
He probably dyed his hair
or got a facelift.

52
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,318
I want to know
which one of the two methods he used.

53
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,738
Why are you making such a big deal
out of us taking a walk?

54
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,156
You punk.

55
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,493
Does it really look like
they're on a walk?

56
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,661
What do we look like then?

57
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,955
You guys look like bandits roaming around.

58
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,381
This is driving me crazy!

59
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,883
You're confusing me even more!

60
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,263
I'm lacking the insides…

61
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,598
I mean, I'm lacking insight right now.

62
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,683
Listen.

63
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,811
You guys will be on probation

64
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,312
until our chairman returns
to make a ruling.

65
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,563
Be on standby.

66
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,985
Move.

67
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,279
You heard him.

68
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,328
Restricted area

69
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,127
We'll have to monitor his condition.

70
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,422
Are you saying he'll never wake up?

71
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,965
It's not that.

72
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:02,135
He's just sleeping
because of the sedatives.

73
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,845
He'll wake up soon.

74
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,099
He used to be able to shake it off
and get right back up.

75
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:11,394
I'm sure he's not like before
because of his illness.

76
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,687
Illness?

77
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,148
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,318
Do you not know about his illness?

79
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,697
It's multiple sclerosis,

80
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,325
and he was in the middle of treatment.

81
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,914
Busan District Prosecutors' Office

82
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,711
Hello.

83
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,921
Prosecutor Nam Duhun at your service.

84
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,549
Nice to meet you.

85
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,719
Ah! It's such an honor

86
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,804
to be working for you so closely,
Chief Prosecutor Lee.

87
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,766
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

88
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,851
Stop flattering me.

89
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,103
You're the one
holding this place together,

90
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,855
so I'll be relying on you.

91
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,732
Not at all, sir.

92
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:01,527
I'm just a guard dog
protecting the neighborhood.

93
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,612
A guard dog?

94
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,159
Don't be so humble.

95
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,619
If we don't have much to discuss,

96
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,829
let's head out.

97
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,123
I heard you made a reservation.

98
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,375
Oh, right.

99
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,919
I'll make sure to treat you right.

100
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,504
I'll let you know once it's ready.

101
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,130
All right.

102
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,757
Excuse me.

103
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,812
Detective Hyeon.

104
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,939
They raided the seminary?

105
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,525
Damn it.

106
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,734
Did anyone die?

107
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,570
All right.

108
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:51,994
He never reports to his superior
before causing trouble, does he?

109
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,372
It's what I despise the most.

110
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,666
Kim, where are you?

111
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,919
Let's meet.

112
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,422
Yeah, now!

113
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,195
They destroyed this place.

114
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,864
- There's blood here.
- Where?

115
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,490
- Here too.
- And here.

116
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,285
Jeez, what happened here?

117
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,215
Come on.

118
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,509
Why did you come here?

119
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,512
The seminary was attacked.

120
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,474
It wasn't one-sided.
Both sides were involved in the fight.

121
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,853
Those priests have been poking their noses
in everything these days.

122
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,063
You think those thugs
would just stand by and watch?

123
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,231
They'd obviously fight back.

124
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,566
- Obviously.
- Yeah.

125
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,568
You can stop inspecting the scene

126
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,029
and go back to the station
to play with your dolls.

127
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,491
- That was a good one.
- You think so?

128
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,702
- I could be a comedian, right?
- Not too bad.

129
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,746
Open up!
Open up!

130
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,165
Open the door!

131
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,172
We're really locked up.

132
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,798
I don't think we have a way out this time.

133
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,509
It was a pretty clever plan though.

134
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,636
Let's just take off
when they open the door.

135
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,387
Good idea. Uh…

136
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,474
Each person only has to take on five guys.

137
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,144
Oh, I guess that means
there are only 20 men out there.

138
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,479
But I saw at least 50.

139
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,564
Oh, my knees.

140
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,691
-Then what should we do?
-What should we do?

141
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:46,817
What should we do?

142
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,277
What should we do?

143
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,987
We'll just die here,

144
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,989
become ghosts, and fly out of here.

145
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,417
Stand back.

146
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,336
All right, all right.

147
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,338
You got this!

148
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,464
Come on.

149
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,135
I can't do it.

150
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,387
What can you do?

151
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,972
You damn pig.

152
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,976
He was dealing
with such a serious illness…

153
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,313
…but never said a word to us.

154
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,233
I was always by his side…

155
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,403
yet I had absolutely no idea.

156
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,781
Since the two of you
are close to Father Kim,

157
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,866
let me ask you something.

158
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,953
Why is he going to such lengths
to keep fighting

159
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,081
despite his condition?

160
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,710
At first,

161
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,212
I just thought he was an unusual person.

162
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,424
But now I'm thinking
there's more to it than that.

163
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,512
If there's another reason, please tell me.

164
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,930
I'd really like to know.

165
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,985
Can you keep a secret?

166
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,748
He's inside. Please get in.

167
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,713
Are you trying to take me down?

168
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,924
Who made you so upset? Get in.

169
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,844
I don't have time. Let's make it quick.

170
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,055
I thought I made it clear to you

171
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,599
to let me know in advance
if you're going to cause trouble.

172
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,309
That way, I can cover for you.

173
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,561
Is this about the seminary incident?

174
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,021
I thought about it,

175
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,398
and it wasn't worth asking you
to cover for us.

176
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,691
Wasn't worth it?

177
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,068
What if someone decides to look into it?

178
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,237
Don't you realize word will spread
to Seoul and Rome and cause a mess?

179
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,449
I'm sure you'll take care of it
before it gets to that.

180
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,284
Let me make this clear.

181
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,954
It's up to me to decide
if it's worth it or not.

182
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,039
Not you.

183
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,749
I see.

184
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,168
I didn't know you called the shots.

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,003
You should've told me.

186
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,923
-You should talk in the car.
-You bastard!

187
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,467
How dare you touch me,
you rude asshole?

188
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,222
Chunseop.

189
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,099
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,685
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,690
Hongsik.

192
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,275
Let me give you some advice.

193
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,320
Don't lose sight of the basics.

194
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,408
And if you're going to handle things,
do it right.

195
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,828
Don't get your ass handed to you
by the priest.

196
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,625
Wouldn't it be great
if word got out nationwide

197
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,420
that drug dealers were crushed
by seminary students?

198
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,048
I'll take care of the media.

199
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,384
So cut the thug work,

200
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,928
and stick to the basics.

201
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,722
Got it?

202
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,855
He's got a bigger ego than I expected.

203
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,244
Who the hell zapped me?

204
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,374
It won't scar, will it?

205
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,376
Hang on.

206
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,172
Father Kim Tsunami

207
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,133
Prosecutor Park.

208
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,135
Who is this? Father Han?

209
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,013
Why are you picking up his phone?

210
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,769
Jeez, it's a mess in here.

211
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,354
What's all this? Why didn't they clean up?

212
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,356
How gross.

213
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,025
Jeez.

214
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,739
I guess Father Kim's the one
who came up with the plan.

215
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,741
He should've let me in on it.

216
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,077
Water tank
Toxic gas storage

217
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,579
What the heck?

218
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,290
Toxic gas and a bomb?

219
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,210
Dollars?

220
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,927
It's been a while, Dimitri.

221
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,888
Do you, by any chance,

222
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,600
know a drug dealer named Boss Park
in Uma-gu?

223
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,523
Oh, is that so?

224
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,152
In that case, can you introduce him to me?

225
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,615
Come on, Dimitri.

226
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:49,245
Don't you want to earn big bucks?

227
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,081
Sir,

228
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,958
I'm certain he's Gu Daeyoung.

229
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,881
-Is he?
-Well, sir.

230
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,175
I lacked the insides…
What's wrong with me?

231
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,844
Insight. Right.

232
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,179
I lacked the insight
and couldn't make the call,

233
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,765
so I thought it'd be best
to wait for your ruling.

234
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,933
Boss Park.

235
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,643
You're the one who said we weren't them!

236
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,936
The thing is,

237
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,105
we didn't have much time
to really get to know each other.

238
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,189
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,650
Are you breaking up with us or something?

240
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
Shut up.

241
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,987
Keep this up
and things won't look good for you either.

242
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,822
Shut up.

243
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,365
You're the worst.

244
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,034
How could you mess
with innocent people like us?

245
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,370
You bad bitch.

246
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,080
You crazy pig!

247
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,250
If you're wrong,

248
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,961
I'll crush your skull wide open.

249
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,922
"I'll crush your skull wide open."
Go ahead. Crush it if you can.

250
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,716
You sneaky cops.

251
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,885
Our dear shaman…

252
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,970
I don't think that shaman is fake.

253
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,764
She even saw the SWAT guns

254
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,850
and told me about my future.

255
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:53,976
What's your fate?

256
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,396
She said
I'll struggle a lot in my midlife,

257
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,315
but things will get better
in my later years.

258
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,818
- It must be tough.
- Sorry?

259
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,487
I heard you're the one
who took the guys to the seminary today.

260
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,364
I'm sorry, sir.

261
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,284
There were quite a lot of students,
so things didn't go as planned.

262
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,620
When you attack someone…

263
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,956
you have to crush them

264
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,917
so they can't even think about
seeking revenge.

265
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,753
I just wanted to help.

266
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,672
Please forgive me.

267
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,049
Don't kneel.

268
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,262
I can't stab you properly if you kneel.

269
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,813
Well, looks like
you won't make it to a better later life.

270
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,651
Where were we? Right, Maksan.

271
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,529
What should we do about him?

272
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,452
I'm not sure.

273
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,995
You're not sure?

274
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,207
You guys should just die.

275
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,544
I hate it
when things are uncertain and messy.

276
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,798
Unfortunately, this is the end for us.

277
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,966
Wait, sir.

278
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,802
We're really innocent.

279
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,137
That doesn't prove who you are though,
does it?

280
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,526
Wait!

281
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,529
I just remembered something.

282
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,281
Maksan has this thing.

283
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,574
What thing?

284
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,994
Have you heard of the legend of Maksan?

285
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,247
Who here would know such a thing?

286
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,459
It was in 2018.

287
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,295
Maksan…

288
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,966
fought a fierce battle with Kobayashi,
a member of the Osaka Yakuza.

289
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,178
While fighting,
Kobayashi stabbed Maksan in the back

290
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,722
with two steel sticks.

291
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:04,356
However, Maksan took him down
with his bare hands

292
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,235
and proudly won the Battle of Osaka.

293
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,079
So if he's a fake,

294
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,207
he won't have the scars on his back.

295
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,667
Right?

296
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,586
Let's have a look.

297
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,547
-Take your shirt off.
-Jeez.

298
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,050
I never thought
I'd be humiliated like this.

299
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,637
I'd rather just die.

300
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,322
Is this it?

301
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,656
This can't be.

302
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,201
I swear he's the detective!

303
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,660
- Hey!
- Yeah?

304
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,287
Oram Mountain fairy!

305
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,498
Please take care of these fools.

306
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,833
Are you sure those aren't pimples?
Let's squeeze them.

307
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,918
Hey, Thai.

308
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,586
Crush his skull.

309
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,005
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.

310
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,884
Wait, hang on.
We can talk this out.

311
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,848
You damn pig.

312
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,984
- Clean this up.
- Yes, sir.

313
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,277
Boss Park.

314
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,280
I'm disappointed in your insight!

315
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,074
That smug bastard.

316
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,451
I'll be off to the lab.

317
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,869
My goodness…

318
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,598
I've never seen someone die
right in front of me.

319
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,808
I'm traumatized.

320
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,103
He's one hell of a crazy bastard.

321
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,439
How can he kill someone like that?

322
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,526
We would've died on the spot
if it weren't for Capelin.

323
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,195
I know. Why did Capelin do that?

324
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,781
How did he know about my scar?

325
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,991
I know.

326
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,285
Only the Gudam family members
know about it.

327
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,245
Father Kim!

328
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,289
Try this. It's hot.

329
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,669
- Oh, no.
- Mistake, mistake.

330
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,880
Mistake?

331
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,756
Father Kim!

332
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,970
Don't come this way. Stay away.

333
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,432
Oh, no! Oh, no!

334
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:50,272
He poked two holes in my back!

335
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,316
We're alive thanks to those holes.

336
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,525
You should thank Father Kim.

337
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,903
Thank you, Father Kim.

338
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,613
Truly.

339
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,116
But how does Capelin know about that scar?

340
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,620
Oh!

341
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,747
I know.

342
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,332
Remember how you took off your shirt

343
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,919
to take a shower
the second we came on the ship?

344
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,838
Jeez, it's hot in here.

345
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,632
I'm going to take a shower.

346
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,888
Goodness, your body
seems to have taken a toll.

347
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,848
Oh, you're right!

348
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,935
-Capelin was standing right here!
-Right there!

349
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,019
Ah.

350
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,563
Why did he come up
with that Osaka Battle nonsense?

351
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,358
Perhaps he's a pathological liar.

352
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,609
Pathological liar?

353
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,944
Yeah.

354
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,362
-That little…
-Let's focus.

355
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,490
We found the location of the bomb,
so let's get out of here and make a plan.

356
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,741
All right, sounds good.

357
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,660
Okay.

358
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,871
What's wrong?

359
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,666
-She's too into character.
-Is a spirit speaking to you?

360
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,125
No, I got a text.

361
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,130
Emergency! A storm has hit the building…

362
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,384
I think something happened
to Father Kim and the seminary.

363
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,468
What?

364
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,359
Is he not awake yet?

365
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,735
No.

366
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,570
He's still fast asleep.

367
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,740
I told him time and again to be careful.

368
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,910
Did you know…

369
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,163
about his illness?

370
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,456
Ah…

371
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,839
Come on, Father Han.

372
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:42,426
Wait. Are you crying?

373
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,596
Come on, Sister Kim. Not you too.

374
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:52,019
Father Kim asked me to keep it a secret
from the comites, so I couldn't tell you.

375
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,146
You don't have to be so upset about it.

376
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,982
He probably didn't want to be a burden,

377
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,276
not even to us, his own family.

378
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,111
Why would we think of him as a burden?

379
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,031
I'd punch him if he were younger than me.

380
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,907
Come on, don't be like that.

381
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,786
I'm sure deep down,
Father Kim wanted to tell you.

382
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,539
You know how much he cares about you.
You're like his younger brother.

383
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,291
His duty as a bellator may be important,

384
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,585
but nothing is as important
as his health right now.

385
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,211
He's right.

386
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,048
We have to protect him from now on.

387
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,507
That's right.

388
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,676
- Goodness gracious.
- That's true.

389
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,852
You're old enough to know
not to play with your food.

390
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,067
Did you get your hair done?

391
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,695
I did.

392
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,572
I wanted to change things up a bit.

393
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,618
I'd like to change things too,

394
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,953
but my body's not the same as before.

395
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,665
The Lord works through you.

396
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,711
It only makes sense
that you're struggling and in pain.

397
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,672
But you have to find a way
to get back on your feet

398
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,716
and overcome it.

399
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:10,972
The Lord always gives strength
to those who rise again.

400
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,474
I know.

401
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,226
That's why I get back up every time.

402
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,145
But this time…

403
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,690
…the scars are building up…

404
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,818
…so it's not easy.

405
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:23,985
You fool.

406
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,322
Why don't you know how to share pain?

407
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,575
It's not worth sharing.

408
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,160
Just share it.

409
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:37,249
It's not pain for those you share it with,
but trust.

410
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,972
Those who receive the gift of your trust

411
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,183
will help you become a better person.

412
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,148
Just as you have helped me
become a better person.

413
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,156
Get back up from where you fell,

414
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,533
and take their hands.

415
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,622
Now eat up and find your strength.

416
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,169
The jangjorim looks delicious.

417
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,048
All right. Goodness gracious.

418
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,809
Oh my. What's wrong with his mouth?

419
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,102
Has he gone into shock?

420
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,273
It looks like it.
I think he's having a bad seizure.

421
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,441
-What do we do?
-Oh, no.

422
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,318
Should I go get the nurse?

423
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,780
-Father Kim.
-Father Kim.

424
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,116
My food.

425
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,368
My jangjorim.

426
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,162
Give me my jangjorim!

427
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:59,539
Where did it go? My jangjorim!

428
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:03,585
Oh, my goodness!

429
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,671
He's completely lost it.

430
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,507
-My jangjorim.
-I think he's regressed

431
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,551
to a child's level of intelligence.

432
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,386
Father Kim, are you okay?

433
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,766
My jangjorim!

434
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,310
Haeil, come to your senses.

435
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,978
-It's me, Auntie Kyungsun.
-Auntie, Auntie.

436
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,939
-It's your auntie.
-That hurts.

437
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,273
-Wait.
-Prosecutor Park.

438
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,733
Auntie, that hurts.

439
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,151
- Does that help?
- Wait!

440
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,197
Why are you hitting me?

441
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,949
Auntie, my foot. Where am I?

442
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,244
Oh, it's the hospital.

443
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,120
It seems he's come back to his senses,

444
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,040
judging by how he's losing his temper.

445
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,669
You should've told us if you were ill.

446
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,797
So you told them everything, huh?

447
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,883
It wasn't me. The doctor told them.

448
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,718
You're such a blabbermouth.

449
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:01,351
I should've told you two sooner.

450
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,395
I'm sorry.

451
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:06,690
Don't argue with anything we say
from now on,

452
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,484
and focus on getting some rest.

453
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,612
I'm okay. I'll get my rest when I need it.

454
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,447
I…

455
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,701
What's this smell?

456
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:18,785
Don't you smell something?

457
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,832
Did someone bring the stinky mask?

458
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,500
Oh, right.

459
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,252
I almost died earlier.

460
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,045
I was so close
to ending up like Polka Dot.

461
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,922
What?

462
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,425
The recent violence
at Busan Major Seminary

463
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,386
is said to have been a mutual conflict

464
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,223
rather than a one-sided assault
by a local gang.

465
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,934
A few instructors and students
at the seminary…

466
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,477
…have been known for frequently engaging

467
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,062
in violence outside of the seminary,

468
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,982
causing conflicts
with the local community.

469
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,401
Most locals are saying

470
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,154
this incident was bound to happen,

471
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,198
that it was only a matter of time.

472
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:00,577
What they're saying on the news
isn't true, Bishop.

473
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,746
That's true.

474
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,165
But those guys are a criminal gang,

475
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,208
and our instructors and students haven't…

476
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,252
Yes.

477
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,922
Understood.

478
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,760
I'll see you tomorrow
and tell you all the details.

479
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:18,928
Okay.

480
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,690
Father Kim Haeil is a bellator.

481
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,776
You've heard of it, right?

482
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,906
I thought
that was just a story in the records.

483
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,407
It's not.

484
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,577
He was fulfilling
the duty the Lord gave him by our side.

485
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,205
So the call from the cardinal's secretary

486
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,165
wasn't fake.

487
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,625
So that's why…

488
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,796
he's been so caught up
in the matters of the secular world.

489
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,174
It's not that he was caught up
in said matters.

490
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,388
He was focused on helping
the powerless and the weak.

491
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,770
Lord.

492
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,606
Please come clean and tell me.

493
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,069
Why are you pushing
this cowardly child of yours?

494
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,487
Why?

495
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,578
Detective Gu.

496
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,663
Can you hear me?

497
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,625
It must be tough
being on that ship with no fresh air.

498
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,960
It's okay.

499
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:35,547
I'm sure it's harder for you
alone in the stands of the enemy team.

500
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,632
I'm fine sitting all alone,

501
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,259
as long as our team hits a home run.

502
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,760
Jeez, this…

503
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,970
You can hear me, right?

504
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,680
It's so tiny.

505
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,141
Anyway, why are you making
an emergency call

506
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,101
instead of Father Kim?

507
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,562
Detective Gu, don't be shocked.

508
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,855
And don't get mad.

509
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,898
Don't cry or get upset either.

510
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,030
Father Kim will be okay, right?

511
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,826
Why didn't he say anything?
He should've at least told me.

512
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,163
Let's get out of here and go to him.

513
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,581
We can tell them

514
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:12,542
that we're going to go see
Maksan's mom, right?

515
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,710
We already used that excuse.

516
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,254
We can't use it again.
Think of something else.

517
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,338
I'm sorry.

518
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,925
Anyway,

519
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,678
it doesn't feel right
to leave Capelin behind.

520
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,477
Hey.

521
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,561
Can we…

522
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,023
go see my mom?

523
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,236
Oh, really?

524
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,489
I said go.

525
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,949
Okay. Thanks. We'll be back.

526
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,326
Yes!

527
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,453
Hold up!

528
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,916
Shaman.

529
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,959
When you come back…

530
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,548
please help Jellyfish move on in peace.

531
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,801
Okay. Let's go.

532
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,599
Let's hurry.

533
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,267
Who knew it'd be this easy?

534
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,812
I'm going to burn this outfit.
It's so itchy.

535
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,523
What's wrong?

536
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,607
Are you hungry?

537
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,946
I think I hear screaming.

538
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,038
-Oh, come on.
-I thought things were going too smoothly.

539
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,123
Jeez, that damn pig.

540
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,089
You just need to give me a name.

541
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,049
Who did you give my information to?

542
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,511
I put it up on a secondhand app.

543
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,388
Happy?

544
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,472
Stop.

545
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,432
Leave her be.

546
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,602
Pain isn't going to get her to talk.

547
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,896
Just kill me, assholes.

548
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,818
Let's do this.

549
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,904
I'll let you die peacefully
if you tell me who.

550
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,698
I'll euthanize you.

551
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:12,412
Euthanasia is illegal in Korea,
you stupid moron.

552
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,998
This is why I like intelligence agents.

553
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,958
They're more tenacious than drug dealers.

554
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,505
Is the phone and laptop analysis
not done yet?

555
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,883
There's an auto-delete feature,

556
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,010
so it's not going to be easy.

557
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,472
Then I guess
you're all we have to extract info from.

558
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,351
Good luck.

559
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,376
-You want one?
-Yes.

560
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,390
I feel more energized now.

561
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:19,812
I've only ever heard of a stun gun.
I never thought I'd get zapped by one.

562
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:20,980
Jeez.

563
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,067
I thought my hair was going to burn.

564
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,361
It's dangerous alone.
We should stick together from now on.

565
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,737
Oh my.

566
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,448
Are you worried about me?

567
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,785
You know me. I can handle it.

568
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,039
No. I'll stake out somewhere nearby
when you meet with Chairman Kim.

569
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,792
How bothersome.

570
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,418
Look at how long my philtrum is.

571
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,755
I'll live a long life.
I won't die that easily.

572
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,924
Just listen to me. I'm just worried, okay?

573
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,176
Wait, you do have a long philtrum.

574
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,722
But seriously, who the hell zapped me?

575
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,890
I wonder too.

576
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,017
If it's one of Prosecutor Nam
or Chairman Kim's guys,

577
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,852
they probably would've killed
or kidnapped you.

578
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,688
Oh, right. Fautor.

579
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,690
How do you know about that?

580
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,067
I heard it from a bellator
when I was in the US.

581
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,112
Our guardian barred from sight!

582
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,864
I don't think it was a fautor.

583
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,616
I think it was Pikachu.

584
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,701
Hmm!

585
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,327
-Pika, pika, Pikachu.
-Pika!

586
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,662
-Pikachu!
-Pika, pika!

587
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,913
-Pika, pika, Pikachu.
-Pika, pika.

588
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,498
-Pikachu!
-Pika!

589
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:21,958
-Pikachu!
-Pika, pika!

590
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,459
-Pika, pika, Pikachu!
-Pika, pika!

591
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:26,504
-Pikachu! Pikachu!
-Pika, pika! Pika, pika, pika!

592
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,798
-Pika, Pikachu!
-Pika, pika! Pika, pika!

593
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,383
-Pika, pika!
-Pikachu!

594
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:33,052
-Pika, pika, Pikachu! Pikachu!
-Pika, pika! Pika, pika!

595
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,848
- I think it's coming from here.
- Yeah?

596
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,683
-Let's go.
-Oh, I hear it now.

597
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,022
Over here.

598
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,231
Oh.

599
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,691
Is that a woman screaming?

600
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,656
It's this room.

601
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,824
Ah!

602
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,204
What are these assholes doing to a woman?

603
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,834
What are you going to do?

604
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,210
Something bad might happen.

605
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,212
She could be from another drug ring.

606
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,839
Maybe they're just fighting.

607
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,674
We're not going anywhere.

608
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,176
Let's save her first.

609
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,260
Stop!

610
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,055
We'll arrest her
if she's from another drug ring.

611
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,557
But if she's just an innocent person,
we have to save her.

612
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,934
Ah! Right, you're a detective, Auntie.

613
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,688
So are you, nephew.

614
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,273
Damn it. Let's hold off on leaving.

615
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,609
Damn it.

616
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,320
Since we're staying,
let's look into Capelin.

617
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,863
Something doesn't add up.

618
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,952
Who's in there?

619
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,250
Someone's screaming.

620
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,838
Why are you still here?

621
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,090
We thought about it,

622
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,426
and it's more important to let Jellyfish
go in peace than to visit Maksan's mom.

623
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,223
Thank you.

624
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,893
Thank you so much.

625
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,645
I mean it.

626
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:09,148
You guys are so kind and considerate.

627
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,818
Thank you, Shaman.

628
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,112
All right, all right.

629
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,446
- Settle down.
- Mm, mm.

630
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,406
Thank you.

631
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,575
No worries. We'll let him go peacefully.

632
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,464
I thought you wanted me
to stay out of your business.

633
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,008
I see you're the type to hold grudges.

634
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,635
Yes, I am.

635
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,095
I hold onto them for pretty long.

636
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,223
What brings you here?

637
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,058
Just like the police investigation report,

638
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,435
the media also concluded
it was the seminary's fault.

639
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,772
I guess they each did their jobs.

640
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,025
You'd be a fool
to trust the news these days.

641
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,236
Father Kim.

642
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,614
I came to make an emergency confession.

643
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:01,409
An emergency confession?
I'm not a first responder.

644
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,703
Can't you make an exception for today?

645
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,705
I can't. Plus, we're in a hospital.

646
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,623
Just this once. Please.

647
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:13,921
All right.

648
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,888
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

649
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,515

Let me help you calm down.

681
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,290

708

You want me to give you some motivation?

709
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,866
What is it?

710
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:32,119
I'm sorry,
but your eyes are a bit intense.

711
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,205
Ah. What is it?

712
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,167
Here.

713
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,211
It's information on Chairman Kim Hongsik.

714
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,381
Saban Cartel: Terrorist Activities

715
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,758
Holy shit!

716
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,431
What is that?

717
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,016
Is that a pigeon?

718
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,528
What? I don't see it.

719
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,210
I just got rid of Polka Dot.

720
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,045
Now it's a pigeon?

721
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,589
This damn cursed house.

722
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,799
Kim Haeil!

723
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,300
Tell me it's not true!

724
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,219
How can there be toxic gas
and a bomb in Uma-gu?

725
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,054
It's true.

726
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,143
Is that enough motivation?

727
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,978
It's more than enough.

728
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,981
Then are you going to continue
fiddling with that stuffed animal?

729
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:44,066
No, I already ripped it apart.

730
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,151
Good job.

731
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,902
You know the meaning of your name, right?

732
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:47,987
Saint Martha.

733
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,572
She tamed the monstrous Tarasque

734
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,198
by sprinkling holy water
and holding the cross over him.

735
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,867
She was beheaded and became a martyr

736
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,952
for holding onto her faith.

737
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,414
Well, no need to become a martyr.
Let's fight until the end.

738
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,833
Okay. You'll help, right?

739
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,419
How many times do I have to tell you?

740
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,753
We're not the ones helping you.

741
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,589
You're helping us.

742
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,467
We need someone like you
in this day and age.

743
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,262
I'll make sure your family is safe,

744
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,681
and I'll also look for a safe place
for you to stay.

745
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,141
Thank you,

746
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,518
but I'll just stay at my place.

747
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,353
No, it's dangerous.

748
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,481
I'll be fine. One second.

749
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,859
- Hang on.
- I thought you ripped the stuffed animal.

750
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,527
Don't tell me you brought a different one.

751
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,779
I didn't. Gosh, why isn't this coming out?

752
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:32,990
What is it?

753
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,783
Oh, jeez!

754
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,243
Where'd you get these?

755
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,621
I'm a police chief.

756
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,753
Have another drink, sir.

757
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,173
Goodness.

758
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,096
Hey, Guard Dog.

759
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,891
Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

760
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,435
Excuse me.

761
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,772
I heard

762
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,900
you're trying to go back
to Seocho-dong in Seoul.

763
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,110
And you're using drug cases
to help yourself

764
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,862
since you have no connections.

765
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,032
That's not true, sir.

766
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:18,202
I have absolutely no intention
of going back there.

767
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,205
I'm going to stay here
to protect the community,

768
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,666
-and ensure the safety of the--
-Damn it.

769
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,086
What's with people in your position
trying to play the hero?

770
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,631
A little mutt like you

771
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:35,052
will only end up getting kicked out
with nothing but your underwear.

772
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,391
I'm relieved I'll still have my underwear.

773
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,809
You little…

774
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,187
Are you messing with me right now?

775
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,982
Hey.

776
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,449
Do you know who I am?

777
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,534
Of course.

778
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,327
I'm well aware.

779
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,495
Mm.

780
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,790
I'm sorry if I offended you.
Please forgive me.

781
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,542
Allow me to pour you a glass.

782
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,626
Good.

783
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,509
No, you have to stay!

784
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,136
I've already changed.

785
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,762
-Take it off.
-Will do.

786
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,472
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

787
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,557
-Wait, wait.
-Stay still.

788
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,058
-Sister Kim, help! Stop it!
-Stop moving.

789
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,143
-You have to stay here.
-No.

790
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,394
I'll give your clothes back

791
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,354
-when you get discharged.
-Wait, no.

792
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,564
- Listen to me.
- Just stay still.

793
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:30,774
-Wait, wait. Just listen to me first.
-My goodness.

794
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,238
I won't do anything on my own.

795
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,532
I'll make sure
to share everything with you guys,

796
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,950
so you don't have to worry.

797
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,161
I know you're just saying that
to get out of this.

798
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,412
Ah!

799
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,456
- Oh, that's what it is.
- No, I'm not.

800
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,790
Trust me.

801
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,126
-It's not… Hello, Doctor.
-Doctor?

802
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,879
-There's no…
-Father Kim!

803
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,922
Hey, Kim Haeil!

804
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,300
Stay here. I'll go get him.
I won't let him go easy.

805
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,761
Goodness gracious.

806
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,348
Father Kim!

807
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,934
Jeez, can't you be more punctual?

808
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,187
Is it okay for you to be out and about?

809
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,521
Of course.

810
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,816
By the way, I can become a comes

811
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,318
if I keep following you around, right?

812
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,904
No, you need a certification.

813
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,782
One in new and renewable energy
equipment engineering,

814
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,867
and one in carbon dioxide gas arc welding.

815
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,118
You must have those two.

816
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,953
Why does a comes need that?

817
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,539
Because the role begins
with acquiring certifications.

818
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,832
Stop messing with me.

819
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,168
Why did you call me?

820
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,755
I need your help.

821
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:37,716
It's strange hearing you ask for help.

822
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,426
There's nothing strange about it.

823
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:43,138
Starting today, we'll be on the Citizen
Watch Team under the Uma Police Chief.

824
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,099
Why is it ticking me off
just hearing about it?

825
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,267
You want me to tick you off more?

826
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,104
No, I'll do as you say.

827
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,355
Good call.

828
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,441
Oh, right, Father Kim.

829
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,734
I have major news.

830
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,277
What is it?

831
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,906
Did something happen to Karina from aespa?

832
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,076
Is there anything I can hit you with?

833
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,577
-How dare you?
-Here.

834
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:07,663
What is this?

835
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,088
You scared the crap out of me!

836
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,550
How did you know about
the scar on my back?

837
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,010
Why did you make up that stuff
about the Osaka Battle?

838
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,137
I don't know.

839
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,555
Answer me.

840
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,598
Why did you help me out
by coming up with all that nonsense?

841
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,267
I said I don't know.

842
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,811
Then tell me this.

843
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:33,063
The person who's being tortured upstairs.

844
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,690
-What?
-Who is it?

845
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,034
What's this?

846
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,167
You can rest now.

847
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,877
It's been a while
since I've been this worn out

848
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,462
from kissing ass all day.

849
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,173
How's the new chief prosecutor?

850
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,091
He's truly respectable.

851
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,511
A true bastard we can look up to.

852
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,599
Did something happen that upset you?

853
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,559
Prosecutor Park.

854
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,520
Let's start wrapping up
on filling the honey jar.

855
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,272
Sorry?

856
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,400
We have enough,

857
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,527
so we should slowly start distributing it.

858
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,450
Listen up, everyone!

859
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,247
You all look displeased.
Where are your manners for your chief?

860
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,541
Is she out of her mind?

861
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,751
I'm not.

862
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,170
I have news to share.

863
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,880
Effective immediately,
the Violent Crimes Team

864
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,049
will be pulling out
of the drug investigation.

865
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,467
What?

866
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:47,429
Then who's going to take over?

867
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,640
The Narcotics Team has been created,

868
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,475
and a new leader has been appointed.

869
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:55,062
Team Leader!

870
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,274
Welcome.

871
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:03,529
This is Ma Jungno,
the leader of the Narcotics Team.

872
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,364
My name means "No to drug addiction."

873
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:07,533
"Ma" is short for mayak, or drugs,

874
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:10,285
and "Jung" is short for jungdok,
or addiction.

875
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,246
Is this a joke?

876
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,289
Is this a prank?

877
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,875
What in the world are you doing?

878
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,961
From now on,

879
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,756
Team Leader Ma and I will be taking over
the drug investigation.

880
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,591
Listen, Chief.

881
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,260
Oh, Team Leader Ma!

882
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,847
Yoo!

883
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,684
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you. I'm Kim Haeil.

884
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,061
It's truly a pleasure.

885
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,397
I've heard a lot about you too.

886
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,941
-I look forward to working with you.
-Likewise.

887
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,153
What are you doing?
Say hi to Team Leader Ma.

888
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:49,575
Hello, I'm Chae Dou.

889
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,035
What is this?

890
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,537
What do you mean? Mind your manners.

891
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:55,747
Starting today,

892
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,417
Father Kim Haeil and Chae Dou

893
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,002
will be observing and advising

894
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:03,505
on the drug investigation
as part of the Citizen Watch Team.

895
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,716
With all that being said,

896
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,593
let's get started with the investigation.

897
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:08,677
Let's move!

898
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,637
Let's move!

899
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,431
- Let's move!
- You can rest here.

900
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:14,933
- Let's go.
- Let's.

901
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,143
We'll be back, sir.

902
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,400
- What's going on?
- Goodness gracious.

903
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,235
Father Kim.

904
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,113
I think Prosecutor Nam
is going to open his honey jar soon.

905
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,532
This is no less than a nuclear bomb.

906
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,743
There are bombs everywhere.

907
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,745
We'll have to defuse that bomb too.

908
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,331
Don't worry, I'll take care of this one.

909
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:38,790
Is everything okay at Uma Police Station?

910
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,334
Yes.

911
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,587
The new team leader's appointment
went great!

912
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,840
That's great.

913
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,718
Chief Go Martha
must've really made up her mind.

914
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:53,221
But if the chief
starts taking matters into her own hands,

915
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,515
won't Kim Hongsik blow up Uma-gu?

916
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,726
We found the gas tank,

917
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,645
but the bomb is still
somewhere inside the ship.

918
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,397
Detective Gu said
they've located the bomb.

919
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,566
We just need to defuse it.

920
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,152
But that'll take a while.

921
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,197
Shouldn't we try to buy time?

922
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,868
I'll meet with him
and try to stop him from triggering it.

923
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,495
I told you not to meet with him alone!

924
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,455
How many times do I have to tell you?

925
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,668
Don't meet him alone.
It's dangerous.

926
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,044
I'm trying to save myself.

927
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,004
I'll die if it goes off.

928
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,215
Oh, that's why.

929
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,300
All right then.

930
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,970
But be careful.

931
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,556
I'll lose all my strength if I lose you.

932
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,184
Oh, my goodness, that's so cheesy.

933
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,310
Bye.

934
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,357
Oh!

935
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,651
That was really cheesy. What's wrong?

936
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,487
-Wasn't I cool?
-It's not like you.

937
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,241
I also thought it was a line
that was very unlike me.

938
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,535
What kind of line was that? Jeez.

939
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,995
What are you on about?

940
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,871
The team leader isn't a human?

941
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,916
Shocked, right? So were we.

942
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,086
Is there something you can do about it?
This isn't some kindergarten.

943
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,715
Listen, Hyeon.

944
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,926
The prosecution can't intervene
in police personnel matters.

945
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,971
How ridiculous.

946
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,058
That Chief Go is a total nutjob.

947
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,854
The scariest thing in the world
is when a fool goes mad.

948
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,564
There.

949
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,941
I've been waiting to take this place down.

950
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,693
- This one?
- That one.

951
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,486
- That one.
- Oh, I see.

952
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,030
What is that place?

953
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,364
- It's a ball boy room.
- Okay.

954
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,159
They package hepanyl to distribute
in the Jangdong-gu red-light district.

955
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,494
I didn't know Kim Hongsik also ran
such a small business.

956
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,579
He doesn't.

957
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,497
There's a guy named Jellyfish
who works under Boss Park,

958
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,541
and he secretly sells it
to rake in extra cash.

959
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,626
So we're going to raid that place?

960
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,003
The three of us?

961
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,423
You two wait here.

962
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,592
I'll be right back.

963
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,676
Stay there.

964
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,844
- What?
- It's dangerous.

965
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,305
Chae Dou, stay here and observe.

966
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,639
Wait for me, Father Kim!

967
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,724
What?

968
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,566
You didn't fall on your head, did you?

969
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,319
Wait there. I'll call 911 for you.

970
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,200
Oh, he's walking fine.

971
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,581
Are you sure you don't want to reconsider?

972
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,583
The intelligence agency is involved,

973
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,335
and now the chief has stepped in.

974
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,129
We should already be out of here.

975
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,339
Should I inform the Geckos?

976
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,929
Hello, Prosecutor Park.

977
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:24,975
I'm walking down Haeridan Street right now
and thought of you.

978
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,021
What was that?

979
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,112
I was near a puffed rice machine.

980
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,447
Haeridan Street, right?
Would you like some puffed rice?

981
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,242
Oh, puffed rice. That sounds good.

982
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,666
What made you think of me
while walking down this street?

983
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:54,171
It's lively and a bit rugged,

984
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:57,757
but there's something cool about it.

985
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,387
Oh, please.

986
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,764
I also have a favor to ask you.

987
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,224
What is it?

988
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,601
Can you sponsor me?

989
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,270
-Sponsor you?
-Yes.

990
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,064
To be honest,
I didn't really like it here at first

991
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,317
because it felt like
I was forced to be here.

992
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:19,321
But now that I've been here for a while,
it's grown on me.

993
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:24,159
Especially the kids who cause trouble
but are trying to turn things around.

994
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,870
Of all the kids
who received protective disposition,

995
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:30,123
I've gathered 20 who want to study.

996
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:33,251
So how about doing a good deed
and giving them scholarships?

997
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:35,921
Mmm.

998
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,384
What is it?

999
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,845
Is there something on my face?

1000
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,932
Yes, puffed rice.

1001
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,354
You could've pretended not to notice.

1002
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:58,693
I'll give them scholarships.

1003
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,362
Spending big is what I'm good at.

1004
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,571
Really?

1005
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:06,451
By the way,
are you going to stay in Uma-gu?

1006
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:07,702
Yes.

1007
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:11,414
Even if a nuclear bomb drops,

1008
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,291
I'm not going to leave this place
anytime soon.

1009
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,170
You're also going to stay, right?

1010
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,298
Oh my.

1011
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,509
The kids are blowing bubbles.

1012
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,386
Guys!

1013
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,012
I love bubbles!

1014
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,014
Can I join?

1015
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,100
Heehee!

1016
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:31,518
Ah!

1017
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,603
Bubbles!

1018
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,189
Heehee!

1019
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:37,857
Hey!

1020
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,818
Where are you going?

1021
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,361
Come here!

1022
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,451
Man, I'm tired.

1023
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,497
What are you doing?

1024
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,166
Don't forget
the two things you have to tell us.

1025
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,045
Your identity.

1026
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,548
This is ridiculous.

1027
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,134
And the identity of the person screaming.

1028
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,596
If you don't tell us,
I'll crush your skull.

1029
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,889
Tell us!

1030
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,474
There's nothing to tell you.

1031
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,560
I don't know who the woman is either!

1032
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:14,936
Oh.

1033
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,938
-Do you also have powers?
-What?

1034
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,065
We never said it was a woman.

1035
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,650
Ah…

1036
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,278
-Tell us! Who are you?
-Tell us!

1037
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,822
Tell us! Who are you?

1038
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,574
Tell us! Who are you?

1039
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:29,743
Tell us! Who are you?

1040
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:30,827
Okay, okay.

1041
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,203
Here goes.

1042
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,457
I was in the Drug Investigation Unit
at Chungnam Provincial Police Agency.

1043
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,583
Let me go.

1044
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,045
Are you serious? Are you one of us?

1045
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,172
I am…

1046
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:44,257
Detectives Gu Jayoung and Gu Daeyoung.

1047
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,718
Salute.

1048
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,512
Wait, so…

1049
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,723
You knew who we were.

1050
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,516
And to save us, you…

1051
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:57,062
Thank you so much… Jung Uyeol.

1052
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,980
That's my alias.

1053
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,608
My real name is Bing Sangu.

1054
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,986
Then are you undercover right now?

1055
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,488
No.

1056
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,031
I've been abandoned.

1057
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,449
Something went wrong, huh?

1058
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,910
I've been an undercover drug dealer
for four years…

1059
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,038
and there are no records of me
in the Drug Investigation Unit.

1060
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,956
You're playing an undercover role

1061
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,334
like Lee Jungjae did in New World.

1062
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,211
Oh, Jungjae.

1063
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,295
Ah.

1064
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,005
But I find it kind of strange.

1065
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,926
Most undercover agents
are cool and good-looking.

1066
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:29,928
What are you talking about?

1067
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,055
That's just a stereotype.

1068
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,140
All undercover cops in real life
are like me.

1069
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,601
- Okay.
- Then tell me.

1070
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,686
Is there someone in the force
who knows about you?

1071
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:41,314
There was one person.

1072
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,108
But he passed away.

1073
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:46,820
He was overworked
and got into a car accident.

1074
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:47,987
It's always like this.

1075
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,448
Only those
who live diligently end up dying!

1076
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,325
Be quiet!

1077
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,412
Does that mean
you can't go back to your unit?

1078
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,038
I lived…

1079
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,874
as a drug dealer for four years.

1080
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,169
I have a criminal record…

1081
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,590
and there's no one
who knows about my real identity.

1082
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,306
Then you should've

1083
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,560
run away!

1084
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,728
You know how it is.

1085
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,315
You can only leave the drug ring
as a corpse.

1086
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,944
Hey.

1087
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,821
Then are you going to live
as a drug dealer forever?

1088
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:31,364
It's not like I want to.

1089
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,201
I'm sick and tired of this life!

1090
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:47,172
Blow your nose.

1091
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,342
Detective Bing,

1092
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,137
we'll get you reinstated.

1093
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,972
How?

1094
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,559
I'm a drug dealer now.

1095
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,853
We have…

1096
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,938
…Aladdin who can help you.

1097
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,982
He'll rub the lamp

1098
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,151
and get you reinstated.

1099
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,862
Aladdin, my foot.

1100
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:11,946
Oh, right.

1101
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:14,782
Who's the woman being tortured?

1102
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:15,950
Who?

1103
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,330
Oh, he brought a woman with him.

1104
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,081
What was it again?

1105
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,585
He said she was
an intelligence agent or something.

1106
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,337
Intelligence agent?

1107
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,589
The National Intelligence Service?

1108
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,425
Narcotics Team

1109
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:38,014
Chief, you were really cool today.

1110
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,475
Please, not at all.

1111
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,394
I just did what I had to do.

1112
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,730
Chief, it was really cool

1113
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,358
- when you swung this around earlier.
- Hey, hey.

1114
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,527
You were great.

1115
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,030
You'll catch
the rest of the guys who ran off, right?

1116
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,198
Of course.

1117
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,284
I'll have them arrested by today.

1118
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,080
Your name.

1119
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,123
Your name!

1120
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,461
There's a woman
being tortured on the ship.

1121
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,338
Apparently, she's an intelligence agent.

1122
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:22,183
Grass Bookstore

1123
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,939
Seokhui!

1124
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,108
Seokhui!

1125
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,201
So Kim Hongsik
took that colleague of yours?

1126
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,662
I think they caught on to us
exchanging information.

1127
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,665
What do we do?
Is there a way we can save her?

1128
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:49,836
He wouldn't agree to taking me in
and letting her go, would he?

1129
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,629
Of course not!

1130
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,381
He's going to kill you both.

1131
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:54,841
What kind of question is that?

1132
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,426
My gosh, what do we do?

1133
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,886
There's only one way.

1134
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,223
South and Korea
will have to raid the place.

1135
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,475
-As in you and me?
-Yeah.

1136
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,685
Me too?

1137
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,645
We come as a package.

1138
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,439
Goodness gracious.

1139
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,277
Hey, Dimitri!

1140
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,988
Hey, Boss Park.

1141
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,991
Yo, Dimitri,
Christmas tree.

1142
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,326
One, two, three.

1143
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,744
It's nice to see you.

1144
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,162
It's been a while.

1145
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,497
You look really well and peaceful.

1146
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,041
I've never been better.

1147
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,459
I got Botox on my forehead.

1148
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,377
You did?

1149
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,256
This is the fierce but nice guy
I told you about.

1150
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,633
Ah…

1151
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,426
Hello.

1152
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,595
I'm a fierce but nice guy.

1153
01:00:40,678 --> 01:00:43,598
I'm Gozaev from Vladivostok.

1154
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,224
Mr. Gozaev.

1155
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:47,769
Nice to meet you.
I'm Boss Park from Uma-gu.

1156
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,356
I feel like we've met before.

1157
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:53,358
No, I doubt it.

1158
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,779
Do these guys have face blindness?

1159
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,782
They didn't recognize Gu Daeyoung,
and now he can't recognize me.

1160
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,827
I was mistaken.

1161
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:08,081
Have some Dubai chocolate.

1162
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:14,003
I heard you run a big pharmacy.

1163
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,088
That's right.

1164
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,506
Worldwife…

1165
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,590
World…

1166
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,175
World…

1167
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,594
Worldwide business is the friend…

1168
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,012
I mean, the trend of the world these days.

1169
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:25,556
Sorry, I only just started
learning English.

1170
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:31,437
It's the massive ship at the wharf
with the Thai writing, right?

1171
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,065
How do you know about that?

1172
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,318
That's the kind of information

1173
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,238
our Russian friends
can get in their sleep.

1174
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:47,578
Stop giving me
that suspicious look, Boss Park.

1175
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:49,497
I'd like to…

1176
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,458
make an investment.

1177
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,127
An investment?

1178
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,004
I'm sorry to say this,

1179
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,924
but our chairman
doesn't just take anyone's money.

1180
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,926
Ah…

1181
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:07,098
Well, with 400 to 500 billion won
in 100-dollar bills sitting on that ship,

1182
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:10,017
my money probably wouldn't even feel
like real money to him.

1183
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,686
400 to 500 billion won?

1184
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,522
I guess you didn't know.

1185
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,776
That's something
even the kids in the Russian mafia know.

1186
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,695
Ah…

1187
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,822
He had no idea.

1188
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,286
Of course I did.

1189
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,830
I just pretended not to
for security reasons.

1190
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,623
My acting's on point, huh?

1191
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:37,044
Of course, you of all people should know.

1192
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,171
That's right.

1193
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,339
Then do you know this?

1194
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,175
There's something inside the ship.

1195
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,260
Boom!

1196
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,845
A bomb.

1197
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,597
A bomb?

1198
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,265
Oh, jeez!

1199
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,810
You're quite the player, sir.

1200
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,228
Excuse me.

1201
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,564
Damn it.

1202
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,441
What now?

1203
01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,776
Don't you ever clock out?

1204
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:00,860
What clock, sir?

1205
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:02,653
It's Wednesday.

1206
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,155
I'm sorry.

1207
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,408
I just had something urgent to tell you.

1208
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,745
We can talk tomorrow
if it's not life or death.

1209
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:11,913
It is, sir.

1210
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,664
In fact,

1211
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,667
it involves
the lives of 3,000 to 4,000 people.

1212
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,087
Did I hear that right? A bomb?

1213
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,172
Yes, sir.

1214
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,632
To be more precise,

1215
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:25,301
it'll wipe out everything
within a 300-meter radius.

1216
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,428
That Kim is a complete nutjob.

1217
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:28,971
What is he, Oppenheimer?

1218
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,348
In the end,

1219
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:33,142
Chairman Kim will take down
both you and Uma-gu…

1220
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,852
…at the same time.

1221
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,187
That's right.

1222
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,564
This really pisses me off,

1223
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,816
but it's a neat ending.

1224
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,442
It is.

1225
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,111
Then is there a way
to get rid of the bomb?

1226
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,031
It's too tricky to manage ourselves,

1227
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,366
so we'll have to bring in bastards…

1228
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,203
I mean, outside help to deal with it.

1229
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:55,206
-Outside help?
-Yes, sir.

1230
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,041
Oh, nice to meet you.

1231
01:03:57,124 --> 01:04:00,461
I'm Prosecutor Duhun Nam from South Korea.

1232
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,547
Regarding Phukha,

1233
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:06,801
who is subjected
to an Interpol red notice, you know?

1234
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:11,722
Actually, we expect
to pinpoint his location

1235
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:13,516
within the next few days.

1236
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,101
Yes.

1237
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:18,646
So, in case of an arrest,

1238
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:23,484
how long will it take
for your arrest team to get there?

1239
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,236
Once the suspect is apprehended…

1240
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,530
-Uh-huh.
-…we'll take him with us.

1241
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:33,369
But we've got too many insiders
spilling information.

1242
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,996
Yes, yes.

1243
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:36,747
Let me see.

1244
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:38,457
Then…

1245
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:43,546
I think we'd better keep it a secret.

1246
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,715
Okay.

1247
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,383
Thank you.

1248
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:51,679
Amazing pronunciation.

1249
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:54,307
How are we
going to get Father Kim on the ship?
How are we
going to get Father Kim on the ship?

1250
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,934
All right, hear me out.

1251
01:04:57,476 --> 01:05:00,855
Boss Park is the only person
who can open the main gate.

1252
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,399
Of all the drug dealers I know,
he's the most gullible,

1253
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,610
and he has intense mood swings.

1254
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,778
He must really care for his underlings.

1255
01:05:07,862 --> 01:05:09,405
He cried his eyes out
when one of them died.

1256
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:11,616
That cold-blooded killer

1257
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,285
crying over his men is absolutely absurd!

1258
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:15,995
So how are we going to get

1259
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,581
that absurd, crybaby Boss Park
to open the gate?

1260
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,794
What if his brother who died
comes back to life?

1261
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,713
How would that be possible?

1262
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:33,095
You, Shaman Yuk Duja,
can make him come back to life.

1263
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,447
Someone is blocking
all the energy on this ship.

1264
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,783
We need to relieve
their pent-up resentment.

1265
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,576
Who's blocking it?

1266
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,746
By any chance…

1267
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:02,541
…is there anyone around you
who died an unfair death recently?

1268
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,002
There is. Jellyfish.

1269
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,713
It's not him!

1270
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,386
I see him.

1271
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:15,596
I see him.

1272
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:19,141
He weighs 125 kg.

1273
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:22,311
He's 180 cm tall.

1274
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:25,272
He's got patchy hair.

1275
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,192
Why is he stuffing himself with sausages?

1276
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,027
Wait, isn't she talking about Fire Eel?

1277
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:32,571
Patchy hair? Sausages? Who is that?

1278
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,032
Oh, goodness.

1279
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,743
-He's a filial son.
-That's me.

1280
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,246
He's on fire. Jeez, it's hot.

1281
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,707
It's an eel on fire.

1282
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,375
Ah! It's Fire Eel!

1283
01:06:44,458 --> 01:06:46,210
I told you, it's him.

1284
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:51,257
We need to relieve that pig's resentment
for this ship to be safe.

1285
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:53,509
That's what the higher power
is telling me.

1286
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:56,846
Goodness, he must be so resentful!

1287
01:06:56,929 --> 01:07:00,099
Oh, my goodness, it's so hot.

1288
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,517
Gosh, I smell incense.

1289
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:04,186
- I smell it.
- What's with her?

1290
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,064
He's here!

1291
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:09,692
He's here!

1292
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,495
- In there?
- Mm.

1293
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:24,040
Are you sure we can go in there?

1294
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,625
She said Fire Eel is in there.

1295
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,211
Wait.

1296
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,504
Damn it.

1297
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,392
Just stand back.

1298
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,227
This must be the lab.

1299
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,564
Our plan to enter the lab is a success.

1300
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:52,193
Let's initiate our next plan.

1301
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,164
Isn't that him?

1302
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:11,045
That's Fire Eel!

1303
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:12,838
He's holding a sausage!

1304
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:13,923
My goodness!

1305
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:16,509
Why are you still wandering
instead of going to the afterlife?

1306
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:18,552
My friend, Fire Eel!

1307
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,721
My brother, Fire Eel!

1308
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,349
- Fire Eel!
- Fire Eel!

1309
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,683
You can't go!

1310
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,186
If you mess with a ghost,

1311
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,688
it'll latch onto you.

1312
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,359
I'm sorry, Fire Eel.

1313
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:35,277
I'll just look at you from here.

1314
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:37,238
Jeez, man.

1315
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,450
- I'll look at you from here!
- Over there.

1316
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,078
Where are you going?

1317
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,162
My goodness.

1318
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,915
Fire Eel!

1319
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:52,545
He has so much resentment
that he's still wandering around.

1320
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,171
Shaman.

1321
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:58,926
What can we do to let him rest in peace?

1322
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:01,971
His resentment runs far too deep.

1323
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:03,764
There's nothing I can do.

1324
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,892
Then who can, if not you?

1325
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,771
There are two shamans
who passed their power onto me.

1326
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,482
They have to come here.

1327
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:25,661
Hey, make way.

1328
01:09:51,645 --> 01:09:52,897
Ta-da.

1329
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,786
Be careful.

1330
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,463
- You're all dead meat.
- You're done for.

1331
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:27,348
Thanks to Jung Donghwan
for his special appearance

1332
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:31,727
Thanks to Jung Donghwan
for his special appearance

1333
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:04,969
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1334
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,887
- You guys were on the same team?
- Spirits.

1335
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:08,597
No, we're family.

1336
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,307
Run to the entrance!

1337
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,352
There's someone else
you shouldn't trust, not me.

1338
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,561
Who the hell are you guys?

1339
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:16,772
It seems Prosecutor Nam
is trying to cut Kim Hongsik off.

1340
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:19,108
Weakening your partner
for you to become stronger.

1341
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,651
- What the hell?
- I heard

1342
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,403
Kim Hongsik will be doomed
if we take down this place.

1343
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:23,570
It's finally time.

1344
01:11:23,654 --> 01:11:25,489
Did they run away?

1345
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:27,157
Can you come with me?

1346
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,493
There's something more serious.

1347
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:30,869
Where's Prosecutor Park Kyungsun?

1348
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:32,579
Let's make it special this time.

1349
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,250
We have to finish everything by today.

1350
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:45,217
