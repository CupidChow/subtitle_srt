00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,457
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,862
Ta-da.

8
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,251
- You're all dead meat.
- You're done for.

9
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,715
Episode 10
Blessings Start Rough

10
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,759
Where did she go?
She's not even picking up.

11
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,846
Where's Prosecutor Park?

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,390
She left saying
she had an urgent matter to attend to.

13
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,726
An urgent matter? I wonder what it is.

14
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,186
You can get back to work.

15
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,231
Darn it.

16
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,942
She's all over the place, isn't she?

17
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,362
What now?

18
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,947
There's something urgent
I need to tell you.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,323
What isn't urgent?

20
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,742
I bet the emergency center
doesn't even get this many calls.

21
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,036
This is actually urgent.

22
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,871
It's about Father Kim Haeil.

23
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,249
I had Detective Cho
stay at the hospital

24
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,000
in case there might be trouble if he died.

25
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,877
But guess what?

26
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:12,257
An unexpected person showed up.

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,758
An unexpected person?

28
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,510
What, did Son Heungmin show up?

29
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,680
I followed her tracks
to see who she came to visit…

30
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,599
and it was Father Kim Haeil.

31
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,602
Caught you. Say cheese.

32
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,939
She's also a world-class traitor, huh?

33
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,027
Man, my blood pressure's going up.

34
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,488
This is a strange new feeling.

35
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,158
Kim Hongsik

36
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,077
Hold on a second.

37
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,788
I need to deal with this first.

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,088
You didn't ask to meet
to deliver bad news, right?

39
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,632
No, sir.

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,011
The thing is…

41
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,137
Hmm?

42
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,347
Why don't you guys tell him?

43
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:05,393
The amount of kasanin leaves coming in
has increased dramatically.

44
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,561
What's wrong with that?

45
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,688
That's more for you guys to mooch off of.

46
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,982
It's too risky
if it increases more than this.

47
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,068
And it's beyond our capacity to handle it.

48
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,863
Listen.

49
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,281
Customs rats.

50
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,701
Then find a way to gather more rats.

51
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,785
We'll give you more food.

52
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,206
That's easier said than done.

53
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,042
I don't know
how things were back where you lived,

54
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,378
but things are different here in Korea.

55
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,265
This bastard's got
far too much national pride.

56
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,436
No one bends the rules like Korea does.

57
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,313
Answer me.

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,065
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,319
I'll…

60
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,738
I'll give you however much you want…

61
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,700
…so please let Fire Eel go to heaven.

62
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,287
I'd appreciate it if you could
squeeze Jellyfish in as a BOGO deal.

63
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,998
We don't do buy-one-get-one deals,

64
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,583
but this one's on the house.

65
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,876
Thank you.

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,255
Thank you so much, Shaman!
May you be blessed.

67
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,881
Will that be okay, sister?

68
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,429
Does the shaman in the velvet outfit
not know how to talk?

69
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,265
What did you say?

70
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,766
My sister

71
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:31,062
has sacrificed her voice to the spirits
to gain spiritual power.

72
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,189
You little.

73
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,691
No, I just…

74
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,234
As for the male shaman,

75
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:40,780
it'd be nice
if we could see your face a little bit.

76
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,700
You know,

77
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,368
just for security reasons.

78
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,204
My goodness! What's going on with her?

79
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,084
Jeez, what's going on?

80
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,711
What's wrong with her?

81
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,005
-I don't know!
-What's wrong with her?

82
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,971
She must've felt something outside.

83
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,723
There must be something there.

84
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,309
-I'll go check.
-Go. Hurry!

85
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,769
What's going on?

86
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,772
Show me around every corner of the ship.

87
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,316
Wait.

88
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,817
Instead of looking around the ship,

89
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,737
shouldn't you relieve
Fire Eel's resentment first?

90
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,240
Fire Eel's spirit
is wandering around this ship.

91
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,409
We have to find him first!

92
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,995
Fire Eel!

93
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,872
Why are you wandering around?

94
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,582
You don't even know your way around here.

95
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,459
Stay in one place, will you?

96
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,960
-All right, let's go.
-Let's go.

97
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,338
Wait, it's better this way.

98
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,257
-Let's go that way then.
-Let's get moving.

99
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,800
Spirits!

100
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,802
Spirits!

101
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:48,014
That was great.
Did you go to acting school?

102
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,182
You could easily win the Grand Prize.

103
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,267
True acting
isn't defined by chasing awards.

104
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,352
Where is it? Hurry.

105
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,270
It's this way. Follow me.

106
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,356
This way.

107
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,440
"Catholic Diocese of Busan"

108
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,108
Nothing like this has ever happened here.

109
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,403
Better yet, this has never happened
anywhere in the world.

110
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,283
How can a seminary be involved
in a conflict with a gang?

111
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:10,661
And what is this about the instructor
and student who initiated the conflict?

112
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,457
How have you been managing
the seminary and the students?

113
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,253
The archbishop is having a hard time
understanding the situation.

114
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,174
You will have to
get to the bottom of this incident

115
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,343
and provide a clear explanation.

116
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,137
I don't want to give an explanation.

117
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,556
What…

118
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,477
We only owe an explanation
if we've done something wrong.

119
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,770
Father Lee.

120
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,149
How could you say that in this situation?

121
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,194
You said this has never happened
anywhere in the world before.

122
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,322
That's not true.

123
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,990
It's happened everywhere.

124
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,159
There have been priests

125
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,703
who have fought against injustice
and violence by risking everything.

126
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,499
Spirits, help me find Fire Eel.
Spirits, help me find Fire Eel.

127
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,000
Spirits.

128
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,044
Spirits, help me find Fire Eel.

129
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,921
Spirits.

130
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,507
Please help me find Fire Eel.

131
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,883
Help me, spirits.

132
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,718
- Let's find him.
- Boss Park.

133
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,847
Doesn't this sound a lot like Roo'ra's
The Angel Who Lost Wings?

134
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,641
It's our Fire Eel who lost his wings.

135
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,978
He can't fly even if he has wings
because he's heavy.

136
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,105
You're heavy too!

137
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,898
Spirits.

138
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,026
This is it.

139
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,367
- Hold that.
- What?

140
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,498
Who are you?

141
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,459
Black Velvet.

142
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,633
Seokhui!

143
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,512
Seokhui.

144
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,432
Damn it, I knew it.

145
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,810
I guess even the Grim Reaper
is a woman these days.

146
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,353
Come to your senses.

147
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,688
It's Haeil.

148
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,774
Did you… become a nun?

149
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,818
Are any of your bones broken?

150
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:06,903
Can you walk?

151
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,492
Judging by how I'm annoyed seeing you,

152
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,785
I think I can walk.

153
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,162
I'm so sorry.

154
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,539
I shouldn't have gotten you involved.

155
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,875
It's better this way.

156
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,169
Now I have a reason to cut you off.

157
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,213
All right, you can cut me off.

158
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,507
But you can do that
after we get out of here.

159
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,758
Try walking.

160
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,806
-Careful.
-Oh, my God.

161
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,016
Who is he?

162
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,100
He's an undercover cop

163
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,019
from the Drug Investigation Unit
who's been here for four years.

164
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,896
Hello, I'm Detective Bing Sangu.

165
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,523
Oh, hello.

166
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,942
It must've been tough all alone.

167
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,360
Hostage obtained.

168
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,779
What am I, a game item?

169
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,030
You know what I mean.

170
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,615
The elderly are in the lab, right?

171
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,824
Yes, they're working right now.

172
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,327
Disguise Seokhui as one of them
and bring everyone to Uma Police Station.

173
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,079
No, it's okay.

174
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,413
I'm going with you.

175
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,207
I'm going to beat those bastards up.

176
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,251
You'll slow us down.
Just get to the agency's hospital.

177
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,335
- But--
- Wear this.

178
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,420
Take her and come to the station.

179
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,672
-Okay.
-Hey!

180
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,090
Be careful!

181
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,133
Come this way.

182
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,385
Help me…

183
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,054
Get out immediately.

184
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,474
Mm.

185
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,060
Boss Park.

186
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,436
Did you find him?

187
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,064
You have to manage your mood swings, okay?

188
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,148
Mood swings?

189
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,779
Run to the entrance!

190
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,533
Get them! Get them!

191
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,248
What are we, wanted criminals?
Why are they blasting the siren so loud?

192
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,749
Why is the entrance so far away?

193
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,001
It feels far when you're running away.

194
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,085
It's so far.

195
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,629
There's a way out over here!
I memorized the way!

196
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,172
Hurry up and open it!

197
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,509
-Hurry, hurry!
Come on!

198
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,720
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

199
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,139
Come here!

200
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,600
You're dead meat!

201
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,351
I'm going to kill you!

202
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,816
Where the hell did they go?

203
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,526
Did they leave?

204
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,403
Maksan, that bastard.

205
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,904
He sure does live recklessly!

206
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,366
Go, go, go!

207
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,577
Wait.
I thought it was the way out.

208
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,870
This is the lab.

209
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,372
I had it memorized.
Left, right, left, right.

210
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,875
No, it's left, right, left, left, right.

211
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,545
No, it's left, right, left, right,
left, left, right.

212
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,922
It's right, left, right, left,
right, left, left.

213
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,215
Left, right, left, right.

214
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,929
What are you doing, Prosecutor Park?
I almost joined.

215
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,350
This is the lab, so there must be
a secret way out. Let's look for it.

216
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,191
Let's attack.

217
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,285
It's finally time.

218
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,953
I underwent

219
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,332
harsh training in Denmark
for this very moment.

220
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,919
For two weeks!

221
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,337
"Justice"

222
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,508
- Is that a guy or a girl?
- Damn it.

223
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,604
I swear, Park Kyungsun.
This dress is too… Wait, is this not it?

224
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,541
So that's where they were.

225
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,765
This room looks ridiculous.

226
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,475
I don't think
you're in a place to say that.

227
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,860
You bastard!

228
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,646
It's finally time.

229
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,155
Here goes the pig's transformation!

230
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,323
What's wrong with him?

231
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,909
What's he doing?

232
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,079
The power I got from the monster rabbit!

233
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,376
Fast charging complete!

234
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,555
Who said you're a budget superhero?

235
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,015
Pikachu!

236
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,517
Go, Yohan!

237
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,643
Stay still.

238
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,611
Yohan, electrocute him! Come on!

239
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,033
Is that person from the past?
What are they wearing?

240
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,911
I get that you're a drug dealer,

241
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,038
but isn't kidnapping and torturing a woman
a bit much?

242
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,750
-You guys were on the same team?
-No, we're family.

243
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,752
You should've told me sooner
that she was one of yours.

244
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,337
I guess Nam Duhun didn't tell you…

245
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,673
that I used to be one of them.

246
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,425
You guys must be really close
to share such intimate information.

247
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,553
I wonder why he didn't tell you.

248
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,596
Perhaps he wanted to toughen you up.

249
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,307
I'm already as tough as I can get.

250
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,287
How dare you hit a woman?

251
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,133
Hurts, doesn't it?

252
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,386
How dare you?

253
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,515
God damn it, pantyhose.

254
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,785
What are they, zombies?
Why aren't they staying down?

255
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,829
We have to get out, or we'll die.

256
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,582
Damn it.

257
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:20,294
Hey, priest.

258
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,297
Let's end things.

259
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,258
I don't think those guys down there
will last another minute.

260
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,698
Father Kim.

261
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,209
Where's the way out?

262
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,961
-I remember now!
-Me too!

263
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,213
Left, left, left, left, left, left, left.

264
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,381
Oh, come on!

265
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,592
How could you mess that up?

266
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,969
Go, hurry!

267
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,019
They're getting away.
Get them!

268
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,578
-No wonder things were going well.
-Damn it.

269
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,081
We can each take a guy.

270
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,582
- I call the hairy guy.
- What?

271
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,750
You pork belly!

272
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,669
Electronic power!

273
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,421
You all talk too much!
Let's go!

274
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,362
Get in! Hurry!

275
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,658
- Get in! Hurry!
- Get in! Hurry up!

276
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,369
Let's go! Come on!

277
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,621
Go get them!

278
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,206
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir! Get them!

279
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,333
Hurry up and get in!

280
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,349
Get in the car!

281
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,402
Drive carefully, will you?

282
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,405
How can I, in this situation?
Everyone, hold on!

283
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,616
There's nothing to hold on to!

284
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,952
- Step on it!
- Sister Kim!

285
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,876
TQ Logistics

286
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,191
Hey.

287
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,567
-Hey.
-Hey.

288
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,779
"Safe Uma, happy citizens"

289
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,447
Come in slowly.

290
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,949
Watch your step.

291
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,284
Don't worry.

292
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,997
Good work.

293
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,499
Ma'am.

294
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:49,336
We only did what they told us to do.

295
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,338
- I swear.
- It's true.

296
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,465
-That's right.
-Indeed.

297
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,967
I understand.

298
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:00,389
If you all just answer
our questions honestly,

299
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,224
we'll factor that in
as a mitigating circumstance.

300
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,433
Okay.

301
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:04,810
Please escort them.

302
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,061
Yes, ma'am. Please follow me.

303
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,855
- Okay.
- Don't worry.

304
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,614
Get up, get up.

305
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,949
-Get up.
-Sir.

306
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,242
-I said get up.
-Sir.

307
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,454
Get up.

308
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,123
Please forgive me.

309
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,083
Sir…

310
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,751
Bring me a knife.

311
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,086
Now!

312
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,465
You've made too many mistakes.

313
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,900
Actually, no.

314
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,361
Let's make a cemetery tomorrow.

315
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,952
We should've done it sooner.

316
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,748
We've been exposed. It's too risky now.

317
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,126
They know about the gas and the bomb,

318
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,462
so they won't make any rash moves.

319
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,674
Even so, we should leave
before it's too late.

320
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:21,011
Just say the word,
and we'll have everything prepared.

321
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,764
Get the cash ready,

322
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,808
and get ready to move to Albuera.

323
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,894
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

324
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,718
What are you doing?

325
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,262
Need a hand?

326
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,599
-What? What do you want?
-What…

327
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,776
It's been a while
since I swung my sword around.

328
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,861
My forearm is killing me.

329
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,406
Why are you taking pictures?

330
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,366
Judging by how things went today,

331
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,494
I thought it'd be best to have
your funeral portraits ready in advance.

332
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,288
You little…

333
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,957
You'll see our double chins
if you take it from that angle.

334
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,919
You have a triple chin
even when you're standing, you pig.

335
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,880
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,590
Take another one of me.
I'll smile this time.

337
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,758
Sure.

338
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,385
Make a peace sign. Good.

339
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,555
My knees.

340
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,598
My joints are all worn out.

341
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,644
Is the hospital
your colleague went to safe?

342
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,063
Yeah, it's affiliated with the agency,
so it's safe.

343
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,899
What's the deal with Fire Eel?

344
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,192
Fire Eel?

345
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,611
What do you mean?

346
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,780
He was resurrected.

347
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,865
It's cold.

348
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,868
I'm going to freeze to death.
Please let me out of here.

349
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,037
Is anyone out there?

350
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,794
What happened?

351
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,298
- Huh?
- How are you alive?

352
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,426
I've been sensitive to cold
since I was young,

353
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,179
so even a little chill
would make me tense up.

354
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,265
It was so cold in the mortuary chamber

355
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,225
that I tensed up.

356
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,645
This is unbelievable.
It's a miracle.

357
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,315
Since you've experienced a miracle,
live a good life from now on.

358
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,984
Okay, I'll live
the rest of my life atoning.

359
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,237
But didn't the doctor say
there was fluid in his stomach?

360
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,697
I guess he was wrong.

361
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,948
It must naturally be like this.

362
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,241
I thought it was fluid too.

363
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,577
-Are you okay? Does it hurt?
-The eel is pregnant.

364
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,665
It's thanks to the power of your prayers.

365
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,834
You prayed for him when he died.

366
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,587
-Of course.
-That was nothing.

367
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,047
I did what was expected of a priest.

368
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,549
I swear your prayers

369
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,760
have mega, ultra, super strong powers.

370
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:07,844
The best.

371
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,222
What am I, a superhero with superpowers?

372
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,265
Wait a second.

373
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:13,392
Detective Bing,

374
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,769
what are you doing there alone?

375
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,437
- Come join us.
- Come on.

376
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,064
- Join us. You're family now.
- Come here.

377
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,148
- Come join us.
- Come here.

378
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,233
Come on.

379
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,651
- You're family.
- Okay.

380
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,195
- Lie down here.
- There's a lot of room. Lie down.

381
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,531
-Hey, scoot over.
-You had to pick the tightest spot, huh?

382
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,246
It's always tight next to Yohan.

383
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,997
Jeez, it's so crowded.

384
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,167
Good work, Detective Bing.

385
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,628
Father Kim will have you reinstated.

386
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,089
Oh, Father Kim
was the Aladdin you were talking about?

387
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:48,427
Yes. If you rub his arm three times,
he'll grant your wish.

388
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,055
I'm too exhausted
to come out of the lamp right now.

389
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,226
You should've taken
better care of yourself!

390
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,853
- Right.
- Right.

391
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,772
You should've at least told me
if you were in such a serious condition!

392
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,775
I know we only just met, but that's not
something you should keep to yourself.

393
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,945
How does it make sense that the comites
don't know about the bellator's health?

394
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,532
I don't want to attend your funeral.

395
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,117
Is he ill?

396
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,619
I don't know.
It seems we're the odd ones out.

397
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,746
I feel so left out.

398
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,916
It's only been five years
since Father Lee Yeongjun passed away.

399
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,587
I can't say goodbye to you too.
Actually, I won't.

400
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,803
Will you give me a chance…

401
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,515
to confess to you, my friends?

402
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,191
I'm sorry I didn't tell you…

403
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,611
about my illness.

404
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,989
I'd like to apologize to you all.

405
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,073
But from now on,

406
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,784
I promise I'll share

407
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,704
every little pain and secret
with you guys.

408
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,416
There's a saying I've overlooked…

409
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,836
because I was so focused
on fulfilling my duty.

410
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,214
"If you want to go fast, go alone.

411
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,801
But if you want to go far, go together."

412
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,182
Just as that saying goes,

413
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,601
I'll make sure…

414
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,311
-The food must be here.
-…to stay with you for a long…

415
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,687
- When did you order?
- Food!

416
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,064
Did you order noodles too?

417
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,524
Soju, soju, soju.

418
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,569
I don't even have the energy
to yell anymore.

419
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,864
I'm so tired.

420
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,783
Today, the Busan Uma
Police Chief's press conference

421
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,618
caused quite a stir.

422
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,702
Let's take a look.

423
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,413
Starting today,

424
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:44,459
the Uma Police Station will declare war,

425
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,921
no, a dogfight, against the drug cartel
operating in the Uma district of Busan.

426
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,383
Narcotics Team Leader Ma Jungno,
please say a word.

427
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,677
Hello,

428
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,762
I'm Team Leader Ma Jungno
of the Narcotics Team.

429
00:25:56,513 --> 00:26:01,101
Our team will hunt down the drug cartel
to the ends of the earth

430
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,520
and utterly destroy them.

431
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,314
I'm sorry, but you'll have to be
utterly destroyed first.

432
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,482
Good luck!

433
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,611
What is this, some sort of school play?

434
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,285
Hey, Chief Go.

435
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:24,165
Why don't you dispose
of that Team Leader Ma or whatever

436
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,585
and slap some sense into yourself?

437
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,880
I've never been
as clear-headed as I am right now.

438
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,299
Ms. Chief.

439
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,926
If you keep this up
thinking the priest's got your back,

440
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,428
you'll also end up in heaven.

441
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,680
So quit your bullshit

442
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,182
and just lounge around in your office!

443
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,227
Lounging around all day is rather boring.

444
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,854
One second.

445
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,648
Team Leader Ma says
he'd like to say a word.

446
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,818
This is Team Leader Ma Jungno.

447
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,487
There are three things I dislike.

448
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,698
First, oppression of human rights.

449
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,825
Second, excessive use of force.

450
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,202
And lastly, external pressure.

451
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,039
Hello? Hello…

452
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,921
I guess you won't be
leaving this world peacefully either.

453
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,424
Well done,
Team Leader Ma.

454
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,593
High five!

455
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,847
What a sight.

456
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,106
Put the bed all the way down.

457
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,359
No, stop it. Just stop it.

458
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,195
-You'll get bedsores.
-Leave me alone.

459
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,571
Hello.

460
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,658
-Hey, you came.
-Goodness gracious.

461
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,117
Hey.

462
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,620
You okay, friend?

463
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,288
It hurts.

464
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,293
Goodness, he mashed you up
like a potato salad.

465
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,879
I'm sorry for showing you
such an ugly sight, my friend.

466
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,214
It's okay.

467
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,133
Things like this happen
when you do business.

468
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,387
Then shall we… postpone our plan?

469
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,554
Our what?

470
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,099
Oh, a placard?

471
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,769
There's no need to do that for me.

472
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,605
This won't work.

473
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,233
Sir, don't worry.

474
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,151
I'll make sure to thoroughly prepare it.

475
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,446
All right. It's best to stick to the plan.

476
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,781
We'll make it quick and sweet.

477
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,076
Kim Hongsik, that asshole.

478
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,870
It's finally time.

479
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,081
I'll…

480
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,710
make sure to burn him to ashes.

481
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,091
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong with him?

482
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,175
Nurse!

483
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,969
Someone's calling me. I'm getting a call.

484
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,346
-Oh, I see.
-Can you put it next to my ear?

485
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,431
Sure.

486
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,601
Just go.

487
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,437
Just go already!

488
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,105
I got it. I'm sorry.

489
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,273
Hello?

490
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,359
Oh, Prosecutor Nam.

491
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,570
Do a small job for me.

492
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,406
Actually, make that two.

493
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,700
Two?

494
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,588
All right.

495
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,298
This is very important.

496
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,968
We have to finish everything by today.

497
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,636
Are you sure we can end things?

498
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,682
I guess you don't know our strength yet.
Tell him.

499
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,519
Somehow getting the impossible done!

500
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,980
He's right. We always somehow get it done.

501
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,523
All right, we'll show you

502
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,777
the power of half-assing!

503
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,112
I love the passion in you guys.

504
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,740
I deeply trust you all.

505
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,450
I'll be counting on you. All right.

506
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,744
- Dismissed!
- Dismissed!

507
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,413
- Let's go.
- It's this one, Songsak.

508
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,081
-It's this one, you idiot.
-Back off.

509
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,958
Yohan and Songsak, you guys take this one.

510
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,336
Team Leader Gu, Detective Gu,
and Detective Bing are in this one.

511
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,670
So it's two and three…

512
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,297
Is it really that difficult to split up?

513
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,632
I knew he didn't trust us.

514
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,258
- You said you trusted us.
- I'm sick of this.

515
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,302
He doesn't trust us.

516
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,929
It's not that I don't trust you. I just…

517
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,263
He doesn't.

518
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,475
Who's driving? Is the van driving itself?

519
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,648
We don't have a driver's license.

520
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,192
I'll drive for you.

521
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,236
Team Leader Gu, you drive this one.

522
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,073
Jeez, I've never been so overworked.

523
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,701
We can raid
the honey jar storage room tomorrow.

524
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,205
If there is a tomorrow for me that is.

525
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,625
Come in.

526
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,211
When did you get here?

527
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,462
Oh.

528
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,880
I just got here.

529
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,924
I heard there was an urgent matter.

530
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,052
My brother got into trouble,
so I had to go help him out.

531
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,762
I didn't know you had a brother.

532
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,348
I thought you were an only child
from the way you acted.

533
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:54,561
He's got a nasty temper,
so he gets into trouble a lot.

534
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:59,274
Those who can't control their temper
are a lost cause.

535
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,483
Did you take care of it?

536
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,068
Yes, I did.

537
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,445
That's all that matters then.

538
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,489
Considering how messed up
the world is these days,

539
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,824
I was just worried.

540
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,909
I'm sorry for making you worry.

541
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:13,204
From now on,
let me know if something happens.

542
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,498
I'm an expert at solving problems,
you know?

543
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,083
I will. Thank you.

544
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,418
It's no big deal.

545
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,211
You can go home now.

546
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,297
I'll see you bright and early tomorrow.

547
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,923
Yes, sir. Have a good day.

548
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,885
I have to go meet the chief prosecutor.

549
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,846
I kissed his ass that one time,
and he won't stop calling me.

550
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,473
I hope it's not too bad today.

551
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,558
Salute!

552
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,477
See you tomorrow.

553
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,905
Welcome.

554
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,407
You've come a long way.

555
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,492
I've heard a lot about you from Gozaev.

556
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,912
You're from NASA, right?

557
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,831
Please help us out. This way.

558
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,001
It's slippery,
so please watch your step.

559
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,338
NASA is in the States, right?

560
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,059
Busan King Karaoke

561
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:31,908
Who the hell are you guys?

562
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,087
Are you okay?

563
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,713
Ms. Kim?

564
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,967
I'm fine, thanks to you.

565
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:57,642
Wait, are you the one
who zapped me last time?

566
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,608
Yonggwang Fisheries and Shipping
does two things.

567
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,444
They distribute the drugs
in Southeast Asia, and…

568
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,071
Bring in the kasanin leaves.

569
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,489
Yes, that's right.

570
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,783
I get they have
their way of shipping it out,

571
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,410
but they need to pass customs
to bring them in.

572
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,912
Prosecutor Nam has two men
working for him in customs.

573
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,998
-It's only one now though.
-Why?

574
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,709
One of them pissed Chairman Kim off
and died on the spot.

575
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,545
They became food for the sturgeons.

576
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,005
You know who the other one is, right?

577
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,840
Yeah, his name is Lee.

578
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,217
He's a corrupt piece of shit.

579
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,760
If we take down this place,

580
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,221
we'll be shutting down Kim Hongsik's
production and distribution, right?

581
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,515
Yes, completely shutting it down.

582
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,766
The drugs are obviously an issue,

583
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,894
but we also have to take down
the rotten customs guys too.

584
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,980
Things are easier

585
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,733
now that we can just toss these bastards
to Chief Go.

586
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,102
Come back.

587
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,104
I said come back.

588
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,697
What's your real affiliation?

589
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,408
Busan District Prosecutors' Office's
Internal Investigations Team.

590
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:39,285
Were you investigating
Prosecutor Nam Duhun?

591
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,661
Yes.

592
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,913
Who do you report to?

593
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,624
I was sent here under
Chief Prosecutor Park Byeongil's orders.

594
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,920
I see, it was Chief Prosecutor Park.

595
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,756
Where did you work
before being dispatched here?

596
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,133
You'll find out soon enough.

597
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,261
How did you know I was dispatched?

598
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,139
A spy recognizes a fellow spy.

599
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,477
Do you know
what the purpose of the go house is?

600
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,895
It's a honey jar storage room

601
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,688
where Prosecutor Nam
hides his secret files.

602
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,649
I knew about it long before you did.

603
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,359
How'd you know I'd go there?

604
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,237
I tailed you the day you were questioning

605
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,405
Vice Minister Park's son.

606
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,699
Why did you stop me from going in?

607
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,743
Why did you zap me?

608
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,245
The thing is…

609
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,205
there's a security camera
inside that room.

610
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,459
Oh.

611
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,129
What's this?

612
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,841
I noticed that
he was watching the room on his phone.

613
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,844
You would've been caught
if you had gone in.

614
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,138
Then how'd you know about tonight?

615
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,641
I look through his laptop
whenever he's out of the office.

616
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,268
Specifically, deleted files.

617
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,228
I was looking through it earlier,

618
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:52,191
and there was CCTV footage of you
visiting Father Kim Haeil at the hospital.

619
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,778
Oh, so he saw that.

620
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,574
Wait, so he knew everything
and still said,

621
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,993
"I'll see you bright and early tomorrow"?

622
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,494
How sly.

623
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,497
These guys are Boss Park's guys.

624
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:10,334
I'm certain
that Prosecutor Nam was behind this.

625
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,045
These assholes.

626
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,006
This is really pissing me off.

627
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,508
How dare they play around with my life?

628
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,307
Why are you so tense?

629
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,059
Where's the person
who was using two stun guns?

630
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,145
The thing is…

631
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,317
There's something I didn't tell you
about this house.

632
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,777
What is it? Wait, one second.

633
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,198
Okay.

634
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,449
Tell me.

635
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:43,826
To be honest…

636
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,958
I'm going to the bathroom.
It's number two.

637
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:58,174
Is he singing or just being a clown?

638
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,927
That was just pure yelling.

639
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,095
My ears are ringing.

640
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,852
This relieves your fatigue and stress.

641
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,979
It's really amazing.

642
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,314
You should give it a go.

643
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,815
What the hell?

644
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,611
Is she not dead yet?

645
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,613
Pawn Park

646
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,782
Where are you?

647
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,744
What are you doing?

648
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,706
Zapped?

649
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,876
Double pistols?

650
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,796
Cut the crap, you idiot.

651
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,677
This complicates things.

652
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,513
What's taking him so long?

653
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,223
Sir.

654
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,059
Don't say too much.

655
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,394
Then I'll die.

656
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,770
Hey, friends.

657
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,273
What took you so long?

658
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,442
Are you okay?

659
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,070
-Damn it, it hurts!
-Oh, dear.

660
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,322
Shouldn't you stay at the hospital?

661
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,700
Jeez, an important bladder…

662
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,368
I mean, an important matter has come up.

663
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,120
I can't just stay in the hospital, can I?

664
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,539
Good point.

665
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,208
Is the work done?

666
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,793
Done, and there are no issues.

667
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,253
Chairman Kim…

668
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,463
didn't catch on, did he?

669
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:23,175
If he did,
we'd be crippled or dead by now.

670
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,262
Actually, we'd be blocks of ice.

671
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:28,597
All right.

672
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,225
We just need to get our hands on the cash.

673
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,897
Make sure to divide it evenly.

674
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,649
Don't worry about that.

675
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,027
Boss Park may not be good at subtraction,

676
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,695
but he's an expert
when it comes to division.

677
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,531
Damn right I am.

678
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,616
Great!

679
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,343
Come in.

680
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,011
Oh, Father Kim.

681
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,514
- Come in and take a seat.
- All right.

682
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:17,104
So, are you feeling better?

683
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,815
Yes, I'm much better now.

684
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:24,153
I heard you went to the Diocesan Office.

685
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,905
I did.

686
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,783
I went to see the bishop.

687
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,370
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

688
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,123
You sure know…

689
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,376
how to apologize quickly.

690
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,629
You must be really upset with me.

691
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,881
That's not true.

692
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,091
You're a…

693
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,929
You're a bellator.

694
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,142
I know you don't agree…
with a bellator's duty.

695
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,900
But in all honesty, you were a bellator
far before I became one.

696
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,361
May I ask why you deny ever being one?

697
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,115
That's not true, I was never a bellator.

698
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,325
To be more precise,

699
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,120
you've undergone a much tougher battle
than that of a bellator.

700
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,835
Noah found this
while organizing some old newspapers.

701
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,212
He fought in the 2004 demolition protests

702
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,797
in Yongcheon-gu, Seoul,

703
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,799
with the priests in the diocese.

704
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,927
I didn't expect him
to throw Molotov cocktails.

705
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,682
I've never even used those before.

706
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,353
It's all in the past.

707
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,648
It may be in the past,

708
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,525
but that doesn't make it go away.

709
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,153
I had no choice back then.

710
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,780
Fighting… was the only way.

711
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:51,824
Then what about now?

712
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,869
It's not a matter of past versus present.

713
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,245
I just think…

714
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,499
that lives matter more.

715
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,838
At the time,
I encouraged my closest friend

716
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,716
to join me,

717
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,510
and he died at the scene.

718
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,472
Francesco Jang Deokjun.

719
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,141
We attended seminary together.

720
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,728
Fighting against injustice…

721
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,190
only led to his death.

722
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,986
I might've considered it an honor
if it had been my death.

723
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,071
But because
it was that of my closest friend,

724
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,032
it felt like…

725
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,577
I had lost everything.

726
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:43,000
When I saw you fall to the ground
covered in blood that day…

727
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,462
…I was reminded of Deokjun.

728
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,756
That's why…

729
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,842
it was all the more heartbreaking
and painful.

730
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,637
Father Lee.

731
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,311
I've overcome death countless times
to fulfill my missions and duties.

732
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,023
There's something
that always crossed my mind

733
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,234
when I was on the verge of death.

734
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,531
I hoped that everything
could be resolved with my death.

735
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,742
And if it couldn't,

736
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,661
I hoped someone else would carry on…

737
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,080
and finish it on my behalf.

738
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,877
It turns out
that risking your life to fulfill a duty…

739
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:34,218
gives you… quite a dopamine rush.

740
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,732
And about the late Father Francesco.

741
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:55,573
I'm sure he's telling God every day
about his heroic exploits of that day…

742
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,618
all the while
sympathizing with your guilt.

743
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,459
It's an honor to have met a priest…

744
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,878
who has fought before me.

745
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:37,406
Nam Duhun, that bastard.
That absolute asshole. That shithead.

746
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,120
Kim Hongsik

747
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,164
Why is he calling?

748
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,166
Hello?

749
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:48,334
I'm sorry for calling so late.

750
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,087
"Late"? You realize it's 2 a.m., right?

751
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,424
Can we meet at the church?

752
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,134
The church?

753
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,219
All right.
All right.

754
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:02,348
Have some kimchi too.

755
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:06,810
You've had it rough the past two days.
Will this be enough?

756
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,646
What's wrong with ramyeon?

757
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,606
Whoever invented this should be rewarded.
It's so delicious.

758
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,654
-Father Kim.
-Stop talking to me while I'm eating!

759
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,324
We'll win this battle, won't we?

760
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:21,659
It's what the Lord wants, right?

761
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,081
Nothing is free in this world.
We have to be ready to make sacrifices.

762
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,461
Why does the Lord lead us
to a happy ending the hard way?

763
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,005
That's how he's always been.

764
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,175
His blessings always start rough.

765
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,010
That's the only way
we'll know their value.

766
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,387
Got it?

767
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,430
Mmm!

768
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,807
This is delicious.

769
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,433
Does it taste better when you don't share?

770
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,268
Yeah.

771
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,064
I can never eat in peace.

772
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,982
- Darn it!
- Where are you going?

773
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,943
I'm going to finish this!

774
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,113
Why did you want to see me
on such short notice?

775
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,865
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

776
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,993
I see this bastard's fleeing the country.

777
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,246
That's not something you need to tell me.

778
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,374
Can you come with me?

779
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:11,875
Why would I?

780
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,627
I have to deal with legal matters,

781
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,129
so I thought I could use some help.

782
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,047
Don't you have an attorney?

783
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,049
My attorney lacks resolve.

784
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,261
I'd appreciate your advice.

785
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,805
I can't. I'm a public official.

786
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,890
I never get involved
in personal company matters.

787
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,686
I'll talk to Prosecutor Nam,
so please consider it.

788
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:32,730
I won't no matter what he says.

789
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,148
A no is a no.

790
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,567
What do I do now?

791
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,278
I need you.

792
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:40,904
Do I have to kidnap you?

793
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,991
Oh my, listen to this guy.

794
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,161
If you are,
make sure to give me a delicious meal.

795
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,372
I like jokbal.
More specifically, jokbaengi.

796
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,459
-Jokbaengi?
-Ever heard of it?

797
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,669
Jokbal and golbaengi, jokbaengi.

798
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,796
Pig trotters and whelk. Got it?

799
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,591
I'm craving it now.

800
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:04,511
I don't know if it's appropriate
to say this, but I'm going to miss you.

801
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,224
I guess I'll miss you too.

802
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,852
Miss seeing you as a free man that is.

803
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,234
I don't think Kim Hongsik knows about me.

804
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,069
I guess Nam Duhun didn't tell him.

805
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,947
If that's the case,
then it seems he's trying to cut him off.

806
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,032
What do you mean?

807
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,618
It can only mean one thing
when he's keeping a double agent a secret.

808
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,286
He's trying to screw him over.

809
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,829
You're right.

810
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,291
Then again, an alliance
between two corrupt guys can't last.

811
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,085
Have you been to the honey jar room again?

812
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,420
Oh, right.

813
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,339
That's not what's important right now.

814
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,132
There's something more serious than that.

815
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,092
What's more important than the honey jar?

816
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,177
Well…

817
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,887
Polka Dot.

818
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,680
Polka Dot?

819
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,726
There's something I didn't tell you
about this house.

820
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,063
The previous tenants of this house
weren't chefs.

821
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,691
Do you know about
Oh Cheolgwang's case from last year?

822
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,151
I do.

823
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,654
The crazy bastard
who killed three of his girlfriends.

824
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,739
He committed suicide in prison.

825
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:09,368
This is where Oh Cheolgwang used to live.

826
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,537
You're lying.

827
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,996
I'm serious.

828
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:17,668
The splatters on the wall
aren't from sauce.

829
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,503
They're bloodstains.

830
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,256
Oh, come on!

831
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,841
I'm sorry.

832
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,927
Everyone knew it was a murderer's house,
so it didn't sell.

833
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,596
So the Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office bought it

834
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,265
and turned it into company housing,

835
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,975
and you were the first to use the place.

836
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,770
Why me? Why was I the first to live here?

837
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,236
Anyway, what exactly happened?

838
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,657
He killed three women in this house.

839
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,452
Two of the bodies were found in the river.

840
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,247
The remaining body hasn't been found yet.

841
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,499
As for Oh Cheolgwang,

842
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,085
he never revealed the location
of where he disposed of the body

843
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:01,837
and committed suicide in prison.

844
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,717
Do you have a picture of the woman
whose body wasn't found?

845
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,196
They've been looking for her body
for a year,

846
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,532
but it's highly unlikely they will.

847
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,622
That ghost is a murder victim.

848
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,041
Wait.

849
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,419
Do you have… a picture of the victim?

850
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,674
I saved it just in case,
but I can't look at it. One second.

851
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,764
-Can I open my eyes?
-Yeah, go ahead.

852
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,229
Come on, stop overreacting.

853
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,522
It's not that…

854
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,072
Things are really going downhill,
aren't they?

855
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,239
This is driving me crazy.

856
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,533
What is this, the year of misfortune?

857
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,162
Screw this.

858
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:18,956
Oh.

859
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,124
Taxi. Over here.

860
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,132
Young Beach Tower.

861
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,262
Oh, jeez. What the heck?

862
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,392
What the hell?

863
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,404
Do you not sleep?

864
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,198
Would you be able to sleep

865
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,950
after being humiliated
by the priest like that?

866
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:58,370
They can go about
doing whatever the hell they want,

867
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:00,831
but no one will ever know,

868
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:03,375
and your livelihood
won't be affected in any way.

869
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,793
Sure, whatever.

870
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,504
There's something I want to ask.

871
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,257
Why didn't you tell me
he was a former NIS agent?

872
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,718
Oh, that.

873
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,594
Well…

874
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,599
Well, I did some thinking…

875
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,896
…and thought
it wasn't worth telling you about.

876
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,857
Wasn't worth it?

877
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,110
It seemed pretty worth it to me.

878
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,363
Did you not tell me on purpose

879
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,615
to get me and the priest to duke it out?

880
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,201
What are you talking about?
What good would that do me?

881
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,247
You know,

882
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,083
weakening your partner
for you to become stronger.

883
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,794
You've watched way too many movies.

884
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,047
You seem pretty delusional at times.

885
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,091
I've developed a habit
of not trusting people over the years.

886
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,761
Goodness, Kim.

887
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,430
You really don't have
a keen eye for people, do you?

888
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,308
There's someone else
you shouldn't trust, not me.

889
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,435
What do you mean?

890
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,772
Prosecutor Park Kyungsun.

891
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,441
She's not who you think she is.

892
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,072
Ms. Park Kyungsun
is one of Father Kim Haeil's people.

893
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,198
What are you gonna do?

894
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,580
Can't trust anyone, can you?

895
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,835
♪ It's always fun ♪

896
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,380
♪ The little penguin Pororo ♪

897
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,467
All right, get ready!

898
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:37,469
Let's go! Extend your arms!

899
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,221
More! Extend them!

900
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,848
Make sure you do each move!

901
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,058
That's it!

902
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,018
Get ready for the kick!

903
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,063
There you go!

904
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,940
Pump it up!

905
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,862
All right, I want more energy!

906
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,656
Come on!

907
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,453
-Father Lee.
-Oh, hello.

908
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,206
Ah.

909
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,916
I thought you'd be busy,

910
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,129
so I had Chae Dou take the lead.

911
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,881
But you banned this exercise.

912
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:22,806
I realized that at times,
you need guts and strength.

913
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,226
That's it.

914
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,687
All together!

915
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,360
Bravo! Bravo!

916
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,450
- Guts and strength.
- Well done.

917
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,330
Hey, guys, have you heard?

918
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,208
I heard Kim Hongsik will be doomed
if we take down this place.

919
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:54,004
Wow, Kim Hongsik will be doomed
if we take this place down!

920
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:58,300
You know, he's not nearly as meticulous
as I thought he'd be.

921
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,844
He puts on a good show,
but he's sloppy in reality.

922
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,304
Go get your weapons.

923
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,555
Hey, let's get ours.

924
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:05,891
Our weapon…

925
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,517
is love.

926
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,561
We love you.

927
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,121
We love you. We love you!

928
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,890
Let go. Let go of me.

929
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,268
You can't just leave like this.

930
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,103
I don't know anything.

931
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,272
We know Kim Hongsik threatened you.

932
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,566
Just come with us and testify.

933
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,401
Go where? I'm not going anywhere.

934
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,278
I'd rather just die here right now.

935
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,030
Is it because of your family?

936
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,741
The police will protect them.

937
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,910
No one here trusts the police!

938
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:10,664
There are a few you can trust,
so please give them a chance.

939
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,374
How can I trust you?

940
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,625
Here.

941
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:18,213
We'll protect you and your family
with our lives.

942
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,014
Goodness, Mr. Lee.

943
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,266
You're the traitor.

944
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,102
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

945
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,772
Don't run away.
It's better that you surrender to me.

946
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,733
Jeez, I told you so.

947
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,652
I was going to kick him.

948
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,363
I'm not just taking down a mere criminal.

949
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,282
I'm cutting out the rotten core

950
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,285
of South Korea's corrupt officials.

951
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,495
You hear me?

952
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,415
That's enough, Detective Gu!
You're going to kill him!

953
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,918
I thought this was
finally feeling like our home turf,

954
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,712
but it seems
we're more suited for away games.

955
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,797
Should we blow up this place?

956
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,341
You mean this entire 87-story building?

957
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,426
Yes, sir.

958
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,219
We're not terrorists.

959
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,388
Let's consider it a donation
and just leave.

960
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,599
Everything's ready.

961
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,477
Bye, Busan seagulls.

962
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,530
Goodness gracious.

963
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,324
I'm exhausted.

964
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:31,077
This is torture like no other.

965
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,471
Kim.

966
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,681
How does it feel to face reality?

967
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,434
That's the feeling of betrayal.

968
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:56,936
The phone is turned off…

969
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,271
"Good evening."

970
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,564
That's for nighttime.

971
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:03,610
Chairman Kim and his underlings' phones
are all turned off.

972
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,487
-Yeah?
-Yes.

973
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,030
I wonder why.

974
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,824
Did they run away?

975
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,493
-Did they?
-Did they?

976
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:12,869
-Probably.
-Probably?

977
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,329
-Probably.
-Are you kidding me?

978
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:16,039
Probably. Oh.

979
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,126
Come here.

980
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,254
-Are you out of your mind?
-I'm sorry.

981
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,924
You think you can joke around with me?

982
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,884
-Know your place.
-Yes, sir.

983
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:28,968
Stomach.

984
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,346
Get lost.

985
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:36,935
Should we start the countdown?

986
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,271
No.

987
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,857
Let's make it special this time.

988
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,363
Okay.

989
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,949
I'll get in touch
after I measure the distance.

990
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:59,207
How many kilometers is it from here?

991
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,837
It's 23.4 km.
We're clear of the blast radius.

992
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,173
You've never set off the bomb yourself.

993
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,011
This time…

994
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,806
I want to do it.

995
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,237
- It worked.
- It didn't go off!

996
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,533
Be quiet.

997
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,951
Why? Why?

998
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:37,871
Sound might cause it to go off.

999
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,416
Be quiet.

1000
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,251
Thank God it didn't go off.

1001
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,174
Stay still. Don't move.

1002
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,777
Uma Gas Station

1003
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,158
Sit. Sit for me.

1004
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:18,411
What's going on?

1005
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,039
There seems to be an issue.

1006
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:23,583
Should we set it off manually?

1007
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,304
I should've blown up
that 87-story building.

1008
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,697
Angela the Geezer

1009
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,659
Geezer Park!

1010
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,786
Have you had breakfast?

1011
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,121
It didn't seem like it to me.

1012
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,292
Kim Hongsik.

1013
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,418
Good work.

1014
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,754
You got rid of my backup.

1015
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,550
Where's Prosecutor Park Kyungsun?

1016
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:16,094
She's not
Prosecutor Park Kyungsun anymore.

1017
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,595
She's my new backup.

1018
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,225
I wonder where she is.

1019
00:59:23,309 --> 00:59:25,186
Perhaps on the verge of meeting God?

1020
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,258
What was that?

1021
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:00,847
Father Han, Sister Kim.

1022
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,814
-What happened?
-Go to the church.

1023
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:10,898
- The church?
- Hurry!

1024
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,611
Go ahead. Hurry.

1025
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,782
Father Kim.

1026
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:34,839
Don't move and stay where you are.
I'll go to you.

1027
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,429
That chair
doesn't suit the church, does it?

1028
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,849
Let me tell you its purpose.

1029
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,311
I turn police or prosecutors
who don't listen to me

1030
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,688
into drug addicts
and execute them on that chair.

1031
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,149
It's my first time using it here in Korea.

1032
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:57,028
Both syringes are filled with kasanin
at 100 times the usual concentration.

1033
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,323
The second she's injected,
she'll suffer an excruciating death,

1034
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,701
right around the time you call 911
and give them the address.

1035
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,536
Hey, Kim Hongsik.

1036
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,789
Do you have to be so clingy?

1037
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,624
I have the right to be.

1038
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,918
I even removed puffed rice from your face.

1039
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,129
You're the one who fell for it.

1040
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:17,548
You're right.

1041
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,552
I honestly can't believe
how badly I fell for it.

1042
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,179
Why are you doing this?

1043
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,098
What do you want?

1044
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,017
Look next to you.

1045
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,940
Kill yourself.

1046
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,192
Then Prosecutor Park will live.

1047
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,819
You asshole.

1048
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:40,196
Stop pissing me off and just kill me.

1049
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,242
Suicide is forbidden in Catholicism.

1050
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,745
Will you go against the Lord
and save Park Kyungsun,

1051
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:53,209
or follow his ways and leave her to die?

1052
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,963
You have only two choices.
Don't play any games.

1053
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:00,717
If you do, she'll be injected right away.

1054
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,220
You asshole, just kill me!

1055
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:07,348
I hate playing the damsel in distress.

1056
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,016
You have one bullet.

1057
01:02:09,934 --> 01:02:11,185
Aim properly.

1058
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,735
Father Kim.

1059
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,862
Put the gun down and get out of here.

1060
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:22,989
You only live once anyway.

1061
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,783
I've lived once and my time's up.
That's all it is.

1062
01:02:29,203 --> 01:02:30,496
If you were me…

1063
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,332
would you be able to leave?

1064
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:39,922
Then aim for one of the syringes.

1065
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,967
I'll slip away when there's space.

1066
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:54,562
I'm more likely to hit your face
than the syringe.

1067
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,026
Just forget it. Stop. Forget it.

1068
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,571
Okay.

1069
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,866
It's decision time.

1070
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,119
I'm starting the countdown.
You have three minutes.

1071
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:17,168
Why only three minutes?
You could've given us more time.

1072
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,670
It takes three minutes
to cook instant noodles,

1073
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,547
the time it takes to think clearly.

1074
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,552
Show us, Father Kim Haeil,

1075
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,805
your faith or your sacrifice.

1076
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:45,238
Don't do it, Father Kim. Please.

1077
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,405
Don't do it.

1078
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,202
-Father Kim!
-Stay back, it's dangerous!

1079
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,166
Stand back.

1080
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:02,380
Looks like he'll save Prosecutor Park
but not make it into heaven.

1081
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,384
I don't want to live my life
feeling like I owe someone something.

1082
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:08,970
Don't do it. I'm serious, Kim Haeil.

1083
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,098
That feeling…

1084
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,351
will go away with time.

1085
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:16,894
Don't do it. I'll feel the same way.

1086
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,187
Father Kim!

1087
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,522
Don't do it, Father Kim.

1088
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,194
Thank you…

1089
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:28,906
for everything.

1090
01:04:30,449 --> 01:04:31,951
Father Kim…

1091
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,564
Thanks to Shin Eunjung
for her special appearance

1092
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:05,943
