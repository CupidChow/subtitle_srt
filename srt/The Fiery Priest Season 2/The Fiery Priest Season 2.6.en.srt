00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,712
Episode 6
The Devil Is Not as Black as He Is Painted

8
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,880
Who are you?

9
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,302
Bingo!

10
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,055
-Leave that there.
-And turn yourself in.

11
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,266
"Bingo"? What nonsense are you saying?

12
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,602
Listen, old men and young lady.

13
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,312
You came to the wrong place.

14
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:08,026
How dare you talk that way to adults?
Mind your manners! I ought to beat you up.

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,861
How did they know about this place?

16
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,362
Damn it. Stay still.

17
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,864
Where's Jung Uyeol?

18
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,199
Who's that?

19
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,742
Connect the words!

20
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,744
Short drug dealer.

21
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,370
Jung Uyeol.

22
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,081
Capelin.

23
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:22,624
Capelin is Jung Uyeol.

24
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,001
Mm.

25
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,753
You morons.

26
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,214
Hey, bring the guys in.

27
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,595
What's all this?

28
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,390
Why are you standing around? Attack them!

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,898
Bring it on.

30
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,159
- Sir!
- Get them! Hurry!

31
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,820
-You little punk.
-That hurts! Stop!

32
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,757
-Bring it on.
-You little punk!

33
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,594
Ow.

34
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,720
Father Kim.

35
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,264
Ow.

36
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:07,061
Where did Capelin run off to?

37
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,563
I don't know.

38
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,399
-There must've been another way out.
-That little rat.

39
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,109
"Premium seafood"

40
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,406
Excuse me.

41
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,992
Are you really a priest?

42
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,204
Why do people keep asking me that
these days?

43
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,288
I am. Why?

44
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,836
In that case, please show us mercy.

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,422
We're going to die if you take everything!

46
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,883
Who's going to kill you? Capelin?

47
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,801
-Well…
-He's just an underling.

48
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,094
I'm sure he has a boss.

49
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,429
Who?

50
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,223
Boss Kim?

51
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,725
No, not Boss Kim. It's Boss Park.

52
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,310
- You idiot!
- Jeez.

53
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,646
We're just ball boys.
We don't know anything.

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,980
Ball boys?

55
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,857
That's what they call us lackeys

56
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,609
who package drugs and help ship them.

57
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,362
You all say you're underlings and lackeys.

58
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,488
Unbelievable.

59
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,697
Who does Boss Park work for?

60
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,824
We really don't know.

61
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,159
If we expose them…

62
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,578
…they're going to kill us.

63
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,831
How do you know they'll kill you
when you don't even know who they are?

64
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,377
Well, how do I put this? Mm…

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,339
-It's just an unknown fear, you know?
-That's it.

66
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,050
Cut the crap.
What's the name of their ring?

67
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,885
I asked because I was curious,

68
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,720
but he said
popular restaurants don't have signs.

69
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:26,266
Let him know
that we're taking all the drugs.

70
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,600
Please.

71
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,562
Detective Gu.

72
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,192
What the hell?

73
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,444
- What's that smell?
- Why does it smell like rotten poop?

74
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,779
What the hell?

75
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,365
-Stay still. It'll put you right to sleep.
-Stay still.

76
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,826
- Don't come near me! Stay away!
- Stay still. Don't move.

77
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,328
Jeez.

78
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,122
Hey!

79
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,582
All right, next. Hurry.

80
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,543
-Why do I have to do it?
-Go on, Detective Gu.

81
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,336
-Seriously.
-Hurry.

82
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,089
- It'll be over soon.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

83
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,677
The rest of you, come here. Hurry.

84
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,180
I'm telling you, it's not a snack factory!

85
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,598
They're making weird stuff!

86
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,517
They hit me with wooden sticks

87
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,729
and these thug-looking men
threw me around!

88
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,689
Quiet down, will you?

89
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,108
Now you're trespassing?

90
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,153
I wouldn't have if the district office
and the police had done their jobs!

91
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,864
We did investigate.

92
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,325
So what's your problem?

93
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
How frustrating.

94
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,329
There comes the priest.

95
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,206
Father…

96
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,216
You're banned from leaving the seminary.

97
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,843
-Sorry?
-One more thing.

98
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,596
You'll be called into
a disciplinary meeting tomorrow.

99
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,183
-Disciplinary meeting?
-If you sneak out of the seminary

100
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,352
before the disciplinary meeting…

101
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,523
you'll be expelled
regardless of the outcome.

102
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,985
Go to your room.

103
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,214
At least blink or something.

104
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,469
It makes me happy
that you're enjoying the food.

105
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,891
I can't eat comfortably
if you say things like that.

106
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,062
It must be the dry aging
that gives the flavor its richness.

107
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,940
You're not from Busan?

108
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,859
No, I used to work in Seoul.

109
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,569
She graduated
from a foreign language high school,

110
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,905
attended SNU,
passed the judicial exam, and was the ace

111
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,074
of the Seoul Southern District
Prosecutors' Office.

112
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,867
She's got it all.

113
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,661
I'm nothing compared to her.

114
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,496
Please, Prosecutor Nam.

115
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,417
How did you end up here then?

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,086
It was a personal matter.

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,798
All you need to know
is that her loyalty brought her here.

118
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,886
May I ask what business you're in?

119
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,098
Right, well…

120
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,934
It's nothing big.

121
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:16,769
I'm just a neighborhood boss, if you will.

122
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,647
Are you married?

123
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,065
Kim!

124
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,360
He's just going for it,
isn't he?

125
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,820
What's wrong with you?

126
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,948
It's not polite to ask women
questions like that these days.

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,533
She's not married.

128
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,703
Right. I'm sorry.

129
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,414
Why does everyone fall in love with me?

130
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,959
I guess I'm just irresistible.

131
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,216
Excuse me.

132
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,017
I think he's into you.

133
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,810
He's not my type.

134
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,021
He might not be
the right person as a life partner,

135
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,898
but he is as a business partner.

136
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,065
You won't lose out.

137
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,650
Yes, sir.

138
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,736
Mm.

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,617
Please check the link I sent you.

140
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,536
"Detectives who smuggle"

141
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,047
I see they had a photoshoot.

142
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,340
All of it?

143
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,347
I've never had my drugs taken
from someone so holy.

144
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,034
This way.

145
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,837
-Open the door.
-Right.

146
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,681
-Pass me the packages.
-Right.

147
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:25,231
Would the kasanin seized today
be worth around 100 million won?

148
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,650
Did you say 100 million? Goodness.

149
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,653
It'd be at least 14 or 15 billion won.

150
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,824
That means we have 15 billion won.

151
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,285
We'd have to weigh it to be exact,

152
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,412
but it's probably enough
for 900,000 people to use.

153
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,540
You could easily turn a million people
into druggies.

154
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,001
It'll spread in no time
the second it gets out.

155
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,085
Hurry.

156
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,548
It's easier to make hell than heaven.

157
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,052
I'll see you again next time.

158
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,263
Do you have a business card?

159
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,474
Oh, it's not ready yet.
I'll give it to you some other time.

160
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,768
Just give him your number.

161
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,228
He's a businessman,

162
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,230
so I should give him my business card.

163
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,065
All right then.

164
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,817
As you wish.

165
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,028
I have some things to talk about with him.

166
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,112
You can head home first.

167
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,031
Okay. Have a good time.

168
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:23,289
He just keeps hitting on me
left and right.

169
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,957
Hmph!

170
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,212
Kim.

171
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,466
Hello?

172
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,470
Look at you.

173
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,643
Auntie, are you sure it's safe here?

174
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,062
It is. Only Team Leader Lee and I
know about this place.

175
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,064
It's as safe as it gets.

176
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,650
They'll come back for it
if we keep it at Uma Police Station.

177
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,318
It's like leaving a cat
to guard the cream.

178
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,074
One second.

179
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,577
What is it?

180
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,788
Father Kim.

181
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,086
I told you not to be reckless.

182
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,504
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,007
Father Kim,
can you stop by Ms. Song's place?

184
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,217
She's not picking up.

185
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,386
Okay, I will.

186
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,723
I saw the photos.
I saw the photos.

187
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,476
I hope the photoshoot wasn't too tiring.

188
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,019
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,647
It all happened in a split second.

190
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,815
Where are you?

191
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,651
Well, uh…

192
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,986
People are recognizing us

193
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,864
because it's spread all over social media,
so we're in hiding.

194
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,949
Hiding?

195
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,578
Did you leak confidential information
about the country or something?

196
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,330
I'm sorry, I have no excuses.

197
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,998
Here's the situation.

198
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,167
Things aren't looking good

199
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,836
because Chairman Kim's drugs
were all taken away.

200
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,881
But the mess isn't being cleaned up,
and we have no way of finding the drugs

201
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,925
since you guys are in hiding.

202
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,554
What do you suggest we do,
Mr. Influencers?

203
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,224
We want to take care of it,
but we're in hiding.

204
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,893
Well then, enjoy hiding.

205
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,896
And do us a favor
and just die while you're at it.

206
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,277
It's spread all over social media.

207
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,863
The temporary priest
knows how to play smart.

208
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,115
He got rid of all the hunting dogs.

209
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,701
Look, Kim.

210
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,370
Considering the situation,

211
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,664
shouldn't you just get rid of him?

212
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,834
You can't get rid of people
each time something like this happens.

213
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,712
I guess there's no point
in making a fuss over everything.

214
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,923
You can't react
to every little thing that happens.

215
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,467
Even so,

216
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,553
we can't just let the priest be.

217
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,389
Let's leave him be for a little longer.

218
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,682
He's a good sparring partner.

219
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,351
What if he knocks you out cold?

220
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,690
There were lots of fiery monks and priests
where I used to live.

221
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,985
Some used guns, some did martial arts,
and some even went to war with us.

222
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,613
That's because
that place is a complete mess!

223
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,406
Is it any different here?

224
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,575
You're right.

225
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,790
Anyway, this place is amazing.

226
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,293
You should stop producing drugs
and just open a club here.

227
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,172
Do you want to forget about all this
and do business together?

228
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:20,257
No way.

229
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,885
Friends who do business together
end up becoming enemies.

230
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,054
I'm leaving.

231
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:26,972
Bye.

232
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,604
Jeez, it's slippery.

233
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,525
Keep up the hard work.

234
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:42,071
Man, Kim is such a gentleman.

235
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,323
I have such a keen eye for people.

236
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,210
Where are our budding stars?

237
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,755
Oh, you mean the ball boys?

238
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,591
They're all gone.

239
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,760
They wouldn't have taken it all
had I been there.

240
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,888
You sure?

241
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,932
Maybe just half.

242
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,978
No, they still would've taken it all.

243
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,730
How did they find out about the place?

244
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,857
Did they tail you?

245
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,317
We must've been exposed
while at Jirimland.

246
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,986
Right.

247
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,238
They must've recorded or filmed you.

248
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,241
Should we get plastic surgery, sir?

249
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,701
Why don't you get surgery…

250
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,161
on your brain instead?

251
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,872
Is that possible?

252
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:38,210
The drugs they took today
add up to a hefty amount.

253
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,378
What are we going to do?

254
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,213
You can pay for it.

255
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,423
Right.

256
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,966
Sorry?

257
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,050
Wait, me?

258
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,802
Give me 10,000 won,
and we'll call it even.

259
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,680
Oh, just 10,000 won?

260
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,475
All right.

261
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,812
Repack the goods
that will be sent to Hong Kong.

262
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,898
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

263
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,149
Ms. Song, are you home?

264
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,528
Ms. Song.

265
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,835
Ms. Song, it's me.

266
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,964
Are you sleeping?

267
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,945
Ms. Song.

268
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,228
I'll be right there.

269
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,562
I just need to make a phone call.

270
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,858
Jeez, he's impatient.

271
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,238
It's Mo Jinsu.

272
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,739
Hey.

273
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,325
I'm Prosecutor Nam of the Busan
Southern District Prosecutors' Office.

274
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,119
Oh, hello, sir.

275
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,163
There's something I need you to do for me

276
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,873
since Influencer Hyeon isn't available.

277
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,500
-Where are you?
-I see.

278
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,546
An elderly person passed away,
so I'm at the scene right now.

279
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,298
Is it the old lady
who lives in Haengseon-dong?

280
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,259
Yes, it is.

281
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,805
I'll send you a text,
so check it right away.

282
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,015
Okay.

283
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,559
Make sure to check it immediately. Got it?

284
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,602
Yes, sir. I will.

285
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,022
- Oh, my gosh.
- How could this happen?

286
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,024
This is unbelievable.

287
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,075
Ms. Song!

288
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,703
Ms. Song.

289
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,414
Ms. Song…

290
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,963
Ms. Song…

291
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,965
So what's the cause?

292
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
Nothing special.
There were no signs of murder.

293
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,389
The leading cause of death
among the elderly is dying alone.

294
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,474
What about an autopsy?

295
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,768
There's no need for an autopsy
for a case like this.

296
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,394
But the cause isn't clear.

297
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,106
That's for us to worry about.

298
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,443
Check whether she has a family, and…

299
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,785
Uma Sky Medical Center

300
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,997
She seemed fine in the morning.

301
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,792
I should've taken her to the hospital.

302
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:06,919
Don't blame yourself.

303
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,216
You did the best you could.

304
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,219
You can say the prayer.

305
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,640
In the name of the Father,

306
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,683
the Son,

307
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,977
and the Holy Spirit.

308
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,856
Amen.

309
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,942
Virtuous Father…

310
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,362
we believe that all who believe in Christ

311
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,156
shall be resurrected along with Him

312
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,408
when they leave this earth.

313
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,663
We lay Song Geumsim…

314
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,208
to rest in your loving arms.

315
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,840
What did you say?

316
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,758
You're going to cremate her
without holding a funeral?

317
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,301
For unclaimed individuals,

318
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,846
the body is transferred directly
from the mortuary to the crematorium,

319
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,598
with no funeral service held.

320
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,226
She has a family. It's just that
their whereabouts are unknown.

321
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,688
We need to find them
and perform an autopsy.

322
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,189
We need to know the exact cause of--

323
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,484
I told you earlier that there were
no signs of injuries or murder.

324
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,322
We looked into it and apparently,
she had severe asthma.

325
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,450
-It must've been a shock from--
-We need to know how…

326
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,123
We need to know how the shock occurred.

327
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,251
There was a strong gasoline smell
coming from her.

328
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,796
I don't know what it might be,
but it didn't smell like snacks.

329
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,673
That's it, a strong gasoline smell.

330
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,425
That's what I smelled too.

331
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,679
And there were gray particles
under her nails.

332
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,764
It was probably just dirt.

333
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,850
It wasn't.

334
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,896
That's not all there is to it.

335
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,731
There was foam around her mouth.

336
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,941
You should suspect poisoning or overdose
in cases like this.

337
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,485
Elderly people often have foam
around their mouths.

338
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,112
What the hell are you talking about?

339
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,448
Is that what you'd say
if it were your mother?

340
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,579
I won't just stand back
if you half-ass your investigation.

341
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,915
Mark my words.

342
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,249
Excuse me, Father.

343
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,336
Are you threatening the police right now?

344
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,715
You people don't take it to heart
if I don't.

345
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,383
Do your job properly.

346
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,969
Let me go!

347
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,723
Let's go.

348
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,689
This is the business license
of the factory where Ms. Song worked.

349
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,359
We need to go here right now.
I'm certain something happened here.

350
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,322
What kind of factory is it?

351
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,448
Oh.

352
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,741
Well…

353
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,619
It's a factory that makes delicious stuff.

354
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,746
They're great people.

355
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,414
They pick me up in the morning

356
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,667
and take me back home after work.

357
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,171
You stay here by Ms. Song's side.

358
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,881
Call me if anything happens.

359
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,594
-Where are you going?
-Factory inspection.

360
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,235
Do it properly.

361
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,279
Be gentle with it!

362
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,372
Finish up in 10 minutes,
or we'll miss the shipping deadline.

363
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,498
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

364
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,000
Hurry up, speed it up.

365
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,669
Move it, come on.

366
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,462
Hurry up!

367
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,559
What's that? Damn it.

368
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,689
- What's going on?
- What the heck?

369
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,316
Hey, hide everything!

370
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,992
Open the doors!

371
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,331
We're the Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency Special Drug Task Force.

372
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,498
Open up!

373
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,385
What's going on?

374
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,428
Man, you guys look cool!

375
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,430
- Stand still.
- My foot! My foot!

376
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,808
-You stepped on my foot!
-Watch it.

377
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,226
Don't run, it's dangerous.

378
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,685
You should've stopped by yesterday.

379
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,145
We would've cleaned the place a bit.

380
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,563
Freeze. Step back.

381
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,111
- Hands up.
- Back up.

382
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,783
Move back.

383
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,256
We found it, sir.

384
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,511
Yes? Did you find it?

385
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,597
They're low-grade medicinal ingredients,
not kasanin.

386
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,266
Medicinal ingredients?

387
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,184
Yes, used in ointments for burns.

388
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:00,313
They were brought in to be sold
at a high price, masked as Korean-made.

389
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,566
Did the sniffer dogs not detect anything?

390
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,067
Not at all.

391
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,236
Anyway, there's nothing here.

392
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,947
We'll inform the Ministry of Food
and Drug Safety and wrap it up.

393
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,949
All right.

394
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,451
Good work.

395
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,795
This place was growing on me.

396
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,047
Good thing our cover wasn't blown.

397
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,272
It looked just like kasanin.

398
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,399
It even smelled like it.

399
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,901
Tell me about it.

400
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,195
Who knew it'd be medicinal ingredients?

401
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,031
That Thai ship was a real headache.

402
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:53,783
- Let's go.
- Okay.

403
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,205
Where the hell is it?

404
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:02,209
Does he take me for a fool?

405
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,840
He's definitely watched too many movies.

406
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,803
Oh.

407
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,604
What the hell is this?

408
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,529
He totally got me, huh?

409
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,113
Fucking hell.

410
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,873
I looked into everything
except for the FBI and the CIA,

411
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,875
and I'm telling you, it's Park's doing.

412
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,044
He knew we'd catch on
if he used the guys here,

413
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,213
so he sent over the guys from Seoul.

414
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,215
How did they know
where the Moon of Seoul was?

415
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,801
That damned old man.

416
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,099
He's something else, isn't he?

417
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,351
I told you
he's called the skewer for a reason.

418
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,272
Anyway, the Moon of Seoul
has been exposed.

419
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,816
It doesn't matter.
They didn't find anything.

420
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,900
They didn't?

421
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,987
But how did the dogs not find the lab?

422
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,614
Two years ago,

423
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,741
we developed something.

424
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,203
A scent that throws off
the sniffer dogs' sense of smell.

425
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:23,331
They could be in a room full of kasanin
and still not detect it.

426
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,918
That's truly amazing.

427
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:30,005
What kind of chemical reaction
causes that?

428
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,632
That's confidential information.

429
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,718
Forget it.

430
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,052
How cheap.

431
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,556
Since I received a gift,
it's only right I return the favor.

432
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,349
You can worry about that later.

433
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,934
It's such a shame about the drugs.

434
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,228
It's a shame for the priest, not me.

435
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,273
What?

436
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:53,737
All right. Cheers!

437
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,615
Cheers!

438
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:08,126
This looks so tender.
It's going to melt in my mouth.

439
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:11,212
It really is. It's super juicy too.

440
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,131
Let's eat up, Auntie.

441
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,633
Enjoy, my nephew.

442
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:18,637
By the way, are they really Laotian?

443
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,805
They're trained in Muay Thai…

444
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,807
-That's not it.
-Muay Lao.

445
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,434
-That's it.
-Yeah.

446
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,685
Oh…

447
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,312
That's a traditional Laotian martial art.

448
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,774
Then those Laotian guys… No.

449
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,110
It'd be more accurate
to call them Laotian warriors.

450
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,529
They did look like warriors.

451
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,949
But they were nothing
compared to Father Kim.

452
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,160
-Of course.
-Father Kim is invincible.

453
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,330
Super duper legendary,

454
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,624
the bestest ever!

455
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,210
"Super duper"?

456
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,420
How childish.

457
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,756
By the way, my friend Songsak,

458
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,218
I'm sure you're not as swift as before
since you're older now.

459
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,886
Are you still…

460
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,389
the tiger that protects the king?

461
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,311
Watch what you say, friend.

462
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,981
I'm still as swift as ever.

463
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,780
How dare you stare at me like that?

464
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,534
Come on.

465
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,953
-You want to die?
-No, I don't.

466
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,372
You speak Korean very well.

467
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,290
Who?

468
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,375
Uh…

469
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,919
Both of you.

470
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,217
Goodness gracious.

471
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,261
You scared me.

472
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,389
Oh, I have two personas.

473
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,599
Thai is my main one,

474
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,768
and Korean is the other.

475
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,061
-I see.
-Me too.

476
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,188
Vladivostok Dokseong is my main one,

477
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,315
and Busan Dokseong is the other.

478
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,527
You sound Korean.

479
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,155
So Songsak is going to help
catch the Laotian guys.

480
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,073
-What about me?
-You have to show them…

481
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,992
your hidden power.

482
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,869
Oh, right, Yohan.

483
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,787
Father Kim did tell me about it.

484
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,123
Is it really true?

485
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,168
What hidden power does he have?

486
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,379
You can think of me as a budget superhero.

487
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:17,464
Excuse me?

488
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,675
So my body is…

489
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,968
-How do I put this?
-Let's see.

490
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,553
It's a bit complicated.

491
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,013
I'll just show you.

492
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,432
No, don't do it. Please stop.

493
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,767
- No.
- Here I go.

494
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,651
Oh, I see.

495
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,323
These two are really weird.

496
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,657
It's like…

497
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,410
the wires have come loose in their heads.

498
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,038
This is how they are.

499
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,957
You'll also get used to them in time.

500
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,042
Am I right?

501
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,465
It's Father Kim.

502
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,133
Where are you?

503
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,876
It's not kasanin.

504
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,504
Unbelievable.

505
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,047
So you're saying this is all fake?

506
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,549
How is this possible?

507
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,051
I think they knew
we were going to show up.

508
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:50,181
That's 150 billion won
right down the drain.

509
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,227
Father Kim.

510
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,895
Are you okay?

511
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,492
-Where are you going?
-Father…

512
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,577
Father Kim!

513
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,250
Did we get played?

514
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,835
Yohan.

515
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,838
Stop stuffing yourself, you pig.

516
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,256
Okay, jeez.

517
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,594
Man, what a ship.

518
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,638
That's where the elderly lady worked.

519
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,891
Eh? What kind of work?

520
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,184
I don't know either.

521
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,770
But her body
reeked of gasoline and chemicals.

522
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:41,274
And there were gray particles
under her nails, like dry cement.

523
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,193
-That's kasanin!
-What?

524
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,237
kasanin leaves, gasoline, dry cement,

525
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,990
and lastly, sulfuric acid.

526
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,283
I'm certain of it.

527
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,994
How could they force an old lady
to make drugs?

528
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,705
You think these drug dealers
have respect for the elderly?

529
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,374
Doesn't that mean
the other seniors are in there?

530
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,293
We can't just stand back.

531
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,712
Can't we just report them
to the National Intelligence Service?

532
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,839
If the Special Drug Task Force
didn't find anything,

533
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,716
then no one will.

534
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,177
Then what do we do?

535
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,386
Ah…

536
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,930
What's wrong?

537
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,434
We have to pretend to be their ally
and find a way to go in there.

538
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,561
So an undercover operation?

539
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,188
Come on, it won't work.

540
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,273
How do you know?
We haven't even tried it yet.

541
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,026
- Who's going to do it then?
- Just stay still.

542
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,453
Who's that?

543
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,664
Stay still. Don't move.

544
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,041
What are you doing here?

545
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,004
-Is that blood?
-Blood?

546
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,429
It's a zombie! A zombie!

547
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,056
Run! It's a zombie!

548
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,313
-I have to go somewhere, so stay here.
-Okay.

549
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,357
-I'm counting on you guys.
-Don't worry.

550
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,237
Oh, jeez.

551
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,446
Get off me!

552
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,450
They're gone. You're good.

553
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,244
They're gone? They're gone.

554
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
What's going on?

555
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,131
We're taking Ms. Song Geumsim's corpse
to the crematorium.

556
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,594
What are you talking about?
She has family.

557
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,055
Her son came by the police station earlier

558
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,349
and refused to claim the body.

559
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,352
I don't believe you. Bring her son here.

560
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,688
Would the police lie?

561
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:47,400
Turns out they do.
Quite often, actually.

562
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,196
I've experienced it firsthand.
They're quite the liars.

563
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,573
Listen, Father.

564
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,075
Please stop.

565
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,744
And watch your tone.

566
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,412
What's wrong with my tone?
I do what I want.

567
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,290
Also, shouldn't you be doing this
during work hours?

568
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,708
That's none of your business.

569
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,420
If you two keep this up,
we'll have to take action.

570
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,297
Go ahead, if you dare.

571
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,423
You think I can't?

572
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,304
What? You're going to tase us?

573
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,224
Go ahead and shoot!

574
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,737
Father Kim…

575
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,822
Father Kim!

576
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,658
Father Kim!

577
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:38,910
A-Are you okay, Father?

578
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,789
Father Kim!

579
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,957
Oh, no!

580
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,668
Wake up, Father Kim!

581
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,670
You idiot!

582
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,465
- Father Kim!
- Why would you shoot him?

583
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,803
Father Kim!

584
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,515
Goodness me, I'm wiped.

585
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,605
That's really bothering me.

586
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,315
I should clean that.

587
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,932
Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office

588
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,725
- Cheers.
- Yes, sir.

589
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,605
Why do you look so tired?
Were you up all night?

590
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,442
I just didn't get a good night's sleep.

591
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,361
Why?

592
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:58,698
Did you have trouble sleeping
after dining with a handsome man?

593
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,449
That's not it, sir.

594
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,785
I already have enough on my plate
with work.

595
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,415
Don't waste your energy on useless stuff.

596
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,876
Why don't we work together?

597
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,295
On what?

598
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,506
Namely, the Teleportation Project.

599
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,091
Sorry?

600
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,469
When are you going to reach the top
by climbing a ladder?

601
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,556
We'll reach the top by teleporting.

602
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,765
In an instant.

603
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,227
Could you elaborate?

604
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,147
Here, take a look.

605
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,067
Park Junhyeok

606
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,360
"Park Junhyeok"?

607
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,321
He's the eldest son
of Vice Minister Park Gitae.

608
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:39,822
You know Vice Minister Park, right?

609
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,951
Isn't he the one who became a star
at the hearing for housing investments?

610
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,453
That's right.

611
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,830
The son of said star

612
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,374
is going to do drugs
at a club in Busan tomorrow

613
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,627
and end up getting caught and brought here

614
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,170
with his actor friend Oh Jinyeong.

615
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,297
How do you know that?

616
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,883
The heavens always help
those who are prepared.

617
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,468
That's right!

618
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,221
The heavens aren't foolish.

619
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,433
Why don't you take care of Park Junhyeok?

620
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,228
I'll have him cry tears of regret
and confess,

621
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,022
call his father to strike up a deal,

622
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,774
and make sure you have the upper hand.

623
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,194
Prosecutor Park.

624
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,988
You're not an ace.
You're a world-class gem.

625
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:24,450
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm not.

626
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,702
Jeez, don't be so humble!

627
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:31,958
Bring me a voice recording
and the drug test results, okay?

628
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,042
Yes, sir.

629
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,048
You're going to help me
fill up the rest of my honey jar.

630
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,216
It's almost full.

631
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,806
You want to know
how much honey is in my jar?

632
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,809
How much?

633
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,353
This much.

634
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,689
This much?

635
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,815
How much is that exactly?

636
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,234
I just have to fill up that much.

637
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,945
You're truly amazing.

638
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,198
Oh, stop it.

639
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,409
Just amazing.

640
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,582
Father Kim.

641
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:14,834
Father Kim.

642
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,419
Are you okay?

643
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,297
How come you're fine?

644
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,549
I told you, I can take a blow.

645
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,967
Even so,

646
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,844
how could you be fine after getting tased?

647
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,347
I think my body might be a superconductor.

648
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,432
Cut it out.

649
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,186
Superconductor, my foot.

650
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:39,108
Come out.

651
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,735
Dean Lee.

652
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,947
I sincerely apologize
for disrupting your duties.

653
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,244
I'd really appreciate it
if I never saw them again.

654
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,455
I'll keep that in mind.

655
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,672
We'll go back to the seminary

656
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,507
after going to the crematorium.

657
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,218
There's no need for you to go there.

658
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,429
I'm sure the police will take care of it.

659
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,681
I'll join the disciplinary meeting
right after.

660
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,558
I said you don't need to go.

661
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,436
It's starting at two, so go get ready.

662
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,231
Disciplinary meeting?

663
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:22,068
Dou's actions have crossed the line,

664
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,111
so I had no choice but to call for one.

665
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,655
It happened while he was volunteering.

666
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,532
That's not a valid reason.

667
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,827
A student who neglects their duties
must be punished.

668
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,829
There's no exception,

669
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,165
even if they're going to be a priest.

670
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:41,545
Father Kim Haeil,
I want you to join the meeting and…

671
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,923
Where are they? Hey!

672
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,717
Those little…

673
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:47,802
Hey!

674
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,011
Goodness gracious.

675
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,890
You've got to be kidding me.

676
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,603
There's only…

677
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:00,272
one person who signed up to audition.

678
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,816
That café worker.

679
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,235
This is not good.

680
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,823
She didn't look like the type
to be good at acting, singing, or dancing.

681
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,033
What?

682
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,662
Come on, I'm sure she's good at something.

683
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,331
We're not professionals.

684
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,168
It's just a small event
like a talent show.

685
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,545
Talent show?

686
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,339
Talent show?

687
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,969
Are you saying we should praise the Lord
like it's some children's talent show?

688
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,887
N-No, that's not it.

689
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,598
That's not what I meant.

690
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,770
Father Han, why don't we speak casually
for a second?

691
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,107
Go on.

692
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,610
Hey, you little brat!

693
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,739
-What?
-Why are you getting angry at me?

694
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,783
I didn't plan this!

695
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,536
I'm just saying I heard God's voice!

696
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,706
Don't lie! You didn't hear anything!

697
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,208
Do you know how hard I'm trying

698
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,503
to behave normally
in front of Father Hong and Sister Kang?

699
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,963
I'm serious!

700
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,840
Don't lie!

701
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,307
The Lord said,

702
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,059
"Welcome all the lost sheep
who come your way

703
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,061
and guide them towards my will."

704
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,110
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

705
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,196
It seems
that us being here for the musical

706
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,364
is part of the Lord's will.

707
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,325
Hallelujah.

708
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,912
In that case,

709
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,538
I'm sure

710
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,334
those who are good at acting,
singing, and dancing

711
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,211
will sign up to audition.

712
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,504
Of course.

713
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,882
Hello.

714
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,596
I'm here to audition for the musical.

715
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,182
For the musical?

716
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,684
- I see.
- She doesn't look like--

717
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,603
Welcome.

718
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,824
Uma Crematorium

719
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,201
Her guardian…

720
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,744
- Where is she?
- Father Kim.

721
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,913
They had already started cremating
before I got here.

722
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,125
How…

723
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,461
How could you just cremate her like that?

724
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,463
Are the procedures being followed?

725
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,049
Goodness gracious.
Look, misters.

726
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:37,471
I run and manage this place,
so what's with you people?

727
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,683
I don't know why you're here,

728
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,394
but we follow the law.

729
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,104
Do you want to check it yourself?

730
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,438
Here, take a look.

731
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,859
We have a power of attorney,

732
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,319
-death certificate--
-All right, we get it.

733
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,240
Goodness gracious.

734
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,783
How ridiculous.

735
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,120
Deceased: Song Geumsim
Undergoing cremation

736
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:23,517
Dear Lord, this poor soul
has been killed once more today.

737
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,357
The perpetrator
is human indifference and cruelty.

738
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:39,908
The late Song Geumsim

739
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,100
What's wrong with everyone?

740
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:11,190
An elderly person
died an unfortunate death,

741
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,652
but those who work for the country
treat her worse than a stray dog.

742
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,447
And I bet the guys who did this to her…

743
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:24,119
don't feel an ounce of guilt.

744
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,248
Chae Dou.

745
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,544
Devils are not as black
as they're made out to be.

746
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,424
That's why they don't know
their true nature,

747
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,178
and it's also why they fail
to realize their wrongs and repent.

748
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,726
We'll have to fight against those devils
from now on.

749
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,270
I want to join.

750
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:54,817
I want to fight…

751
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,613
alongside you guys.

752
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,882
Uma Cleaning Service

753
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,400
Did you find out where the priest lives?

754
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,610
The guys are looking into it.

755
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:41,822
He sure knows how to stay under the radar,
doesn't he?

756
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:44,992
What about the cremation?

757
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,077
It's done.

758
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,287
Mm.

759
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,165
I wonder
why the Lord's will always end in vain.

760
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,127
Stop the car.

761
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,639
A once-in-60-years miracle!
The Orcaus meteor shower's cosmic show

762
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,808
Wow.

763
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,436
Why didn't I know about this?

764
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,520
Park Junhyeok

765
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:21,069
So he has that much dirt
on the big shots, huh? Huh.

766
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,114
He's a true collector.

767
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:28,786
Who is that?

768
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,457
Hello, this is Prosecutor Park Kyungsun.

769
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,250
It's me, Kim Hongsik.

770
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,836
Oh, hello, Chairman Kim.

771
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,923
How did you get my number?

772
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,383
Oh, I asked Prosecutor Nam.

773
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,927
I see.

774
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,180
I'm getting my business cards tomorrow,
but I guess you couldn't wait.

775
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,182
Anyway, why did you call?

776
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,978
Would you like to go
see shooting stars with me?

777
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,189
Oh, I saw that on the news.

778
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,817
The meteor shower cosmic show, right?

779
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,653
Yes, I heard 100 of them
will be falling every hour.

780
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,112
I'm sorry.

781
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,157
I have some trauma around falling objects.

782
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,451
Sorry?

783
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,829
When I was young,
someone threw some poop from a rooftop

784
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,456
and it landed right on my head.

785
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,294
Well, the stars
won't actually be falling onto us…

786
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,879
Mm-mm…

787
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:25,384
Even the smallest trigger
can reawaken one's trauma.

788
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,220
I have a meeting to attend.

789
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:29,763
Have fun.

790
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,976
Shooting stars, my foot.

791
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:42,150
Why can't shooting stars shoot up
instead of down?

792
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,036
I'll be back after the meeting.

793
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,080
What if you get expelled?

794
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,500
If I do, should I go to a temple instead?

795
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,752
They don't just take in anyone.

796
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,131
In that case,

797
00:48:04,214 --> 00:48:05,674
I'll start studying the Quran--

798
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,050
Jeez.

799
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,468
Don't be ridiculous.

800
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,013
Don't worry.

801
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,182
God said he won't let you get expelled.

802
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,020
That seems highly unlikely,
seeing that there's little to no hope.

803
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,814
You don't know how he works, do you?

804
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,693
You see, he never gives you spoilers.

805
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,743
Wait here.

806
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,163
Why would you go in?

807
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,836
Why are you coming in alone?

808
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,131
I'll take the punishment
on behalf of Chae Dou.

809
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,383
That doesn't make any sense.

810
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,677
Why would you do that?

811
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,472
I'll be punished, and so should you.

812
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,974
Why me?

813
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,977
The sin of wrong teaching
is greater than the sin of wrong learning.

814
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,396
Don't joke around with me.
I won't fall for it.

815
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,191
Oh, was it obvious?

816
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,443
Yes, very.

817
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,111
Chae Dou will be given…

818
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,531
a one-semester suspension.

819
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,243
That's too harsh. Please reconsider.

820
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,245
No, I will not.

821
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,668
I'm not just asking you to reconsider it.

822
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,504
Let's make a deal.

823
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:27,839
A-A deal?

824
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,277
I told you

825
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,280
God wouldn't let you get expelled,
didn't I?

826
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,492
What did you say?

827
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:56,994
I made a deal.

828
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,954
What kind of deal?

829
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,789
In return for withdrawing your punishment,

830
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,791
I'm banned from losing my temper
for a month.

831
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,169
You? Not lose your temper for a month?

832
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:09,673
Honestly, I'm not sure if I can do it.

833
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,385
But I made a huge sacrifice…

834
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,345
just for you.

835
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,430
I'll be off.

836
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,436
Don't lie!

837
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,815
I'll just take the punishment!

838
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,069
He's going around the church,
the seminary, and the town.

839
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,280
Hard at work, isn't he?

840
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,076
My turn.

841
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,204
Let's go.

842
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,794
You're going to host
a fundraising event for our church?

843
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,880
I'm thinking of gathering some donors

844
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,257
and creating an official committee.

845
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,885
We would be so grateful.

846
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,262
You didn't have to plan a whole event.

847
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:59,389
Would it be okay
if it were held at the church?

848
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,933
I'm thinking of inviting musicians,
hiring a buffet caterer,

849
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,685
and organizing an appreciation event.

850
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,565
I'm afraid it'll be difficult to host it
inside the church if there are musicians.

851
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,067
But you can use the front yard.

852
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,235
That would be perfect.

853
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,154
As long as it's on church grounds.

854
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:18,992
Then could you say a few words
on behalf of the donors?

855
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,329
I'm not very good with words.

856
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,581
I highly doubt that.

857
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,249
We would really appreciate it.

858
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,460
All right then.

859
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,586
Oh, right.

860
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,005
Please tell Father Kim Haeil
to attend as well.

861
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,090
He feels like a friend to me.

862
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,466
Ah…

863
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:43,642
Who does he think he is
to call Father Kim his friend?

864
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,726
Goodness.

865
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,063
It seems
you're not too fond of that businessman.

866
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,192
Well, it's not exactly that.

867
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,029
My gut feeling is that something's up.

868
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,114
Your gut feeling?

869
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,698
Yes.

870
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,201
You know how accurate it is.

871
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,079
-Right.
-Yes.

872
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,748
Could you please elaborate?

873
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:11,878
He just doesn't seem like the type
Father Kim would get along with.

874
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,758
If Father Kim is a warm darkness…

875
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,554
he's like a cold light.

876
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,723
Warm darkness and cold light.

877
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,517
Excuse me!

878
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,103
Hello.

879
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,897
Well…

880
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:37,404
I'm here to sign up
for the musical audition.

881
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:39,322
Right.

882
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,908
I see.

883
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,580
Nice to meet you.

884
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,006
I'm here, Auntie.

885
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:58,592
There's something written there.

886
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,427
Is it Arabic?

887
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,180
It looks like Thai letters.

888
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,265
You took a picture, right?

889
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,474
Yes.

890
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:09,978
What's going on?

891
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,188
There's a car coming in.

892
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,689
It's a van.

893
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,283
Wait, I think I saw that van
in front of the bathhouse.

894
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,411
A lizard tattoo?

895
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:30,332
They rewrapped the van.

896
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:32,626
But we can't know for sure who they are

897
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,377
since we can only see their arms.

898
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,463
Auntie.

899
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:40,842
I have a feeling that the Gu family
is going to do something big soon.

900
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:43,887
We're going to find out
who the drug lord is

901
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,681
and save Uma-gu.

902
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,979
That sure sounds nice.

903
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,069
So how many people can he take down

904
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,862
with the leverage he has
with the drug issues?

905
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,282
He said his honey jar is almost full,

906
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,867
so probably around 10 to 20 people.

907
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,246
He might have more room in that jar.
Where are the records?

908
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,706
That's what I'm unsure about.

909
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,501
They're not in the file room
or Prosecutor Nam's office.

910
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,420
He doesn't have a safe,
and he doesn't lock his drawers either.

911
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,755
That means…

912
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,008
he stashed them somewhere else.

913
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,927
He must have another place of his own.

914
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,846
I'll look into it tomorrow
when I question Park Junhyeok.

915
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,431
All right.

916
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,184
By the way, is this really necessary?

917
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,478
Confidentiality is key for our rendezvous.

918
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,729
Jeez.

919
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,939
All right, now come out.

920
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,942
Wait, I can't go up.
I have to go under to get out.

921
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,318
Goodness gracious.

922
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,989
Slow down!

923
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,827
- What am I doing riding a chick?
- Let's go.

924
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,161
We know how to have fun, don't we?

925
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,289
Bye!

926
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,540
Goodbye.

927
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,708
You know,

928
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,419
the guy backing Prosecutor Nam
is totally into me.

929
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,878
No way.

930
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,672
You must be irresistible.

931
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,965
Who is it this time?

932
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,925
Just one of those guys
with fingers in every pie

933
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,094
who makes a lot of money.

934
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,263
I think his name was Kim Hongsik.

935
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,683
Is he the guy…

936
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,686
who's as annoying as he is tall?

937
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,272
That's him. How did you know?

938
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,649
I knew it.
He goes to Uma Church.

939
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,403
He even donated two billion won recently.

940
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,738
Unbelievable.

941
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,990
He just has money lying around,
doesn't he?

942
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,075
You like wealthy people.

943
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,744
Why don't you give him a chance?

944
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,829
He's not my type.

945
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,165
I'm not into tall, model-like guys.

946
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,375
Then what about me?

947
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,711
Except for you.

948
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,087
Let's go, chickies!

949
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,594
Oh, that's it.

950
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,512
Punch it. Keep going.

951
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,597
That's it.

952
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,140
Come on, punch harder.

953
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,559
As if fighting humans wasn't enough,
now you're fighting a dragon?

954
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,269
I'm going to kill them all!

955
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:59,147
It's spitting out fire!

956
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,025
You're all burnt.

957
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,570
How'd it turn out?

958
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,572
Hmm, nice.

959
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:11,201
What's happening
to the ship at the abandoned wharf?

960
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:13,620
I heard the drug task force from Seoul
didn't find anything.

961
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:17,832
I'm sure they were deceived somehow.

962
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,585
How did they find out about it anyway?

963
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:23,546
Is someone else other than us
looking into them as well?

964
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,256
It'd be best

965
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:27,550
if we could somehow
befriend the drug dealers

966
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,010
and enter the ship ourselves.

967
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,347
We've been too exposed
to attempt an undercover operation.

968
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,432
What's wrong with that?

969
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,186
You must have a plan.

970
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,480
You do, right?

971
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,108
-Tell me. What is it? I'm curious.
-All right, all right.

972
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,818
Here.

973
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,029
-Take a look.
-What's this?

974
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,657
A wanted poster
that was at the police station.

975
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,783
"Killer Oh Hanmo wanted"

976
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,787
No way.
There's no way this is real.

977
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,206
I'll explain…
Please just hear me out.

978
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:00,083
Wait, Dean Lee.

979
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,966
Killer Oh Hanmo wanted

980
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,843
Hallelujah.

981
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,805
He's like Detective Gu Daeyoung's twin.

982
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,140
They look exactly the same.

983
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,724
Good stuff, right?

984
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,352
With a record like his,

985
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,396
the drug dealers
will want to be his best friend.

986
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,189
Especially with Gu Daeyoung's…

987
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,526
I mean, especially with Oh Hanmo's looks.

988
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,198
It won't work.

989
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,076
I'm telling you, it will.
I guarantee you.

990
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,370
You guys are like doppelgängers.

991
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,372
I heard you die
when you meet your doppelgänger.

992
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,665
See? I'm out. I don't want to die.

993
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,833
Hold it up.

994
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,504
Operation Doppelgänger. I like it.

995
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:50,467
I think this will work.
There's no doubt about it.

996
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,720
See? Look here. They moved in threes.

997
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,430
And one of them was Southeast Asian.

998
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,020
I guess I'll take that role.

999
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,521
Yohan, let's do this together.

1000
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,232
No, Dokseong is a better fit for this
than me.

1001
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,359
-Why me?
-No, that's not true.

1002
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,612
Look, one of them was 110 kg.

1003
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,363
See that?

1004
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:16,951
-All right.
-We got this.

1005
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,786
Just forget it.

1006
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,206
Most importantly, we don't look alike.

1007
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,041
You're identical!

1008
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,001
What do you mean, identical? Look at him.

1009
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,712
Damn it.
Look at the birthmark under his eye.

1010
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,796
What about this?

1011
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,424
We can slap that right on
with some makeup.

1012
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,052
But it might smudge if he sweats.

1013
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,679
-Exactly.
-He sweats buckets.

1014
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,764
Are you kidding me?

1015
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,432
I sweat like a fountain.

1016
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,769
Uh, Yohan,

1017
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,355
-hold Detective Gu, will you?
-Why?

1018
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,152
Yeah, I think that's the best idea.

1019
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:55,240
- All right.
- What's going on?

1020
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,616
You guys should step back.

1021
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,368
- What's going on?
- What?

1022
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,286
- Are you going to massage me?
- Hold him tight.

1023
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,829
What are they doing?

1024
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,289
Detective Gu, look here.

1025
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,959
- Look at Dokseong. Right here.
- Oh, he's getting a massage.

1026
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,425
It's identical.

1027
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,719
You've created a masterpiece.

1028
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,681
Well, you see,

1029
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:23,643
I made sure to really control my strength.

1030
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:27,355
No, it's a bit small.
Get him up, I'll punch him again.

1031
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:28,439
-There's no need.
-No.

1032
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,524
-Don't.
-He's going to die.

1033
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,817
It hurts.

1034
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,735
I can't open my eye.

1035
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,780
- I think we need one other person.
- What?

1036
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,949
Look, it says here in red,

1037
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,451
"He was able to escape

1038
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,704
with the help of his girlfriend
during the arrest."

1039
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:50,003
I want to do it. I really do.

1040
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,463
But the drug dealers know my face already,

1041
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,756
so I can't do it.

1042
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,175
God will ensure they don't recognize you.

1043
00:59:56,259 --> 01:00:00,430
Is God a plastic surgeon or something?

1044
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,724
I'll hold her.

1045
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,309
Wait, hold on.

1046
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,561
-I can't be the only one.
-Wait, come on.

1047
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,646
- What did I do wrong?
- Stay still.

1048
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:11,441
Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it.

1049
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:14,944
I'm in.

1050
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,627
We'll initiate the plan tonight.

1051
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,879
Set the bait as fast as you can.

1052
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,422
Go!

1053
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,474
Lord.

1054
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,770
Why are you not with us?

1055
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,773
Why are you…

1056
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,902
hiding amidst this chaos?

1057
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:00,657
The helpless are tormented by evil

1058
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,951
and fall into their wicked schemes.

1059
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,788
The wicked boast of their greed

1060
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,375
and the oppressors curse and mock you.

1061
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,130
Lord.

1062
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:19,217
Please hear my prayer.

1063
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:24,389
Please listen to my sorrows.

1064
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,974
Guide me with your justice

1065
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,936
for the sake of our enemies.

1066
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,605
Please…

1067
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,025
set your path

1068
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,028
before me.

1069
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:05,281
Energy drink

1070
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,951
Stop

1071
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,504
I fell asleep. Where are we?

1072
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,091
Driver Kim.

1073
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:27,720
We're at the crossroads
before you go to the afterlife.

1074
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:32,475
Who are you?

1075
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,852
Who the hell are you?

1076
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,021
Who are you bastards?

1077
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,816
Let go, you bastards!

1078
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,293
I can't stand this icky feeling anymore.

1079
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,883
Jeez, it's not even coming off.

1080
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:09,822
It's a fire!

1081
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,159
Oh, no!

1082
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,256
Someone call 911!

1083
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,759
- Water!
- Go get more water!

1084
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:32,219
- Hurry up!
- More water! Hurry!

1085
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:33,930
Someone call the fire department!

1086
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:35,097
Hurry up!

1087
01:05:38,684 --> 01:05:39,936
Call 911!

1088
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,515
This is a little preview of hell, Father.

1089
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:13,904
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1090
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,824
I know who set
the statue of the Virgin Mary on fire.

1091
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,535
Another big serving added to my honey jar.

1092
01:07:19,618 --> 01:07:20,911
You can stay here for the time being.

1093
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:23,539
Apparently, they'll kill anyone for money.

1094
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,499
We're the Sweeper Gang!

1095
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:27,043
You call this a disguise?
Are you serious?

1096
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,919
Father Kim, behind you.

1097
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,254
Why did you really come here?

1098
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:33,257
A big war is going to break out
on the drug dealers' turf soon.

1099
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,469
You've got the kind of look
that makes you very untrustworthy.

1100
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,180
I still have something left to do.

1101
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,473
You can't take it back!

1102
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:43,100
I've received insider information.

1103
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:45,269
They're not an ordinary person.

1104
01:07:45,352 --> 01:07:47,188
I was holding out well,

1105
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,814
but I guess I've been made.

1106
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,524
You'd better hold out from here on out.
