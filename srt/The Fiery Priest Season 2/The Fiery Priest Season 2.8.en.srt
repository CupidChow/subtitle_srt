The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,964
Episode 8
A Worm Gets Crushed When Stepped On

8
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,432
I've been holding out well.

9
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,601
You'd better hold out from here on out.

10
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,348
How do you put this on?

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,683
Tell me.

12
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,483
Why stop them? Have them join.

13
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,973
I can't believe that cheap-looking bastard
is the drug lord.

14
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,808
You're a shaman. How could you not know?

15
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,811
I'm not a real shaman, am I?

16
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,729
Quit getting so caught up in the act!

17
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,773
Quiet down, will you?

18
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,114
Father Kim
won't just leave him be, will he?

19
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,991
He probably went for him right away.

20
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,826
I'm sure
that bastard came with a lot of guys.

21
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,578
We have to go there.

22
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,622
Now that Father Kim knows his identity,
he's not going to go easy.

23
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,459
- Go up.
- What the heck?

24
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,586
What's going on?

25
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,254
Go up. Hurry.

26
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,298
- Let's move.
- Jeez.

27
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,050
- Let's go warm up.
- Those bastards.

28
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,052
Capelin, what's going on?

29
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:01,139
Our chairman and the priest
are going at each other right now.

30
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,391
-We're heading there.
-Why are you bringing so many men

31
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,727
just to take down one guy?

32
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,479
Wait for us!

33
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,233
I'm going to kill the priest
with my own hands!

34
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,126
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

35
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,172
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

36
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,759
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

37
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:41,137
Wait, he's the head honcho
of the drug ring?

38
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,513
Chairman Kim?

39
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,640
Yes.

40
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,726
The one who donated a huge sum.
The one who's into you!

41
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:51,564
He's fighting Father Kim one-on-one,
but he brought a lot of his men.

42
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,524
Why did Father Kim
get into a fight all alone?

43
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,026
He's not even well right now.

44
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,110
Sorry?

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,071
What do you mean?

46
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,616
Well, you know.

47
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,534
He's no longer in his prime.

48
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,913
I'm sure he's worn down
and not as fit as before.

49
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,997
Oh.

50
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,332
Let's talk later.

51
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,959
I've got to think of a plan.

52
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,252
Please hurry.

53
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,795
"Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office"

54
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,048
I knew something was off about him

55
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,259
when he was going on about shooting stars.

56
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,428
Come on, think of something. Come on.

57
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,432
What can I do to calm this guy down?

58
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,464
Father Kim!

59
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,892
What are you doing?

60
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,063
Are you offering your other cheek
just as Jesus told you to?

61
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,650
I don't know what God's plan is,

62
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,069
but for me, killing a priest
is out of the question for now.

63
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,780
Let's just have you hospitalized
for a while.

64
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,079
Here I go.

65
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,344
Hello?

66
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,930
Let's go to the observatory.

67
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,016
Sorry?

68
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,477
You asked me
to go watch shooting stars tonight, no?

69
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,896
I thought you said
it was bad luck to see them.

70
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,148
Who in the world said that?

71
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:01,361
Who does a shooting star think it is
to determine my fate?

72
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,363
I choose my own fate.

73
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,781
Right, of course.

74
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,115
In that case…

75
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,410
I'll go pick you up.

76
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,371
No, I'll meet you there.

77
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,456
I choose how I get there.

78
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,665
Right.

79
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,544
All right then.
I'll text you the time and location.

80
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,712
Okay.

81
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,016
What the heck?

82
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,354
What is that?

83
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,367
Oh, right. You need to go to the hospital.

84
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,077
Here I go again.

85
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:10,638
Hello.

86
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,517
Everyone here, don't take another step.

87
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,769
Freeze and put your hands up!

88
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,901
Wait!

89
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,278
Please wait.

90
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,529
Wait, wait, wait.

91
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,614
Wait, don't shoot!

92
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,200
You shouldn't be out here.
Please go inside!

93
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,535
Please don't shoot.

94
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,620
You can let the priest go,

95
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,415
but please arrest the rest of them.

96
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,208
Yes, Chief!

97
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,294
What?

98
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,258
"Chief"? Did I hear that correctly?

99
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,509
Yes.

100
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,263
I'm Go Martha,
the chief of Uma Police Station.

101
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,806
Huh?

102
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,310
Look, Chief.

103
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,731
Is this really necessary
over a small fight?

104
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,316
Mr. Kim Hongsik!

105
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,860
You are under arrest for assault,

106
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,864
drug manufacturing and trafficking,
and murder.

107
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,949
Your Miranda Rights
will be explained on the way.

108
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,034
Wait.

109
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,328
You knew he was a drug dealer?

110
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,540
Here.

111
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,418
I'm the chief.

112
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,503
"Public official ID
Go Martha"

113
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,087
Are these the same people?

114
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,721
Didn't you say the chief was a moron?

115
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,974
It seems like
that moron has completely lost it.

116
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,852
Should we raid the police station
and bail Chairman Kim?

117
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,229
Stop overreacting.

118
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,190
Don't go anywhere near the station,
you little shits.

119
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,399
Sir,

120
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,860
when pieces of shit gather,
they become a huge pile of shit,

121
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,738
and that enormous smell
can also become a powerful weapon!

122
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,949
Oh, jeez,
a fart's coming out.

123
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,117
It's still shit either way.

124
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,994
Just don't do anything.

125
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,708
The chief still has more learning to do,
doesn't she?

126
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,585
Hello? Oh, he hung up.

127
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,670
Hang on.

128
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,172
I think I just shit my pants.

129
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,590
-Let go of me.
-Oh, jeez.

130
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,551
-I have to go kill the priest!
-How are you so strong?

131
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,010
We have to go to the west.

132
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,637
What's with you? Let go of me.

133
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,764
I was a professional martial artist.

134
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,517
I'm ready! Let's go!

135
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,936
- Goodness gracious.
- There they are.

136
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,229
Hey!

137
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,274
Let go of them!

138
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,358
Back off.

139
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,695
Where are you trying to go?

140
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,780
Go.

141
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,865
Go on!

142
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:35,992
Wait.

143
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:39,912
The SWAT team arrested
everyone at the scene, right?

144
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,208
That means they probably carry guns.

145
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,544
I see them. I see them.

146
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,337
I see black guns!

147
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,463
I smell gunpowder too.

148
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:53,134
I forgot that you can't win
against bullets with Muay Thai.

149
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,720
A martial artist can't either,
not even Bruce Lee.

150
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:56,846
Jeez.

151
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,097
Hey, Maksan.

152
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,266
Don't hurt people with that.

153
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,517
Go back in and calm down.

154
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,102
Dismissed!

155
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,395
-Yes, sir.
-Back up.

156
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,814
Are you just going to sit back
when your boss has been arrested?

157
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:10,359
He can easily take on 54 people at once
and still come out on top.

158
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,820
It'll only be a burden to him

159
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,488
if we intervene.

160
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,740
Now move.

161
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,576
Hang on.

162
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,287
-You shit your pants, didn't you?
-No, I didn't.

163
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,914
I didn't.

164
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,001
What in the world did he eat?

165
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,462
Did he come straight out of the '80s?

166
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,255
Why is he dressed like that?

167
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,590
Hey.

168
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,216
Isn't it over
now that Phukha's been arrested?

169
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,679
It's not over until it's over.

170
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,974
-Shaman.
-Shaman.

171
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,031
-Hey, go with him.
-This way.

172
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,741
Go.

173
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,534
Easy.

174
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,038
Take him to the holding cell
and request a warrant.

175
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,831
Wait, Chief.

176
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,710
You need to explain what's going on!

177
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,213
You heard her. Take him
to the holding cell and get a warrant.

178
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,971
-When did he get here?
-I don't know.

179
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,227
Chairman Kim.

180
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,188
Think of this as a little field trip

181
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,773
and get some rest.

182
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,317
There's nothing to look at here.

183
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,027
Do I get a souvenir?

184
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,570
Sorry?

185
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,989
I'm just kidding. Get to work.

186
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,575
A joke. I see.

187
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,959
Chief Go Martha

188
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,504
Chief,

189
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,631
there's a person called Father Kim Haeil

190
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,675
-who wants to meet you.
-No, tell him to come next time.

191
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,056
Sister Go Martha.

192
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,895
I mean Chief Go Martha.

193
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,982
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,150
No, no.

195
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,819
What's there to be sorry about?
I should be thanking you.

196
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,154
You saved me.

197
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,030
That's not something
you should thank me for.

198
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,782
I'm a police officer after all.

199
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,576
Exactly,
you're a police officer.

200
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,494
No, you're the police chief!

201
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,079
We had no idea!

202
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,999
You completely fooled us.
Listen, Chief.

203
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,544
How much do you know about Kim Hongsik?

204
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,337
Oh…

205
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,381
Kim Hongsik, a rising drug lord
from Southeast Asia.

206
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,675
He used Boss Park's men

207
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,137
to wipe out all the local drug gangs
and established a base in Uma-gu

208
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,890
to monopolize the manufacturing
and distribution of drugs.

209
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,185
Oh, and he has Prosecutor Nam Duhun
covering for him.

210
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,269
Uh…

211
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,314
This is all I know. I promise.

212
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,399
You know everything.

213
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,569
If you just arrest the rest of--

214
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,653
No.

215
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,573
My only goal was to save you.

216
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,284
Dealing with Kim Hongsik
is outside my jurisdiction.

217
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,664
But arresting and investigating him…

218
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,918
is under your jurisdiction.

219
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,922
The warrant is going to get dismissed,

220
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:22,259
and an attorney in a custom-made suit
will arrive at the station soon.

221
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,180
Then, Kim Hongsik
will be released for lack of evidence.

222
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,264
That won't happen.

223
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,974
He's locked up right now,
so if we search his--

224
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,060
And once he's released, I'll…

225
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,148
…never see the light of day again.

226
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,483
I'm certain of it.

227
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,325
Calm down.

228
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,830
Chief.

229
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,332
You're…

230
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,668
a chief.

231
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,338
You're almost right.

232
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,590
I am indeed a chief…

233
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,884
…but I'm a puppet chief.

234
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,429
Chief.

235
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,431
If you don't start an investigation,

236
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,059
I will not leave this room.

237
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,269
In that case,

238
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,770
I will leave.

239
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,066
Wait, Chief. Chief.

240
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,068
You're coming back, right?

241
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,611
Make yourself at home!

242
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,073
Goodbye.

243
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,250
Hey, Seokhui.

244
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,835
What am I doing? I'm listening.

245
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,713
I have new information on Phukha.

246
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,382
I need you to look at it immediately.

247
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,843
What? Send it to me.

248
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,136
All right.

249
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,743
That's a three and three.

250
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:11,994
Then I'll place it here.

251
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:16,123
- That's also a three and three.
- It's like that everywhere.

252
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,543
I'll place mine right here.
That's a four and three.

253
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,711
Looks like I've won!

254
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,756
Come on.

255
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,633
What the heck?

256
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,384
- Here I go.
- Doesn't he know Kim was arrested?

257
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,886
How is he so relaxed?

258
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,475
All right.

259
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,352
I see why you're relaxed.

260
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,563
As long as the warrant isn't granted, huh?

261
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,028
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

262
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,906
How could you arrest an innocent man
without any evidence?

263
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,367
I apologize on everyone's behalf.

264
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,327
It's only right that I cooperate.

265
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,079
-Thank you for saying that.
-Where's the chief?

266
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:57,915
She's probably somewhere
fiddling with her stuffed animal.

267
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,876
- We need to get his car ready.
- Right.

268
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,503
We have it ready.

269
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,588
Why are you so quiet, Father Kim?

270
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,840
I guess you didn't know
that I'm a quiet person.

271
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,385
How strange.

272
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,222
From what I saw earlier,
you would've had me locked up

273
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,974
and completely destroyed this place.

274
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,645
Destroying things is your expertise.

275
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,314
I guess you know about my powerful backup.

276
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,191
It seemed more like
you were preparing for war.

277
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,609
So?

278
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,611
Would you like a little taste,
like the burning statue?

279
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,196
I'm not a fan of samples.

280
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,906
I even skip over them at the supermarket.

281
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,243
Pray that we don't reach the main course.

282
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:36,787
As for you,

283
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,872
don't think about running away.

284
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,125
Why would I?

285
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,545
Uma-gu is my territory
and soon-to-be heaven.

286
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,800
I won't cause trouble
as long as you stay out of it.

287
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,429
Either that,
or you'll have to sacrifice yourself.

288
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,639
Then I'll get rid of my backup.

289
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:01,311
You shouldn't say more,
Chairman Kim.

290
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,565
-This way.
-All right.

291
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,152
Hey!

292
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,032
- Mr. Attorney.
- Yes?

293
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,867
Your suit is custom-made, right?

294
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,870
No, it used to be my father's.

295
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,789
Why are you so frugal?

296
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,459
High earners
should contribute to the economy!

297
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,419
Buy your clothes, okay?

298
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,923
Let's resume our rained-out game soon.

299
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,343
Don't come to church starting next week.

300
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,179
You're banned.

301
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,388
I'm still coming.

302
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,273
Drive safely.

303
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,292
Oh my!

304
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,171
-His suit isn't custom-made.
-Sorry?

305
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,631
Come with me.

306
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,883
You said you'll never see
the light of day again.

307
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,220
I guess I'll see some light
since things were settled quietly.

308
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,514
What do you mean, quietly?

309
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,599
The SWAT team caused a whole scene
when arresting them.

310
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,519
I'm really okay.

311
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,564
If you're not going to stay in my office,
I'm going to get back to work.

312
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,068
Also, please don't tell the people
at the church about my identity,

313
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,362
including those
in the musical theater group.

314
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,655
Do you also sing?

315
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,865
Yes.

316
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,875
Jeez.

317
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,544
Why aren't we getting any updates?

318
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,462
Why are things so quiet?

319
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,007
Dear gods of heaven and earth,
please keep Father Kim safe.

320
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,677
-Please, I beg of you.
-What if they just flee the country?

321
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,223
What if we wake up in our sleep
and find ourselves in the open sea?

322
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,642
If that happens,

323
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:04,893
we'll have to catch tuna…

324
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,271
and whales to survive.

325
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:11,275
Humans are built to survive anywhere.

326
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,402
What if we run into pirates?

327
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,239
Hey, we look more like pirates
than pirates themselves.

328
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,284
Given how quiet things are,

329
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,286
I have a feeling
Phukha was released without any charges.

330
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,872
Don't say that, Auntie Shaman.

331
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,665
There's no way
he would've been released this quickly.

332
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,585
Oh, I got a text. It's Father Kim.

333
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,926
7 p.m., Lonely Restaurant…

334
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,054
-Man, I'm too old, I can't see anything.
-Let me read it.

335
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,268
What did he say?

336
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,312
It's an order to make contact.

337
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,314
Am I doing this right?

338
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,441
You're doing amazing.

339
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:58,071
Anyway, if I hadn't called Chairman Kim
to go to the observatory,

340
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,364
your noggin…

341
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,908
My bad.

342
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,242
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,870
Your dome would've gotten cracked open.

344
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,456
Dome isn't any better than noggin,
you know?

345
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,208
Also,

346
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,877
how can someone who issues warrants
like they're free candy

347
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,296
reject it just like that?

348
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,589
You know what the scariest thing

349
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,341
about a prosecutor's authority is?

350
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,427
What? Digging into your family
and your distant relatives?

351
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,720
No.

352
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,139
Doing absolutely nothing.

353
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,059
That's the real ultimate power.

354
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,728
But that means nothing to you, right?

355
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,396
You catch them as soon as they're let go.

356
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,815
If I had done that…

357
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,818
thousands of people would've died.

358
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,238
What do you mean?

359
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,115
What's this?

360
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,368
According to the information
I've gathered,

361
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,078
there's something Phukha always does.

362
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,956
If the area he's operating in
is no longer useful

363
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,290
or his identity is exposed,

364
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,335
he blows up the ship
and takes off right away.

365
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,755
Those are photos of the Laima Port
in Myanmar,

366
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,006
where Phukha's ship was.

367
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,384
This was a port?

368
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,469
It's completely destroyed.

369
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,763
Did he set off
a nuclear bomb or something?

370
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,224
It's a bomb made with sodium cyanide.

371
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,059
The explosive power
is 0.5 kilotons of TNT.

372
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,603
That's really powerful, right?

373
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,105
Extremely.

374
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,232
The blast radius reached 300 meters,

375
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,026
killing over 200 people.

376
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,820
200…

377
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,571
He's absolutely insane.

378
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:25,158
Wait, so this bomb is planted
inside the ship right now?

379
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,954
Yes, it's planted
somewhere inside the ship.

380
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,455
Then what do we do?

381
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,041
Team Leader Gu and the rest
are on the ship.

382
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,919
There's something even scarier
than the bomb.

383
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,963
Scroll down.

384
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,050
What's this?

385
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,429
There was a drug manufacturing town
on the outskirts of Laos,

386
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,222
and when government forces
attacked the place,

387
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,934
Phukha massacred everyone in the village
who was making drugs

388
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,602
to keep it all under wraps.

389
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,606
How did he kill them all?
They're all coughing up blood.

390
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,026
He used a toxic gas called PF2X.

391
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,112
The gas was released
from the water tank in the village.

392
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:08,660
Then that means there's a gas tank
somewhere in Uma-gu.

393
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,787
Exactly.

394
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,795
Is this the right way?

395
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,091
-I think so.
-Jeez, I have no idea where I'm going.

396
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,969
Where are you all going?

397
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,433
I'm going to go see my mom.

398
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,102
How strange.

399
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,146
I wonder how you got in touch with her
without a phone.

400
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,940
You fools.

401
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,817
We don't need phones.

402
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,779
I sent a powerful message to his mother

403
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,989
-with my spiritual power.
-That's right.

404
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,491
Man,

405
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:50,243
your spiritual power
sure reached her quickly.

406
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,621
What a filial son.

407
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,623
But you know,
in movies,

408
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,000
they always die
on the way to go see their mom.

409
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,294
I still have to see her even if I die.

410
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,381
Why are they going to see your mom though?

411
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,715
Are you going to die together?

412
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,592
I'm going to meet my mother-in-law,

413
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,677
you asshole.

414
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,555
While we're on the topic of moms,
I miss my mom.

415
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,015
Me too.

416
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,267
I miss my mom in Thailand.

417
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,896
I miss my mom.

418
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,024
I miss my mom!

419
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,110
Hey, hey.

420
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,736
This is unbearably sad.

421
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,948
Go visit her.

422
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,576
An unfilial son
knows the heart of an unfilial son.

423
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,954
- Thanks, Boss Park.
- Go on.

424
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,624
See you later.

425
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,628
Wait.

426
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,672
Wait.

427
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,218
But I'm a pretty filial son.
That was harsh of him to say.

428
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:52,055
I'm telling you,
I swear he's that detective.

429
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:54,683
Hey.

430
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,810
Come here.

431
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,272
You trying to start a fight with me?

432
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,857
That's not it.

433
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,859
I'm just saying we should check.

434
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,694
You can slap me in the face if I'm wrong.

435
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,446
You seem pretty confident.

436
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,905
Capelin, go check.

437
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,990
Okay.

438
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,037
You'd better hope you're right.

439
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,582
You caught me at the wrong time.

440
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,960
What happens

441
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,254
if both the gas is released
and the bomb explodes in Uma-gu?

442
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,966
My guess is that 2,000 to 3,000 people

443
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,968
will die within 10 minutes.

444
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,265
I wonder
why he didn't set off the bomb today.

445
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,601
His identity was exposed.

446
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,269
He still has something left to do here.

447
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,480
And he knows we can't make a move.

448
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,315
Do you think he forgot

449
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,818
because we have
our observatory date tonight?

450
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,236
Listen to yourself.

451
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,490
Sure, you saved thousands of lives.

452
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,325
I would like to think so.

453
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,995
Let's just come up with a detailed plan
and catch him.

454
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,163
You know we can do it.

455
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,457
Phukha's got a tight hold
on the hacker groups in Asia,

456
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,625
so the information is going to leak.

457
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,710
Good lord. So what do we do then?

458
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,421
We'll have Detective Gu's team
look into the bomb.

459
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,758
You look into the gas.

460
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,967
And get closer to…

461
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,886
Oh, jeez, hang on.

462
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,972
Get closer to Chairman Kim.

463
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,225
How am I going to do that exactly?

464
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,851
You want me to ask him,

465
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,521
"Oh my, where did you hide the gas?"

466
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,398
I think he'll tell you
if you ask him just like that.

467
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,859
My goodness, you've got to be kidding me.

468
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,820
I'd much rather see Polka Dot the ghost.

469
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,239
Do you still see her?

470
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,408
I think the exorcism
actually made her go away.

471
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,743
I haven't seen her since.

472
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,954
What did I say?

473
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,956
I've still got it.

474
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,749
But you know,

475
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,126
I've been feeling a bit heavy
and uncomfortable since that day.

476
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,378
Right?

477
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,381
She left with you on your back.

478
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,590
Stop saying that!

479
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,426
She's a ghost,
but I guess she's also into looks.

480
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,639
I guess
humans and ghosts are all into looks.

481
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,558
What are you talking about?

482
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,017
- Stop the nonsense.
- So full of himself.

483
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,187
Also, I think there'll be
an unexpected person joining our side.

484
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,689
I'd have to persuade them first.

485
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,190
Who?

486
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,569
A public authority.

487
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,861
Oh, come on.

488
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,405
You don't trust those people.

489
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,324
I don't, but I'm going to try this time.

490
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,121
What do you mean
Chairman Kim is the drug lord?

491
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,330
It's true.

492
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,000
He's at the police station right now.

493
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,502
There must be a misunderstanding.

494
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,963
There's no way
he'd be involved in something like that.

495
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:32,549
He may look like a gentleman
on the outside, but in reality,

496
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,967
he's a very cruel drug--

497
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,093
Father Hong.

498
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,636
- Oh, jeez!
- You bastard!

499
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,054
-Are you okay?
-Oh, gosh!

500
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,764
-Are you okay?
-It hurts.

501
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,016
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

502
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,767
What happened?

503
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,021
Ah, I'm sorry for the chaos earlier today.

504
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,191
Could you please explain what's going on?

505
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,904
My competitors
accused me of importing drugs.

506
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,325
Father Kim Haeil seemed to believe that,
so we got into a little fight.

507
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,411
I proved my innocence
at the police station.

508
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,705
What did I say?

509
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,707
I told you there's no way.

510
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,000
Of course.

511
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,961
Why would someone as good-natured
as Chairman Kim ever do such a thing?

512
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,796
Good-natured, my foot!

513
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,423
Foot, yes.

514
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:16,551
Now that he's stepped "foot" in Uma-gu,
he'll make it a better place.

515
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,053
Right?

516
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,225
Is this everyone?

517
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,393
Yeah.

518
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,355
Us two deacons, and three of our juniors.

519
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,610
Starting tomorrow, we're kicking off
the anti-drug campaign in Uma-gu.

520
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,987
We'll also visit the nursing home
and convince the elders.

521
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,865
But will they even listen to us?

522
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,159
To be honest, I'm a little scared.

523
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,702
I mean, a drug ring is involved.

524
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,954
Did you forget what Father Kim Haeil said?

525
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,706
You need guts.

526
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,541
Priests need to have guts.

527
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,378
Guts, guts, guts!

528
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,837
-Guts.
-Guts.

529
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,005
Guts?

530
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:00,011
I think I just heard you say "guts."

531
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,888
What are you talking about?

532
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,557
No, we said "nuts."

533
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,478
You mean those rich, healthy,
earthy-flavored snacks

534
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,439
with a satisfying crunch
you can't keep your hands away from?

535
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:19,030
♪ Can't keep our hands away ♪

536
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,324
Yes, exactly. Delicious nuts.

537
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:24,411
You're not scheming anything suspicious,
are you?

538
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:25,620
Not at all.

539
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,707
If I find out that you're up to no good,

540
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,792
I'll be giving all of you
a serious punishment, got it?

541
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,043
Yes, sir.

542
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,263
Lonely Restaurant

543
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,182
Where in the world is my mom?

544
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,060
- My son!
- Mom!

545
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,980
Mom.

546
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,653
Mother!

547
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:05,827
Why do you all look so haggard?

548
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,746
This is your daughter-in-law.

549
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,874
-Mother, please accept my bow.
-Oh, goodness. All right.

550
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,168
- It's nice to see you, my daughter-in-law.
- Accept mine too.

551
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,298
It's nice to see you,
foul-mouthed fairy shaman.

552
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,592
Take a seat.

553
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,594
Mom!

554
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,512
Goodness, my mom!

555
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,768
Man, this is making me tear up.

556
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,936
- Have a seat.
- My goodness.

557
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,022
Get down!

558
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,864
I'm telling you, I'm right.

559
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,408
Chairman Kim got exposed
after those guys came here.

560
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,244
You'd better check if I'm right or wrong
when they come back.

561
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,164
Jeez, you're so damn suspicious.

562
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,999
Hold up.

563
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,753
What's up, Capelin?

564
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,547
Is that so?

565
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,883
I see.

566
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,301
All right.

567
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,511
All right, bye.

568
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,304
What did he say?

569
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:09,933
Come here.

570
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,309
Hurry.

571
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,978
He said his mom showed up.

572
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,022
-Oh, really?
-Capelin teared up.

573
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,358
-Oh, he did?
-Am I a joke to you because I shit myself?

574
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,360
Oh, you shit yourself?

575
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,444
Can't you tell?

576
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,615
Get closer.

577
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,699
Closer.

578
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,785
Get lost.

579
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,831
Hmm?

580
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,876
Oh, my God.

581
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,086
Here.

582
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,713
Have some noodles.

583
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,260
Your finger went in.

584
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,928
It's okay. Jeez, that's hot.

585
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,222
Food isn't what's important right now.

586
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:53,059
We'll never make it off the ship
if this goes off.

587
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:57,272
I've imagined many ways to die,
but definitely not like this.

588
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,692
Look. There's toxic gas too.

589
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,318
If this blows up,

590
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,529
everyone at the church…

591
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,656
This is bad.

592
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,285
Father Kim told me to tell you all

593
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:14,539
to locate the bomb in the ship.

594
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,586
We need a lot of equipment
to locate a bomb.

595
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,588
We have Yohan.

596
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,632
Our budget superhero.

597
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,678
My power has greatly increased

598
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,971
since that incident.

599
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,396
One day, I was on a hike
when I suddenly got hungry.

600
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:42,317
In hunger, I ate from a pile of carrots
a rabbit had saved up.

601
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,320
While munching away,

602
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,406
I locked eyes with the rabbit
whose food I had stolen.

603
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,959
The Super Saiyan rabbit, fuming,
attacked me with incredible strength.

604
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,588
It relentlessly tore at my ear!

605
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,882
That was how I got my superpower.

606
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,387
Wait, what?

607
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,722
- Yohan.
- Yes?

608
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,058
Explosive devices

609
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,101
make a faint sound,

610
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,812
like a high-glitched frequency.

611
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,230
It's "high-pitched."

612
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,690
You know what I meant.

613
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,984
You just need to detect that.

614
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,195
How can a human being detect that?

615
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,238
Do you want to touch it?

616
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,199
No, you son of a gun.

617
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,495
-What are you doing?
-Here, have some gimbap too.

618
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,205
Thank you.

619
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,207
-Grandma.
-They're gone.

620
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,583
They're done, don't worry.

621
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,335
- Don't worry.
- Goodness gracious.

622
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,344
Goodness, Chief.

623
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,138
I'm really curious.

624
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,932
Are you gutsy,

625
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:57,684
or are you just dumb?

626
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,438
You think you can just happily head home
after causing all that trouble?

627
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:06,067
Did Chairman Kim Hongsik send you here?

628
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,527
Who else would've sent us here?

629
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,028
The vice chairman?

630
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,200
Jeez, that was hilarious.

631
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,995
Hey, load her into the van.

632
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,872
Wait, wait.

633
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,583
You shouldn't say "load"
when referring to a human.

634
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,795
This is kidnapping, and don't forget
that I'm the chief of Uma Police Station.

635
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,923
How can someone act tough and stupid
at the same time?

636
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,800
Come on, load her up!

637
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,973
Let go! Let go of me!

638
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,355
What the heck?

639
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,983
Why did she suddenly turn into a mad dog?

640
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,277
Go get her!

641
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,825
Stop right there!

642
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,078
I'll put a gag in your mouth
once I get you.

643
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,253
We're going to gag you
as soon as we get you!

644
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,639
There you are.

645
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,891
Jeez.

646
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,768
I'm tired.

647
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,062
I'm exhausted.

648
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,439
You chose to come to this alley
of all the alleys?

649
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,732
Do you have any idea

650
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,359
how serious a crime it is
to threaten a police chief?

651
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,236
We'd still do it even if we knew.

652
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,321
You know why?

653
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,031
Do you?

654
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,209
Are you drug dealers brainless?

655
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,294
Do you not know how to think?

656
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,880
She's the police chief.

657
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:52,423
It's the priest again.

658
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,674
Eh?

659
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,517
You want to continue?

660
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,394
Retreat! Retreat!

661
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,439
Hey, let's go.
Come on, you punks!

662
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,775
What the heck? No, please!

663
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,859
I don't like you!

664
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,490
Are you okay?

665
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,748
I'll put them on for you.

666
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,130
Can you see now?

667
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,593
Thank you for saving me,

668
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,805
but please just leave me alone.

669
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,890
Don't come near me.

670
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,892
- Chief.
- Please.

671
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,895
It doesn't matter
if I get kidnapped or die.

672
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,607
Please just don't get involved.

673
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,037
What about the chief?

674
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,123
You don't know where she went?

675
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,249
No, sir.

676
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,625
She's not at home.

677
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,044
I think the priest took her.

678
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,838
Does he not sleep?

679
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,840
He's going to get really ill at this rate.

680
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,884
I think the chief

681
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,428
knows everything about us like the priest.

682
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,762
So what?

683
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,223
-Sorry?
-The thing about secrets is

684
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:28,644
they only have power
if the person who knows them is powerful.

685
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:32,523
It's nothing but a tabloid
when in the hands of a powerless worm.

686
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,777
I learned something from you again, sir.

687
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,070
-Did you?
-Yes, sir.

688
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,697
Then let me teach you one more thing.

689
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,908
They say a worm squirms when stepped on.

690
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,535
But that's the case
when it's stepped on lightly.

691
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,413
If you really step on it, it gets crushed.

692
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,415
Wouldn't it burst?

693
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,834
If you step on it with full force.

694
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:56,255
Noted, sir.
Why don't we play another game?

695
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,506
We're done playing.

696
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,268
Ms. Park.

697
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,938
Oh, Chairman Kim.

698
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:23,991
A star.

699
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,752
Oh, wow,
there really are rings around Saturn.

700
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,420
That's so cool.

701
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,298
Are there any constellations
you want to know about?

702
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,471
Were you a pirate or something?
How do you know these things?

703
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,557
My nickname used to be Jack Sparrow.

704
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:52,144
Well, you do have
the same facial features and vibe.

705
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:58,651
Oh. That's Leo.

706
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,988
And that's the Big Dipper.

707
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:05,741
And the one below is Cassiopeia.

708
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,619
Look at this bastard.

709
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,372
Can I ask you
another question about stars?

710
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,581
Of course, anything.

711
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,001
Which one is the rock star?

712
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:17,086
Get it?

713
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,714
Gosh, that's hilarious.

714
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,049
And what about the pop star?

715
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,429
Wait, isn't that a meteor?

716
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,811
Three of them fell at once.

717
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,688
That's three times the luck.

718
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,274
I guess so.
It wouldn't kill someone three times.

719
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,818
That's so cool.

720
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,904
Why do you like
coming to the observatory so much?

721
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,451
Women like men who are observant.

722
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,289
Goodness, Chairman Kim.

723
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,793
Damn it, that's so damn cheesy.

724
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,088
Leo.

725
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,381
The one up there is Leo.

726
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,717
Big Dipper.

727
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,806
Mmm.

728
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,520
By the way, is Kim Hongsik your real name?

729
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,606
It's quite tacky, right?

730
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,858
Do you know where I got the name?

731
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,860
Sounds like
your parents didn't name you that.

732
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,613
Well, they more or less did.

733
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,908
Do you know an old drama
called The Moon of Seoul?

734
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,243
Of course, it was a huge hit.

735
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,995
I'm a fan of the writer.

736
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,290
It's my favorite drama.

737
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,085
Actor Han Seokkyu played Kim Hongsik,

738
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:42,380
Choi Minsik played Park Chunseop,
and Baek Yoonsik played Kim Incheol.

739
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,257
My brothers' names
are Chunseop and Incheol.

740
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,676
You're The Moon of Seoul brothers.

741
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,806
Wasn't Hongsik in the drama
a gigolo or a gangster or something?

742
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,973
A gigolo.

743
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,141
But…

744
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,187
he reminds me of myself. He makes me sad.

745
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,856
It's even sadder

746
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,025
that he tried to live life to the fullest
but ended up getting stabbed.

747
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,569
Oh, right, that's how he died.

748
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,113
I remember it was the last scene.

749
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,823
You know,

750
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,076
I want to be a successful Hongsik
who doesn't end up getting stabbed.

751
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,619
Right here in Uma-gu.

752
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,124
It seems like you're successful,
so just be careful not to get stabbed.

753
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,300
What's this now?

754
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,804
-I picked this up--
-Please don't say "on the way here."

755
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,722
I bought it.

756
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:35,558
I bought it.

757
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:39,562
It counts as bribery when a businessman
gives a prosecutor a gift.

758
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,231
Not when it's a gift
from a man to a woman.

759
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,652
In that case, I'll receive the gift
this one time as a woman.

760
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,280
What is it anyway?

761
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,573
Well…

762
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:52,741
You can open it at home.

763
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,786
It's nothing. It's just a small gesture.

764
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,331
Is a mass murderer being shy right now?

765
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:02,168
What's up with this bastard?

766
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,752
Please eat.

767
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,235
Don't think about running away.

768
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,738
Why would I?

769
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,074
Uma-gu is my territory
and soon-to-be heaven.

770
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,084
Father Lee.

771
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,420
What if the devils
make their so-called heaven?

772
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,552
And what if people believe that heaven…

773
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,722
is the real one?

774
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,931
Five of us, including me and Noah,
are going to take action

775
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,057
and split up into two groups.

776
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,560
They're doing this voluntarily, right?

777
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,353
You didn't force them or anything?

778
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,648
This is a seminary.
You think I'm a thug or something?

779
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,317
I have to hear Noah's opinion.

780
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,193
He didn't force you, did he?

781
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,196
Of course not, Father Kim.

782
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,115
Of course he'd say no in front of you.

783
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,326
Anyway, be careful.

784
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,704
I have to look for something dangerous
starting today.

785
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,207
-Something dangerous?
-You'll chicken out if I tell you.

786
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,375
Come on.

787
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,419
Do I look like a farm animal?

788
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,879
Good one.

789
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,965
It can't be
something like a bomb or a toxic gas.

790
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:00,679
I can imagine the bomb,
but how bad is the gas?

791
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,806
Just something used in
chemical warfare if a war breaks out.

792
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,600
Do I have to transfer?

793
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,684
Go ahead.

794
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,728
The rest of us at the seminary
will just cough up blood and die.

795
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,896
Come on!

796
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,898
How are you going to find it?

797
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,191
I'm not finding the actual gas.

798
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,234
I'm going to find
the people who manage it.

799
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,236
And who are those people?

800
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,823
-Why are you so whiny?
-Come on.

801
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,326
I'll be off. Call me if anything happens.

802
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,372
Something is going to happen.

803
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,707
Wait, no.

804
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,459
Guts!

805
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,173
Don't buy or sell drugs.

806
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,550
Don't buy or sell drugs!

807
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,012
-Why are they so slow?
-If you witness drug transactions,

808
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,848
please report them to the police.

809
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,810
- Report them to the police!
- Do they really believe in resurrection?

810
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,813
- They're asking for a death wish.
- Don't buy or sell drugs.

811
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,565
- Don't buy or sell drugs…
- Ma'am.

812
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,194
You should be careful on the streets.

813
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,362
Have a nice day.

814
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,156
Report them to the police!

815
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,410
Drugs are not allowed
in the beautiful Uma-gu!

816
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,329
Drugs are not allowed!

817
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,082
Don't buy or sell drugs.

818
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,166
National Forensic Service

819
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,627
Results for kasanin: negative

820
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,049
Actor Oh Jinyeong's second test
came back negative as well.

821
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,510
This is not good.

822
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,554
Did you intimidate his agency's CEO?

823
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,014
He was shaking in fear in front of me,

824
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,392
but apparently, he's known
for stabbing people in the back.

825
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,686
Then he'll definitely stab us in the back.

826
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,605
-Make sure to give him a clear warning.
-Yes, sir.

827
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:34,773
I'll make it clear to him

828
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,233
that he'll be standing
in front of the police line

829
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,736
with camera flashes going off
if he speaks on the matter.

830
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,364
Mm. There's nothing
more effective than that.

831
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,032
Anyway,

832
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,118
are things going well with Kim Hongsik?

833
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,871
- Sorry?
- Judging by his personality,

834
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,039
I can imagine him making his move on you.

835
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,418
I'm not that easy.

836
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,462
Plus, I'm not interested in dating.

837
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,548
My nickname used to be… Kyung-nun.

838
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,508
Kyung-nun?

839
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,760
As in "Kyungsun" plus "nun"?

840
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,638
Man, Kim must be
hot and bothered right now.

841
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,309
I'll just sit back with my popcorn,
watch the fun,

842
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,810
and see who wins in the end.

843
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,273
This darn bastard.

844
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,275
I hope you choke on a corn kernel.

845
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,529
I have a long day ahead of me.

846
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,490
The new chief prosecutor is coming,

847
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,450
so I have to go keep him company all day.

848
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,827
It'll just be for today.

849
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,830
Goodness gracious.

850
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,083
Park Dochang, 33 years old.

851
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,840
Jeez, this punk.

852
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,638
I mean…

853
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,932
can't hurt to just look at it, right?

854
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,350
It doesn't cost me anything.

855
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,727
I'm not taking it. I'm just looking at it.

856
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,270
I just look, okay?

857
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,067
Oh my.

858
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,361
He's insane.

859
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:03,862
This is huge.

860
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:05,906
Goodness me.

861
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:11,036
Jeez, it looks so good on me.

862
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,790
Big jewelry like this is usually fake.

863
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,585
I doubt he would've given me a fake one
unless he wanted to lose face.

864
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,920
To a prosecutor no less.

865
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,759
Or is this bastard
just a fake, shallow person?

866
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,762
What's with this guy?

867
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,407
I have two eggs,
but you have three.

868
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,995
What are they, recluses?
They never leave the ship.

869
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,665
Why would they when this is the factory,
storage room, and headquarters?

870
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,252
We have to find the bomb
as soon as possible.

871
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,837
I know.

872
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,923
We can only search
when they're not around.

873
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,174
Darn it.

874
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,300
Chairman Kim is here.

875
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,388
Hello, sir.

876
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,599
What's the update
on the packages to Thailand?

877
00:48:55,682 --> 00:48:58,101
They're about 70% ready.

878
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,187
They're extremely picky and suspicious.

879
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,022
-We need to be precise.
-Yes, sir.

880
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,775
Are those the guys?

881
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,485
Oh, yes, sir.

882
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,655
What are you doing?
Stand up and greet him properly.

883
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,326
I'm Maksan.

884
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:15,869
Thank you for taking us in.

885
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,961
You really do look like that detective.

886
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,838
I'll let you kill the priest
when the time is right.

887
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:27,923
Yes, sir.

888
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,425
I'll stay put and wait for your order.

889
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,011
You guys can't just stay here for free.

890
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,597
Why don't you help out
when we ship the goods to Thailand?

891
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,101
From what I hear,
the guys might get cheeky.

892
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,937
It's my expertise
to catch those who get cheeky.

893
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,480
I'll make it up to you.

894
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,607
What are you? Are you a real shaman?

895
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,359
Can't you tell…

896
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:48,944
s-sir?

897
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,321
What's my fate?

898
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,825
Let's see.

899
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:03,667
You'll live a life of wealth and glory,
only to meet an untimely death…

900
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,550
What's an untimely death?

901
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,760
That was the case,

902
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,804
but you will meet a benefactor

903
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,098
and live a long life.

904
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,564
I wonder who that benefactor is.

905
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,733
Let's see.

906
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,572
Just say anything.

907
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,990
The south.

908
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,245
They're someone in the south.

909
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,538
The south?

910
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,665
Sounds about right.

911
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,834
You're good.

912
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,837
Uh, are you leaving?

913
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,048
Goodbye, sir.

914
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,382
Goodbye.

915
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,551
This is new.

916
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,847
It's not like him
to give someone work right away.

917
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,516
It's because I've got the skills.

918
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,852
So when are the goods being served?

919
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:06,271
"Goods"? What do you mean?

920
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,691
I mean our food.

921
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,319
Oh, that. What do you mean when?
It's right now.

922
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,197
- Eat up. You guys eat up too.
- Yes, sir.

923
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,288
Ma'am, I can't help but ask…

924
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,291
Do you want to sell this to me?

925
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,210
I'll give you…

926
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,587
2.5 billion won.

927
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:33,840
What's wrong?

928
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:35,467
Is that too little?

929
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,970
All right then, let's see…

930
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,224
All right, 2.8 billion won.

931
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,815
Do you have any idea how precious this is?
That's way too little.

932
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:54,152
Of course I know.
I've worked here for years.

933
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,987
You can't get this in Korea.

934
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,781
Only royal families in Southeast Asia

935
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:59,533
can get their hands
on something like this.

936
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,912
What in the world
did that bastard give me?

937
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:08,291
I'll look into some other places first.

938
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,294
Have a nice day.

939
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,921
Wait, ma'am.

940
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,382
You won't sell it
for much more at other places.

941
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,052
Darn it,
I could've bought it for 5 billion won.

942
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:22,430
Come here, bastard.

943
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,016
There, there.

944
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,811
I lost a big commission today,
you little bastard.

945
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,191
Goodness gracious.

946
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,528
Seeing how he's spending money recklessly,

947
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,822
he's definitely an idiot
when it comes to dating.

948
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:43,660
I'll teach you a thing or two
about romance.

949
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,091
Is there something wrong?

950
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,345
Take back this gift.

951
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,557
Do you not like it?

952
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,935
I thought it was fake
and worth 100,000 won at most.

953
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,979
Did you have it appraised?

954
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,063
I did.

955
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,317
It was worth enough
to buy an apartment in Gangnam.

956
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,735
A big one at that.

957
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,070
I hate things like this.

958
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,822
Do I look that materialistic?

959
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,949
That's not why I gave it to you.

960
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:25,410
I just thought it'd look good on you.

961
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,746
I now know what you think of me.

962
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,539
We should stop seeing each other.

963
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,626
It seems like
there was a misunderstanding.

964
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,711
I hope your business succeeds.

965
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,129
And don't get stabbed.

966
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,550
Prosecutor Park.

967
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,428
- Prosecutor Park.
- That was so cheesy.

968
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,139
In your face.

969
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,769
Prosecutor Nam

970
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:54,773
- Hello?
- Hey.

971
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,359
I have some time
before going to headquarters.

972
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,610
Let's go eat.

973
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,821
Is everything okay
with the new chief prosecutor?

974
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,740
He's all about taking bribes,

975
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,825
making sure
his whole family benefits from it too.

976
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,454
He loves to drink
and has zero awareness of gender issues.

977
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,373
No problem at all, right?

978
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,541
He's a 10 out of 10.

979
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,627
We've hit the jackpot with our higher-up

980
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,671
and our underlings.

981
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,381
I'm very, very happy.

982
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,010
Prosecutor Park must be good at her job.

983
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,388
She's a world-class gem.

984
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:28,098
Although she says she's not.

985
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:30,892
It's common for prosecutors
to become lawyers after they quit, right?

986
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,977
Why do you ask?

987
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,895
Are you going to help me
set up my practice?

988
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,106
I'm not talking about you.

989
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,400
How cheap and inconsiderate of you.

990
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,484
Forget it.

991
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,529
Just help set up a fancy one
for Prosecutor Park.

992
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,240
Here.

993
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,077
By the way,

994
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,205
did you see the seminarians
and their ridiculous nonsense?

995
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,499
They even went to the nursing home
to give their blessing.

996
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,625
You're kidding.

997
00:54:56,251 --> 00:55:00,588
They were doing some sort of
drug eradication campaign or something.

998
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,090
Shouldn't you do something about them?

999
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,883
But they're seminarians.

1000
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,720
Nothing good will come
from doing anything about them.

1001
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,763
You know Sonogong
from Flying Superboard, right?

1002
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,891
He has the ability to create
clones of himself by pulling his hair out.

1003
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,227
Those guys are clones of Kim Haeil.

1004
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,813
We have to stop them before it's too late.

1005
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,690
The younger ones have power.

1006
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:21,026
Let me know in advance
if you're going to do something.

1007
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,403
I'll cover you.

1008
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:30,994
- Listen up!
- Yes, sir!

1009
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,372
- Kill them all today.
- Let's go.

1010
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,765
They've all gone.
Not many are left on the ship.

1011
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,808
Really? Then let's look around now.

1012
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,443
Don't you need a bigger one
for it to work better?

1013
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,363
This is perfect. My hands will feel numb
if it's any bigger.

1014
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,324
You're one picky superhero.

1015
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,408
Let's go.

1016
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,252
Uma Gas Station

1017
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:30,929
Darn it, I can't see anything.

1018
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,014
I should've brought binoculars.

1019
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,725
I'm definitely aging.

1020
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,786
Darn it.

1021
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,955
Oh, jeez.

1022
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,959
Damn it.

1023
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,711
What is it, Geezer Park?

1024
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,381
I'm on my way to raid
the honey jar storage room.

1025
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,465
What?

1026
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:12,011
But the sun's still out. Will you be okay?

1027
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,721
Today's the day.

1028
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,558
Prosecutor Nam
will be at headquarters today.

1029
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:19,144
Oh, really?

1030
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,104
You need to be careful.

1031
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,397
What about you?

1032
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,648
Me?

1033
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,941
I'm currently…

1034
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:28,820
tailing the gecko tattoo guys.

1035
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,990
Make sure you don't get caught.
You're a bit clumsy these days.

1036
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,074
Please.

1037
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,326
When have I ever gotten caught?

1038
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,371
And I'm not clumsy, okay? Jeez.

1039
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,638
Oh, right, I can use the camera.

1040
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,140
I can zoom in on them.

1041
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,686
Wow! I should've done this sooner.

1042
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,159
What's the matter?

1043
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,368
Are you okay?

1044
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,704
It hurts.

1045
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:20,872
Does it?

1046
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:24,000
It's not easy being a hero.
Just a little more, Yohan.

1047
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,252
You got this.

1048
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:34,052
Over there.
It's that way.

1049
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,178
Where, exactly?

1050
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,264
I think I hear
a beeping sound coming from there.

1051
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,436
You got this, Yohan.

1052
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,579
I brought a sturdy one today.

1053
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,956
Listen up!

1054
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,874
Beat them up to a pulp!

1055
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,292
Yes, sir!

1056
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,634
It was crazy.

1057
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,136
We almost got beaten to death
by the drug dealers.

1058
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,138
They wouldn't actually kill us.

1059
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,473
They're just trying to scare us.

1060
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,276
What the hell?

1061
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:36,030
Stop it!

1062
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,366
Are you okay?

1063
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,368
Noah!

1064
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,043
Why are you doing this?

1065
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:53,089
Andrew!

1066
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,717
Die, you bastard!

1067
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,010
Are you okay?

1068
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,511
Hey, back up.

1069
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,638
This one's pretty tough.

1070
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,641
Let's see if you can take this!

1071
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,893
What about now, huh?

1072
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,608
Uma Gas Station

1073
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:28,750
What is it?

1074
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,712
Father Kim, it's madness in here.

1075
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,841
The drug dealers raided the seminary.

1076
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,400
I texted you the address.

1077
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,528
I got it. I'm nearby.

1078
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,322
Will you be okay on your own?

1079
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:02,116
If they were able to get intel on you
from the Thai DSI,

1080
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,284
we can't underestimate them.

1081
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:04,994
We'll head over right away.

1082
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,788
It's fine. I'll go there myself.

1083
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,915
I felt like taking a walk anyway.

1084
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:13,670
Grass Bookstore

1085
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:24,263
Uma Go House

1086
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,357
So what if you use an expensive lock?

1087
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,983
I'll be using a crowbar anyway.

1088
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,471
Are your ears okay?

1089
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:06,931
They never hurt.

1090
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:09,142
I just pretended they did
for dramatic effect.

1091
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,602
You're not a hero.
You're just a drama queen.

1092
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,775
I think it's coming from here.

1093
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,529
Are you sure it's coming from here,
you drama queen?

1094
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,030
It is.

1095
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,075
I hear a high-pitched frequency
and what sounds like a ticking clock.

1096
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,493
And a growling sound.

1097
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,162
That's coming from your stomach.

1098
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,457
- Indeed. It's coming from my stomach.
- You pig.

1099
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,294
Look, this is the only room
that has a lock.

1100
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,629
Then it must be this room.

1101
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,716
They must've installed a lock
because there's something in here.

1102
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,635
Look for a crowbar
so we can open the door.

1103
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,720
Okay.

1104
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:49,599
What are you looking for?

1105
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,561
Are you in an escape room,

1106
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,271
Team Leader Gu Daeyoung?

1107
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:07,992
Welcome.

1108
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:16,083
Are you looking for anything?

1109
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,046
I think I already found it.

1110
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,547
You did?

1111
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,758
Is there anything else…

1112
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,301
Mm.

1113
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,054
Yes, there is.

1114
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,348
I heard you carry some special documents.

1115
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:39,982
Well, we do get rare books
every now and then.

1116
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:43,861
That's not what I'm talking about.

1117
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,031
I mean things that no one knows about.

1118
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:52,912
Why would something like that be here?

1119
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,790
I was told it was here.

1120
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,041
Father Kim.

1121
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:40,978
Retreat!

1122
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:42,563
Retreat!

1123
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,778
I said retreat, you morons!

1124
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,531
Father Kim!

1125
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,534
Father Kim, they're running away!

1126
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,037
Don't run away!

1127
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,796
Father Kim…

1128
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:28,901
Father Kim…

1129
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,488
Father Kim.

1130
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,490
Father… Father Kim!
