The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,247
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,540
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,517
The temporary priest?

8
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,521
- Father Kim!
- Hey!

9
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,649
Halt, you rascals!

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,776
Go! It's dangerous!

11
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,870
Jeez.

12
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,160
Look at that. He's good.

13
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,355
The cops are coming. Wrap it up.

14
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,658
Let's go.

15
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,800
Father Kim!

16
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,511
-Are you okay?
-Go check on them.

17
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,596
Oh, jeez.

18
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,848
- Are you okay?
- What's going on here?

19
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,560
Over here!

20
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,978
Please hurry!

21
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:12,859
Team 1, to the left!

22
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,986
- Team 2, to the right! Start searching!
- Yes, sir!

23
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,657
Episode 5
Hard Measures for Insanity

24
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,743
A group of drug ring members

25
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,288
escaped while being transported
under police custody in Dohan-gu, Busan.

26
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,874
-The Dohan Police reported…
-Are they filming a variety show or what?

27
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,835
…that they had received a tip
on drug traffickers, raided the scene,

28
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,882
and were escorting the suspects
when they assaulted the officers and fled.

29
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,636
Eight officers have suffered
minor to serious injuries,

30
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,931
and one of them is reported to be
in critical condition.

31
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,850
The Busan Metropolitan Police Agency
has formed a special task force

32
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,644
to apprehend them…

33
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,069
That's some next-level bullshit.

34
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,243
Yes?

35
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,619
Kim.

36
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,705
You've created quite the scene
to save those dimwits.

37
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,251
Sometimes, you have to handle things
in a barbaric way.

38
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,545
And do you realize the Busan police
are a mess because of your barbaric ways?

39
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,007
And you'll clean up that mess, won't you?

40
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,592
Listen, Kim.

41
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,761
It's easier to clean up shit

42
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,098
when you don't crap out a whole bunch
out in the open.

43
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,810
But if you shit out diarrhea
in the middle of the road,

44
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,145
that's no easy work
for the person cleaning it up!

45
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,399
I found out something mind-blowing

46
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,317
because I shit out diarrhea
in the middle of the road.

47
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,361
What is it?

48
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,905
You know that priest
who's like a priest but not?

49
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,157
I found out who he is.

50
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,161
You did?

51
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,413
Who is he?

52
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,539
Sir!

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,960
Did he just hang up on me?

54
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,295
You startled me.

55
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,797
Oh, I didn't know you were on the phone.
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,259
-What is it?
-Do I really not get a welcome party?

57
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,720
It's already my third day here.

58
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,431
Let me tell you how it works here.

59
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,182
We follow a self-service system,

60
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,310
so you can throw your own welcome party.

61
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,645
Yes, sir. Noted.

62
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,105
Self-service.

63
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,444
Well noted, you absolute scum.

64
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,658
-Sir.
-What now?

65
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,368
Self-service.

66
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,832
There are nutjobs everywhere.

67
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,085
This is frustrating.

68
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,837
Will they be able to catch them?

69
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,757
They said a special task force
has been created,

70
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,342
so I'm sure they will.

71
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,385
I don't get
why they even use the term "special."

72
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,970
There's nothing special about them.

73
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,764
It'll be a special and chaotic day today,

74
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,557
but things will be quiet tomorrow.

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,684
Prosecutor Nam is going to find
a way to intervene.

76
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,227
I just know it.

77
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:56,606
Let's hurry and go.
I don't like the police station.

78
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,985
Who were those guys?
I'd hate to run into them at night.

79
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,653
It's nighttime right now.

80
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,364
Would they be less scary during the day?

81
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,366
I doubt it.

82
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,575
I have something to say.

83
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,579
You cowards.

84
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,290
Why did you run away earlier?

85
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,918
You said, "Go, it's dangerous!"

86
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,878
We were following your orders.

87
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,255
I just ran away because they did.

88
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,132
Even so,

89
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,385
how could you just run away like that?

90
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,136
I thought you'd attack
from the back or something.

91
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,597
This isn't rugby.
Why would we attack from the back?

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,349
Their backs looked scarier.

93
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,767
You!

94
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,227
"Halt, you rascals"?

95
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,104
What was that?

96
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,106
What are you, a royal inspector
from the Joseon period?

97
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,482
He sounded like a Joseon soldier.

98
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,860
But seriously, who are they?

99
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,695
I think they're professional killers

100
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,697
trained in Laotian martial arts
called Muay Lao.

101
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,491
They're all part of the same group.

102
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,742
Laos?

103
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,286
That means the Southeast Asian guys
are in on it too, right, Auntie?

104
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,664
Yes, I think so.

105
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,291
Man, this guy is no joke.

106
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,961
Even the guys from Russia
keep away from them.

107
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,213
Thank goodness we stayed out of it.

108
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,381
Hmm.

109
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,342
You might as well throw some rocks
if you're going to stay in the back.

110
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,886
I don't have good hand control.

111
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,096
Yeah?

112
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,598
I can help you with that.

113
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,018
What are you doing?

114
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,187
-Stop it! He's driving!
-Stop!

115
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,815
-I'm just helping him.
-Shoot him with the taser or something!

116
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,444
I'll gladly accept any accomplishment…

117
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,029
I mean, punishment,
no matter how painful it is.

118
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,323
We'll gladly accept it!

119
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,828
I'll kill you all if you don't get up
before I count to three.

120
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,746
One…

121
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,000
three.

122
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,254
You skipped two. Did you forget it?

123
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,093
Forget it.

124
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,263
There's nothing I'd gain from killing you.

125
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,640
We're nothing but useless machines

126
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,767
that eat and sleep all day.

127
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,561
We're useless machines!

128
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,354
Machines don't cry.

129
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,939
These aren't tears.

130
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,275
It's rusty water.

131
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:09,197
You guys are the most childlike
drug dealers I've ever seen.

132
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,199
Why don't we create a ring name?

133
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,160
Maybe Baby Shark Gang
or Baby Octopus Gang.

Sir.

138
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,837
Should we go abroad?

139
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,924
Just don't do anything and stay put.

140
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,092
You can do that, right?

141
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,470
Yes, sir!
It's what we do best!

142
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,515
We'll stay put
until our bones turn to ashes!

143
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,019
I don't care about your ashes.
Get lost.

144
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,354
-Let's get lost.
-Yes, sir.

145
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,525

You're still here?

152
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,129
I still have some work to get done.

153
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,715
No one's going to notice your hard work.

154
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,384
Just go home.

155
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,302
I'm off.

156
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,137

I get that confidentiality is important,
but this is too much.

166
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,997
You look good.

167
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,874
It'll be a fun memory.

168
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,627
Are you sure they're guys from Laos?

169
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,962
I'm sure of it. I faced them myself.

170
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,215
Does that mean
their cartel members are all here?

171
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,550
I don't know for sure,

172
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,802
but it's highly likely.

173
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,930
Then this is out of our hands.

174
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,266
It would mean war
between South Korea and Laos.

175
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,018
You'll be South, and I'll be Korea.

176
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,227
What are you saying?

177
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,479
"Tsunami Korea, Phoenix Sun South"

178
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,189
Wait, no, I frowned. Let's take it again.

179
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:51,025
How are things going with Prosecutor Nam?

180
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,652
I'm trying to butter up to him,

181
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,320
but it's like he's got
a non-stick coating.

182
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,656
Evil beings tend to have their guard up.

183
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,533
I've dealt with
a handful of nasty people like him,

184
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,410
but he's the worst of them all.

185
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,704
Everything from his looks
to the way he talks.

186
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,873
It's written all over his face.

187
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,543
"King of Jerks."

188
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,923
King of Jerks.

189
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,216
What can you expect?

190
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,926
It's nothing new.

191
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,302
When others act that way, they're jerks.

192
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,096
-When I act that way, I'm being confident.
-Goodness.

193
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,847
Listen to you.

194
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,099
Anyway,

195
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,601
do you need help getting close to him?

196
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,437
I've already requested help from JB.

197
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,940
That's good then.

198
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,734
Get JB's help and build a bond
with Prosecutor Nam as fellow prosecutors.

199
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,320
It's easier said than done.

200
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,864
Oh, right.
Am I getting a car provided or what?

201
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,741
I need to tail him.

202
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,203
Of course we have one for you.
I'll send you the address of where it is.

203
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,038
Oh, thanks!

204
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,459
Oh, these came out better than I expected.

205
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,431
I won't let it slide
if it's some junk car.

206
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,856
Whoa.

207
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,941
Yeah.

208
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,152
This is a sick ride.

209
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:33,377
How can a whole bunch of you
not take down one priest?

210
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,299
But I don't think he's an ordinary priest.

212
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,718
But he is.

213
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,846
He's a temporary priest at Uma Church.

214
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,848
He was different from the priests

215
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,517
who fought for the villagers
in the Golden Triangle.

216
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,270
He's a trained professional.

217
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,230
He's more than a professional.

218
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,483
If he had set his mind to it,

219
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,444
you all would've died on the spot.

220
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,908
A strong enemy is like a woman.

221
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,953
You meet them unexpectedly.

222
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,045
Should we get rid of the priest tomorrow?

223
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,220
Can you go to heaven
if you give a lot of offerings?

224
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,555
Money won't get you to heaven.

225
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,890
However,

226
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,475
it could get you to hell.

227
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,273
-Leave him be.
-Sorry?

228
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,151
But you said he's a strong enemy.

229
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,362
Don't you remember
what General Bak Lak said?

230
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,447
A warrior's luck comes in two forms.

231
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,826
The first is having good friends.

232
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,537
The second is having worthy enemies.

233
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,082
Noted.

234
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,875
We'll keep that in mind.

235
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,882
Goodness, we should eat.

236
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,759
Where are you?

237
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,803
The second floor!

238
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,179
- Jeez.
- Here.

239
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,724
You could get lost in this house.

240
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,271
Why are you up here?
This house is massive.

241
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,897
It's a mess on the first floor.

242
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,691
We're here
because we're too lazy to clean.

243
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,734
It's not like
you're going to clean the place.

244
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,027
Where were you?

245
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,404
Well…

246
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,822
- What is that?
- What is that? Show me.

247
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,991
-Show me.
-It's nothing.

248
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,577
It's nothing.

249
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,911
Are they stickers?

250
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,414
-You're so secretive.
-I'll tell you next time.

251
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:34,874
That's not what's important.

252
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,041
How is it?

253
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,544
It's much better quality than I thought.
You can even see their pimples.

254
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,256
But there's no way of knowing who's who

255
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,341
because they don't call each other
by their names.

256
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,718
Oh!

257
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
There it is.

258
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,512
One more thing.

259
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,847
The chairman

260
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,599
wanted me to cut off your adrenaline…

261
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,852
-I mean, your Achilles tendon.
-The person he refers to as "chairman."

262
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,478
I think he might be the drug boss.

263
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,605
Chairman?

264
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,189
Who do they think they are?

265
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,984
They look like a bunch of people
who buy luxury dupes.

266
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,986
Let's see.

267
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,405
We'll have to identify them
with just their faces.

268
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,700
We'll know who they are as soon as
we run their faces through the system.

269
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,994
AI recognition is amazing these days.

270
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,539
Ah, but I don't have access
to the system anymore.

271
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,374
Auntie.

272
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,879
If you rub Father Kim's arm three times,
he'll give you access.

273
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,964
What is he, a genie?

274
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,101
There's a place I know

275
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,811
where you can run their faces
through the system.

276
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,814
Really?

277
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,775
A genie doesn't lie.

278
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,111
This is my first time seeing one.

279
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,238
Thank you.

280
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,490
You're welcome.

281
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,452
Please let me win the lottery.

282
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,496
The ticket you bought today
was last week's winning ticket.

283
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,543
Please make Babel Pharmaceuticals'
stock prices soar.

284
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,045
Just pray that they don't plummet.

285
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,600
What to do now?

286
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,977
Goodness gracious.

287
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,729
We're still playing.
Don't lose your mind just yet.

288
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,780
I've got it right where I need it.

289
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,699
I see.

290
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,410
So that's how you're going to play, huh?

291
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,038
What a cunning diversionary tactic.

292
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,959
"A surprise attack where one makes a sound
in the east and attacks from the west"

293
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,211
Diversionary tactic.

294
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,337
That's it.

295
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,674
Sir, time out.

296
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,886
Chairman Kim, it's me. Have you eaten?

297
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,472
I have. Have you?

298
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,725
Yes, I have.

299
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,144
I actually called to let you know

300
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,648
that there are reporters and detectives
looking into your son's drug case.

301
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,985
I was trying to divert their attention

302
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,280
and did a little something
at Dohan Police Station.

303
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,866
That was your doing?

304
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,411
That's one hell of a diversionary tactic.

305
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,372
Right? That's exactly it.

306
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:26,086
But things kind of got out of hand.

307
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,089
Would you be able to help me out again?

308
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,842
Don't worry about it.

309
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,429
You're working your butt off
because of my son,

310
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,847
so of course I'll help.

311
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,725
What can I do for you?

312
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,143
Thank you, sir.

313
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,145
That would be great.

314
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,482
I'll prepare it and send it over soon.

315
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,241
Hey, Capelin.

316
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,121
You're going to
pull an all-nighter at this rate.

317
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,247
That's it for today.

318
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,333
Leave everything as is

319
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,335
so you can continue tomorrow.

320
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,420
You can go home now. Stop working.

321
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,130
Go home. Go on.

322
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,715
- Let's go.
- Go on.

323
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,550
- Go on.
- Go on.

324
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,678
Go home.

325
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,931
- Go home.
- Go on home.

326
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,516
Just take it.

327
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,726
-Goodness.
-Here.

328
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,729
What is this?

329
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,357
You've been coughing a lot lately.

330
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,569
You'll get better and feel real good
if you take this.

331
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,154
Take it before bed.

332
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,491
I see. Thank you.

333
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:38,992
Don't forget to take it.

334
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,036
Go on. It's time to go home.

335
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,915
Joseph, Stephen.

336
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,671
Where have you been at this hour?

337
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,720
You should be serving God,

338
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,806
but you're serving another power instead?

339
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,226
I'm sorry, Dean Lee.

340
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,812
Rules are meant to be followed.

341
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,814
How are you going to become priests

342
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,816
if you can't even follow simple rules?

343
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,609
I'm taking these away.

344
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,070
I want you to submit

345
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,114
a 10-page self-reflection report
by tomorrow.

346
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,032
You may go.

347
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,955
Father Lee Yeongjun.

348
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,418
Do you remember how we got close?

349
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,176
♪ Banana chacha ♪

350
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,094

You're coming in late again.

355
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,860
How were you in there?
You were out there just now.

356
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:55,944
Mm-mm.

357
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,824
Anyway,

358
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,368
it seems
you've gotten into a fight or something.

359
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,163
Your pants are torn up today.

360
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,081
My pants?

361
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,250
- When did this happen?
- Sorry?

362
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,544
Oh, nothing. Please continue.

363
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,466
I'm not one to pry
into other people's private matters.

364
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,550
However,

365
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,929
I must step out of line and ask today.

366
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,096
Just what in the world

367
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,641
are you getting up to every night?

368
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,644
Why don't you take a guess?

369
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,272
-Physical labor?
-Wrong.

370
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,523
Oh, performing magic!

371
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,776
-Wrong again!
-Then…

372
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,903
-A night hike?
-Wrong, wrong, wrong!

373
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,697
Why am I guessing?

374
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,282
There's something on your chest.

375
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,368
- What is it?
- Oh, you're so polite.

376
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,119
What?

377
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,871
That little…

378
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,456
What just happened?

379
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,966
Oh, my gosh.

380
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,891
What was that?

381
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,854
Why does it feel
so cold and eerie in here?

382
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,481
It's not even that cold out.

383
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,336
So he knows
the National Intelligence Service?

384
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,296
I knew it.

385
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,090
Father Kim is so cool.

386
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:05,967
Come on.

387
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,262
Recognize the faces for me. Come on.

388
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,014
Come on.

389
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,682
Come on.

390
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,645
You won't get results that quickly.

391
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,897
You should get some sleep.

392
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,149
I can't after looking at these mugs.

393
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,094
My gosh.

394
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,012
He's so loud.

395
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,389
Thought he died there for a second.

396
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,015
Why did he pause?

397
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,248
Damn it! These damn lizards!

398
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,084
Why do they all look the same?

399
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,673
I can't believe
I have to look up this dumb tattoo.

400
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,093
That darn Laotian lizard tattoo.

401
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,932
I can't believe them.

402
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,809
How could they not call us even once?

403
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,479
They've forgotten about us.

404
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,941
We were bound to be abandoned
from the very beginning.

405
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,194
Abandoned?

406
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,279
No, it's worse than that.

407
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,239
We're being left out of the Gudam family.

408
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,992
They consider us useless beings.

409
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,370
Useless beans? Why are we beans?

410
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,123
No, useless beings.

411
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,251
It refers to individuals
who have no value or purpose to anyone.

412
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,588
I'd much rather be a bean.
At least that's nutritious.

413
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,549
-What's wrong?
-I just can't believe this right now.

414
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,469
Even worthless beings have pride.

415
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,596
Don't pick up even if Father Kim calls.

416
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,268
Someone's calling me.

417
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,355
It's Father Kim.

418
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,940
He's calling.

419
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,817
Answer him!

420
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,404
Yes, Father Kim?

421
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,908
Hey, Songsak Thekaratta… Darn it.

422
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,285
Songsak, where are you?

423
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,412
How've you been?

424
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,830
Very well.

425
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:44,084
The world may think of me as useless
and feel they don't need me,

426
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,503
but that didn't stop me from doing well.

427
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,171
I need you.

428
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,549
Do you, by any chance,

429
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,551
know how to speak Lao?

430
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,512
Of course. My mom is Laotian.

431
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,180
Oh, is she?

432
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,892
Are you with Yohan right now?

433
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,602
Yes.

434
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,563
Put me on speaker.

435
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,772
One second.

436
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,986
I'm right here.

437
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,154
I need you guys to do something.

438
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,490

445
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,391

We'll make it…

458
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,571
Songsak!

459
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,616
Wake up! We have to go to Busan! Oh, no.

460
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,376
Yohan.

461
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,962

462
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,923
- Thank God.
- You pig.

463
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,424
What the hell did you eat?

464
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,718
Let's get going.

465
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,390

466
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,058
-Father Kim Haeil.
-Yes.

467
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,893
Oh, there you are.

468
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,019
Oh.

469
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,816
I'm not sure I can look past
your behavior last night.

470
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,194
I understand
that you were trying to be friendly

471
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,405
and break the tension between us.

472
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,572
Even so,

473
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,117
don't you think
"Oh, you're so polite" is a bit much?

474
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,369
-I mean--
-Look, there's a cow.

475
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,162
What? A cow?

476
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,706
How can there be a cow here?

477
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,332
Was there a barn nearby?

478
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,418
Where is it?

479
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,002
Why would there be a cow here?

480
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:35,422
I'm joking, that was udder nonsense.

481
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,299
-You fell for such udder nonsense!
-Look at them.

482
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,052
They're looking at the bright sun

483
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,930
and praising our Lord.

484
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,515

- That looks good.
- I'm so excited.

493
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,704
I wonder how many people will audition.

494
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,081

- Thank you for helping out.
- Thank you.

00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,839
Have a seat.

498
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,134
Now that we've put up the posters,

499
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,304
-I'm sure a lot of people will audition.
-Thank you.

500
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,513
Just you wait.

501
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm sure
passionate hidden talents will appear.

502
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,268
- Mm.
- To be honest,

503
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:34,731
I took on big roles, like Kim Jungbae,
back in the day.

504
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,815
Goodness.

505
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,818
People these days don't know
who Kim Jungbae is.

506
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,070
I know him.

507
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,364
- The character in the old drama…
- Yes.

508
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,325
- …called Lee Suil and Sim Sunae.
- That's right.

509
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,744
- I know him too.
- Oh my.

510
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,917
Did you like the diamond ring

511
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,543
from Kim Jungbae that much?

512
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,674
My goodness.

513
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,636
-You went a bit overboard.
-That was great.

514
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,179
Excuse me.

515
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,808
Can I sign up to audition?

516
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:12,352
Of course.

517
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,229
Do you attend Uma Church?

518
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,438
Well,

519
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,982
I do have a baptismal name,
but I'm a lapsed Catholic.

520
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,818
That's okay.

521
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,654
You just have to go to confession,
and then sign up.

522
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:23,947
That's right.

523
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,657
Okay, I will!

524
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,285

00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,836

526
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,019
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

527
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,104
Amen.

528
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,230
Dear Lord,

529
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,942
bless us and this food
that you have graciously given us.

530
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,486

00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,033

533
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,994
You can't disturb the Great Silence.

534
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,288
I'm sorry, it was urgent.

535
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,372
What is it?

536
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,793
I went to Ms. Song's place yesterday,

537
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,253
and she seemed unwell.

538
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,674
You have a fever.

539
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,010
She had a fever and was coughing a lot.

540
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,095
She's always had a bad lung.

541
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,097
Did her condition worsen?

542
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,141
That's what it seemed like.

543
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,020
Then take her to the hospital later.

544
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,438
Okay.

545
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,315
Oh, and also,

546
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,442
she smelled strange.

547
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,861
She smelled strange? What do you mean?

548
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,279
How do I put this?

549
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,198
It was like a strong super glue spell.

550
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,492
Kind of like chemicals.

551
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,703
Go to the district office

552
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,748
and ask about the snack factory
after the hospital.

553
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,001
Okay, I'll go to the district office
and the police station.

554
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,962
-Don't go overboard and cause trouble.
-Okay.

555
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,798
By the way,
why are you so busy at night?

556
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,508
You never answer my calls.

557
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,718
I'm not busy.

558
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,094
But you're never in your room.

559
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,638
Oh, I just wasn't in my room.

560
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,764
Then where were you?

561
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,058
In your heart.

562
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,769
Enjoy your meal.

563
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,566
Was that a corny line?

564
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,944
-Enjoy your food.
-Thank you.

565
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,787
Hey, granny. You look happy.

566
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,372
- I am.
- Hey, let's go.

567
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,082
How great is it to smile?

568
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,292
Why is she so happy?

569
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,963
Hurry up and get in.

570
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,721
Is she okay?

571
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,309
So it was true.

572
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,353
"Name: Kim Haeil"

573
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,605
A priest of the Catholic Diocese of Seoul.

574
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,190
"Name: Gu Daeyoung"

575
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,275
Leader of Gudam Police Station's
Violent Crimes Team?

576
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,861
I see.

577
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,281
They must be looking into
the Gudam middle schooler case.

578
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:17,036
But how do they know the female detective?

579
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,123
Maybe they got to know each other
during their investigations

580
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,582
and then decided to team up.

581
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,334
It seems like they lied

582
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,503
about Detective Gu's gambling debt
to get her off the wanted list.

583
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:28,381
This priest is quite meddlesome, isn't he?

584
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,676
He should just stay at the church
and receive offerings.

585
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,302
By the way,

586
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,346
everything's been taken care of
at Dohan Police Station.

587
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,974
They've sent over all the records,

588
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:41,894
left everything in our hands,
and dissolved the special task force.

589
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,271
As they should.

590
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,232
I kissed up to that old man like no other.

591
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,985
Come in.

592
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,741
What is it?

593
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,702
It's part of my daily routine
to greet my superior.

594
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,288
You can take that out of your routine.
Get to work.

595
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,291
If you don't mind it too much,
I'd like to maintain my routine.

596
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,133
She's like a city slicker,

597
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,551
but she has manners.

598
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,389
You know…

599
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,726
I thought it'd be done
in a matter of seconds like in the movies.

600
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,022
I swear
those spy movies are never accurate.

601
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,233
There are tens of thousands of faces
in that system.

602
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,195
Let's get some work done while we wait.

603
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,571
All right.

604
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,074
Let's go bully the villains.

605
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,952
You realize you sound and look
more like a villain right now, right?

606
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,246
-Hey!
-Who and how, exactly?

607
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:46,918
What do people in martial arts movies do
to hold their opponents down?

608
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,002
- Play freeze tag?
- Hey!

609
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,170
Obviously not that.

610
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,130
-I wasn't sleeping.
-Jeez, you startled me.

611
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,550
They do so
by going for the pressure points.

612
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,344
No way.

613
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,640
Just like this.

614
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,602
By pressure points…

615
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,979
Nam Duhun's underlings.

616
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,649
Those bastards!

617
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,859
Can you release me, please?

618
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,319
I didn't get that. What did you say?

619
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,904
Can you release me, please?

620
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,240
Should I release him and let him talk?

621
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,158
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

622
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,202
You'll behave, right?

623
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,578
You'll listen to me, right?

624
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:24,080
Are you done with the dirty life?

625
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,832
This is great.

626
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,292
Breathe.

627
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,627
Breathe in, breathe out.

628
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,087
Breathe in, breathe out.

629
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,883
We're in luck.

630
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,803
I've done some digging
and gathered information on those guys.

631
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:46,269
Why didn't you get rid of the priest
if you knew?

632
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,980
Those guys aren't easy opponents.

633
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,566
Well, that applies to you too.

634
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,859
I'm just pumped.

635
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,611
It's been a while
since I met such a strong opponent.

636
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,405
Jeez.

637
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,157
You're a true fighter, aren't you?

638
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,450
Good luck to you then.

639
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,535
But listen.

640
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,204
Don't get too pumped up.

641
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,999
If those guys give me a hard time,

642
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,208
I'll get rid of him.

643
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,668
All right.

644
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,420
I have work to get done. Bye.

645
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,759
He's watched far too many movies.

646
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,527
Wow.

647
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,114
The seniors have still got it.
They've done a lot.

648
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,866
I made sure they shot their bolt

649
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,535
and used up all their energy
before taking their last breath.

650
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,788
You're an asshole, aren't you?

651
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,123
Sorry?

652
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,210
Are these boys ready to cross the waters?

653
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,962
There are boys in the water?

654
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,049
Oh, overseas shipping.

655
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,508
Yes, they're ready.

656
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,064
Those guys always collect money
twice a day.

657
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,483
They take money from dealers

658
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,402
and take cuts from other petty smugglers.

659
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,989
How diligent and dirty of them.

660
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,574
What are they, beggars?

661
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,620
Diligent devils
follow their routines religiously.

662
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,704
Oh.

663
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,581
Then I must be an absolute angel.

664
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,125
I don't follow any routine.

665
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,712
You're just a lazy bum.

666
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,464
There they are.

667
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:49,976
Let's go.

668
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,311
"R Group heir and celebrity
hit-and-run case"

669
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,980
Here, take this.

670
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:57,775
By the way,
am I the only other prosecutor here?

671
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,152
It's small and shabby here,
so it's just been me.

672
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,114
No one voluntarily comes here
because of how this city is.

673
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,074
I like it this way.

674
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,327
Why?

675
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,246
Because you can score big alone?

676
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,789
That's not it.

677
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,375
Because I can serve you
without worrying about others.

678
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,753
Are you insulting me or do you mean that?

679
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,380
Insulting you?

680
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,840
I've been known

681
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,883
for serving my superiors well
since I became a prosecutor.

682
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,344
Well, that's strange.

683
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:28,389
Surely you wouldn't be here
if you really had served them well.

684
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,516
You make a great point.

685
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,686
I have but myself to blame for all this.

686
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,980
There's no need for that.

687
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,567
I can tell right away
that this place is full of drug dealers.

688
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,444
I can take some of the load off of you.

689
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,613
You've never dealt with drug dealers,
have you?

690
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,824
They're absolutely insane.

691
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,703
I haven't…

692
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,664
…but I'm not so sane myself either,
so I can handle it.

693
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,835
I'll make sure those guys

694
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,671
confess to everything,
including their sins from past lives.

695
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,965
Yeah?

696
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,508
All right then.

697
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,428
"Uma-gu karaoke drug possession
and transaction case"

698
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,638
Thank you.

699
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:15,353
You bastards. You're dead meat.

700
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,687
Are you okay?

701
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,731
Oh my.

702
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,066
I'm okay.

703
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,402
What's wrong with you?

704
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,739
Exactly, so just give me two more names.

705
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,617
I'm not asking for all the names, am I?
Just two, that's it.

706
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,244
Then I'll knock a year off your sentence.

707
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,704
I'm telling you, I'm out of names.

708
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,915
I already told you everyone involved.

709
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,666
Get ready!

710
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:43,798
You know what this sound is?

711
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,591
I don't.

712
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,885
It's the sound of an excavator
ready to dig up dirt.

713
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,806
Your father is a principal, right?

714
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,350
How about I dig up
some dirt on him instead?

715
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,685
I'm sure
he's received bribes from parents.

716
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,271
I should request a joint investigation
with the Office of Education.

717
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,941
No, no, not my father.

718
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,652
I'll tell you.
I'll give you one more name.

719
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,114
Goodness me, Father.
Forgive this unfilial child.

720
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,241
He's only giving me one name.

721
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,784
Okay, two names.

722
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,869
I'll give you two names.

723
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,371
Two names, great. Start talking.

724
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,458
Is she possessed?

725
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,711
Is she from a family of shamans?

726
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,843
Hello. How've you been?

727
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,262
Hey, big boss. How's life?

728
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,763
I'm the same.

729
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,266
How's your wife doing?

730
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,768
- She's doing great.
- Ah.

731
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,270
Hey, wanna come to the alumni reunion?

732
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,938
It's this weekend in Cheongdam.

733
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,773
No, I'll pass.

734
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,983
It's not even in Busan.

735
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,235
Fine, do whatever you want.

736
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,905
By any chance,
is Park Kyungsun at your office now?

737
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,157
Yes, that's right.

738
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,285
She looks normal,

739
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,245
but she's quite a crazy one.

740
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,329
Do you know her?

741
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,706
Of course I know her.

742
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,042
Be good to her. She's admirable.

743
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,627
How is she admirable?

744
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,422
Hurry up.

745
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,883
- Move it. The sun's going to set.
- Hurry up.

746
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,759
- Speed it up.
- Okay.

747
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,304
- Stack it up properly.
- Okay.

748
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,513
This is…

749
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:17,099
- Carry two at a time.
- This is quite heavy.

750
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,684
Who are those losers?

751
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,102
They're not drug dealers.

752
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,605
They're just thugs
in the Wharf Roach Gang.

753
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,940
We raided them thinking
they were smuggling in hepanyl,

754
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,775
but it was something else.

755
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,943
What was it, Auntie?

756
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,821
They're busy smuggling in numbing cream.

757
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,281
What for?

758
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,450
More people are getting tattoos
these days,

759
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,327
and apparently,
the ones sold in Korea are expensive.

760
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,829
They're all so diligent for no reason.

761
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,581
They just do everything, don't they?

762
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,250
They've got to make a living somehow.

763
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,338
- I said, carry two at a time.
- Okay, okay.

764
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,589
That little…

765
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,299
What is it? Do you know them?

766
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:54,512
They were taken to the police station
for insulting people with disabilities.

767
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:59,350
There's a line people in my family say
when dealing with bad guys.

768
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,810
Hard measures are needed for insanity.

769
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,106
Wow.

770
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,401
What a resolute family. Mm.

771
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,154
That was a bit frightening.
Goodness gracious.

772
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,950
All right, let's go.

773
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,662
Starting next time,

774
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,455
let's increase the quantity.

775
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,417
People these days are getting tatted
all over their bodies.

776
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,670
It'll be hard to convince the suppliers.

777
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,964
Oh, so they don't need the money now,
do they?

778
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,382
Hey!

779
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,218
You little punks.

780
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,844
Stay right there.

781
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,682
I'll teach you a lesson.

782
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,854
- What's wrong with him?
- What is he doing?

783
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,147
What the heck?

784
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,986
That was so not cool.

785
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,364
All right.

786
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:59,118
You've made enough dirty money,
haven't you?

787
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,328
- Do you go to church?
- No, I don't.

788
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,081
Why do I keep getting involved
with priests these days?

789
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,291
- Isn't that him?
- Who?

790
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:07,001
-At the police station.
-Oh, yeah.

791
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,545
-He cried his eyes out.
-Yeah, that's him.

792
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,590
I was acting, not crying my eyes out.

793
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,092
Anyway, that's numbing cream
in the boxes, right?

794
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,427
Put it on.

795
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,595
So I can beat you up.

796
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,972
What is he saying?

797
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,143
We can't.

798
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,521
There are side effects
to using this cream, so…

799
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,482
I mean… Wait.

800
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,276
Who are you?

801
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,154
You rolled down that pile of sand
like an armadillo.

802
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,617
-You saw that?
-I did.

803
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:42,995
That's not what's important!

804
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,623
Are your brains dead or something?

805
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,458
Can't you differentiate good from bad?

806
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,293
What are you on about?

807
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,670
Who the hell are you?

808
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,465
-Oh, jeez.
-What the heck?

809
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:57,176
- Are you okay?
- Did they burst?

810
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,512
You'd better put it on
even if it has side effects.

811
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,350
There will be quite a few hits
coming your way.

812
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,185
-Okay.
-Okay, thank you.

813
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,436
Hurry up!

814
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:11,190
- What…
- You idiots.

815
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:12,483
What are you, kabuki actors?

816
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,734
You morons.

817
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,860
Hurry up.

818
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,944
What are you waiting for?

819
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,196
Go, kabuki actors!

820
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,337
Wow, I really got the pressure points.

821
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,588
What are you,
a martial artist?

822
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,090
That really works?

823
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,217
All right, detectives, come here.

824
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,094
Wait…

825
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,553
You're the priest, aren't you?

826
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:48,811
- Hurry!
- Open the door!

827
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,229
Holy crap!

828
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,730
- Oh, jeez!
- You scared me!

829
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,191
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

830
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,526
Shall we have some fun?

831
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,364
Now, Auntie!

832
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,957
This works great.

833
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,252
Oh.

834
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,505
Are you…

835
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,259
A-Are you okay?

836
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:22,886
Uma Foods?
It's a snack factory.

837
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,724
What kind of snack factory has no sign
and doesn't produce snacks?

838
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,767
There are only small factories
in this region,

839
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,894
so they don't have fancy signs.

840
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:31,979
Huh.

841
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,314
What about CEO Park Jungman?
What does he do?

842
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,483
It says he's a CEO, so that's what he is.

843
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,902
Come on!
I'm telling you, this place is strange!

844
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,450
All the employees' mugs are strange too.

845
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,035
That doesn't fall within our jurisdiction.

846
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,246
Go consult a physiognomist.

847
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,684
Mr. Yong.

848
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,020
We finally meet.

849
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:16,523
It's an honor to meet you, Chairman Kim.

850
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,984
You have a great sense of style.

851
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,820
I made sure to look good.

852
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,115
Thanks to you, my plants arrived safely.

853
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,036
Well, of course.
I was just doing my job.

854
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,001
I knew it.

855
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,127
-Boss Park!
-Yes, sir.

856
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,213
What is it, sir?

857
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,133
I told you to cut them here,
not this high up.

858
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,468
Right.

859
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,636
I apologize.

860
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:49,473
The guys in charge
mistook centimeters for inches.

861
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,059
Bring me the legs.
Let's stick them back on.

862
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,728
- Thank God we didn't throw them away.
- Go get them.

863
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,814
-Okay.
-That's not going to work.

864
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,192
They're not going to stick.

865
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,028
What are we, in the States?
Why would they measure in inches?

866
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,157
I apologize on their behalf.

867
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,660
It's okay, sir. I'm fine.

868
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,495
- You sure?
- Yes.

869
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,039
All right then.

870
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,418
We'll begin shipping tomorrow,
starting with Hong Kong.

871
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,128
Yes, sir.

872
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,047
We're all prepared.

873
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,174
You just have to pack them up,

874
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,509
and we'll load them onto the ship.

875
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,678
Wait, I feel so bad.

876
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,887
Sorry?

877
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,683
You're the one who bribed
the customs officials in each country.

878
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,809
But I'm benefitting from it.

879
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,229
You don't have to feel bad at all.

880
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,691
I work for you now, don't I?

881
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,526
I'm so grateful.

882
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,779
In return,

883
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,990
-I'll compensate you for your hard work.
-Sorry?

884
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,201
I'll let your son, daughter-in-law,
and grandchild in the States

885
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,370
live with both their legs intact

886
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,372
for the rest of their lives.

887
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,086
Thank you.

888
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,630
Thank you so much.

889
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,465
There's no need to cry.

890
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:06,842
It's only normal for humans
to have two legs.

891
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:11,805
I'm sorry about your legs.

892
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,360
-What does smuggling mean?
-This is crazy.

893
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,279
I don't know, but it must be bad.
Look at them.

894
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:28,739
- Take pictures. Excuse me.
- Hello.

895
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,032
Why did you do that, sir?

896
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,369
What the heck? Where are we?

897
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,706
Oh, wow! What's going on here?

898
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,375
They're detectives who smuggle!

899
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,295
This is just truly unbelievable!

900
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,673
Just how much did they make
from smuggling?

901
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,133
They all look so well.

902
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,343
Excuse me, mister.

903
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,470
-Let's see your right profile.
-You're so handsome.

904
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,847
-Your right side is much better.
-Hey!

905
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,933
Yeah, here, record me.
Record me with them.

906
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,602
- This is crazy.
- You're so good-looking.

907
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,020
Damn it.

908
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,318
Detective!

909
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,111
Untie us.

910
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,446
They're finally here.

911
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,325
It's Dokseong.

912
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,038
I think facial recognition is complete.

913
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,415
Let's see. We have their names,

914
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:24,503
dates of birth, criminal records,
nicknames, and more.

915
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,713
Can you send us a picture of that?

916
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,382
Right now?

917
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,967
Yeah. I'll call you back.

918
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,427
Okay.

919
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:38,684
Jeez, I should be at my restaurant,
not here doing this.

920
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,768
"Nickname: Boss Park
Nickname: Jellyfish"

921
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,562
You see the third guy called Capelin?

922
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:48,360
I felt it when we saw him at Jirimland,
but I feel like I've seen him before.

923
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:49,945
Where?

924
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,655
The thing is…

925
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,283
I don't know.

926
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:58,453
You want me to hypnotize you
so you can remember?

927
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,330
No, don't.

928
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,667
I don't want to remember
my family in my past life.

929
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,751
You know, in the Kremlin.

930
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,753
Were you a bricklayer in your past life?

931
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,838
That's not what I'm saying.

932
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,132
Be quiet, will you? I'm trying to focus.

933
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,051
You'd better remember it by today,
Russian bricklayer.

934
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,721
Or else I'll lock you up
inside the brick walls.

935
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,474
What is he talking about?

936
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,935
Jeez.

937
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,187
Is he referencing
The Three Little Pigs or what?

938
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,148
I swear I've seen him before.

939
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,275
Look me in the eyes!

940
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,404
I'm sure they use burner numbers.

941
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,449
Their addresses are also probably fake,

942
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,034
but let's look into them anyway.

943
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,371
I call Boss Park.

944
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,790
I call Capelin. You can take Jellyfish.
His house is the furthest away.

945
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,376
You're quite sly, you know that?

946
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,461
Uh?

947
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,881
All right, all right, I'll go.

948
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,800
-Wait, Auntie.
-What?

949
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,927
Isn't it uncomfortable for you…

950
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,596
that I'm speaking formally?

951
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:02,267
I thought that was why
you were speaking formally all this time.

952
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,352
No, of course not, Auntie.

953
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,729
How could you think that?

954
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,980
Whatever.

955
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,816
It is uncomfortable,
so just speak casually like before.

956
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:12,360
Oh my.

957
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,363
That is unacceptable in our family.

958
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:16,698
How can I speak casually to my--

959
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,908
Speak casually.

960
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,367
Do as I say.

961
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,414
In that case, I'll just call you "auntie"

962
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,999
but talk to you casually.

963
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,793
-Okay, Auntie?
-Suit yourself.

964
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,004
See you later, Auntie.

965
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,256
I love you!

966
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,017
Stand straight.

967
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,727
Bow.

968
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:47,521
Hello, sir.

969
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:50,273
Hey. Nice to meet you all.

970
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,733
This is great.

971
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,902
You guys are young and handsome.

972
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:58,031
Look at your hair color.
Red, yellow, and white in between.

973
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,326
Are you the thugs in your neighborhood?

974
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,828
Yes, sir.

975
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,913
Louder. Are you?

976
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,415
- Yes, sir!
- I see. Nice to meet you.

977
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,585
Why do you think such a gobble…

978
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,380
I mean, such a global person as myself

979
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,549
has gathered
you lowly individuals here today?

980
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,384
To make a petty gang?

981
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,593
No.

982
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:22,180
I need young business partners
for my new business.

983
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,392
You only live once, so don't you want
to live a cool and fancy life?

984
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:26,476
Yes, sir.

985
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,602
Don't you?

986
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:28,812
We do!

987
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,565
Busan is known for baseball!
Do you like baseball?

988
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,691
Yes, sir!

989
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,152
We will refer to you as ball boys
from now on.

990
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,696
If you do well as ball boys,
you'll eventually make the team.

991
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,073
And if you do well on the team,
you'll become a key player.

992
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,784
And if you become a key player,
you'll eventually become the manager.

993
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,411
If you do well as the manager…

994
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,956
you'll be able to work directly
with the owner of the team.

995
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:52,127
As long as you do as we say,
we guarantee that in three years,

996
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,547
you'll each have
a building under your name.

997
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,924
-That's sick, man.
-A building?

998
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,009
However,

999
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:03,054
if you ever speak of our business
to anyone,

1000
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,140
you'll become one with the building.

1001
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,642
Yellow, you'll be somewhere
on the fourth or fifth floor.

1002
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,478
Red, you'll be somewhere
between the fifth and sixth floors.

1003
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,148
Say hi to your neighbor, punks.

1004
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,860
-Hello!
-Nice to meet you. I hope we get along.

1005
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,987
Enough! Stop it!
I was just kidding.

1006
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,072
Why did you dye your hair?

1007
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,282
What are you looking at?

1008
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,408
I'm sorry, sir.

1009
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,576
All right!

1010
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,828
So what is your job, you ask?

1011
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,914
You just have to beautifully pack
the product in front of you.

1012
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,415
How?

1013
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:31,875
With all your heart.

1014
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,959
Understand?

1015
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:34,461
U-Understand.

1016
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,670
Louder.

1017
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,755
Understand?

1018
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,881
Understand!

1019
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,133
Okay! Ready, start!

1020
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,384
Watch them, Capefish.

1021
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,011
"Capefish"?

1022
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:45,639
Short for Capelin and Jellyfish, morons.

1023
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,350
Go pack with them. Go join them.

1024
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,185
- Why are you standing here? Go.
- Okay.

1025
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,229
- Hurry.
- You got a hand tremor?

1026
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,439
No, sir.

1027
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:56,691
Just do this if you can't find a knife.

1028
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,401
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Let's see…

1029
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,946
I see how it is.

1030
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,448
Oh, this is… I see.

1031
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,992
I was wondering why things were quiet.

1032
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,953
Why are you making a fuss over this?

1033
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,496
I'm telling you, it's strange.

1034
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,039
What kind of factory has no sign?

1035
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,832
Plus, these thugs
were guarding the entrance.

1036
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,042
Look!

1037
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,294
We looked into it,

1038
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,546
and this place is operating legally.

1039
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,758
- Did you look into it thoroughly?
- Come on.

1040
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,802
We wouldn't have done it half-heartedly.

1041
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,846
All the workers are seniors.
They could be abusing them.

1042
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,516
There were no signs of abuse.

1043
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,811
Stop making things up.

1044
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:37,857
Where did I see him?

1045
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,151
"Lonely Restaurant"

1046
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,903
Why can't I remember?

1047
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,198
Come on, come on, come on!

1048
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,825
Please!

1049
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,121
Sir!

1050
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,707
How could you fart when we're eating?
Man, it stinks.

1051
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,293
Jeez, that's disgusting.

1052
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,460
That really stinks.

1053
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,004
I'm sorry.

1054
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,463
Please continue eating.

1055
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,134
- Jeez.
- Come on, you idiot.

1056
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,593
You goldfish.

1057
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,929
Come on, search your memories.

1058
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,307
- You have to hit yourself harder.
- Come on, come on.

1059
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,812
I remember.

1060
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:21,276
Congratulations on passing
the Korean Food Craftsman exam!

1061
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:30,827
Nothing, right?

1062
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:32,412
It was at the peak of the mountain,

1063
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,914
and it was completely abandoned.

1064
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,916
-What about you?
-I've got nothing too.

1065
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:41,338
It's a sock factory
that has nothing to do with Capelin.

1066
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,591
Boss Park's address was the closest one.
Where's Father Kim?

1067
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,516
We got nothing.

1068
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,435
What about you?

1069
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:57,729
Did you get into a fight?

1070
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:06,279
You did volunteer work
and delivered 1,000 briquettes?

1071
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,117
He says he's sorry for yelling at you.

1072
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,036
That's okay.

1073
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,205
I've become used to it now.

1074
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,540
Wow, 1,000 briquettes.

1075
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,460
Then again, it's not like
you could refuse with that outfit on.

1076
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,588
Your face is the same color
as your clothes.

1077
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,881
How dare you!

1078
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,134
Stop it.
My stomach's going to burst.

1079
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,096
Stop it.

1080
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,896
I mean… hello?

1081
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,482
I finally remembered where I saw Capelin.

1082
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,901
Where?

1083
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,069
Cooking class.

1084
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,113
He attended the same cooking class as me.

1085
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,280
A cooking class?

1086
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,367
Yes.
I even checked with the academy.

1087
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,120
Apparently, he still goes every night.

1088
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,579
Mm.

1089
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:57,664
Where's the location?

1090
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:59,666
You've got to be kidding me.

1091
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:03,503
Must I do everything for you?
You should do some work too.

1092
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,797
You want me to feed you and bathe you too?

1093
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,008
What are you going to do without me?

1094
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,637
Excessive boasting won't get you anything
but a good beating.

1095
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,347
It's best you don't provoke me today.

1096
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,225
It's 512, Namil-dong, Jangdong-gu.

1097
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,310
Joeun Cooking Academy.

1098
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:23,440
"Prosecutors' oath"

1099
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:25,150
Did you know?

1100
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,777
I heard Chief Prosecutor Park

1101
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,866
is looking into you to take you down.

1102
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,161
This bastard.

1103
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,246
"It seems necessary to investigate

1104
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,790
Departmental Chief Prosecutor Nam Duhun
for this corruption."

1105
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,460
What am I going to do with him?

1106
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,629
He's one tenacious man, isn't he?

1107
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,009
Come in.

1108
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,846
-You wanted to see me, sir?
-Prosecutor Park.

1109
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,433
You managed to track down
17 druggies in just one day.

1110
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:01,144
It's no big deal.

1111
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,606
You've been working hard since you came,

1112
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,150
so I thought I'd throw you
a belated welcome party.

1113
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,652
But something urgent came up,
so why don't we do it tomorrow?

1114
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,946
I thought
everything was self-service here.

1115
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,199
It is, as in I'll throw it myself.

1116
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,243
Thank you, sir. Goodbye.

1117
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:23,082
Nice! He's slowly warming up to me.

1118
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,251
What should I eat?

1119
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,086
Hagfish?

1120
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:28,880
Raw fish?

1121
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,011
Why does he always drink
strawberry smoothies?

1122
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,685
Mmm.

1123
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,063
It's screaming diabetes.

1124
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,190
Mmm.

1125
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,274
Good for him.

1126
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:50,735
Hagfish.

1127
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,903
Raw fish.

1128
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,655
Octopus.

1129
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,783
-Is your motorcycle at the repair shop?
-I don't know.

1130
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,827
Jeez, my back.

1131
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,747
It's nice here.

1132
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,165
Songsak!

1133
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,583
Yohan!

1134
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,085
Gozaev!

1135
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:10,004
Gozaev!

1136
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:13,049
Oh, goodness.

1137
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,262
It's been so long, Gozaev!

1138
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,596
It's nice to see you!

1139
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,807
I'm not Gozaev anymore.

1140
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,433
I changed my name to Ko Dokseong.

1141
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,936
"Kodok" as in "lonely"?
Wow, what a name!

1142
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,938
Have we always been this close?

1143
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:28,898
Oh, right.

1144
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,526
This bastard's a bad guy.

1145
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:33,278
Yeah, you're a bad guy.

1146
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,780
-Beat him up, Songsak.
-Wait, wait!

1147
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,865
I've changed.

1148
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,701
I'm a law-abiding businessman. I swear.

1149
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,579
-You swear?
-I swear. I swear on my name.

1150
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,871
Which name?

1151
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,665
Ko Dokseong!

1152
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,458
I'm serious, I swear!

1153
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,669
Really?

1154
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,546
Nice to see you then!

1155
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:17,071
Ask about the snack factory.

1156
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,865
Don't go overboard and cause trouble.

1157
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:41,304
What kind of drug dealer learns to cook?

1158
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,807
He said he's going to open a restaurant
after retiring.

1159
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,644
A drug dealer may be able to retire,
but a devil can't.

1160
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,770
Don't be ridiculous.

1161
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,772
Mr. Ko got his license in a year.

1162
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,273
Why is he still attending?

1163
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:55,360
I know. On top of that,
he goes every single night.

1164
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,820
He's probably horrible at cooking.

1165
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,280
Wait a second.

1166
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,367
Oh, it's Dokseong.

1167
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,163
- What is it?
- What? What? What?

1168
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,165
That's why he's been going all this time?

1169
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,042
"He has a huge crush
on the cooking instructor!"

1170
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,543
That's so terrifying.

1171
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,047
I guess that's the power of love.

1172
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,507
He's in love with the instructor?

1173
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,968
The Lord is sure a jokester.

1174
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,054
How can he allow a devil to love?

1175
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,807
Will he even come
considering what happened yesterday?

1176
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,558
I guarantee you he will.

1177
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,603
Love is the compass of the heart.

1178
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,564
It only points in one direction.

1179
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,653
I think the anger in these branches
is heading in your direction.

1180
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,866
Look, over there!
It's Capelin with a bouquet.

1181
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,368
-Oh!
-He's here.

1182
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,038
I told you.

1183
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,165
Love is the compass of the heart.

1184
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,542
We got him.

1185
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:56,129
It seems like he's going to confess today.

1186
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:58,506
I bet 10,000 won on him getting rejected.

1187
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,508
I'll take that bet

1188
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,136
and throw in another 10,000 won
that she'll chuck the gift and bouquet.

1189
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,930
I'll take both your bets

1190
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,974
and throw in another 10,000 won
for a slap in the face.

1191
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:13,938
Jeez, it feels strange for two men
to eat at a place like this.

1192
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:17,608
We should come to a nice place like this
every once in a while.

1193
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,360
You're right.

1194
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,320
Let's stuff ourselves
with expensive food tonight.

1195
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,031
Why did you want to see me?
I doubt it's because you wanted to eat.

1196
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,325
Hear me out.

1197
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:31,456
There's a man named Park,
and he's a chief prosecutor.

1198
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,000
Apparently, he's trying to take me down.

1199
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,086
I guess you got caught.

1200
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,212
Money can't help you?

1201
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,674
It's those who try to solve things
with money who end up getting screwed.

1202
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,301
He's one tenacious man.

1203
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,887
He used to be
in the Drug Investigation Division

1204
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,513
in the Central Investigation Department.

1205
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,767
He's so tenacious
that his nickname is the skewer.

1206
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,602
Who knew such a person existed in Korea?

1207
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:55,271
He said he was going to take me down

1208
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,940
and declare war on all drugs in Busan.

1209
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,735
He's watched too many movies.

1210
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:04,197
They always say crap like that.

1211
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,532
Not a single person
who declared war on drugs

1212
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,867
lived to see another day.

1213
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,620
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

1214
01:03:10,703 --> 01:03:15,458
This man needs to know
the obvious outcome of this war.

1215
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,420
Then why don't we show him?

1216
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,632
All right.

1217
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,224
This is very pretty. It's a shame
that we're the only ones here.

1218
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,560
Hang on a second.

1219
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,980
There's someone who'd gladly join us.
Want me to call them?

1220
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,619
This seat…

1221
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,039
is better than my bed.

1222
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,916
I should just sleep here tonight.

1223
01:03:59,126 --> 01:04:01,003
Prosecutor Nam Duhun

1224
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,173
Yes, sir.

1225
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,383
Hey.

1226
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,134
Why don't we have the party tonight?

1227
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,219
I'll send you the address.

1228
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,554
Yeah.

1229
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:11,597
I'm with a special guest as well.

1230
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,141
Okay. What's the address?

1231
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,730
Don't slack off.

1232
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:25,152
Come on.
What are you doing?

1233
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,821
You want to get fired?

1234
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,865
No.

1235
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:32,827
I'll hold in my cough and do my…

1236
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,003
Oh, no.

1237
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,838
Stop the act.

1238
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:47,550
Granny.

1239
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:50,428
Granny.

1240
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,306
Damn it.

1241
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:54,724
Hey…

1242
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,579
Hurry up, will you?

1243
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,290
- The ball boys are waiting!
- Hurry up.

1244
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,416
- Hey.
- Hurry!

1245
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:22,376
- Speed it up.
- You going to keep talking?

1246
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,754
Where the hell is Capelin?

1247
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:25,838
Hurry!

1248
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:28,257
Be careful.

1249
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,551
- Be careful!
- Or else you'll pay for it!

1250
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,221
- Come on.
- Stack it on top.

1251
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,684
- Be careful with that.
- Drop it and you're dead.

1252
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,625
- I was here last time!
- Stay still!

1253
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,794
- I'm here to deliver something!
- That's enough!

1254
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,131
I don't know where the Gyodam three-way…

1255
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,571
"Rejection, rejection, rejection"

1256
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,031
Wait, wait.

1257
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:36,117
You don't have to do this. Oh, jeez.

1258
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,746
- Hmm…
- You know what?

1259
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,374
I still love you so much.

1260
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,710
He shouldn't have said that.

1261
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,379
Are you crazy?

1262
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,553
- I thought we had a connection.
- I'll be taking these.

1263
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,179
Wait.

1264
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,265
- Hear me out.
- Go away!

1265
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:03,352
I'm going to come again tomorrow
and the day after tomorrow.

1266
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,479
-I'm going to come every day!
-Get lost!

1267
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:08,899
Wait…

1268
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:10,484
She must really hate his guts

1269
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,069
to slap him in the face.

1270
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,990
What in the world did he say to her?

1271
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:17,783
I feel bad.

1272
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:19,869
Yes, sir.

1273
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:22,079
I'm not crying.

1274
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,331
Oh, I forgot. I'm on my way.

1275
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:27,001
- Damn it.
- Oh! He's leaving.

1276
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,003
Shall we tail him?

1277
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:41,724
I love you. I love you.

1278
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:42,808
Jeez.

1279
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:47,855
Was "I love you" the issue or what?
What went wrong?

1280
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:49,648
Be careful.

1281
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,984
Are the windows tinted?

1282
01:07:52,526 --> 01:07:53,944
They're not.

1283
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,865
Why can't I stop crying? Damn it.

1284
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,869
Now my nose is runny.

1285
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,050
-Oh, you're here. Have a seat.
-Yes.

1286
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:18,928
I thought you said you were with someone.

1287
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,763
He went to the bathroom.

1288
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,266
He's a businessman.
You should get to know him.

1289
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,813
I knew it.
Of course there's someone behind you.

1290
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:30,648
Thank you.

1291
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:32,399
But sir,

1292
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:35,986
I thought you weren't too fond of me.

1293
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:40,491
I heard you took the fall for a bribe
instead of your superior.

1294
01:08:40,574 --> 01:08:43,494
Did you do a background check on me?

1295
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,079
Background check?

1296
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,414
Rumors spread faster than light.

1297
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,668
He was my superior, so I have no regrets.

1298
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,170
And I can always work my way
back to Seoul.

1299
01:08:55,172 --> 01:08:56,257
Would you…

1300
01:08:57,007 --> 01:08:58,509
do that for me?

1301
01:08:58,592 --> 01:08:59,760
Excuse me?

1302
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,304
Come on, tell me.

1303
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:06,433
What if I guaranteed you
a bright and luxurious future?

1304
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,436
In that case…

1305
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,064
I'll never forget your generosity.

1306
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,775
I knew you were different.

1307
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,277
You mean that?

1308
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:17,987
That's great.

1309
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,697
"A gratitude so deep,
it's etched into the bones"

1310
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,036
I knew someone was bound to die
but not this soon.

1311
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,621
Send her to the crematorium.

1312
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:28,706
Yes, sir.

1313
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,001
Apparently, she has a family member,

1314
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:33,335
so they sent her home first.

1315
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,628
Will things be okay?

1316
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:35,921
Don't worry, sir.

1317
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,049
The Uma Police and district office guys
will take care of it.

1318
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,134
Sir,

1319
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,219
it's me, Boss Park of the Yongsa Gang.

1320
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:44,388
Have the ball boys wrap up their work.

1321
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:45,598
Yes, sir.

1322
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,558
I'll take care of it, sir.

1323
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:52,354
This bastard doesn't do anything.

1324
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,815
What the hell does he really do?
Damn, I'm jealous.

1325
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,403
Darn it,
I should've washed my hair.

1326
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:00,738
It's already getting oily.

1327
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,591
Hey, Kim.

1328
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:06,720
Yes, Prosecutor Nam.

1329
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,392
- Who is she?
- Ah…

1330
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:15,062
This is Prosecutor Park Kyungsun.
She recently started working for me.

1331
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,399
Hello, I'm Prosecutor Park Kyungsun.

1332
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:22,778
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Hongsik.

1333
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,365
Hold on.

1334
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,951
What's with the intense look in his eyes?

1335
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:32,997
Shall we eat?

1336
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:47,928
- Carry her.
- Here.

1337
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,013
All right.

1338
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:50,973
-Give me her arm.
-Hurry up.

1339
01:11:51,056 --> 01:11:53,225
-Okay, I got her.
-Go, go.

1340
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,977
Where's the key? Get the key.

1341
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,103
Hurry up.

1342
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:01,400
Be quiet!

1343
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,864
Where should I put her? Where?

1344
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:09,116
-Right here.
-Dude, get the blanket.

1345
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,200
One second.

1346
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,037
- She's really heavy.
- Oh, come on.

1347
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,205
No one sleeps without a pillow.
Get her pillow.

1348
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,207
-Right.
-Hurry, come on.

1349
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:18,500
-Put her down.
-Put her down.

1350
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,338
You idiots.

1351
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,131
Her head should be on the pillow.

1352
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:25,674
Here.

1353
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:29,219
Not over her face.
Make it look like she died while sleeping.

1354
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,221
Jeez, you morons.

1355
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:33,015
Let's go.

1356
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,859
Wait, that… That…

1357
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,153
So that's all kasanin, right?

1358
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:47,654
All of that?

1359
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,573
That's all going to be distributed
in Busan?

1360
01:12:49,656 --> 01:12:51,492
This is outrageous.

1361
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,786
No drug ring can produce
that amount of drugs.

1362
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,830
The Laotian drug cartel must be in on it.

1363
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:58,207
It's gone to a whole new scale.

1364
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,417
But none of these places
seem to store drugs.

1365
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,710
I think they're packing it up here

1366
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:02,795
before shipping them.

1367
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,713
They disguised the place
and covered up the smell.

1368
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,424
In that case, we should go in
and offer some kind words.

1369
01:13:08,425 --> 01:13:09,510
What kind words?

1370
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:10,928
To wish them success.

1371
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:13,097
Just kidding.
To wish them failure, of course.

1372
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,646
Let's go ruin their opening day.

1373
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:32,449
The heads of these anchovies
smell nasty. Smell it.

1374
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,700
Get it away from me.

1375
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:35,953
My head is ringing because of the smell.

1376
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:37,579
Hey.

1377
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,456
Nasty?

1378
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,166
That's the smell of money right there.

1379
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:44,837
It smells wonderful.

1380
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:51,593
Do we have more guys coming?

1381
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:53,137
No.

1382
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,311
Sirs.

1383
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,814
- Cover me. Don't move.
- Who are you?

1384
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:07,985
Bingo!

1385
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,908
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1386
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,367
Who does Boss Park work for?

1387
01:14:58,285 --> 01:14:59,703
The temporary priest
knows how to play smart.

1388
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:00,996
The rest of you, come here.

1389
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:03,123
We can't just let the priest be.

1390
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:04,208
Ms. Song.

1391
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,251
There was
a strong gasoline smell coming from her.

1392
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,128
Elderly people often have foam
around their mouths.

1393
01:15:08,212 --> 01:15:09,713
What the hell are you talking about?

1394
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:10,797
What the hell is this?

1395
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:13,217
Is someone else other than us
looking into them as well?

1396
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,011
Since I received a gift,
it's only right I return the favor.

1397
01:15:16,094 --> 01:15:18,639
You have to show them
your hidden power.

1398
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:21,517
You can think of me
as a budget superhero.

1399
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,101
Operation Doppelgänger.

1400
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:24,811
I'm in.

1401
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:25,938
We'll initiate the plan tonight.

1402
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,981
Set the bait as fast as you can.

1403
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:29,566
Go!

1404
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,448
