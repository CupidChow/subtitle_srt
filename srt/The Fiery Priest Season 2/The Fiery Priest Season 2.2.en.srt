00:00:01,543 --> 00:00:03,253
The Fiery Priest Season 2

2
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,582
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:41,875
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed under supervision

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:42,959
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,921
Episode 2
When In Busan

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,648
Goodness, there he is.

9
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,400
-I guess he didn't know either.
-Detective Gu.

10
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,861
- Detective Gu.
- What's going on?

11
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,822
Read this.

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,160
I'm sorry to leave like this,

13
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,662
but I'll take care of this by myself.

14
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,040
It's too dangerous for you to join me.

15
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:26,044
But I need to deal with this
for the sake of Sangyeon.

16
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,798
Sangyeon once told me

17
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,591
why he believes in God.

18
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,677
He said he doesn't know
if God truly exists,

19
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,973
but he believes He must,
with all the evil in the world.

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,226
That's why he believes in Him.

21
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:47,148
So I need to teach the devils
who did this to Sangyeon a lesson

22
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,861
that God does exist
somewhere in the world.

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,907
This is my duty as a bellator.

24
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,164
Don't worry about me.

25
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,750
As always,

26
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,044
everything will be okay.

27
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,421
Please don't follow me.

28
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,299
Especially Detective Gu.
Don't you dare follow me.

29
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,759
Take care of Gudam-gu.

30
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,347
Jeez, Kim Haeil!

31
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,560
I get that you're angry,
but why would you crumple up his letter?

32
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,644
"Angry Father"

33
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,230
Forget it. He turned off his phone.

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,859
He's going off the grid again!

35
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,987
He said it was his duty as a bellator,
so he'll likely report to the Roman Curia.

36
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,615
That means he's going to see it through.

37
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,117
What do we do?

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,121
I'm his number-one comes, his companion.

39
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,957
I'll dig through Busan
and find out where he is.

40
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,625
Just you wait.

41
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,380
Father Kim!

42
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,887
Goodness me.

43
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,848
What are you,
a Southeast Asian casino boss?

44
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,766
You haven't changed at all.

45
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,560
It must've been a long journey.

46
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,020
You must be tired.

47
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,147
What's with your accent?

48
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,566
You see,

49
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,401
Busan is my second hometown.

50
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,153
It's only right
that I use the dialect here.

51
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,031
Would you like some Busan fish cake?

52
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,574
No, thanks.

53
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,951
Given how good you look,
you must be bringing in a lot of money.

54
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,119
Are you up to something shady?

55
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,829
Come on, Father Kim.

56
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,791
I'm not the old Gozaev anymore.

57
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,001
I've been naturalized,

58
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,629
and my Korean name is Ko Dokseong.

59
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,881
I'm a businessman
who owns three restaurants.

60
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,883
And are you loansharking
with all that money?

61
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,636
I like to call it "short-term financing."

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,720
That's the same thing.

63
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,389
Enough about business.

64
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,808
Get in.
I'll take you to a good restaurant.

65
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,062
You know what to do
if Detective Gu calls, right?

66
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,898
Yes. We cut each other off a while ago.

67
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,317
I don't ever want
to get mixed up with him.

68
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,152
Looks like you mean it.

69
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,798
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

70
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,474
What's your name?

71
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,518
It's Fire Eel, sir.

72
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,854
You look more like a pufferfish.

73
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:33,731
What about you?

74
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,899
Rockfish, sir.

75
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,194
Jellyfish, sir.

76
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,029
Capelin, sir.

77
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,781
- Monkfish, sir.
- Hairtail, sir.

78
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,533
That's enough. Enough.

79
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,451
Are there any humans around here?

80
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,372
Did you guys
break your spine or something?

81
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,416
That's no way to greet someone.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,837
If you're going to greet me,
do it properly.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,464
No wonder you're just
a bunch of drug dealers.

84
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,219
Boss Park.

85
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,304
Hello, sir.

86
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,014
Welcome.

87
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,100
You sick or something?
Why are we having porridge?

88
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,185
This place has great porridge.

89
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,062
You should try it.

90
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,814
I don't like porridge.

91
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,608
All I had was porridge back then
to save up for law school.

92
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,027
Ma'am.

93
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,405
I'd like a bowl of rice
and soybean paste stew.

94
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,907
- Me too.
- Okay.

95
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,039
I apologize for what happened in Seoul.

96
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,124
Forget about it.

97
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,045
I made a huge mistake. Please forgive me.

98
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,422
Have you heard about the guys
who were involved?

99
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,592
Yes, sir. I'm looking into it.

100
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,887
I think another ring in Seoul
might be involved.

101
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,681
Why get cheeky when you can't handle it?

102
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,101
Was it your new boss' order?

103
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,021
No, sir. He doesn't know about it.

104
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,523
Man, you must be really scared of him,

105
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,275
Yongsa Gang Boss Park.

106
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,526
You didn't tell him, huh?

107
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,862
He's on a whole other level.

108
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,115
He's a true warrior, hero, and legend.
The ultimate boss, if you will.

109
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,408
Ultimate boss, my foot.

110
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,744
I don't trust anything
you drug dealers say.

111
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,163
So is your boss coming or what?

112
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,915
He's coming to Korea in a few days.

113
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,376
I'll inform him to visit you
when he arrives.

114
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,130
Drug rings in Seoul, Gyeongsang,
Jeolla, Chungcheong,

115
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,840
and now Southeast Asia.

116
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,968
You guys are all over the place.

117
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,012
That's right, sir.

118
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,931
Sir.

119
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,771
Don't get arrogant. Put it away.

120
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,858
You help us out all the time
but never take any money or drugs.

121
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,568
You're making us feel bad, sir.

122
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,195
Please take it.

123
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,198
You want me to get screwed over
for taking your dirty money?

124
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,577
Just do as I say.

125
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,454
And get off your high horse.

126
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,207
Yes, sir.

127
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,003
-By the way…
-Yes?

128
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,172
…there are celebrities
who come to Busan to do drugs, right?

129
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,133
Yes, from actors to singers.

130
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,260
Even influencers do these days.

131
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,428
Mm.

132
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,138
Then give me a list…

133
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,682
of the well-known ones.

134
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,976
Are you planning to use them soon?

135
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,479
No.

136
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,233
I need a few fall guys
before diving into this risky business.

137
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,236
Are you going diving?

138
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,030
You idiot.

139
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,284
With the endless sea all around,

140
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,453
the mountains stretch out boundlessly.

141
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,209
Who's calling me?

143
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,921
Detective Gu Daeyoung

144
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,089
Look.

145
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,511
- Jeez.
- Don't tell him.

146
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,014
Hello.

147
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,391
Hey.

148
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,143
Haeil. Kim Haeil.

149
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,644
Hail?

150
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,396
Don't tell him.

151
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,024
As in a hailstorm?
No, our sky's pretty clear.

152
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,192
Cut it out.

153
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,651
Do you really not know?

154
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,487
I don't.

155
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,656
It's been a while since I cut him off,
and I don't want anything to do with him.

156
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,617
Happy now?

157
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,747
The only decently bad guy
Father Kim would seek help from is you.

158
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,542
I'm the last person who wants
to get mixed up with him, okay?

159
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,962
I don't like him! I'm just so sick of him!

160
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,965
I'm hanging up.

161
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,592
Hey. Hey!

162
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,348
I can sense his horrible acting.

163
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,311
I think he knows.

164
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,857
You know I don't mean it. I'm just acting.

165
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,818
Gosh, this smoke.

166
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,530
Eat up.

167
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,700
You're really devouring the food.
Did you starve yourself?

168
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,286
Chuck flap tail from Hanwoo cattle
raised by the sea.

169
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,413
It's delicious, isn't it?

170
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,374
Did you look into
the thing I asked you about?

171
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,750
Fire Eel?

172
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,335
I did,

173
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,964
but there are a lot of people in Busan
who go by that nickname.

174
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,842
You'll find something
if you narrow it down to drug rings.

175
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,346
Things are different
in their line of work these days.

176
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,933
They're elusive, invincible, and savage.

177
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,102
So you're saying
you couldn't find Fire Eel.

178
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,311
Come on now.

179
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,940
He wouldn't be a drug dealer
if he were easy to find.

180
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,526
Don't make me repeat myself.
Find him as quickly as you can.

181
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,403
Okay.

182
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,239
Are you leaving? You should eat more.

183
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,991
Mm-mm-mm!

184
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,244
I set up a place for you
with an ocean view.

185
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,829
I'm not here on vacation.

186
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,622
I'm busy. Call me when you find Fire Eel.

187
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,958
Let me drive you then. You've got luggage.

188
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,168
Your driving makes me sick.

189
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,046
Where in the world is he going?

190
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,717
- How much is it?
- 185,000 won.

191
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,968
Put it on the tab.

192
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,557
Busan School of Theology,
Sangyeon's case,

193
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,767
and the hardship I'm enduring.

194
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,523
There must be multiple reasons
as to why the Lord had led me to Busan.

195
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,735
I need to figure them out right here.

196
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,612
Hello.

197
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,577
- Excuse me, may I ask--
- Joseph.

198
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,661
Joseph!

199
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,509
All the sounds you hear right now
including the prayers, hymns,

200
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,887
and even the birds…

201
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,514
are sounds coming from the Lord.

202
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,851
Despite all the beautiful sounds
around you,

203
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,395
you choose to listen to such music?

204
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,897
I'll be taking these for now.

205
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,649
And I want you to submit

206
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,818
a 10-page report on all the sounds
you hear on the school grounds

207
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,695
and a 10-page self-reflection report.

208
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,364
You can go.

209
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,330
Are you Father Michael Kim Haeil?

210
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,040
Oh, yes.

211
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,334
Yes, yes. Nice to meet you.

212
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,086
Do you know where the dean's office is?

213
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,421
I'm the dean.

214
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,476
I'm Lee Ungseok, also known as Dominic.

215
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,270
I'm Kim Haeil, also known as Michael.

216
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,190
"Dean Lee Ungseok"

217
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,402
I'm actually not the one
who recommended and invited you.

218
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,321
The diocesan bishop
strongly recommended you.

219
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,281
Oh, I see.

220
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,742
I heard you were very close

221
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,120
to Father Lee Yeongjun.

222
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,289
He's the one who ordained me.

223
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:51,293
I, too, have great respect for Father Lee.

224
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,507
But there is one thing
that I disagree with him.

225
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,428
I believe the church and the secular world
should remain separate.

226
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,223
Are you saying we shouldn't care about
what's happening out there?

227
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,017
No, we should.

228
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,062
But we should also
always remember our duties.

229
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:15,317
If you choose to follow in his footsteps
while you're here--

230
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,319
I only wish to do one thing here.

231
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,239
Maintain the aspiring priests'
zest and strength.

232
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,867
Zest? Did you say zest?

233
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,785
Yes.

234
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,455
I asked everyone to gather
before the Great Silence

235
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:30,291
as I had someone to introduce you to.

236
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,085
This is Father Michael Kim Haeil…

237
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,672
…your life guidance instructor.

238
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,096
Nice to meet you, everyone.

239
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,599
I'm Father Michael Kim Haeil.

240
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,398
It is our lifestyle and duty

241
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,901
to live by God's commandments.

242
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,905
It is also very important for seminarians

243
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,033
to adhere to the rules and principles.

244
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,286
But you must also know
that faith in these rules and principles…

245
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,458
shouldn't outweigh anger for the world.

246
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,628
Fighting against the cruel world

247
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,255
despite knowing it may anger God…

248
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,801
is also your ultimate duty.

249
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,597
And what do you need
in order to achieve this?

250
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,432
It's…

251
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,228
zest and strength!

252
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,610
Starting tomorrow morning,

253
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,195
we will begin a hellish--

254
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,113
- "Hellish"?
- What?

255
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,407
Ah…

256
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,537
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,163
I forgot where I was.

258
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,501
Starting tomorrow,
we will begin a heavenly training regimen.

259
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,712
Everyone is to join.

260
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,714
There will be no exceptions.

261
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:04,176
A priest must be full of zest and strength
to fight against the world.

262
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,555
With that being said,
I will upload a video on the school forum.

263
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,015
I want you all to watch it and study it.

264
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,688
Forum

265
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,358
Zest overload

266
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,278
Don't be alarmed, everyone!

267
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,948
One, two, three, four! Taekwon!

268
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,783
One, two!

269
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,410
All together now!

270
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,662
-One, two, three!
-What is this?

271
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,915
Four! It's as easy as that!

272
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,923
What's this noise?

273
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,094
Is someone chanting a spell?

274
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,481
Sir.

275
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,525
Ah…

276
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:02,776
Detective No.

277
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,403
Yes?

278
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,322
Why are you trying to hit me?

279
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,448
Me?

280
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,742
Don't hit me. It hurts.

281
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,952
- What are you talking about?
- Stop! Stop!

282
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,914
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

283
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,000
What's more important to you?

284
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,044
- Don't mess--
- Go away!

285
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,677
Where are your ears, mister?

286
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,430
And your nose?

287
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,770
Mmm!

288
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,439
LA has such good soft tofu stew.

289
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,024
It's even better than the ones in Korea.

290
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,317
Mmm!

291
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,194
-Is it good?
-Yeah!

292
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,738
I think you have more to worry about.

293
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,741
Well, I'm hungry, so I have to eat.
Things will work themselves out.

294
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,825
Listen.

295
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,286
There's nothing they can do
back at the office.

296
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,831
You might end up serving your time here.

297
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,249
They can't do anything?

298
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,294
-No.
-Damn it.

299
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,049
What kind of food do they give
in American prisons?

300
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,759
Kyungsun!

301
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,057
Stop eating.

302
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,558
Come with me.

303
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,727
Oh, no. This isn't good.

304
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:22,022
You're really done for now, aren't you?

305
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,149
Stop overreacting, you punk.

306
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,697
Let's go.

307
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,327
Where are they taking me?

308
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:39,373
At this rate,
I might actually serve my time here.

309
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,300
Wow, thanks for coming quickly.

310
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,552
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,554
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

312
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,056
I don't think you would've believed me.

313
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,684
Well, thanks to you guys,

314
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,769
we captured a cartel's head honcho.

315
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,313
I'm truly grateful.

316
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,486
Thanks to you, I was able to complete
my mission as a bellator.

317
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,823
So I really appreciate
your and Father Kim's help.

318
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,241
Don't mention it.

319
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,953
But also,
Father Kim gave us a rough explanation,

320
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,248
but where does the name "bellator"
come from exactly?

321
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,332
Mm.

322
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,710
Bellator, it means "warrior" in Latin.

323
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,503
Hmm…

324
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,757
Since the dawn of the 12th century
in the Catholic nations of Europe,

325
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,051
a chosen few priests were anointed

326
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,845
by the divine hand of the Pope himself.

327
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,806
The priests
were either knights or mercenaries.

328
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,560
Those chosen were granted
the authority to uphold justice to foes

329
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,645
as long as they didn't take any life.

330
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,815
The Vatican referred to this priest
as a "bellator."

331
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,987
They received the Vatican protection
and they were granted spiritual immunity.

332
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,574
The priests have come to exist
on each continent.

333
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,786
Whoa, that's incredible.

334
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,121
Kim Haeil never tells you

335
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,456
anything in detail.

336
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,959
All this time,
they've been concealing

337
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,712
their identity and operating in secret.

338
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,926
So they're kind of like
the Vatican's secret agents, right?

339
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,094
That's right.

340
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,097
Father Kim formally became a bellator
four years ago.

341
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,432
"Bellator Kim Haeil
Comes"

342
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,602
As you know,
the bellator supporters like you

343
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,437
are known as "comes."

344
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:29,066
The beings who protect
the bellator and comes

345
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,776
are known as "fautors."

346
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,113
That's the first I'm hearing of fautor.

347
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,325
Fautor comes to the aid of bellator
and comes when they are in danger.

348
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,161
Like air, fautor exists around us,

349
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,746
but they are barred from sight.

350
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,543
They keep watching
as a silent, unseen guardian.

351
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,503
Hmm…

352
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,049
Fautor.

353
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,009
Hmm.

354
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,192
Excuse me.

355
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,447
Would you like more wine?

356
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,908
Can you give me another tube of gochujang?

357
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,412
Ah, I'm sorry,
we're all out of gochujang, sir.

358
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,998
Come on, I know
you have some stashed in the back.

359
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,418
We're really out, sir,
as a lot of people asked for it.

360
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,087
How could you run out of gochujang?

361
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,673
I'm really sorry.
This isn't a Korean flag carrier,

362
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,425
so we couldn't prepare enough.

363
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,303
I might lose my mind
if I don't get one right now.

364
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,556
You shouldn't lose your mind.

365
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,600
Here, take this.

366
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,059
Oh my. Thank you!

367
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,561
You don't want it?

368
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,439
I have a high blood sugar level,

369
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,065
so I have to avoid spicy and salty foods.

370
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,651
You brought peace to this flight, ma'am.

371
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,112
You must love gochujang.

372
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,531
It's been a while
since I've been to Korea.

373
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,699
Right.

374
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,623
Oh my. What's this?

375
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,874
For the gochujang.

376
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,752
This is so much.

377
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,713
- You remind me of my mom.
- Goodness gracious.

378
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,798
You're a good son, aren't you,
Gochujang Man?

379
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,677
This is basically a free flight for me.

380
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,638
My mom passed away…

381
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,348
because she didn't have
a mere five dollars.

382
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,727
She got her throat slit
like she was some fish.

383
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,858
Ladies and gentlemen,

384
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:39,071
we have begun our descent
into Gimhae airport.

385
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,866
Please restore your tray table and seats
to their original positions…

386
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,802
It is a big deal.
It's multiple sclerosis.

387
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,845
So it's not a terminal illness.

388
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,640
No, but there will be painful symptoms.

389
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,809
I can handle the pain.

390
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,477
It'll get worse if you don't treat it.

391
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,020
So what's the cause?

392
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,605
There are various causes for it…

393
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,400
but you tick a lot of the boxes.

394
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,876
Possibility of virus infection
from abroad,

395
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,587
external trauma to the head, and more.

396
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,798
Worst-case scenario,
you'll be completely paralyzed.

397
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:44,011
And most of all,
you'll be completely prone to infection.

398
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,220
Then you won't be able to do anything--

399
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,346
I got it.

400
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,767
I'll get treatment and take medication.

401
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,020
I won't let it get worse. Good enough?

402
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,104
Haeil.

403
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,565
You really have to live like a priest now.

404
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,483
That's the only way you'll live.

405
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:21,798
I'll begin my duty

406
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,800
as a bellator, Papa.

407
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,926
Lord, why didn't you make my arms longer?

408
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,012
Why do you believe God exists?

409
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,268
I don't know if He truly exists or not.

410
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,312
But…

411
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,107
there are so many devils in the world,

412
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,110
so I'm sure he exists somewhere.

413
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,864
I don't believe in Him
because I can see Him

414
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,491
but because I believe that I can.

415
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,416
Yes?

416
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,126
It's Dean Lee.

417
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,836
Oh, yes, sir.

418
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,964
I need you to go somewhere right now.

419
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,133
Sorry?

420
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,717
Busan Wooma Police Station

421
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,762
There's a student called
Benedict Chae Dou who's in his final year.

422
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,640
He's going to be ordained soon,

423
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,226
but not only does he lack self-control,

424
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,396
but he takes more interest
in the secular world than in formation.

425
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,689
He's a troublemaker.

426
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,774
Father Hong of Wooma Church

427
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,860
used to handle things
when he caused trouble,

428
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,028
as he thinks of him dearly.

429
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:10,407
Starting today, why don't you handle it?

430
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,910
I'd like to ease Father Hong's burden.

431
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,080
And see for yourself

432
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,249
what the consequences
of misguided duties are.

433
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,750
Hit me like you did earlier!

434
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,169
-What, you scared now?
-Yeah!

435
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,837
You scared of the police officers?

436
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,756
-You scared? Just admit that you are.
-Look, officer.

437
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,551
How can a priest hit people?

438
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,262
They're the ones who hit me!

439
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:36,141
Look. My nose bled like a fountain!

440
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,393
-He's putting on a show!
-He's a liar!

441
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,478
- He's lying!
- Hey!

442
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,772
-Be quiet.
-Yes, sir.

443
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,274
Excuse me, Father Chae.

444
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,444
It hasn't even been a month,
and you're back here already.

445
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,906
It has been a month.
It's been a month and five days.

446
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,366
-He's a habitual offender!
-He sure is.

447
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,243
-You shouldn't do that as a priest!
-Yeah!

448
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,953
-Are you a thug or what?
-Are you?

449
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,580
Be quiet, you punks!

450
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:02,042
How can a priest hit people?
Don't you agree, sir?

451
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,793
- I'm the one who got hit!
- Dou…

452
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,213
Dou.

453
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,176
I've committed a grave sin.

454
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,012
Dou.

455
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,014
Oh my, oh my. Are you okay?

456
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,557
I'm so sorry.

457
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,018
I've committed a grave sin.

458
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,687
He's not a bad kid.
I failed to discipline him.

459
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,815
How do you know him?

460
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:30,153
I'm an instructor
at the seminary he goes to.

461
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,365
- I see, I see.
- It's all my fault.

462
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,785
If you could just punish me instead…

463
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,869
Please calm down.

464
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,080
And who exactly are you?

465
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:44,709
Right. I'm Mo Jinsu, the leader
of Criminal Investigation Team 1.

466
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,136
I've committed a grave sin. I'm sorry.

467
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,347
-Yes, yes.
-I'm so sorry. I'm to blame.

468
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,723
If you could punish me instead--

469
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,892
-Wait, one second!
-Yes?

470
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,312
So he's a student, not a priest?

471
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,942
The older priest who usually comes
said he was a priest.

472
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,945
He's a student.
And I failed to discipline him.

473
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,364
-He's a normal student then!
-You liar!

474
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,241
- How old are you?
- I said, be quiet!

475
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,868
I ought to beat you up!

476
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,870
I'm sorry.
Please forgive him.

477
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,247
Please calm down.

478
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,792
Sir, in this case, we'll have to take him
into custody for questioning.

479
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:26,876
Custody!

480
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,337
Oh, no!

481
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:32,215
What am I going to do with you?

482
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,176
Are you okay? Are you okay?

483
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,346
I'm so sorry.

484
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,973
I'm so sorry.

485
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,725
Sir, you should take this call.

486
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,892
Why? Who is it?

487
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,478
It's the cardinal's secretary.

488
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,772
- Cardinal?
- Yes, sir.

489
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,275
Yes, please speak.

490
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,485
C-Cardinal? Is that someone
who works at a carnival?

491
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,195
-Yeah.
-Really?

492
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,864
-Never heard of it.
-It's like a clown.

493
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,073
-Oh, right.
-You're right.

494
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,576
-Right, I remember now.
-I told you so.

495
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,620
I see. But why did they call?

496
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,338
What's this?

497
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,632
Why? Do I look that good?

498
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,426
Excuse me,
since when were you so beautiful?

499
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,595
Oh, gosh, stop it! Come on!

500
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,764
-Actually, keep going.
-Since you were born?

501
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,350
We're meeting someone you know,
so I had to dress up.

502
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,769
Ah.

503
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,438
About that… it's been canceled.

504
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,357
Why?

505
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,652
He has an important guest to meet with,
so he postponed it.

506
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,153
What important guest?

507
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,989
Well, I don't know.

508
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,700
He wanted to see me,
so why is he canceling?

509
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,787
I even got my hair done.

510
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,372
I'm sorry, he's just really busy.

511
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,290
But I'll see him tomorrow,

512
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,584
so I'll make sure to schedule a meeting.

513
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,878
Forget it.
I don't want to see him anymore.

514
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,174
At least give me his name.
Is it confidential or something?

515
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,386
I can't tell you.

516
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:04,683
Forget it if you can't.
You never answer my questions.

517
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,939
Fire Eel. It's Fire Eel.

518
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,023
Fire!

519
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,483
Fire Eel?

520
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,404
You scared me!

521
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,739
It's so good to see you laugh…

522
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,034
-Heidi.
-I told you not to call me that.

523
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,832
Ma'am, four more rolls
of mini gimbap, please.

524
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,042
This is better than drugs.

525
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,337
Jeez, have you ever done drugs before?

526
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,966
Of course.
More than you know actually.

527
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,093
What a joke.

528
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,845
Eat up.

529
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,764
This isn't good.

530
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,850
You're my rival.

531
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,894
Goodness, rival, my foot.

532
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,359
What's with them this time?

533
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,154
Those crazy bastards.

534
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:02,073
Don't be like them.

535
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,451
Sir, sir!

536
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,247
Hello, sir!

537
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,340
Hello, sir!

538
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,969
You should've told us
you were arriving today.

539
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,471
Why?

540
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,264
So you could do something tacky?

541
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,517
We would've prepared
a warm welcome party for--

542
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,440
Don't.

543
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,984
Let's keep it on the down-low.

544
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,402
Yes, sir.

545
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,161
Show him some respect, you punks!

546
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,746
Two, three!

547
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,207
Welcome, sir!

548
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,833
We love you, sir!

549
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,134
Jeez, you're all so cute
that I want to kill you.

550
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,178
Don't you agree, ma'am?

551
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,516
Stand straight.

552
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,021
Wooma Police Station

553
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,232
Thank goodness
Father Han taught me acting.

554
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,818
I guess you never stop learning.

555
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,922
Do you know who I am?

556
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,301
You're Father Michael Kim Haeil.

557
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,886
Aren't you getting ordained soon?

558
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,430
- I am.
- Then tell me!

559
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,893
How dare you pretend to be a priest?
Are you a scammer?

560
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,813
It wasn't my idea.
Father Hong told me to do so.

561
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,690
Did he tell you to go around
faking your identity?

562
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,316
Are you an idiot?

563
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,653
Foolish acts also have consequences.

564
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:07,073
But consider yourself lucky
since this was my first appointment task.

565
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,408
I won't let you off easy next time.

566
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,035
Those guys
made fun of people with disability.

567
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,037
Was I supposed to turn a blind eye?

568
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,749
Even so,

569
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,169
how dare you throw your fists around
wearing a clerical collar?

570
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,505
Don't you even know the basics?

571
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,009
A priest isn't a thug.
You should know how to control your anger!

572
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,020
How will you become a priest
with such little self-control?

573
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,232
Let's go.

574
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,862
Do master's students
also volunteer for the elderly?

575
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,114
They do, but I don't.

576
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,198
Why not?

577
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:53,453
Dean Lee banned me from going
because he's afraid I'll cause trouble.

578
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,207
Unbelievable.

579
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,377
You must be proud to skip out
on what everyone else does.

580
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,006
Stick with me from now on.

581
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,633
Sorry?

582
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,095
Why? You don't want to?

583
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,598
That's not it.

584
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,351
The elderly in this neighborhood
aren't that fond of us.

585
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,229
They say we're all talk
and we don't do much.

586
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,356
It's okay.

587
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:24,233
The elderly tend to like me.
Give me your phone.

588
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,911
Save my number.

589
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,222
Come on, let's go.

590
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,432
What are you doing? Hurry up.

591
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,396
I'm working right now, Mom.
I'll call you back when I'm done, okay?

592
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,398
Bye.

593
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,951
-It's about time now.
-Come on.

594
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,786
Goodness.

595
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,789
Hello, Team Leader Hyeon.

596
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,710
-Where's your boss?
-Sorry?

597
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,170
Is it a special day or something?

598
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:29,173
What's with the tone
and the look in your eyes?

599
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,634
Is there something wrong?

600
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,636
How disturbing.

601
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,976
Hello, sir!

602
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,898
I'm sorry.

603
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,317
I lived in a hot country,
so I get cold easily.

604
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,112
So it's you.

605
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,281
The new boss, Chairman Kim.

606
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,742
That's right.

607
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,411
I'm Kim Hongsik.
I look forward to working with you.

608
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,664
I've heard that you were
quite the big shot in Southeast Asia.

609
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,918
Well, I made enough
to support me and my guys.

610
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,129
Listen, Hongsik.

611
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,174
This isn't some countryside
you used to live in.

612
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,426
It's Busan,
the second biggest city in Korea.

613
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,055
You won't get off easily here.

614
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,182
-Got it?
-Yes.

615
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,852
-Damn it, I ought to just beat him up.
-Hey, stop it, stop it.

616
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,521
Hey, mind your manners
and say, "Yes, sir."

617
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,983
Yes, sir.

618
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,528
There's no narcotics team
at Wooma Police Station.

619
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,073
We take care of everything
in the violent crimes team,

620
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,284
and Departmental Chief Prosecutor
Nam Duhun

621
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,245
at the Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office oversees everything.

622
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,538
What that means is

623
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,625
this is our turf, and we run this place.

624
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,212
So show us your best and do well.

625
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,631
That way,
things will be easier for you too.

626
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,508
- Got it.
- Also,

627
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,676
your rebate was 8%, right?

628
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,763
We're increasing it to 20%
on top of restarting production.

629
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,057
Jeez, 20%?

630
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,975
Isn't that too much of a steal?

631
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:06,395
Hey, man who can't act his age.

632
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,858
Who the hell are you referring to?

633
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,653
The arrogant leader next to you.

634
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,988
Are you high?

635
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:20,159
There are 23 reasons
why dogs are better than humans.

636
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,327
You know what number three is?

637
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,080
Be it a stray dog or a pet dog,

638
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,250
they immediately become submissive
when confronted by a stronger dog,

639
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,211
so they don't get their necks torn off.

640
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,046
A smart survival behavior, no?

641
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,090
What nonsense are you on about?

642
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,843
You want to shut down
on the day you reopen?

643
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,763
Hey, open this up.

644
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:59,115
-Oh, jeez!
-What the hell?

645
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,540
Man, it's frozen already.

646
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,709
Korea's got great cooling technology.

647
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,046
You know who these frozen pollacks are?

648
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,966
Wait, what did they say they'll do
if we run our business?

649
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,177
That they will "wipe us out."

650
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,763
They're the guys
who said they'll wipe us out.

651
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,684
The leader of the Gudong Gang
and Hochang Station Exit 2 Gang.

652
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,269
You bastards.

653
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,064
Are you threatening me right now?

654
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,568
I'm not done. You want to know
what will happen to these two?

655
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,777
You bastard.

656
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,362
God damn it.

657
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,573
Don't mess around with us, you--

658
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,408
Detective An!

659
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,535
Detective An!

660
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,510
Damn it.

661
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,151
Get on your high horse again.

662
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,738
Chairman Kim, we were out of line.

663
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,198
You understood me.

664
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:24,659
Kneel.

665
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,588
From now on…

666
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,343
just do as I say.

667
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,887
If you do…

668
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,017
…I'll make sure you're full and happy.

669
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,186
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

670
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,275
Thanks.

671
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,282
By the way, let Prosecutor Nam know
about what happened here.

672
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,118
But tone it down when you do.

673
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,494
Yes, sir!

674
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,871
Let's get to work.

675
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,581
Get rid of this.

676
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,250
- Get a towel.
- Go get a towel.

677
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,224
Unbelievable.

678
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,519
Move to this beat.

679
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,313
One, two, three, four.

680
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,481
One, two, three, four.

681
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,525
If you stop, you have to run ten laps.

682
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,693
Move it.

683
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,529
Breathe! Two, two, three, four!

684
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,197
Come on, follow the beat.

685
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,574
That's it. There we go.

686
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,286
Darn it! This is harder than the video.

687
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,912
Don't forget to breathe.

688
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,081
One, two, three, four.

689
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,541
One, two, three…

690
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,626
What's wrong with him?

691
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,212
I'm not sure.
He was under his desk yesterday.

692
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,966
But today, I found him inside the cabinet.

693
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,183
Fresh air!

694
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,980
Chief, buy some tanghulu, candied fruits.

695
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,317
If you do, then I'll…

696
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:26,072
♪ Tang, tang, hulu, hulu
Tang, tang, tang, hululululu ♪

697
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:30,451
♪ Tang, tang, hulu, hulu
Tang, tang, tang, hululululu ♪

698
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,870
♪ Tang, tang, hulu, hulu
Tang… ♪

699
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,664
I'm cold.
I'm cold, Chief.

700
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,959
Hey.

701
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,629
You should've told me sooner.

702
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,090
How can I tell you
that I have a panic disorder?

703
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,842
-Did you go to the hospital?
-They say it's severe.

704
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,637
I'm okay!

705
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,972
I'll continue to… I'm cold.

706
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,474
I'm so cold, sir.

707
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,685
Get some rest and don't come to work.

708
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,688
I'm okay, sir. I'll come to… Shut up!

709
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,358
I said, shut up! I don't want to hear it!

710
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,197
I have to hide for at least two weeks.

711
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,075
All right, take two weeks off.
No, take a month off.

712
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,535
Thank you, sir.

713
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,876
You might be my brother,
but I don't consider a gangster my family!

714
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,422
I'll take care of
Dad's memorial service with Mom!

715
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,048
It's none of your business!

716
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,633
Just live like you always have!

717
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,261
Did you change your number?
I'm blocking you!

718
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,763
Block number

719
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,306
Is it your older brother?

720
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,308
He keeps calling me,

721
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,560
that good-for-nothing.

722
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,979
But still, he's blood-related family.

723
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,355
Who cares?

724
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,317
-Coming back from your morning workout?
-Yeah.

725
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,447
-You want to touch it?
-Just eat up.

726
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,531
Okay.

727
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,615
Thank you.

728
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:53,909
Oh.

729
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:58,456
By the way, did Father Kim call?

730
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,583
He didn't just go off the grid this time.

731
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,377
He's completely vanished into thin air.

732
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,963
I get why he'd leave others behind,

733
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,007
but he should've taken me with him.

734
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,091
Who am I again?

735
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,051
The cat that protects the king.

736
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,095
It's tiger, you pig.

737
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,180
Get ready!

738
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,516
-Meow!
-Here I go!

739
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,518
Meow! Meow! Meow!

740
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,397
Hey, hey, hey.

741
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,111
Yohan.

742
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,947
You really did change since that incident.

743
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,492
I know. I'm scared of myself.

744
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,706
Are you serious?

745
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,250
I know this might upset you,

746
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,920
but I'm leaving to help Father Kim.

747
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:50,132
This is a dangerous task
that only professionals can take care of.

748
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,885
I, Night Guy Gu Daeyoung, will be back.

749
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:56,180
Also, please take care of Sangyeon.

750
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,099
Come on!

751
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,395
Is it a trend to leave messages
before taking off?

752
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,231
-Seriously!
-We can't just sit back anymore.

753
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,649
We can't!

754
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,984
-Goodness, you scared me!
-I'm sorry!

755
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:12,738
You're right! Let's think of something!

756
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,658
Let's see.

757
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,746
Angela the Geezer

758
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,419
Hey.

759
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,255
Good work.

760
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,714
That's it?

761
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,258
You ruined my study abroad.

762
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,094
Why exploit your beauty
to fulfill my duty?

763
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,514
Well, I heard the cartel's underboss

764
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:42,059
is into beautiful
and intellectual Asian women.

765
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,144
Are you sure you didn't make that up?

766
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,607
Is he lonely or something?

767
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:54,071
Then again, you wouldn't know
my charms and beauty.

768
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,823
Anyway, where are you?

769
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,325
I'm in Busan
as an instructor at a seminary.

770
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,868
Instructor?

771
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,621
Wait, you as an instructor?

772
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,081
Why?

773
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,125
Is there something wrong?

774
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,378
You're not flogging the students
as punishment, are you?

775
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,715
Come on, I wouldn't hit students.

776
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,842
I'm a benevolent instructor.

777
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,970
Sure, sure.
Have fun being a benevolent instructor.

778
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:20,639
I'll be praying for the students.

779
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,354
Kook Dokseong

780
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,649
Anyway, you're well and healthy, right?

781
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,568
Are you worrying about me right now?

782
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,862
Take care of your health!

783
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,447
I'm glad you're well.

784
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,741
I have to go.
I'll see you when you get to Korea.

785
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,326
Bye.

786
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,536
Okay, see you in Korea.

787
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,871
Uh…

788
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,206
Darn it, he hung up.

789
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,130
Mmm!

790
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,508
I could use some pork belly cartilage.

791
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,018
Ah!

792
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,021
Gozaev!

793
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,731
What?

794
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,777
You want me to come over?

795
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,570
What… Okay!

796
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,197
All right, all right!

797
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,240
What's he stuffing his face with?

798
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,493
All right, all right.

799
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,997
This was farther than I expected.

800
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,166
What do you mean…

801
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,002
-by you almost found him?
-Shh!

802
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,381
People are watching. Goodness me.

803
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,299
Have some of this first.

804
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,053
Jeez, it got all over me.

805
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,555
-This is an expensive suit.
-How much is it?

806
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,849
You wouldn't know.
You always wear the same thing.

807
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,977
I may have not found Fire Eel himself,

808
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:53,649
but I found someone
who knows him very well.

809
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,112
Who is it?

810
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,699
I heard it from a friend
who's a loan shark

811
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,033
there's a guy named Ko Donggeun

812
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,286
and he's a complete thug who runs
a few bars and adult establishments.

813
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,288
He's also a major druggie,

814
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,499
and he's very tight with Fire Eel.

815
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,459
He's a piece of trash

816
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,878
who beats up the girls who work for him.

817
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,464
Whenever he's drugged up,

818
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:22,428
-he chants "My Lord, Fire Eel" all day.
-My Lord, Fire Eel. My Lord, Fire Eel!

819
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,431
Hallelujah!

820
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,349
Then again, he's not wrong.

821
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,811
All druggies consider their suppliers
to be their lords.

822
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,731
It's the worst heresy among heresies.

823
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,775
So where is that piece of trash?

824
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,863
I don't know.

825
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,074
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

826
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,410
Jeez, you're still so short-tempered.

827
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,245
Let's go. Come on.

828
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,914
Ma'am, how much is it? Put it on the tab!

829
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,500
My goodness, that scammer.

Food Alley

831
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:59,298
Goodness gracious.

832
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,633
He should be in there.

833
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,845
The CEO's office is on the third floor.

834
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,597
They can't know your face, so stay here.

835
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,056
-Here.
-What?

836
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,516
I'll be back.

837
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,480
What a shame.

838
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:17,983
I was going to show him
Gozaev's killer punch,

839
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,027

840
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,491
Two will be stronger than one.
Come with me.

841
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,536
I should stop reminiscing about the past.
I'll be here.

842
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,121
Jeez. Just get some ice.

843
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,165
- Ice?
- Yeah.

844
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,917
You want iced Americano?

845
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,211
Let's see.

846
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,965

at least have the guts to take a beating.

Wait!

866
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,546
You'll go to hell

Are you really a priest?

You're not, right?
You're a killer, aren't you?

Who'd hire a killer for you?
What a waste of money.

Good point.
It would be a waste of money.

why Leonardo DiCaprio died in Titanic?

Hypothermia.

884
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:12,908
He at least died next to someone he loved,
but you're dying alone in this tub.

Gosh, I'm cold.

888
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:25,712
Don't worry.
I'll pray for you when you die.

889
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,381
What can I do for you?

890
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,216
Tell me what you need.

891
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,345
-Yeah?
-Yes.

892
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:35,931
All right.

893
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,981
Where's your Lord Fire Eel?

894
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,069
Sorry?

895
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,989
Who might that be?

896
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,740
Fire Eel?

897
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,580
Wait, no!

898
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,965
I don't know where he is.

899
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,217
I've only ever seen his face.

900
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:16,847
That's it.

901
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,474
That's what I want to hear.
Of course you know him.

902
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,396
That means you guys meet up.

903
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,939
Let's see.

904
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,733
Darn it.

905
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,194
They meet up.

906
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,617
Call him and tell him you're out of drugs.

907
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,537
Say you want him to give you the drugs,
not his underlings.

908
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,832
What's your unlock pattern?

909
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,709
It's this.

910
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:49,463
-Unbelievable.
-Fire Eel.

911
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,381
Here he is.

912
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:53,008
Put it on speaker.

913
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,176
"Lord Fire Eel"

914
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:58,513
"Fire Eel"

915
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:01,767
Goodness, it's Fanatic Mr. Ko.

916
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,854
-Are you already out?
-How'd you know, sir?

917
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,149
Why else would you
have called me on this pleasant night?

918
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,484
I'll send Sangman.

919
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,235
No, no.

920
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,571
I want to have a drink with you.

921
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,448
Could you come?

922
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,575
I can't, I have work.

923
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,077
What about tomorrow?

924
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,579
He says tomorrow.

925
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:23,914
No.

926
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,291
Tell him you have something special
for him and ask where he is.

927
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,210
-"Something special"?
-Yeah, something special.

928
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,836
Wait, wait, wait!

929
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,254
Anything he likes.

930
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,426
Well, you see, sir,

931
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,596
I got some pine honey to give you.

932
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,681
Where are you right now, sir?

933
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,766
Hey.

934
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,393
Did you say pine honey?

935
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,230
Where'd you get something so precious?

936
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,608
I'm near Songnam right now.

937
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,610
He's near Songnam.

938
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,115
I'll see you later.

939
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,201
Good job. How easy was that?

940
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,954
Now, turn yourself in and get off drugs.

941
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,207
Don't worry, you won't die.

942
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:09,501
Wait, help me with this.

943
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,128
Lord!

944
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,712
Oh, come on!

945
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,716
Let's go. I don't need the ice anymore.

946
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,182
What's with the look on your face?
Did you see a ghost or something?

947
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:25,684
Yes.

948
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,727
I'm sorry, Father Kim.

949
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,438
About what? What's wrong?

950
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,523
Father Kim.

951
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,732
Oh, my gosh!

952
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,992
It's been a while since my nose bled.

953
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:43,410
It reminds me of the past.

954
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,287
You runaway!

955
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,247
-You traitor!
-You chaser!

956
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,750
-I swear I didn't tell him.
-Then how is he here?

957
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:53,253
He couldn't deceive me
with his horrible acting.

958
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,671
I looked through your messages.

959
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,506
Cut him off?
You want nothing to do with him?

960
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,967
You guys sure messaged each other a lot.

961
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,886
You're a loan shark
and you only use one phone?

962
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,138
I have to pay more if I use more than one.

963
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,931
Wait, I thought
you were a restaurant owner.

964
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,684
I'm not a loan shark.

965
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:11,188
-I'm a lone shark, like a lone wolf.
-Yeah, a lone shark.

966
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,314
Also!

967
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:14,316
What did you tell your chief?

968
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,736
I had to pretend to be Fu Bao
and do all sorts of stuff to get time off.

969
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,698
You should be protecting Gudam-gu
as the leader of the violent crimes team.

970
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,618
It's up to me where I choose to protect,
as long as I'm protecting Korea.

971
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,661
What? But Sangyeon…

972
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,246
Just go back to Seoul.

973
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,331
-No.
-Go right now!

974
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,041
-No, I won't. No.
-Go immediately! Go!

975
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,293
-No, no, no!
-Go, go, go!

976
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,170
-Take the KTX train!
-Stop it already!

977
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,631
What are you, kids?
You always fight when you're together.

978
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,257
- Stay out of it!
- Stay out of it!

979
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,592
What are you yelling at me for?

980
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:43,136
You both have such a nasty temper.

981
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,598
I heard you gave one of the druggies
an ice bath.

982
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,183
Did you find out where Fire Eel is?

983
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,352
They're near Songnam right now…

984
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,063
-Go back to Seoul. It's dangerous.
-No.

985
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,522
-Go.
-I don't care, I'm going with you.

986
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,607
-Here we go.
-I'm going alone.

987
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,025
Then go alone. I mean, I'm going with you.

988
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,610
-Go back alone!
-No!

989
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,835
Sir, here's your sausage.

990
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,214
-Hey.
-Yes?

991
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,757
You like treasure hunting, right?

992
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,844
Sir, you want me to show you
how good I am?

993
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,806
Yeah, go find it
and keep track of the numbers.

994
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,182
-Okay.
-Go.

995
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,725
-Hey.
-Yes?

996
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,477
-Heat up another one.
-Okay.

997
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,355
- Get me something to drink too.
- Okay, sir.

998
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:39,192
Hey, this one's cold.
Heat it up for longer.

999
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,280
Oh, jeez!

1000
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,907
- What's going on?
- What's happening?

1001
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,242
It acts up sometimes.

1002
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:50,203
-Come on, fix it!
-Fix your car!

1003
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:54,124
-Who takes care of their car like this?
-Where is it? How far away is it?

1004
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,668
-Can you push the car?
-What are you talking about?

1005
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,253
If you two push, it'll start going again.

1006
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,297
Why would we push the car
in this day and age?

1007
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,258
-It's so old-school.
-The engine will start again.

1008
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:04,801
- What now?
- We'd be on our way by now!

1009
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,011
Be quiet! How far away are we?

1010
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,637
Let's just get going.

1011
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,973
-Goodness gracious.
-Are you doing this on purpose?

1012
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,100
Push harder, will you?

1013
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,727
I am!
How much more do we have to push?

1014
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,063
How tiring.
How much longer do we have to push?

1015
00:55:19,399 --> 00:55:20,650
Are you tired?

1016
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,402
We're here.

1017
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,446
- Hey!
- Shh!

1018
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,613
Be quiet!

1019
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,282
- What?
- Lower your voices.

1020
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:31,036
You see the black cars up there?

1021
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,163
There's a storage unit next to it.

1022
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,622
That's the place.

1023
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,249
Don't be loud.

1024
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,126
So that's the place.

1025
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,837
By the way, will the two of you be okay?

1026
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,881
It's more like one than two.

1027
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,549
Can we check
how many guys are there first?

1028
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,593
God is always behind us.

1029
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:49,137
That again.

1030
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,140
Charge the battery on your car.

1031
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,225
-I'm watching you.
-I'll be right here.

1032
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,186
The battery…

1033
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,273
-You're taking it off?
-Yeah, I've been too exposed.

1034
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,859
- God might be disappointed.
- No, no, no.

1035
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,653
There's no way He'd be.

1036
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,795
I'll get rid of the ball boys in Gudam.

1037
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,547
Yes, sir.

1038
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:30,178
Gudam was perfect for our new home field.

1039
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,721
If only the kid hadn't fainted.

1040
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,140
Sir, I'm done with everything.

1041
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,229
-Take everything to the ball boy room.
-Okay.

1042
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:40,355
Oh, right.

1043
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,110
You promised
you'd treat my girlfriend to a nice meal.

1044
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,070
When is it going to happen?

1045
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,739
Oh, right. Heidi, Girl of the Alps.

1046
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,123
Jeez, come on.

1047
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,335
- Who is that?
- My goodness.

1048
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,838
That was hard. You should put
some rust inhibitor on that door.

1049
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,257
I'm sure you can afford it.

1050
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:09,259
Who are you?

1051
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,220
Are you Fire Eel?

1052
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,596
Are you a cop?

1053
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:16,850
Or a gang member
who has invaded our territory?

1054
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,102
Who are you? How do you know me?

1055
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:22,605
My boss tells me
the exact locations of the bad guys.

1056
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,191
Is your boss a GPS?

1057
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,403
What a pathetic joke.

1058
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,947
Something like it.

1059
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,952
Whatever, come here.
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk.

1060
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,997
What's with
all these crazy people these days?

1061
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:44,836
Go teach him a lesson.

1062
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,005
Get him!

1063
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,256
Yes, sir!

1064
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,050
I wouldn't recommend doing that.

1065
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,407
We won't need God to cover for us.

1066
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:31,090
I hope it doesn't take too long.
Then again, they're both so talkative.

1067
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,550
Oh, there we go.

1068
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,801
I got it.

1069
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,561
Who are they?

1070
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:47,899
Guns?

1071
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,989
Pick up the phone!

1072
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,784
They're going in with guns!
Pick up the phone!

1073
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,843
You bastard!

1074
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,513
What the hell?

1075
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,397
Jeez, these bastards.

1076
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,650
All you do is sell drugs,
which is why you're so weak.

1077
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,360
Just stay down!

1078
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,036
You little punk!

1079
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,460
Jeez, these bastards.

1080
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,045
Who the hell are you, dirt face?

1081
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,463
"Dirt face"?

1082
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,425
How dare you insult someone's looks
in this day and age?

1083
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,760
-Come on. Bring it on.
-Sure, I'm coming.

1084
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,429
Bring it on!

1085
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:07,687
He's impact-proof.

1086
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,982
-Damn, your head is strong.
-Bring it on.

1087
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,483
Come here. Come at me!

1088
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,209
That was amazing.

1089
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,492
Jeez, that little…

1090
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,668
Why are you so fast?

1091
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,346
Fire Eel.

1092
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,181
- Stop it. Enough.
- Come here.

1093
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,517
It's okay.

1094
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,852
It's… okay!

1095
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,106
Bring it on.

1096
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,880
Get up!

1097
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,966
How dare you run away?

1098
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,218
Get up. One, two…

1099
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:05,096
Gosh, my stomach.

1100
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,014
Let me go.

1101
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,476
Are you a professional dodgeball player?

1102
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,895
Who's your boss?

1103
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,564
-Who is it?
-Who is it?

1104
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,316
You can't just raid us like this.

1105
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,568
Tell me what gang you're in.

1106
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:20,987
That's personal information.

1107
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,114
- Now, answer me!
- Answer!

1108
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,117
Did you attack us
without knowing who our boss is?

1109
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,954
If we knew your boss,
we wouldn't have come all the way here.

1110
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,457
Stop hitting me!

1111
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,084
I've never seen such reckless people.

1112
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,422
I'm done for, even if I tell you
who my direct superior is.

1113
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:40,715
So just kill me!

1114
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,550
All right, as you wish then.

1115
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:45,261
No, no! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1116
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,513
Freeze!

1117
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,618
We're with the drug investigation unit.
Get down and put your hands up.

1118
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,163
Uh…

1119
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,873
We're not the bad guys.

1120
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,541
We're really not. Right?

1121
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,001
Of course we're not.

1122
01:03:17,084 --> 01:03:18,628
We don't even look like it.

1123
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:20,630
We're not the bad guys.

1124
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:23,341
Talk again and I'll shoot you.

1125
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,970
Put your hands up!

1126
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,825
#The return of the stray dog

1127
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,620
Everyone clap
for the chairman's good health.

1128
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,878
All right, stop, stop, stop!

1129
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,379
Stop! Stop!

1130
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,256
-Stop!
-Yes, start, start.

1131
01:04:46,424 --> 01:04:48,301
I said stop.

1132
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,052
Wait, didn't you say start?

1133
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,804
I said stop, not start.

1134
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:53,973
Go down over there.

1135
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,393
- Go!
- Okay.

1136
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,145
Move.

1137
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,771
I'm sorry, sir.

1138
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,107
Is the Moon of Seoul arriving soon?

1139
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,902
Yes, it'll be in Busan in two days.

1140
01:05:05,985 --> 01:05:07,987
Let's get something straight
before we begin.

1141
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,573
Stop selling hepanyl starting tomorrow.

1142
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,992
Sir? But we still have a lot left.

1143
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,244
It doesn't make enough money
and kills people off too quickly.

1144
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,996
It's got no future.

1145
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,789
Let's focus on our luxury items.

1146
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,334
Yes, sir.

1147
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,836
Ah, another thing.

1148
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,214
The boys and I would like to have
a proper gang name.

1149
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,635
-We don't need one.
-But it'd be helpful for our image.

1150
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:33,012
Popular restaurants
usually don't have huge signs.

1151
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:36,390
Let's keep things on the down-low
and make some quiet profit.

1152
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:37,475
That's our motto.

1153
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,060
Yes, sir.

1154
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,937
Understood.

1155
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:43,981
It's quite high up here.

1156
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,608
I'm afraid of heights.

1157
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:46,734
Sir.

1158
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,029
Should I reserve a spot at a restaurant?

1159
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,075
You little…

1160
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:56,827
Go away.

1161
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:57,995
Go!

1162
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:00,790
I'm sorry, sir!

1163
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,921
#Chae Dou's holiness education

1164
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:10,466
Fill in the highlighted parts.

1165
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,595
Yes.

1166
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,181
You just need to fill out these forms

1167
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:20,768
and bring your welfare card
and the receipt for your hearing aid.

1168
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,728
But Father,
I'm so hungry.

1169
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:23,854
Me too.

1170
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,608
Then shall we go for some ramyeon?

1171
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:28,693
Yes!

1172
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,194
Let's go.

1173
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,491
What did you do yesterday?

1174
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:37,994
I went shopping with my friends.

1175
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,916
Those mutes sure are talkative.

1176
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,335
How do they get punished
if they talk too much in class?

1177
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,754
I guess they'd tie up their hands.

1178
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:51,841
Like this.

1179
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,094
Shut up and scram.

1180
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:58,347
My goodness,
I guess the priest isn't mute.

1181
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,600
But what did you just say?
Shut up and scram?

1182
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,352
Will you look at this bastard?

1183
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,312
-Hey, don't.
-Get off me.

1184
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:09,567
I can't stand being around
those who are below human.

1185
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,736
Can you say that as a priest?

1186
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,654
-Come on, sit.
-Don't stop me.

1187
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:14,739
Are you really a priest?

1188
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,160
I'd be getting out of here if I were you.

1189
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:20,745
Man, my mom said

1190
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,496
I'd go to hell if I punched a monk.

1191
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,124
He's a priest, not a monk.
Get it together.

1192
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:28,919
-Aren't they the same?
-Monks are bald, you idiot.

1193
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:30,337
This is your last warning.

1194
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,089
Get lost in three seconds.

1195
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,717
He's hilarious.

1196
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,887
-One.
-Come on!

1197
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,723
-Two.
-Who do you think we are?

1198
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,308
-Let's go!
-Bring it!

1199
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:47,396
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1200
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,024
You pay for mistakes with your life.

1201
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,068
Fire Eel is just an underling.

1202
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:54,570
The ones higher up
are far more nasty and ruthless.

1203
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,655
Can you let us join the investigation?

1204
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,783
You didn't go to Busan
for the seminary, did you?

1205
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,035
They're addicted to drugs,
and more are getting addicted too.

1206
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,870
That ship is a moving base.

1207
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:04,789
Can you make the president?

1208
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:07,166
Lure them out by giving them a fake tip.

1209
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:08,959
I'm going to work starting tomorrow.

1210
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,294
What kind of factory is it?

1211
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:12,004
What the hell did you say?

1212
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,297
The no-name team isn't safe either.

1213
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,049
I think they're going to get raided soon.

1214
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,675
You're dead meat.

1215
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,095
Tickets for
the express lane to hell are ready!
