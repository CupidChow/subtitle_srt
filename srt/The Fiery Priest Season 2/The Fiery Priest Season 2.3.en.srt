00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:03,253
The Fiery Priest Season 2

2
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,637
Father Kim.

8
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,099
Don't worry, it's not a terminal illness.

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,851
That's not the point.

10
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,644
You might not be able to walk.

11
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,229
You know how doctors are.

12
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,898
They tell you the worst-case scenario.

13
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,982
You're a bellator,

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,276
so it's only a matter of time
before you face the worst.

15
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,237
Well, I'm sure
God will take care of me.

16
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,699
You should take care of your own health.
Why are you making him do the work?

17
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,118
Lord, please take care of me
just this once.

18
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,705
Do the other comites know?

19
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,376
No one knows except for you.

20
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,712
Let's just forget about everything

21
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,005
and focus on your treatment.

22
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,008
All right, I'll get my treatment,

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,594
but you'll have to help me.

24
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,263
You only told me
so I'd take the fall, didn't you?

25
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,723
Of course.

26
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:42,143
I wonder if there's a cure
for your shamelessness.

27
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,521
All right.

28
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,608
I'll make sure to be the best
and most helpful comes in the world,

29
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,734
so get treatment, okay?

30
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,819
Okay.

31
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,904
Once all this is over,

32
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,906
I'll go someplace nice and get my rest.

33
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,990
Promise me.

34
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,414
-God is watching.
-Goodness me.

35
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,041
How are you so strong?

36
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,960
Well…

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,379
Is that how you trained?

38
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,797
Goodness gracious.

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,423
I can't even do that.

40
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,594
Kim Haeil,

41
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,888
please take it easy.

42
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,688
Jeez, that's hot!

43
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,943
Episode 3
Somewhere in Between Heaven and Hell

44
00:02:58,428 --> 00:02:59,679
Man, my back hurts.

45
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,181
How long was I out?

46
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,057
19 hours and 24 minutes, sir.

47
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,603
It's nice to be back in Korea.

48
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,896
I slept like a baby.

49
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,941
What brings you here?

50
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,403
There's something urgent
I have to report to you.

51
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,197
What is it?

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,533
We hacked into Boss Park's text messages.

53
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,244
Behave yourself.

54
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,663
If the Chairman finds out,
we're in trouble.

55
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,836
We really did almost shut down
on the day of reopening.

56
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,680
Freeze!

57
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,739
We're with the Drug Investigation Unit.

58
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,115
Get down and put your hands up!

59
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,076
Uh…

60
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,577
We're not the bad guys.

61
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,162
We're really not. Right?

62
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,580
Of course we're not.

63
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,665
We don't even look like it.

64
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,583
We're not the bad guys.

65
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,294
Talk again and I'll shoot you.

66
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,881
Put your hands up!

67
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,680
Arrest Fire Eel.

68
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,806
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,769
Heidi? Hei…

70
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,317
Detectives.

71
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,528
These guys are very suspicious.

72
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,994
Things are no fun
without their twists and turns.

73
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:48,746
Of course, I'm sure they'll understand
if we explain everything.

74
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:51,791
Don't move.

75
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,293
Thank you for your hard work.

76
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,086
I'm Team Leader Gu Daeyoung
of Violent Crimes Team 2

77
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,546
at Gudam Police Station.

78
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,590
Public Official ID
Gu Daeyoung

79
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,804
Oh, come on!

80
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,806
- Jeez.
- It's okay, it's fine.

81
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,558
We'll just explain to them again.

82
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,976
One second.

83
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,561
Who the heck are they?

84
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,854
-There.
-There.

85
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,983
All right, everyone.

86
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,445
As you can see, I'm a servant of the Lord!

87
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,202
I told you to use a different photo
for your ID.

88
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,537
It's so heavily edited.

89
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,415
Why would you wear your clerical collar?

90
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,624
You seem like a con artist!

91
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,877
"Con artist"?
Did you just call a priest a con artist?

92
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,712
Are you crazy?

93
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,923
How amateur of you.

94
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,134
You should at least
make your lies believable.

95
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,845
It seems like Oh Sangman took off.

96
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,222
You should've gone after him.

97
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,141
I'm sorry.
I was collecting evidence.

98
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,894
Damn it. We have to catch that bastard.

99
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:53,978
Let's go.

100
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,402
-Did you take your shoes off?
-No. What is this smell?

101
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,528
What is this smell?

102
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,200
Father Kim! Father Kim!

103
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,219
Hurry up!

104
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,056
We're here, sir!

105
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,059
What brings you here at this hour?

106
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,063
I came to have a late-night snack.

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,399
The night breeze in Busan is great.

108
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,942
I can smell the green laver.

109
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,530
Where's the square-faced guy?

110
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,366
We sent Rockfish over to Dong-gu port.

111
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,493
He's quite the meticulous type.

112
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,162
I guess we need to manage that place too.

113
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,580
By the way,

114
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,041
do you usually get hungry at this hour?

115
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,460
Yeah, especially today.

116
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,796
You know why? Because I'm angry.

117
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,465
Sorry?

118
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,634
-What the hell?
-What in the world?

119
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,223
Sir!

120
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,561
I heard you almost got caught
in Gudam or something.

121
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,313
-Yes, sir.
-I wonder why you didn't tell me about it.

122
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,649
Things were already being taken care of

123
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,152
and there were no further issues.

124
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,487
So you don't have to report to me
if things are taken care of?

125
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,910
We had extras lying around.

126
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,121
I'm sorry!

127
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,873
I won't make mistakes again!

128
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,500
The thing is

129
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,627
humans are bound to make mistakes.

130
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,337
However, the real issue is

131
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,132
they make bigger mistakes
based on their previous mistakes.

132
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,800
I swear!

133
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,303
I won't even make the smallest mistakes!

134
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,140
There's a rule set by my boss,

135
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,602
General Bak Lak, whom I respect the most.

136
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,566
One mistake, one life.

137
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,122
Oh, no, Sea Squirt!

138
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,626
I don't believe in forgiveness.

139
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,961
There's nothing more futile
than forgiveness.

140
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:25,963
You pay for mistakes

141
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,715
with your life.

142
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,050
Yes, sir!

143
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,176
You pay for mistakes

144
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,928
with your life!

145
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,516
This is how we grow closer, yeah?

146
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,434
Have a drink.

147
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,899
What's wrong with you?

148
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,275
Jeez, stop it.

149
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,860
What's wrong with you?

150
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,737
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-Goodness me.

151
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,405
Please stop.

152
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,282
You idiot, stop calling me.

153
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,326
What the hell did you say?

154
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,578
What's the matter?

155
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,916
Sir, the thing is…

156
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,001
-Fire Eel…
-What?

157
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,086
Well…

158
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,421
-The thing is…
-Spit it out!

159
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,173
The thing is what, you punk?

160
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,343
Fire Eel was arrested.

161
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,236
Looks like you have no more moves to play.

162
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,654
What are you gonna do?

163
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,574
Well, this is how things are in Go.

164
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,952
Man, I really have no way out.

165
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,120
Jeez.

166
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,332
Excuse me.

167
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,709
Pawn Park

168
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,795
- What is it?
- We're in trouble.

169
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,173
-What?
-The cops suddenly showed up, and…

170
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,842
The cops showed up?

171
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,095
- So what happened?
- They got one of our guys.

172
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,806
That's why I'm calling you. Prosecutor--

173
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,766
What are you on about?

174
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,020
Do you want to run your business or not?

175
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,146
What?

176
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,982
I don't know.
Talk to your new boss about it.

177
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,069
Where was Team Leader Lee all this time?

178
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,990
Oh my. What happened here?

179
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,285
Well, I guess a strong wind blew in.

180
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,913
You really can't predict
the weather these days, can you?

181
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,290
It's all messed up.

182
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,668
Sir, I'll give you a call.

183
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,505
What a nasty sport.

184
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,343
Where are you?

185
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,555
What? You're out drinking again,
aren't you?

186
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,182
No, I'm not, sir.

187
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,558
Of course you are.

188
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,477
Listen to me carefully.

189
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,354
Yes, sir.

190
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,147
Yes, sir.

191
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,191
I'll look into it thoroughly
and find the guys.

192
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:54,403
Lure them out by making a fake report
or giving them a fake tip.

193
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:55,905
Understand?

194
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,659
Yes, sir.
I'll smoke them out from their burrow.

195
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,369
Just make sure you get it done.

196
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,412
And stop drinking.

197
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,083
What are they even drinking for?

198
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,669
You rude bastard.

199
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,587
Sir…

200
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,048
…did the cops show up?

201
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,843
Yeah, they did.

202
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,054
How am I going to find them?

203
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,681
This is driving me insane.

204
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,726
Jeez, that stinks.

205
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,938
- Jeez.
- Sir!

206
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,357
Are you okay, sir?

207
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,235
What's going to happen to us now?

208
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,778
How would I know?

209
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,987
We're screwed.

210
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,948
Background check

211
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,491
This is a bathhouse, right?

212
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,953
No wonder I wanted sikhye and eggs
on the way in.

213
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,746
Hmm.

214
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,543
You're really taking your sweet time
with those.

215
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,422
Uncuff them.

216
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,887
Now do you believe us?

217
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,305
We were telling the truth.

218
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,932
Even so,

219
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,892
how could merely two of you go there?

220
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,562
We went,
but we're not just "merely" two guys.

221
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,940
You're a team leader.
You should know better.

222
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,817
It's a case
that also occurred in Gudam-gu.

223
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,110
We have good reason to be here.

224
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,695
Be that as it may,

225
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:21,198
our three-month undercover work
almost went down the drain because of you!

226
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,868
I made myself look absolutely hideous

227
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,537
and did all sorts of things
to catch Fire Eel, and…

228
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,956
Forget it.

229
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,543
I understand things were tough,

230
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,546
but we caught them,
so your work didn't go down the drain.

231
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,673
Yeah, you're right. It didn't.

232
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,799
Speaking of Fire Eel,

233
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,052
what's the name of the drug ring
he's associated with, and who's the boss?

234
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,221
We can't tell you that. It's confidential.

235
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,891
-Why don't you give us a hint?
-No.

236
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,560
-Just a small hint.
-We said no.

237
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,233
I know
this is a difficult favor to ask for,

238
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,152
but can you let us join the investigation?

239
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,529
We promise we won't cause trouble.

240
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,739
Father Kim.

241
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,157
That isn't a difficult favor.

242
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,409
-It's an impossible one.
-I mean,

243
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,620
a priest in an investigation?

244
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,079
Unbelievable.

245
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,790
Do you think this makes sense?

246
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,334
Should I make it make sense for you?

247
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,461
You think catching a drug ring is a joke?

248
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,671
We caught Fire Eel!

249
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,300
He's just an underling.

250
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,386
The ones higher up
are far more nasty and ruthless.

251
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,930
We're pretty nasty and evil
where we come from.

252
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,849
All right, all right,
that's enough.

253
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,602
We'll let today's incident slide.

254
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,604
Go back to Seoul.

255
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,981
Sir, this is your last chance.

256
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,858
If you don't let us
join the investigation…

257
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,486
-Come on.
-Go already.

258
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,987
-Please reconsider.
-Get out.

259
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,364
Listen carefully.

260
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,325
We won't let it slide
if you interfere again.

261
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,285
Then what are you going to do?

262
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,038
I'll lock you up in there
until we put these guys behind bars.

263
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,331
I'm not kidding.

264
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:57,962
In that case…

265
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,006
can we just stay here?

266
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,716
Go already!

267
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,760
Go back to Seoul already!

268
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,679
Okay, okay, okay.

269
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,640
We'll go, but tell us your name first.

270
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,352
I'm Detective Gu Jayoung. Happy now?

271
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,145
Gu Jayoung?

272
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,399
Which Gu clan do you belong to?

273
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,318
Is that important right now?

274
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,447
I'll close my eyes.

275
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,116
I'll close them. Please, I beg you.

276
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,993
If you put that on me…

277
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,543
So what you're saying is

278
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:43,299
you were attacked by a priest
and some guy before the cops came.

279
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,466
Right?

280
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:46,969
Yes.

281
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,222
I thought the priest was a martial artist.

282
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,224
The looks in his eyes were unspeakable

283
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,684
and he was--

284
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:56,687
He's a cop in disguise as a priest!

285
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,522
What else?

286
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
What else can you tell me?

287
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,609
I saw Heidi

288
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,944
among the cops.

289
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,654
Heidi?

290
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,448
Are they from the Alps or something?

291
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:11,952
It's the nickname of the girl I'm seeing.

292
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,415
So the girl you're seeing

293
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,375
is a cop?

294
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,544
Yes.

295
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,254
That's very romantic.

296
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,881
Falling in love with an undercover cop.

297
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,424
Thank you, sir.

298
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,052
You idiot!
How can you get fooled by a cop?

299
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,804
Where should I punch you first?

300
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,474
- Boss Park.
- Yes, sir.

301
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,477
Didn't I tell you to stop selling hepanyl
starting today?

302
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,021
I told them to get rid of the extras
by the end of the day.

303
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,982
I told you to stop selling starting today,
not by the end of today.

304
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,484
You did?

305
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,194
I misunderstood, sir.

306
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,238
Everything was great until I woke up.

307
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,283
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, sir.

308
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,369
Did you find where your guy was taken to?

309
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,537
The cops are moving in secret,
so we don't know.

310
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,040
I told the guys to look into it,
and I also told Prosecutor Nam.

311
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,292
Find that Fire Eel or whatever
and take care of him.

312
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,628
He's my right-hand man,
so he'll never disclose…

313
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,633
Your right-hand man got caught.

314
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,593
Cut him off, or else you'll die.

315
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,095
Yes, sir.

316
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,473
One mistake,

317
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,100
one life.

318
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,894
You remember, right?

319
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,604
I do, sir.

320
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,682
Those little…

321
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,820
I fixed the battery.

322
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,988
It's as good as new.

323
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,865
What's this?

324
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,450
That smells like shit!

325
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,701
You know the location, right?

326
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,871
Yes. It's a closed-down bathhouse
40 minutes from here.

327
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,707
How do I get rid of the smell?

328
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,543
-It's not going to be easy.
-It probably won't come out.

329
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:26,378
Let's let the wind carry it away.

330
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,172
Are you ready?

331
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,381
Here we go!

332
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,511
Oh, that's nice.

333
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,096
I need this delicious smell
to get rid of the stink.

334
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,183
Your dandruff's getting all over the food.

335
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,020
The Drug Investigation Unit is on it,
so we can back off now.

336
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,147
They don't know much either.

337
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,815
-You saw it, right?
-Of course.

338
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,611
Apart from the two main detectives,
the rest are useless.

339
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,197
They got lucky and caught a few of them,

340
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,240
but that's about it.

341
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,451
If Fire Eel doesn't speak,
we're back to square one.

342
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,911
Why are they going off on their own?

343
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,037
From what I can tell,

344
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:01,747
they're a nameless team.

345
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,957
Nameless? They don't have a team name?

346
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,084
That's what you call

347
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,836
a drug enforcement team
that operates independently.

348
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,923
They typically specialize
in undercover investigations

349
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,425
and aren't required to report
to the higher-ups beforehand.

350
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,510
Ah…

351
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,886
You're smart.

352
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,679
But don't they have to share
their progress?

353
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,933
Uh… which jurisdiction oversees this area?

354
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,893
Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office.

355
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,895
They're in charge
of all drug-related cases.

356
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,480
Hmm…

357
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,190
The way I see it,

358
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,401
a prosecutor is the overseer,
and they're just going rogue.

359
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,529
Is it okay to do that to a higher-up?

360
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,907
In this case, there's usually
a reason for such behavior.

361
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,408
One that benefits neither of them.

362
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,701
Ah…

363
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,745
The cartel won't just sit back
after what happened to Fire Eel.

364
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,330
The nameless team isn't safe either.

365
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,332
They'll come for them.

366
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,043
Drug dealers leave no loose ends.

367
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,216
Eat up. I'm going to make a call.

368
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,765
Hello, Father Kim.

369
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,017
Geezer Park, where are you,
where are you, where are you?

370
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,436
I'm still in LA.
I'm on my way to the airport.

371
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,813
I depart in three hours.

372
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,773
Have a safe flight, and let's do this.

373
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,151
Stay a day in Seoul,
and then come to Busan.

374
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,986
I'm busy, okay?

375
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,530
I have to report to JB,
and I have trials scheduled.

376
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,657
Don't you have things to do
at the seminary?

377
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,327
Not really. And even if I did,
I'd take care of them.

378
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,787
Report to JB

379
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,497
and come to Busan for a day.

380
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,291
I'm not a freelancer.

381
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,127
I'm a public official.
I'm going to get fired at this rate.

382
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,546
Come on, just one day.

383
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,923
You don't want to miss this!

384
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:37,593
Father Kim,

385
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,762
why don't we speak casually for a minute?

386
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,847
What?

387
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,184
All of a sudden? Right now?

388
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,896
Hang on.

389
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,857
We need to set a timer for a minute.
Let's make it short.

390
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,983
Ready, start.

391
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,903
Hey, you didn't go to Busan
for the seminary, did you?

392
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,987
Yes, I did.

393
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,238
Don't lie.

394
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,699
Is it because of your duty as a bellator?

395
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,619
Well, not exactly.

396
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,873
The drug problem here is pretty bad.

397
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:08,957
Hey!

398
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,254
I was just telling you about a problem.
There's no need to yell.

399
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,673
You took it too far.

400
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,050
I'm Kim Haeil.

401
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,760
I'll see you soon, Geezer Park.

402
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,261
Have a safe flight.

403
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,346
Bye.

404
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,931
Wait…

405
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,479
What else did I expect from Kim Haeil,
the anger provoker?

406
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,566
I want somaek.

407
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,817
Somaek?

408
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,948
- Do you know somaek?
- Yeah, I know somaek!

409
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,492
I've seen people drink it in K-dramas.

410
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,078
It has to be 30% soju

411
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,913
and 70% beer.

412
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,498
That's the best ratio.

413
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,041
No, no, no, no, no…

414
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,085
It should be 70% soju and 30% beer.

415
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,253
You can go to paradise.

416
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,006
You're a strong lady!

417
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,800
Okay, let's go!

418
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,052
I'm a boss lady.

419
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:06,890
Oh.

420
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,517
Jeez, I want it more now.

421
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,771
I have to go back to the seminary,
so keep an eye on the bathhouse.

422
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,606
Wait a second.

423
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,943
I told you
I'd only help you find Fire Eel.

424
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,821
This meat is so juicy. It's great.

425
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,032
That's not important right now.
I might die at this rate.

426
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,910
I'm a diligent business owner here.

427
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,956
I'm going to die
if the drug dealers find out who I am!

428
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,458
Come on, Gozaev from Vladivostok.

429
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,877
When did you become such a scaredy-cat?

430
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,546
I wouldn't say I'm a scaredy-cat.

431
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,591
Honestly, it's not like
I gain anything out of this.

432
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,885
All right, all right!

433
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,304
Just help me out once more.

434
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,347
You're a big fat liar!

435
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,515
There's going to be more.

436
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,017
How dare you yell at me?

437
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,353
Forgive me.

438
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,188
I'm doomed.

439
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,441
I'm doomed thanks to someone.

440
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,818
You're not. Don't worry.

441
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,403
Anyway,

442
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,697
Father Han and Sister Kim
didn't say they were coming, did they?

443
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,575
I called them earlier,
and they sounded very upset.

444
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,994
They said they're not even
thinking about coming here.

445
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,955
I have a bad feeling.

446
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,958
They haven't called once.

447
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,879
Sister Kim.

448
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,634
I think I've finally thought of something.

449
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:27,554
-What is it? What is it?
-Take a look at this.

450
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,976
"Creating a musical theater group
at Uma Church"?

451
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,772
I can play the piano.

452
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,482
And you…

453
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,816
I was a child actor,

454
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,611
and I can sing.

455
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,366
Okay!

456
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,205
Let me book tickets for the train.

457
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,916
Let's see. Should I buy some shoes first?

458
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,377
I'll be pressing on those pedals.

459
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,016
Pure stealth.

460
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,566
Oh, nice.

461
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,527
I'm safe.

462
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,616
Is this what it feels like
to be a Night Guy?

463
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,793
Hey, Fire Eel.

464
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,294
Hmm?

465
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,547
Let's not make this difficult.

466
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,383
Reducing your sentence by half
isn't a bad deal.

467
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,472
Please let me sleep.

468
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,599
Depriving people of sleep
is a form of abuse.

469
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,935
You bastard. Abuse?

470
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,104
Just give me two names.

471
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,482
If you do,
you won't be in prison for that long.

472
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,777
Sure, I'll be released.
Released as a corpse

473
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,779
without a single drop of blood.

474
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,322
I don't know anything.

475
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,158
All right.

476
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,076
Forget about prison.

477
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,203
I'll think of another way for you to live.

478
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,496
Forget it.

479
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,748
You should worry about yourselves.

480
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,834
Anything could happen to you.

481
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,918
Hey.

482
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,296
I'll end your life if you keep this up.

483
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,881
Oh.

484
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,257
That actually sounds good.

485
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,341
You have a gun, right?

486
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,679
Shoot me right here in the head.

487
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,266
-Go ahead.
-You bastard.

488
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,102
Sir, calm down.

489
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,313
-Hit me.
-You bastard!

490
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,814
Relax, relax.

491
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:44,900
He almost got me.

492
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,403
He's completely shut his mouth.

493
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,614
I'll keep at it until he speaks.

494
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,451
It's okay. Talk to him one more time,

495
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,411
and if he doesn't speak,
take him to Nest 2.

496
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,413
-Nest 2?
-Yeah.

497
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,166
Don't report to Prosecutor Nam.

498
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,793
Are you afraid that word will spread?

499
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,337
Yeah.

500
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,463
If things go south,

501
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,341
we'll lose Fire Eel right under our noses.

502
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,842
Then we won't be able to find the others.

503
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,928
Do you think Prosecutor Nam caught on?

504
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,057
He probably has.

505
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:22,145
Don't respond to any tips
that come in today. We'll get caught.

506
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,730
Yes, sir.

507
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,732
I'll make sure we don't.

508
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,402
This is CCTV footage
from the building next door.

509
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,323
These two made a move
before the cops came.

510
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,783
It's true.

511
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,993
One's in clerical clothing,

512
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,078
and the other isn't.

513
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,080
Are they both cops?

514
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,998
I don't think so.

515
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,124
Take a look at this.

516
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,628
The cops pointed their guns at them

517
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,796
as if they were criminals.

518
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,298
I guess they're not on the same team.

519
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,843
Who are these bastards?

520
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,514
According to these guys,

521
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,683
one was disguised as a priest,

522
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,893
another one seemed like
a Southeast Asian gang member,

523
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,186
and the other….

524
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,814
…looked rather rough.

525
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,942
A priest…

526
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,154
Who's the rough-looking guy?

527
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,413
Dean's office

528
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,665
Father Kim Haeil.

529
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,794
Where are you off to
in such a hurry today?

530
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,548
I'm volunteering with Benedict Chae Dou.

531
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,635
I don't think it's necessary
to go to such lengths.

532
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,638
I'm just keeping an eye on him.

533
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,766
-Keeping an eye on him?
-Yes, it's necessary

534
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,560
to keep a close eye on students like Dou.

535
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,481
Does that mean
I should keep a close eye on you?

536
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,484
What do you mean?

537
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,072
I saw you coming back at dawn.

538
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,748
It was unavoidable.

539
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,916
I had to be there for a friend.

540
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,961
It must've been rough,

541
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,255
seeing that your coat is all torn up.

542
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,508
I guess it ripped
when I climbed over the wall.

543
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,052
-Excuse me?
-Oh, nothing.

544
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,762
I should patch it up.

545
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,847
Since you say it was unavoidable,

546
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,183
I'll let it slide this time.

547
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,934
I'll be off then.

548
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,482
By the way,

549
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:34,486
forcing the students
to exercise in the morning

550
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,404
is a form of violating their rights.

551
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,283
It's not a morning exercise.

552
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,161
Let's just say
it's a ritual of gratitude to God.

553
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:44,913
Sorry?

554
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,915
They're experiencing
the wonders of the human body

555
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,875
that the Lord has given us.

556
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,377
If you will excuse me.

557
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,971
It's so nice being out!

558
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,724
It's hot!

559
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,267
We're volunteering!

560
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:08,478
We even get to…

561
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:11,064
We even get to meet the elderly.

562
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,149
It's so nice.

563
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,278
At least act like you're enjoying this.

564
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,490
This is nice!

565
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,618
There wasn't a hint of sincerity at all.

566
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,496
What's the matter?

567
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,208
I'm enjoying being out,
but you should brace yourself.

568
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,669
What do you mean?

569
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:35,255
I told you the elderly don't like us.

570
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,924
Guide me to the area
where the elderly dislike you the most.

571
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,719
There's no such place.
They all just dislike us.

572
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,768
This place
is still filled with the elderly.

573
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:51,229
There isn't
a single young person living here.

574
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,398
They all don't seem to be well-off.

575
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,650
Does the government not support them?

576
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,527
It's nowhere near enough.

577
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,156
No one here
is supported by their children.

578
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,450
The government's help isn't enough.

579
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,201
If they get sick,

580
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,454
they just pass away.

581
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,217
Sir, are you unwell?

582
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,679
He's addicted to drugs

583
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,473
and more are getting addicted.

584
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,520
Father Kim, there too.

585
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:48,203
Shouldn't the authorities
do something about this?

586
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,164
Are they just neglecting them?

587
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:56,085
They say it's just the irrational behavior
of the impoverished, lonely elderly.

588
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,338
Have you contacted
the media or politicians?

589
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,089
A long time ago.

590
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:03,593
But no one took an interest,
so it was never publicized.

591
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,220
No one cares about this place.

592
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,181
They just stop by during the elections.

593
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,602
I heard you can easily get your hands
on something called hepanyl

594
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,938
because it's cheap.

595
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,817
They're here again.

596
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:25,073
You guys do nothing but tell us
to believe in God and have faith.

597
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:26,866
Bastards.

598
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,368
There's no faith!

599
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,620
You're all con artists and Satan himself!

600
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,831
Sir, we're just trying to--

601
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,334
We spoke carelessly. Please forgive us.

602
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,460
You know what?

603
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,672
Give this old druggie some money.

604
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,091
- We don't have money.
- Sure you do!

605
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,634
I heard from another priest

606
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,095
that you earn
more than one million won per month.

607
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,349
He's just going to buy more drugs
with that money.

608
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,769
An old man with advanced gastric cancer
should at least do drugs

609
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,479
if he can't get treatment.

610
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,066
Huh?

611
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,369
How are things going?

612
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,459
We're tracking
the Drug Investigation Unit detectives

613
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,503
by their phone number.

614
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,256
I think we'll have their location
in an hour.

615
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,800
Report back to me
the second you have them.

616
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:30,013
The police can't make use
of modern conveniences, can they?

617
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,891
So what if they live in an advanced
internet nation? They can't do shit.

618
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:36,895
We're talking about
a third of your original sentence.

619
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,772
That's more or less
being released on probation.

620
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,025
I can't tell you
even if I was found innocent.

621
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,860
Don't be so scared.

622
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,862
I'll protect you.

623
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,197
Look.

624
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,949
Even Bryan Mills from Taken

625
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:52,827
and John Wick can't protect me.

626
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,631
Do you have kimchi?

627
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,382
You punk.

628
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:11,387
Jeez,
you didn't have to hit me for that.

629
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,943
This is so heavy.
I should've ordered Jeonju bibimbap.

630
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,487
You said you wanted tuna mayo

631
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,197
and even ate mine.

632
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,158
Why don't they make half-and-half menus?

633
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,535
Like Jeonju mayo.

634
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,413
Half-and-half dishes

635
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,082
aren't as satisfying.

636
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,502
Giving up one thing to choose another

637
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,671
works up your appetite even more.

638
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,756
You have a point.

639
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,342
When did you become such a wise man?

640
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,426
Come on.

641
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,514
I graduated from a prestigious university
in Russia.

642
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,767
My professor lives in Vladivostok,

643
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,894
and let me tell you something.

644
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:04,107
I've read Dostoevsky
and Maxim Gorky's works with him.

645
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,150
My professor lives in Namcheon-dong.

646
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,362
I feel so gross.

647
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,823
I'm going to take a shower.

648
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,121
Jeez, it's hot.

649
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:25,545
Gosh, my eyes are so strained
from being in the dark all day.

650
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,173
How do I turn on the lights again?

651
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,679
Why is that going up?

652
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,347
I'm sorry. I'll put it back down.

653
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,767
Darn it.

654
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,644
This isn't it.

655
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,896
Jeez, what's going on?

656
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,608
What is that?

657
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,822
Damn it, my eyes.

658
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,407
Hey! What are you doing?

659
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,284
Close this!

660
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,119
Oh, my.

661
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,912
It's unsettlingly healthy.

662
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,042
-Not bad, right?
-Not bad at all!

663
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,545
How do I cleanse my eyes?

664
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:15,344
We haven't even opened yet,
and we already have a lot of customers.

665
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,056
People are more interested in it
than I expected.

666
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,226
I need to do something about my appearance
if I want to live here.

667
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,855
Incheol and I will need new clothes.

668
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:26,939
Shall we head to the department store?

669
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,817
Let's get new looks for our new business.

670
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,194
Ma'am!

671
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,697
That could've been dangerous.

672
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,574
You shouldn't carry so much stuff.

673
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,409
I'm sorry.

674
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,870
I'm a bit greedy, you see.

675
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:43,289
We'll help you. Where do you live?

676
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,208
I know where she lives.

677
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,751
- Thank you.
- We'll do it.

678
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,711
-Okay.
-It's okay, you can step aside.

679
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,422
All right.

680
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,673
It's okay, we got it.

681
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:56,385
Hurry up, will you? Use your strength.

682
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,647
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

683
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,482
We're okay.

684
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,609
Come in for some ramyeon

685
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,694
and keep this old woman company, will you?

686
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,786
- Okay, we will.
- Come on in.

687
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,830
I'll make the ramyeon

688
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,456
and clean the house for you.

689
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,460
Father Kim!

690
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,467
How about you clean

691
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,303
and I make the ramyeon?

692
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,347
I'm an expert at making ramyeon.

693
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,641
-A rammelier, if you will.
-Right.

694
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,103
He clearly doesn't care
about how tired I am.

695
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,315
I would've bought some instant rice
if I had known there wasn't any.

696
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,525
It's okay.

697
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,653
I can't digest rice all that well,
so I prefer noodles.

698
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:57,405
Do you live alone?

699
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,532
Yes.

700
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:01,909
What about

701
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,828
your children?

702
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,622
I have a son,

703
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,750
but I haven't been in touch with him
for over five years.

704
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,463
Ma'am.

705
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,383
Are you unwell?

706
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,470
I have a bad lung, but I'll be fine.

707
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,977
Goodness, that's enough now.

708
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,313
Your knees must be hurting.

709
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,565
I'm almost done.

710
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,108
You know what?

711
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,403
Father Kim can sing
Lim Youngwoong's songs really well.

712
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,155
Really?

713
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,450
Could you sing one of his songs for me?

714
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,203
Well,

715
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,538
I don't usually…

716
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,749
She's waiting, Father Kim.

717
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,379
All right. One, two, three, four.

718
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,424
♪ What did you believe in me ♪

Uma Nursing Home

725
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,260
Gift of love

726
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,473
This is it, sir.

727
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,686
All right.

728
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:52,770
"Welcome back, Chairman Kim"

729
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,313
Let me introduce you to the person

730
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,400
who's been donating to the nursing home
and giving us our paychecks.

731
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,527
Chairman Kim. A round of applause!

732
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,203
Apologies for my belated visit.
I had some business to attend to abroad.

733
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,288
Nice to meet you.

734
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,039
- Oh my.
- Goodness.

735
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,959
-He's handsome and polite.
-That's quite all right.

736
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,295
We're grateful for all that you've done.

737
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,713
Please.

738
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:23,259
If the country isn't taking care of you,
then we should.

739
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,136
Isn't that how it should be?

740
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,139
You're not skipping your meals, right?

741
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,849
-Of course not.
-Don't worry.

742
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,978
Tell me if my employees don't provide meat
three times a week.

743
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,688
I'll make sure to fire them.

744
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,232
You're the best!

745
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,484
You can feel free to spend your time here.

746
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,528
But for those of you

747
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,989
who still have the energy
and passion to work,

748
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,657
please let me know.

749
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,201
I know just the place
that will pay you well.

750
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,995
Even us old people?

751
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,373
Of course. Do you think someone
as handsome and rich as me would lie?

752
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,500
-You're handsome and competent.
-Right.

753
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,462
Consider me your grandson,
and let me give you a gift.

754
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,388
Over there too.

755
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,400
Damn it.

756
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,027
I smell like old people.

757
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,411
Mmm!

758
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,834
Ma'am, about the boxes you collect.

759
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,712
Don't collect too many. It's dangerous.

760
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,090
Today's my last day.

761
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,883
I'm going to work starting tomorrow.

762
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,427
But you seem to have trouble walking.

763
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:49,929
What kind of job is it?

764
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:53,516
It's a job I can do at a factory
while sitting down.

765
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,436
What kind of factory is it?

766
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,563
Well…

767
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,982
it's a factory that makes delicious stuff.

768
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,236
-That's what I heard.
-Oh, I guess it's a food factory.

769
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,115
Yes, that's right.

770
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,827
I'm going to make money,
so I'm done collecting boxes.

771
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,711
It isn't much, but buy yourself
something delicious with this.

772
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:24,130
It's okay, I'm fine.

773
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,632
I just met you today.
It isn't right for me…

774
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,716
Take it.

775
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,718
He's rich.

776
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,971
But still, I can't just take it.

777
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,807
Flex.

778
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,143
- I'm a rich priest.
- Goodness me.

779
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,978
Thank you so much.

780
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,146
No problem.

781
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,231
Eat up.

782
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,485
Iced peach tea

783
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,995
What am I doing?

784
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,789
Here you go.

785
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,293
By the way, you gave her quite a sum.
Will you be okay?

786
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,546
I'm a rich priest. You saw it earlier.

787
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,298
Kim Haeil's flex.

788
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,593
The cardinal has your back
and you're rich.

789
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,303
Are you sure you're not a scammer?

790
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,013
You little.

791
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,807
You have a hammer for a fist.

792
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,268
Come by this place often
even if it's without me

793
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,020
and watch for
more of the elderly getting addicted.

794
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,771
But there's nothing we can do about it.

795
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,816
Even if that's the case,
we can't just sit back.

796
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,234
Also,

797
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,445
don't tell the elderly here

798
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,198
to have faith and whatnot.

799
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,574
Then what do I tell them?

800
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,871
Tell them you won't let them die alone
on the streets.

801
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,582
Wouldn't that be better?

802
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,086
What time is it?

803
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,923
I'm late.

804
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,716
Wait, hang on. I'll finish up later.

805
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,842
-Hey.
-Where are you going?

806
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,928
-Go back to the seminary.
-What? What about this?

807
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,142
You didn't even clean up.

808
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,772
Busan Station

809
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,824
I think you went a little overboard.

810
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,201
You told me not to let anyone,
including my parents, recognize me.

811
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,746
Now that I think about it,
I shouldn't have said that.

812
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,668
You've gotten a lot stronger.
Do you train in iron palm?

813
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,545
You're so annoying, but give me a hug.

814
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,213
Goodness.

815
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,631
You haven't changed.

816
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,259
Are you taking care of yourself?

817
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,220
Of course.
I'm taking my medication regularly.

818
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,513
You came sooner than I expected.

819
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,307
I came as soon as I reported back to JB.

820
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,850
You were pestering me to come.

821
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,228
All right, ready, action!

822
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,188
What are you talking about?

823
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:32,192
You need to fill me in
for me to think of a plan or something.

824
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,527
Did I not tell you?

825
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,865
You didn't.
You didn't tell me a single thing.

826
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,117
I'm also not in my right mind.

827
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,619
What was I thinking,

828
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,829
coming all the way here from LA
when I knew nothing?

829
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,497
Before you lose it even more,

830
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,791
let me tell you.

831
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,379
Those scumbags!

832
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,301
They're really pissing me off.

833
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:03,182
I used to buy ice cream for Sangyeon
outside the church when he was young.

834
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,101
He was always a lovable and nice kid.

835
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,394
How could they

836
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,314
-force someone like him to take drugs?
-Calm down.

837
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,524
Calm down.
Anyway, that's what happened to Sangyeon

838
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,234
and also how we caught Fire Eel.

839
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,569
Okay.

840
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,488
Give me more information on those guys.

841
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,199
I'll dig into them
like I'm digging up their graves.

842
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,825
I knew you'd ask,

843
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,786
so I had it prepared.

844
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:24,995
Nice!

845
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,165
I don't know who
or what these bastards are,

846
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,751
but I'll make sure
they have a great time behind bars.

847
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,671
It'll be nice and cold in there!

848
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,798
Geezer Park.

849
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,050
Your anger is like a health tonic.

850
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,052
It gives me so much strength and energy.

851
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,471
I'm human taurine, aren't I?

852
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,063
Let's go!

853
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,696
Pawn Park

854
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,074
What is it?

855
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,575
Chairman Kim wants to see you, sir.

856
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,285
Chairman, my foot.

857
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,788
What is he, your master?

858
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,540
Hey, Park.

859
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,542
Why don't you choose
the location this time?

860
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,127
Make sure it's a good one.

861
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,269
Hello, sir.

862
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,271
What is this place?

863
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,398
"Sturgeon farm"?

864
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,358
It's not too bad.

865
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,610
- Holy crap!
- Jeez, you scared me.

866
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,028
Who the hell is he?

867
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,780
He's the owner of this place.

868
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:44,950
What a mug.

869
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,411
What's with the scar?

870
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,416
Nice to meet you.

871
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,670
I'm Kim Hongsik from Laos.

872
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,715
You look normal for a drug dealer.

873
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:02,342
Thank you.

874
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,595
It's an honor to meet you.

875
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:06,638
I see you still know your Korean.

876
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,931
Huh?

877
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,558
Let's go in for a cup of Laotian coffee.

878
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,726
Sure.

879
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,186
Please go in.

880
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,701
You should've just stayed in Laos.

881
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,369
Why did you come to Korea?

882
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,997
It's the best country to run a business.

883
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,376
It may seem like a refined,
law-abiding democracy on the outside,

884
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,462
but on the inside,
it's as corrupt as South America.

885
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,546
Wow.

886
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,964
That's very insulting,

887
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,549
but you make a good point.

888
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,718
Hey, drug dealer boss.

889
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,638
Just do as you always have.

890
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,807
Just pay your tribute.

891
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,518
Whatever mess you make,

892
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,813
I'll make sure to clean it up well
without a trace.

893
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,731
You're amazing.

894
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:01,610
You don't want our drugs or money,
but just tribute.

895
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,363
More of a win for you guys that way, no?

896
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,156
It's a win for you too.

897
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,367
You won't get locked up
even if you get caught.

898
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,701
Am I right?

899
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,871
Do you take me for a joke

900
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,915
just because we're in the same boat now?

901
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,667
Graduated as a geography major
at a regional university.

902
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,710
A law school graduate prosecutor
without any connections.

903
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,754
Got a position in Seocho-dong
but was an outsider.

904
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,967
For heaven's sake, this is why
this is such a huge issue here.

905
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,594
How is one's personal information
not protected at all?

906
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,847
For such a lone wolf to survive,

907
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,683
there's nothing better than knowing
the weaknesses of the big shots.

908
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,601
It's better when it involves drugs.

909
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,479
Even better when it involves their kids.

910
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,732
If you keep at it for 10 years or so,

911
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,193
you might have a chance
to become the president.

912
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,154
You know your stuff.

913
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:49,324
Just a little.

914
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,831
I'm asking this as a joke,

915
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,250
but…

916
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,460
can you make me the president?

917
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,138
If that's what you want.

918
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,768
I said it's a joke.

919
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:20,606
Did you notice

920
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:23,400
a helicopter flying above us
for a while now?

921
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,985
Mm.

922
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,029
You're right, I hear it.
Are they spraying pesticides?

923
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,785
That's not it. It's the SWAT helicopter.

924
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,539
I was going to have you arrested
if you were some brainless drug dealer.

925
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:41,627
But I guess that won't be necessary.

926
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,711
I'll have them gone.

927
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,881
Did you know

928
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,967
that your parents in Gimhae
are tending to the plants

929
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,386
in their garden?

930
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:55,974
If you were a brainless prosecutor,

931
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,644
I was going to have them
take their last breath peacefully.

932
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,521
You're one crazy bastard.

933
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,982
Let me know if you need me
to take care of anything.

934
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,943
I'll make sure to get it done
nice and clean.

935
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:12,032
All right. Let's do this.

936
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,497
I'll become the king,

937
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:22,542
and you'll become the emperor.

938
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,921
Even if we can't part on good terms,

939
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,131
let's at least avoid a messy one.

940
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,800
Sounds good.

941
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,640
We found out where Fire Eel was taken.

942
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,392
Hmm.

943
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,436
With the power of science.

944
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,233
Man, the power of science?

945
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,492
Here comes the drink.

946
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,869
Is that too much?

947
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,301
Mmm.

948
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,721
This hits the spot.

949
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,102
So the drug boss went missing,

950
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,563
and now Uma-gu is a drug-free place?

951
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,483
Things sound suspiciously smooth.

952
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,156
A continuous drop in drug-related crimes
in Uma-gu, Busan

953
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:41,079
I smell something real fishy
from these guys.

954
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:44,958
Mmm!

955
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,544
I love this smell.

956
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,017
I pray

957
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,561
that I won't have to use this.

958
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,272
But guess what?

959
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:10,233
I'm going to use it
even if I don't have to!

960
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,989
You're all dead meat.

961
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,246
Who are you?

962
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,415
I'm Father Matthew,

963
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,544
and I'll be serving
at Gudam Church temporarily.

964
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,463
Oh, hello.

965
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,548
By the way,

966
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,009
did Sister Kim and Father Han
go somewhere?

967
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,721
They went to Busan for volunteer service.

968
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:40,806
Busan?

969
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,224
Jeez, you startled me.

970
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,267
That's right.

971
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,604
Do you know when they're coming back?

972
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,565
They said they'll be back
in a month or two.

973
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,901
Thank you. Come on, Songsak.

974
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,153
They all went and left us behind.

975
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,488
They didn't even tell us.

976
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,907
How could they do this to us?

977
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,327
Let go of me, you pig.

978
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,538
You jerk.

979
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,264
-Take a look at this place.
-I know.

980
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,227
My goodness.

981
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,320
Sister Sophia?

982
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,072
Father Simon?

983
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,206
Welcome.

984
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,833
Nice to meet you.

985
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,629
I'm sure things are busy there too,
but thank you for coming all the way here.

986
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,840
Not at all.

987
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,218
We appreciate your volunteering
despite having no ties to this church.

988
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:03,930
It's beautiful here, and you can still
feel some of the old charm.

989
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,100
Haengseong-dong is my hometown,

990
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:10,770
which is why I've decided
to live the rest of my life here.

991
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,482
It's our long-cherished wish

992
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,068
to create a musical theater group
and perform.

993
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:20,906
Is there a particular reason why that is?

994
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:26,494
There are a lot of homeless people,
troublemakers, and drug addicts here.

995
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,997
Nothing would bring us more joy

996
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,792
than to see them
find the right path in life again

997
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,586
by watching our performances.

998
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,838
That's such a wonderful idea.

999
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,175
We'll do the best we can to help you.

1000
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,219
Right.

1001
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,346
There's a young priest

1002
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,389
who recently joined the seminary nearby.

1003
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,434
Oh?

1004
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,770
Who, exactly?

1005
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,814
He's very tall and handsome.

1006
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,524
His name was…

1007
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:00,737
- Was it Father Michael Kim Haeil?
- Yes, that's right.

1008
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,822
Kim Haeil!

1009
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:08,578
What was that?

1010
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,874
Jeez, I have the chills.

1011
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:20,131
You should've covered the whole thing.

1012
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,763
Come on.

1013
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,766
I'm going out!
Shower quickly and watch them!

1014
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,393
You've got to be kidding me.

1015
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,527
What am I supposed to do
if you leave me alone here?

1016
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,570
What if the bad guys come?

1017
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,911
- Let me help you.
- It's okay.

1018
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,540
Do you do this by yourself every day?

1019
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,791
No.

1020
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:57,460
There are elderly people
who collect boxes,

1021
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,755
but they all said
they're stopping starting today.

1022
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,048
Why?

1023
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:06,011
It seems like they all found a job.

1024
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,305
I'm just hoping it's a good one.

1025
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,140
Ah.

1026
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,601
One second.

1027
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,604
What is it? Are they on the move?

1028
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,274
What?

1029
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,985
When? When did this happen?

1030
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:23,778
Hey!

1031
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,656
I'll see you down there soon.

1032
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,450
Okay, bye.

1033
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,661
Dean Lee.

1034
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,832
I'm sorry,
but I have an urgent matter to attend to.

1035
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,001
Go ahead.

1036
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,045
-I'll help you next time.
-Sure.

1037
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,051
Jeez, you're so fast.

1038
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,635
Where are they?

1039
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,804
Where?

1040
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,182
There they are.

1041
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:56,770
Stop running!

1042
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,981
- Hello, Father Kim.
- Hello.

1043
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,566
- Hello.
- Hello.

1044
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,110
- I heard a lot about you.
- I see.

1045
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,363
I hear you all served
at Gudam Church together.

1046
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,697
Yes.

1047
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,324
We're very close.

1048
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:11,659
And you're a detective

1049
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,119
- from Gudam, right?
- Yes, that's right.

1050
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,705
I heard you're here
to treat your heart disease.

1051
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:16,831
Yes, correct.

1052
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:20,543
- I shouldn't have ran.
- Oh, no.

1053
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,379
Where are you staying?

1054
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,048
- Nearby the church actually.
- I see.

1055
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,093
Anyway,

1056
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,428
the church.

1057
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:33,681
What about Gudam Church?

1058
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:36,726
We asked Father Matthew
to take over temporarily.

1059
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:39,687
It hasn't even been a week
since his retirement.

1060
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,190
Stress.

1061
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,276
-Father Kim.
-Yes?

1062
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,738
If you're going to go rogue,

1063
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:53,660
why in the world did you say
we're your family and comites?

1064
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,704
She's right. You're being two-faced.

1065
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:57,956
I'm so disappointed!

1066
00:56:58,998 --> 00:56:59,999
They're right.

1067
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,128
You think we stayed silent
because we're some fools?

1068
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,255
We were trying to cater to our bellator.

1069
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,631
You don't care about our sacrifices,
do you?

1070
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:08,383
-Do you?
-Do you?

1071
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,051
Okay, I understand you two.

1072
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,262
What did you sacrifice, Gu Daeyoung?

1073
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,721
Tell me.

1074
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:17,392
Also, aren't we your comites?

1075
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,852
Here's comes number one.

1076
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,688
Number one. Prosecutor Park, number two.

1077
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,190
-Number three.
-Number four.

1078
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,526
Yohan, number five. Songsak, number six.

1079
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,777
-Those two are in Seoul.
-Right.

1080
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,947
We swore
that we'd fulfill our duties as comites…

1081
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,574
Top secret.

1082
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,825
Lower your voice.

1083
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,035
-Please.
-Right.

1084
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,455
All right.

1085
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,290
I'm sorry.

1086
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,042
But make sure you only stay at the church.

1087
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,044
Don't get yourselves involved
in anything dangerous.

1088
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,172
I'll let you know
if I need your help, okay?

1089
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:51,634
See how easy that was?

1090
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:56,347
We'll make sure to aid you
to the best of our abilities as comites.

1091
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,099
Pinky promise.

1092
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:06,816
I'm listening.

1093
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:11,362
There's a van that arrived 10 minutes ago
and hasn't left since.

1094
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,949
It seems like they came to see
how many they're up against.

1095
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,410
I think they're going to get raided soon.

1096
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,661
Is that so?

1097
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,622
Are they with the drug dealers,
police, or the prosecution?

1098
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,959
Their arms are completely tatted up,

1099
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,045
so I don't think
they're with the police or prosecution.

1100
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,963
Okay, I'll be there soon. Stay there.

1101
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,467
Hey, come on.

1102
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,010
We have to go. Someone came.

1103
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,595
-Okay, let's go.
-Come on, hurry.

1104
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,222
-Stay here. I'll be back.
-Okay, okay.

1105
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,349
-Hurry.
-Stay safe!

1106
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:40,850
Be careful!

1107
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,435
I want to go too!

1108
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,520
Me too.

1109
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,087
Hello, sir.

1110
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,257
- Did they get Fire Eel?
- Yes, the guys are there.

1111
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,300
Prosecutor Nam will take care of it.

1112
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,140
It's truly amazing.
My Moon of Seoul.

1113
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,686
-Let me tell you something.
-Yes, sir.

1114
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,187
That ship is a moving base.

1115
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,231
I had a few of those back in the day.

1116
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,692
It's so damn cool, sir.

1117
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:32,944
It's almost like a phantom ship.

1118
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,029
-How'd you know?
-Sorry?

1119
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,740
A lot of people died in there,
so it's full of ghosts.

1120
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,451
There are ghosts in there.

1121
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:42,870
Ghosts?

1122
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,789
Should I get a talisman?

1123
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,875
They're Southeast Asian ghosts,

1124
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,086
so a Korean one won't work.

1125
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,089
Move out of the way.

1126
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,008
There are ghosts in there.

1127
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,177
Check if there are
any Southeast Asian shamans around.

1128
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,637
-Southeast Asian…
-Wait.

1129
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,681
Weren't you in the ROKMC,
the ghost-catching Marines?

1130
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,141
You can catch the ghosts yourself.

1131
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,976
-Me? The Marines?
-Yes.

1132
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:07,562
- I was lying!
- Oh, come on, sir!

1133
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,063
Sir!

1134
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,446
Dangerous!
Do not enter

1135
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,782
Goodbye, sir!

1136
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,695
Hwasang Bathhouse

1137
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:58,821
Will you be okay without me?

1138
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,323
Yes, I'll be fine.

1139
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,533
At least tell me where I'm going.

1140
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,411
You didn't tell me what I wanted to know,
so I'm not telling you.

1141
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,080
You're so petty.

1142
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,499
I have a wish.

1143
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,959
My mother lives alone in Geumcho-dong.

1144
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,711
Can I visit her once?

1145
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,588
This isn't a taxi.

1146
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,674
Please, Detective.

1147
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,009
She's bedridden,

1148
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,844
so I'd like to see her.

1149
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,429
You punk.

1150
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,307
You shouldn't have gotten into drugs
if you were that worried.

1151
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,767
Listen, you bastard.

1152
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,935
Don't do anything stupid

1153
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,603
or else.

1154
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,071
Hwasang Bathhouse

1155
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,873
It looks like
they're taking Fire Eel somewhere.

1156
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,083
Who's with him?

1157
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,335
One female detective and a male detective.

1158
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,795
Where are they going?

1159
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:57,880
They probably have another hideout.

1160
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,049
They know that it's not safe here.

1161
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:02,802
Look over there. Over there.

1162
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,973
-Come on.
-Wait a second.

1163
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,307
Gosh, my neck.

1164
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,892
What's wrong with you?

1165
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,696
They're going.

1166
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,493
They're following.

1167
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:37,336
Who are they?

1168
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,095
Wait, I know them.

1169
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,014
They're the Violent
Crimes Team guys at Uma Police Station.

1170
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:49,682
They're in cahoots too?

1171
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,476
Things aren't so great here either, huh?

1172
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,602
What's with all these people?

1173
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,270
Stay and keep watch.
We'll follow Fire Eel.

1174
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,354
-Okay.
-Let's go.

1175
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,817
-Are you okay?
-Jeez. Let's go.

1176
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,115
- This is a nice bathhouse.
- Nice!

1177
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,825
Don't move.

1178
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,119
Freeze. All right, all right.

1179
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,538
Everyone, stop what you're doing

1180
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,540
and please do as we say.

1181
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,334
Who are you?

1182
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,503
We're the Uma Police
Violent Crimes Team.

1183
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,046
Ah, Uma?

1184
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:21,756
"Detective Gu"

1185
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:23,257
I'm well aware of who you are.

1186
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,969
We're public officials
who do police work like you guys.

1187
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,846
Police work?

1188
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,890
-Are you sure it's not dirty work?
-You little.

1189
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:33,518
I don't believe we've met before,
yet you're crossing the line.

1190
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:34,977
Don't you agree?

1191
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:36,896
Hey.

1192
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:41,692
We have no reason to follow your orders.

1193
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,070
The Uma Police Violent Crimes Team

1194
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:49,075
will execute the arrest warrant
against the nameless team

1195
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,660
of the Busan
Metropolitan Police Agency's…

1196
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,079
Drug Investigation Unit.

1197
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,082
Arrest warrant, my foot.

1198
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:58,251
We don't follow your orders.

1199
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:01,546
Must you take the hard way?

1200
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:05,132
Where's the trust between us?

1201
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,676
What are they saying?

1202
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,135
Yes, sir.

1203
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,054
He's right here.

1204
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:11,138
"Prosecutor Nam Duhun"

1205
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:14,267
How've you been, you asshole?

1206
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,185
Hello, sir.

1207
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:20,314
I understand the pain of losing your guys.

1208
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:23,359
But why are you digging up stuff
and going off on your own?

1209
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,821
We're just fulfilling our duties.

1210
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:27,905
"Uma Police Hyeon Woocheol"

1211
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:30,575
Did you forget about the changes
to investigative powers?

1212
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,578
If you make a mistake,
you should ask for forgiveness.

1213
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,913
It's not a crime
to go after drug dealers.

1214
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,999
It's a crime when you do it.

1215
01:04:38,916 --> 01:04:40,042
Hey, Uma guys.

1216
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,878
You're permitted to fire without warning

1217
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,671
if they don't comply with the arrest.

1218
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:45,381
Yes, sir.

1219
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,300
Fire?

1220
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,136
- Arrogant bastards.
- Oh, jeez.

1221
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,267
That means
we can forget about the blank shot.

1222
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:57,977
Yes, sir.

1223
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,772
Hurry up and cuff them.

1224
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,983
Make sure we have them all.

1225
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,276
"Team Leader Lee"

1226
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,862
Those sneaky bastards.

1227
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,572
What do we do now?

1228
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,741
Let's get to Nest 2 first.

1229
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,326
What are you talking about?

1230
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,036
It's two of you
against God knows how many.

1231
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,079
We're screwed.

1232
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,539
Shut up!

1233
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,207
- Hey, watch out! Watch out!
- We're never…

1234
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:33,804
Yeonggwan.

1235
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,264
Yeonggwan! Yeonggwan!

1236
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:36,849
Yeonggwan!

1237
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,977
Fire Eel, are you okay?

1238
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,562
Hey, look.

1239
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,357
Look over there.

1240
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:09,674
Mother.

1241
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:13,177
I'll be with you soon. Wait for me.

1242
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,707
Wait, why are they…

1243
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,592
What the…

1244
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,886
It's been a while
since we fought on the streets.

1245
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:56,971
Tell me about it.

1246
01:06:57,054 --> 01:07:00,057
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

1247
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,393
Your tickets
for the express lane to hell are ready!

1248
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:04,645
What is he saying?

1249
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:13,988
Huh?

1250
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:03,829
#Yohan, it's your brother!

1251
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,165
Hello.

1252
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:15,007
I told you not to look for me.

1253
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,094
Your brother's here
to help you make money.

1254
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:21,055
I don't consider a thug like you
my brother.

1255
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:23,307
Help me make money? Yeah, right.

1256
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,809
Maybe I was being too nice.

1257
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:25,893
You need some sense
knocked into you.

1258
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,436
Excuse me.

1259
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,486
Oh, wow.

1260
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,488
Wow, you two look identical.

1261
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:39,532
-Who are you?
-Me?

1262
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,867
I'm Yohan's friend,

1263
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:44,203
Songsak Thekarattanapurasat.

1264
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:48,749
Are you Yohan's older brother Oh Chorong?

1265
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:49,834
I am. Why?

1266
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,503
Oh, no wonder.

1267
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,672
I heard that a long time ago,

1268
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,092
you took his scholarship and money
for your dad's hospital bills

1269
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,635
and ran away from home.

1270
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:03,055
Why would you share
our family affairs with just anyone?

1271
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,683
-He's not just anyone. He's my friend.
-I'm his friend.

1272
01:09:10,604 --> 01:09:13,858
If you're here to bother Yohan,
you should leave!

1273
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:17,570
Jeez, you're annoying me
on an international level.

1274
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,697
Hey, I'm a martial arts master.

1275
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,699
-One hit from me, and you're dead.
-Hmm.

1276
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:24,034
Then hit me with your best shot.

1277
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:26,328
I won't.

1278
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,831
Why would I?

1279
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,374
What would I have to gain from…

1280
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:39,133
You really look exactly the same.

1281
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:43,470
A pig here, a pig there…

1282
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,640
Yohan, hold on.

1283
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,475
Calm down, calm down, calm down!

1284
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,941
Songsak!

1285
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,154
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1286
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,156
Things won't be any different
even if I go with you.

1287
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,116
I'll make sure
you can continue investigating.

1288
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,368
She's going to make a deal
with Fire Eel soon.

1289
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:07,995
Who the hell are they?

1290
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,455
-Damn you.
-What are you doing?

1291
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,207
A new ring was probably made.

1292
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,584
This factory and Uma-gu

1293
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:15,336
will become a place for seniors.

1294
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,922
What? There's this mad,
ambitious look in his eyes.

1295
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,840
I'm James Kim Hongsik.

1296
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,592
What's the plan
for luring the drug dealers?

1297
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:23,135
Let's make a deal.

1298
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,720
I've already taken care of it in advance.

1299
01:10:24,803 --> 01:10:26,972
The National Intelligence Service.
Fire Eel!

1300
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,934
I'll give them a taste
of every corner of hell.

1301
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,645
With God's help.

1302
