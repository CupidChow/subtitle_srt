00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,253
The Fiery Priest Season 2

2
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,540
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,255
There's a man named Park,

8
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,591
and he's a chief prosecutor.

9
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,176
Apparently, he's trying to take me down.

10
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,802
I guess you got caught.

11
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,055
He used to be
in the Drug Investigation Division

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,556
in the Central Investigation Department.

13
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,349
He's so tenacious.

14
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,976
Who knew such a person existed in Korea?

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,352
He said he was going to take me down…

16
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,855
-Who are you?
-…and declare war on all drugs in Busan.

17
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,357
Not a single person
who declared war on drugs

18
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,609
lived to see another day.

19
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,944
Who the hell are you?

20
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:15,784
Stop

21
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:22,165
Episode 7
A Priest's Duty Begins with Fury

22
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,839
Man, you guys look well.

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,592
You guys should go wash up.

24
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,676
Good work.

25
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,763
I said good work!

26
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,766
Those guys are so damn rude all the time.

27
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,434
Hey, how old are you?

28
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,770
-I think they're pretty old.
-Forget it. That's enough.

29
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,900
I'll teach those rude bastards a lesson
one of these days. Don't worry.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,070
Make sure to use mineral water
instead of industrial water

31
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,781
to freeze the important man in the trunk.

32
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,033
Answer me.

33
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,118
Yes, sir.

34
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,285
Jeez.

35
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,287
The weather's great.

36
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,872
Yes, this way.

37
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,874
Yes.

38
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,170
My goodness.

39
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,713
Look at you famous influencers.

40
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,383
Hang on, let's take a picture.

41
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,676
-I ought to beat you up.
-Jeez.

42
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,637
- Stop it!
- Stop.

43
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,180
Did you give our photos a like?

44
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,348
Of course.

45
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,599
I liked it twice.

46
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,102
Wait, that unlikes it, right?

47
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,228
Cut the crap.

48
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,105
- Where's our tribute?
- Come with me.

49
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,815
Drink up!

50
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,776
Goodness me.

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,320
Look at these ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:38,032
You guys must be worn out
from all the fun you've been having.

53
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,036
-Fun!
-Jeez.

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,372
- What's with the look in your eyes?
- Hey, calm down.

55
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,167
Stand up.

56
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,752
Stand up.

57
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,671
Do I have to speak Lao?

58
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,841
You didn't have to come by.
We took care of it.

59
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,719
I just came by to pay my respects,

60
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,762
not because I was worried.

61
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,724
Korea sure is a country
full of courteous people.

62
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,476
Is he in there?

63
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,815
Wow, it must be nice and cool in there.

64
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,859
Nothing beats a reefer truck
when you're hot.

65
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,112
Which one is it?

66
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,370
You should've just laid low.

67
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,915
Why did you have to poke your nose
into our business?

68
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,958
I doubt you'll go to heaven.

69
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,378
Here's to hoping that you won't be
a judicial officer in your next life.

70
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,047
You don't need to worry about that.

71
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,132
He'll be reborn as a sturgeon soon.

72
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,635
That's not too bad either.

73
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,388
Rest in peace, sir.

74
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,226
Back away, Polka Dot!

75
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,519
Polka…

76
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,150
Who's calling?

77
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,320
Prosecutor Nam Duhun

78
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,656
Yes, sir?

79
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,200
- Were you sleeping?
- Sorry?

80
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,952
Yes, I guess I was.

81
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,037
Anyway, why did you call?

82
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,497
Why else would I have called?

83
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,082
You have Park Junhyeok to take care of.

84
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh, right.

85
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,211
I'm sorry, I'll be right there.

86
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,728
Bring more water!

87
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,356
- Hurry!
- Water!

88
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,361
This is a little preview of hell, Father.

89
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:56,087
He's spotted us.
Go slow so he can keep up.

90
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,093
Hey, over here!

91
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,494
Can you even see with those on?

92
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,329
Sir.

93
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,997
-You should take those off.
-Right.

94
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,500
Criminal Investigation Team 1
would've received the tribute

95
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,086
if the statue of the Virgin Mary
hadn't burned down.

96
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,172
You'd better thank the Virgin Mary.

97
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,549
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

98
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,220
- What are you doing?
- How ridiculously holy.

99
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,056
Come on in.

100
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm sorry I'm late.

101
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,893
Don't worry about it.

102
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,146
This is Prosecutor Park Kyungsun
whom I've told you about before.

103
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,231
Treat her well.

104
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,859
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

105
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,611
You know them, right?

106
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,613
The famous detectives
who had a photoshoot.

107
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,324
I do. I'll look forward to the next one.

108
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,702
If you'll excuse me now.

109
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,787
Prosecutor Park.

110
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,913
Go easy, all right?

111
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,998
Don't traumatize
the young druggies too much.

112
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,291
Yes, sir.

113
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,918
I'll control myself.

114
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,002
Good luck.

115
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,426
Sit down!

116
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,223
Oh, shit, polka dots.

117
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,768
You're rather harsh with your words.

118
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,228
What's a mere prosecutor doing here?

119
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,312
Bring in someone higher!

120
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,815
Listen, Mr. Young Polka Dot.

121
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,153
I'm not in the best mood right now
because I had a bad dream.

122
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,905
So let's not provoke each other
and make this easy, okay?

123
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:31,367
Wow, you're pretty,
and you have a way with words.

124
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,996
-How old are you?
-How old am I?

125
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,791
Old enough to be your mom, you bastard.

126
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,670
You think you're here to hang out?

127
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,465
All right, let's begin.

128
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,217
"Amazing Alcohol"

129
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,969
The Wharf Roach Gang

130
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,471
is out drinking at this place.

131
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,307
Oh! It's not far from here. Let's go.

132
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,434
Wait, not too fast.

133
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,436
We need to change your look, Detective Gu.

134
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,147
What for?
I already look great and pathetic.

135
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,150
I've received insider information.

136
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,860
- You know Maksan, right?
- Yeah.

137
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,904
He has a girlfriend…

138
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,740
but she's no ordinary woman.

139
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,119
-What?
-Is she a celebrity?

140
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,913
Celebrity, my foot.

141
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,416
A foul-mouthed fairy shaman
Yuk Duja

142
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,918
-What?
-What?

143
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,753
Are they a poster couple or what?

144
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,800
Listen carefully, punk.

145
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,261
It's not just your father's neck
on the line,

146
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,596
but also the judges,
chiefs, and ministers.

147
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,806
And you'd be ruining
your family's reputation.

148
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,893
Ruining it like there's no tomorrow.

149
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,062
Then what do I have to do?

150
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,980
Fully admit to your crimes.

151
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,858
Tell them that you did all sorts of drugs.
Got it?

152
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,443
Then will everything be covered up?

153
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,153
"Covered up"?

154
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,864
I'm trying to reduce your punishment,
not make it disappear.

155
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,783
How shameless of you.

156
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
Give me your father's number
so I can talk to him.

157
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,956
I-I can't, he'll kill me.

158
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,125
I'll make sure he doesn't,
so just give me his number,

159
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,669
you polka-dot bastard.

160
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,255
And you, rising star.

161
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,464
You just have to admit it as well.

162
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,341
I swear I didn't do drugs.

163
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,260
Did the test results come out yet?

164
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,429
Five, four, three, two, one.

165
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,558
You sound certain.
We'll see what your hair has to say.

166
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,142
You just wait.

167
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,478
Hair, hair.

168
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,731
I'll pluck all your armpit hair,
fine hair, and more

169
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,733
until the results come out positive.

170
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,777
Hello, Vice Minister Park.

171
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,154
I'm Park Kyungsun from the Busan
Southern District Prosecutors' Office.

172
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,115
I'm sorry to say this,

173
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,618
but your son has recklessly, heavily,
and excessively done all sorts of drugs.

174
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,815
Would you look at that?

175
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,319
This place is filled with evil spirits.

176
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,697
Babe, you could perform a ritual
to get rid of them.

177
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,823
Wait a second.

178
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,825
He looks familiar.

179
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,246
There are plenty like him
who look like they belong behind bars.

180
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,582
Hey.

181
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,042
Tell me.

182
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,879
-Do I have the face of a prisoner?
-What is he on about?

183
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,007
Man, that chick's got some wild eyebrows.

184
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,010
-They look like birds.
-Chirp, chirp.

185
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,180
You want a good beating, bastards?

186
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,848
That guy doesn't look Korean.

187
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,058
Made in Thailand.

188
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,476
I'm good at Korean.

189
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,935
-Wow.
-Oh, he is.

190
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,481
We'll ask a simple question,
so give us a simple answer.

191
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,399
Stay out of this, fatty.

192
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,818
You look like some well-fed pig,

193
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,071
but your manners and tone
aren't so well-bred.

194
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,573
Talk to me before I beat you up.

195
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,866
Listen.

196
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,744
Do you know this bastard?

197
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,329
Uh…

198
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:04,955
Ah!

199
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,749
Do we know him?

200
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,502
We'll let you know
after the commercial break.

201
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,588
That was a good one!

202
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,175
You can't just fly in here out of nowhere
like a bottle cap…

203
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,810
Your life is as useless as a bottle cap,
you son of a gun.

204
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,353
-How dare you?
-Come on.

205
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,355
-Bring it on. Come on!
-Sit down.

206
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,526
Over here, punk!

207
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,237
I'm sorry.
I said I'm sorry.

208
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,669
Who are you?

209
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,713
- You want to know?
- Talk to me.

210
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,135
Since you asked,

211
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,762
it's only right we tell you who we are.

212
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,515
Skusher.

213
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,559
Yuk Duja.

214
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,310
Maksan.

215
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,813
Crapi!

216
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,108
We're the Sweeper Gang!

217
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,782
How come there aren't any CCTVs here?

218
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,869
Well, it's a place
of sacredness and faith,

219
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,454
so we didn't install any.

220
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,206
I'm certain
it's the work of a fanatic from a cult.

221
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,292
Fanatic, my foot.

222
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,794
How can you be so certain?

223
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,296
Two years ago,

224
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,424
a fanatic set fire
to the statue of Buddha at Uma Temple.

225
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:42,011
Whoever it may be,
please catch the culprit.

226
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,387
Don't worry.

227
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,264
I knew it.

228
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,559
I mean, to be completely honest,

229
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,060
it's because certain priests

230
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,981
were meddling in other people's business
that such a disaster happened.

231
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,025
You see, the thing about crime

232
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,527
is that it's all about cause and effect.

233
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,779
How ridiculous.

234
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,322
What are you, a criminologist?

235
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,990
How does cause and effect fit into this?

236
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,492
Father Kim.

237
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,660
They're here to investigate.
Please mind your manners.

238
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,537
They have no intention of investigating.

239
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,247
They're here to add fuel to the fire.

240
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,043
Can we talk for a second?

241
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,252
What?

242
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,379
Come with us.

243
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,215
Me?

244
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,551
Excuse us.

245
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,845
- Sure, go ahead.
- Thank you for your hard work.

246
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,183
I know who set
the statue of the Virgin Mary…

247
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,061
on fire.

248
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,563
Is it who I think it is?

249
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,524
Who is it?

250
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,567
Who are the devil-like people
who did this?

251
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,237
They're not just devil-like.
They are devils.

252
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,530
Father Kim.

253
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,282
Tell me everything.

254
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,993
Hurry up and tell me where the priest is.

255
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,621
-Aren't you a shaman? Shouldn't you know?
-Dude.

256
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,832
- Be quiet.
- Shut your mouth.

257
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,752
He's protected by a higher power,
so I can't get to him.

258
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,339
Hurry up and tell us.

259
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,008
I-If he's not at the church,

260
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,511
you should go to the seminary near it.

261
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,221
-R-Right.
-Apparently, he's an instructor there.

262
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,851
It doesn't feel right
to kill at a seminary.

263
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,477
W-Why do you want to kill him?

264
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,021
-What's wrong with you? Shut up.
-Be quiet.

265
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,356
That's none of your business.

266
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,900
Call us when you see him, okay?

267
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,318
Yes, sir.

268
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,528
Who are we…

269
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,488
again?

270
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,865
We're the…

271
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,034
Sweeper Gang!

272
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:33,080
What is a drug cartel doing here
in Uma-gu?

273
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,373
The bigger issue

274
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,167
is that the cartel
is only getting stronger.

275
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,586
So you're saying

276
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,213
that those guys set the statue on fire,

277
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,383
and the prosecution and the police
are all in cahoots with them?

278
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,721
It's more than that. They're a family.

279
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,180
Oh, dear Lord.

280
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,226
By the way,

281
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,980
why are you going after that drug cartel?

282
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,819
I told you.

283
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,238
The police and the prosecution
are all in cahoots with them.

284
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,491
Even so,
it's not your duty to go after them.

285
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,412
Especially not with the immature
and thoughtless Chae Dou.

286
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,582
Dean Lee, I'm an adult.

287
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,084
You are immature and thoughtless.

288
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,336
See? I told you!

289
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,717
Anyway,

290
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,719
this goes against your duty as a priest.

291
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,971
Does it really matter
if you're a police or a priest

292
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,640
when it comes to chasing out evil?

293
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,974
Hair analysis report

294
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,770
Good work.

295
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:38,896
What did Vice Minister Park say?

296
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,356
He's going to clear out his schedule

297
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,441
and come see you in private.

298
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,526
Well, of course he has to come.

299
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,820
He's going to become the minister,
and then he'll run for office.

300
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,490
However, according to the test results,

301
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,700
his celebrity friend Oh Jinyeong is clean.

302
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,619
Keep pressuring him,

303
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,746
so he can take all the blame.

304
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,498
Yes, sir.

305
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,502
Another big serving added to my honey jar.

306
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,215
Even though the prosecution
and the police may be corrupt,

307
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,884
that's something for them
to realize and overcome.

308
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,304
No good will come of us intervening.

309
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,557
They'll never realize it.
It's been decades since their corruption.

310
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,518
We have to keep waiting.

311
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,396
Reformation takes more time and effort
than revolution.

312
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,231
I'm not waiting
or expecting anything from them.

313
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,524
I'll just do it my way.

314
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,359
Is this why you came here?

315
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,987
To instigate the students?

316
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,446
No, it's to teach them how to attack…

317
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,323
I mean, it's to teach them
how to take action.

318
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,449
Forget it.

319
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,495
Please leave the seminary.

320
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,294
As far as I know, our deal isn't over yet.

321
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,299
A deal?

322
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,385
If you withdraw Chae Dou's punishment

323
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:53,929
and turn a blind eye to everything I do,

324
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,181
I'll make sure
that every seat at every Mass…

325
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,018
…is sold out in a month.

326
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,395
Mass isn't a concert.

327
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,272
I'm saying I'll make sure it's filled.

328
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,942
I'm talking Sunday Mass,
Youth Mass, and Saturday Mass.

329
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,529
Less than a fifth of the seats
are filled every week.

330
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,031
I'll fill the other four-fifths.

331
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,702
Withdraw the punishment
and turn a blind eye, you say?

332
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,996
So you've added a condition.

333
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,166
Yes, that makes two conditions.

334
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,959
In that case,

335
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,462
it's only right
for another mission to be added.

336
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,922
I knew you'd say that, so I came prepared.

337
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,091
I'll make sure to triple
the number of applicants

338
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,677
to the seminary next year.

339
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,513
Hmm…

340
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,143
All right.

341
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,104
However, if you fail any of your missions,

342
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,983
both you and Dou will have to leave, okay?

343
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,735
Okay, deal!

344
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,206
I'll just take the punishment.

345
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,711
Don't give up. It's not over yet.

346
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,340
I knew it.

347
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,594
I didn't even trust you,
but I got stabbed in the back.

348
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,972
Forget it, that's it.

349
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,892
Forget about our deal and the missions.
None of it ever happened.

350
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,352
No takebacks!

351
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,736
Jeez, it's already three in the morning.

352
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,279
I'll give you a ride home.

353
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,198
It's okay, I already called a taxi.

354
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,493
Did you? I guess it might be
a little awkward to ride together.

355
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,162
Hold on, isn't it Sunday today?

356
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,540
That calls for instant black bean noodles.

357
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,543
Go enjoy them at home and get some rest.

358
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,296
Get home safely, sir.

359
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,511
I still have something left to do.

360
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:28,959
Jeez.

361
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,420
Someone's in a hurry.

362
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:32,963
Goodness.

363
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:47,311
Something doesn't feel right.

364
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,314
Are they tailing me?

365
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,653
That paranoid bastard.

366
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,658
Jeez, that scared me.

367
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,952
I thought they were tailing me.

368
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:16,798
Hey.

369
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,676
Did they fall for it?

370
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,345
They weren't suspicious?

371
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,721
Of course not.

372
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,265
Everyone falls for my method acting.

373
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,808
That's good.

374
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,394
They're going to want
to confirm your identity.

375
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,896
Will he be on time tomorrow?

376
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,481
Don't worry.

377
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,150
He'll be here in the morning.

378
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,568
This will work, right?

379
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,279
Of course it will.

380
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,531
It'll be the end of things.
Game over, you know?

381
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,742
All right, take care.

382
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,828
Take the device I gave you,
and make sure to take the toothpicks too.

383
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,872
I have them ready.

384
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,707
All right, bye.

385
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,793
Uma Go House

386
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,937
You thought you lost me, huh?

387
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,108
What's this sheet of paper?

388
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,235
It's a special piece of paper
with an invisible chip embedded in it.

389
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,820
Oh my.

390
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,989
This is extremely high-tech paper.

391
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,366
Where do you even get this?

392
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,450
The stationery store.

393
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,203
Just make sure
Prosecutor Nam keeps it with him.

394
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,913
Okay.

395
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,873
This is really cool.

396
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,132
So he can take all the blame.

397
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,258
Yes, sir.

398
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:44,094
Another big serving added to my honey jar.

399
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,359
Darn it.

400
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,903
What the heck?

401
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,489
All right.

402
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,199
Perfect.

403
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,512
♪ My precious honey jar ♪

404
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,647
♪ My precious honey jar in Busan ♪

405
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,988
That sneaky man.

406
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,741
So this is
where you store your honey jar, huh?

407
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,453
Got you.

408
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,414
♪ My precious honey jar ♪

409
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,834
Mic check.

410
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,712
May 12th, 2024.

411
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:02,172
It is currently

412
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,175
4:44 a.m.

413
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,928
Here's today's news.

414
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,100
I'll start the recording

415
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,519
of the case involving Park Junhyeok,
son of Vice Minister Park Gitae,

416
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,687
and popular actor Oh Jinyeong,

417
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:23,276
accused of drug use
at an adult establishment in Busan.

418
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,868
My son still has a long way to go.

419
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,663
He's still young, so I'm sure
he wants to see what life has to offer.

420
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,373
Don't worry too much.

421
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,458
Once this is settled,

422
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,794
I'll make sure
to treat you properly in Seoul.

423
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,337
Oh, please, Vice Minister Park.

424
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,756
You don't need to do that.

425
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,508
How do these look?

426
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,261
Look at him,
heading straight for his downfall.

427
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,055
I'm sure
he's going to regret this one day.

428
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,936
Goodness, I'm coming to Busan every week
because of you.

429
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,439
Stop whining, Reporter Ki.

430
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,107
Just bear with me.

431
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,026
I'll make sure you get promoted
to director and eventually CEO.

432
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,405
If you're going to help with my promotion,

433
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,449
you might as well
pave my way to the throne.

434
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,783
Don't be ridiculous.

435
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,785
And do something about your brows.

436
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:14,870
You look hideous.

437
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,539
What do you mean?
I got these done at Apgujeong.

438
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,790
For real?

439
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,000
You got scammed.

440
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,294
Jeez, no, I didn't.

441
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,962
What do you know about style?

442
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,841
Here, these are the pictures
you asked for last time.

443
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,051
Take a look.

444
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,015
- I like this.
- Okay.

445
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:39,936
It'd cause quite a stir if we laid out
the drug dealers' corpses like this, huh?

446
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,397
It wouldn't just cause a stir.

447
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,733
It'd mean you won in the war on drugs,

448
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,193
and you'd become a nationwide…

449
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,277
No,

450
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,779
you'd become a worldwide superstar!

451
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:52,657
You sure have a way with words.

452
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,494
By the way, how are you going to
take the drug dealers down?

453
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,455
That's the issue right now.

454
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,082
I need someone
who'll do the dirty work for me.

455
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,210
- Reporter Ki.
- Yes?

456
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,795
I'll give you the info, so do something
for me before you head back to Seoul.

457
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,088
What is it?

458
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,091
-Is it drug-related?
-No.

459
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,010
It's something mind-blowing.

460
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,720
What?

461
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,309
SpiDer: Here is the photo you requested.

462
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,817
Served in the
Naval Special Warfare Flotilla UDT/SEAL

463
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,695
Assigned to Special Team of the NIS
International Counterterrorism Division

464
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,280
Unbelievable.

465
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,449
He's the real deal.

466
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,330
All right.

467
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,123
This is the very place

468
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:46,253
where the statue of the Virgin Mary
spontaneously caught on fire.

469
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,755
Spontaneous combustion

470
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,633
is a supernatural phenomenon
that occurs worldwide

471
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,343
and remains a mystery.

472
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,179
This case is also a supernatural one,

473
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,516
and the police have stated
that their investigation is unclear.

474
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,850
Excuse me.

475
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,935
Cut.

476
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,353
Yes?

477
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,564
I'm the dean here.

478
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:06,856
Are you a reporter?

479
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,484
Oh, you're the dean.

480
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,362
I'm Ki Deokgi
from the Social Affairs Desk at GBS.

481
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,575
Anyway, what did you just say?

482
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,451
-Spontaneous combustion?
-Oh, yes.

483
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:21,663
That's what the police
and rumors are saying.

484
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,957
How does that make any sense?

485
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,667
You call this nonsense reporting?

486
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,127
Come on, Father.

487
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,045
It's a good thing
that this is being covered.

488
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,714
Think about it.

489
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,633
Believers from all over the world
will visit.

490
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,677
That will help the regional economy,

491
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,221
and you'll become famous too.

492
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,389
Get out.

493
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,765
But I'm outside.

494
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,434
Is there a door here?

495
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,353
Step outside the seminary
before I beat you up.

496
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,940
Goodness, you're quite harsh
with your words.

497
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,734
I'd advise you to cooperate.

498
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:54,279
I'd advise you to leave right now.

499
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,363
Father.

500
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,868
This is media suppression
by the Catholic Church.

501
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,077
Let's wrap up.

502
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,583
What in the…

503
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,420
I'll take five steak sandwiches.

504
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,088
As for the vegetables…

505
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,424
please put in everything.

506
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,053
Is there something wrong?

507
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,679
Uh-uh…

508
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,226
- What's up with them?
- Are they shooting something?

509
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,895
I'm scared.
Let's eat over there.

510
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,772
- Okay.
- Let's go.

511
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,316
This is so delicious.

512
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,319
I'm glad we decided to eat this.
It's very filling.

513
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,572
I can open my eye now. Mm.

514
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,074
Jeez, it's so itchy.

515
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,326
I can't even wash my hair.

516
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,203
Just wait three days.

517
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,663
Your hair oil will relieve the itchiness.

518
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,124
Yohan, we're eating good food here.

519
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,710
Don't talk about nasty stuff, you pig.

520
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,462
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

521
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,839
I have a bad feeling.

522
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,342
What are you going to do
if one of them actually knows Maksan?

523
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,053
Then I'll stab them with my hairpin.

524
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,513
I'll take care of it.

525
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,723
Wow, you're so charismatic.

526
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,433
That's why men go crazy for you.

527
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,602
Hmm.

528
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,396
I got a text.

529
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,190
-Where is it?
-Chilgong Wharf, Zone 3.

530
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,321
You should finish eating.
You need to fuel up.

531
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,407
Right, right.

532
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,202
Give this to Father Kim.

533
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,789
"Killer Oh Hanmo wanted"
"Killer Oh Hanmo wanted"

534
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,874
He really does look like that detective.

535
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,210
If what they say about him is true,
he should be the right fit.

536
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,671
I hear he's absolutely ruthless.

537
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,632
Apparently, he'll kill anyone for money.

538
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,969
He's even killed four police officers.

539
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,887
And he also killed a police dog

540
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:44,723
by biting it.

541
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,729
-He killed a police dog by biting it?
-Yes, sir.

542
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,814
The drug dealers
will have to keep an eye out for him.

543
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,608
Apparently, he killed people while sober.

544
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,902
He's a complete nutjob.

545
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,155
Sir, we need a nutjob like him right now.

546
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,867
Why don't we help him stay under the radar

547
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,119
and make use of him?

548
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,247
Let's check that he's legit first
just to be safe.

549
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,291
Yes, sir. I'll check right now.

550
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,714
Welcome.

551
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,175
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

552
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,137
Oh, there's Chairman Kim.

553
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,684
Father Kim, did you hear about
the fundraising event tomorrow?

554
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,810
What event?

555
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,146
That man is going to gather donors

556
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,981
and host a fundraising event
for the church.

557
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,816
-In the front yard of Uma Church.
-That's right.

558
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,234
He's going to hire a buffet caterer

559
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,944
and invite musicians as well.

560
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,697
Is the church front yard
a venue for events or what?

561
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,365
He might as well just lay out
a red carpet too.

562
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,034
- How've you been?
- Welcome.

563
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,244
Thanks to you, I've been
able to spread kindness this week.

564
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,751
Hello, Father Kim.

565
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,422
Why host an event in the churchyard
when you can afford a fancier place?

566
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,632
Because it's holy.

567
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,842
I'm just trying to rack up
some blessing mileage.

568
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,061
"Because it's holy.
Rack up some blessing mileage."

569
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,821
-What's going on? What are you doing?
-Sorry?

570
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,030
- Well…
- Wait.

571
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,116
- Hang on, Father Kim.
- Why aren't those people coming?

572
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,576
- Tell me about it.
- Look, Father Kim.

573
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,580
-I think they're coming.
-Wait, that nun looks… Move out of my way.

574
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,748
Wait.

575
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,293
When we're struggling
or feeling betrayed…

576
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,256
do we listen for God's voice

577
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,174
or the devil's voice?

578
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,760
We don't listen for God's voice.

579
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,513
We usually turn to alcohol

580
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,515
or talk to other people.

581
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,309
We turn to
easily accessible coping methods.

582
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,104
That's when the devil speaks up.

583
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,981
"There's no use."

584
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,983
"There's not much to life."

585
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,776
"No one will notice your hardships."

586
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,445
We become isolated
and trapped in these words.

587
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,990
If you listen to this voice,

588
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,325
you'll ruin yourself

589
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,246
and your relationships
with your loved ones.

590
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,542
I'd like you to make it clear to yourself
through today's gospel.

591
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,462
The goal of Christ
is to triumph over evil.

592
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,675
Being with God is the way to win

593
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,262
the battle against evil.

594
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,741
Jeez, are you all going
to a construction site?

595
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,368
What's with all the wooden sticks?

596
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,455
Man, you really do look like
that detective.

597
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,084
And that girl looks like
that female detective.

598
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,466
What's the punk who killed his parents
yapping about?

599
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,469
What the hell are you talking about?

600
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,305
You two,
thick men on the sides. Who are you?

601
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,058
"Thick"? What are we, steak cuts?
You want a piece of us?

602
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,184
Hang on.

603
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,937
If you want to have
a rough physical conversation…

604
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,397
bring it on.

605
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,524
- What is he doing?
- What are you, a bodybuilder?

606
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,193
-What's going on?
-How absurd.

607
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,404
Goodness, Maksan.

608
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,531
Jeez.

609
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,367
Maksan.

610
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,454
Don't you remember me?

611
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,671
Oh, right, I do.

612
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,755
Hey.

613
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,925
I'm Capelin. I used to work
for Breadhead back in Daejeon.

614
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,803
Right!

615
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,846
Breadhead's underling!

616
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,015
I remember.

617
00:32:56,557 --> 00:33:00,311
It's been about 10 years, hasn't it?

618
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,938
We met last year.

619
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,900
It was the day before you bit
and killed that police dog.

620
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,862
So it's been 10 months.

621
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,947
Jeez.

622
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,409
I'm bad at keeping up with dates.

623
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,496
Goodness, it's my first time
meeting you, ma'am.

624
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,123
I've heard a lot about you.

625
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,709
I've heard a lot about you too.

626
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,253
I see there's a lot of rice on your face.

627
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,255
I guess you won't ever starve to death.

628
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,299
-It's a good thing.
-Oh, I see.

629
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,637
Wait, Capelin. You guys know each other?

630
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,931
Of course.

631
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,184
He saved Breadhead's life twice.

632
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,519
No way.

633
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,938
Friends,

634
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,732
there's something I must ask.

635
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,818
Why do you want to get rid of the priest?

636
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,820
We all have our reasons.

637
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,238
Don't pry.

638
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,322
Right.

639
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:55,908
Well, we're also trying to get rid of him.

640
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,577
You're all dead meat if you touch him!

641
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,416
Got it?

642
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,129
I'll be the one to kill him.

643
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,175
You're scary. Calm down.

644
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,552
All right, let's head to the office.

645
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:18,139
We can enjoy a hot cup of coffee
and continue talking.

646
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,934
Hey, you're trying to kill us, aren't you?

647
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,227
-Come here.
-Oh, jeez.

648
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,480
-What's gotten into you?
-I was just offering coffee.

649
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,398
-What are you, a Thai warrior?
-Don't worry.

650
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,691
Let me escort you. Let's go.

651
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,152
All right. Let's go, my brother.

652
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,613
-Man, it's nice to see you again.
-Look at your muscles.

653
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,323
Go get your dumbbells if you're scared.

654
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,542
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

655
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,878
-Amen.
-Amen.

656
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,967
I feel like I've been sinning lately.

657
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,929
Well, it's more like I'm having
blasphemous thoughts.

658
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,056
I want to earn a lot of money

659
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,558
and ensure
everyone in Uma-gu lives abundantly.

660
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,852
Why is that blasphemous?

661
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,395
Because I want them

662
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,731
to live that kind of life
without needing to believe in God.

663
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,735
To be completely honest, you can't
actually see God's kingdom, can you?

664
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:17,073
Then why do you come to church
seeking someone you can't even see?

665
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,408
Well, it's fun that you can't see him.

666
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,952
There's also a thrill in being deceived.

667
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,205
Is that why you donated two billion won?

668
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,915
There's nothing more fun than that.

669
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,002
Anyway, I'm confessing
because of all these random thoughts.

670
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,504
There's no need to confess.

671
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,549
You're God's beloved child.

672
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,260
You're a citizen of his kingdom

673
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,095
because he cherishes you dearly.

674
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,639
He cherishes me dearly?

675
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,974
Yes.

676
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,726
Considering how he's blessed you
with wealth,

677
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,104
even though you're always laughing
under your breath at every Mass.

678
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:53,901
The Lord needs a mischievous child too.

679
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:57,071
I see he truly loves
all kinds of children.

680
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,283
Let's praise the Lord.

681
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,245
How've you been?

682
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:06,205
-I can't believe we finally met!
-Oh, my goodness!

683
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,875
I wanted to come see you guys
the second I landed,

684
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,085
but I couldn't
because of my duty as a comes.

685
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,753
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

686
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,880
You've gotten more good-looking.

687
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,756
You've got to be kidding me.

688
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,386
Don't I look good?

689
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,846
You do. Wait, no.

690
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,639
I told you not to come here.

691
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,892
How many times do I have to tell you
that confidentiality is key?

692
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,352
I told you not to come
because Kim Hongsik will be here.

693
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,022
That's why I came in disguise.

694
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,316
You call this a disguise? Are you serious?

695
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,611
-Do you know Kim Hongsik?
-Ah.

696
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,821
-Well…
-That businessman…

697
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,615
is into her.

698
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,326
Oh my!

699
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,994
You can't fall for him. Okay?

700
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,788
I'm telling you now,
you cannot fall for him.

701
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,123
-Got it?
-All right, she knows.

702
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,125
-That's not what's important right now.
-Right.

703
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,210
Now tell me.

704
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,170
Why did you really come here?

705
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,506
Well, it's just been a while
since I last attended Mass,

706
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,800
and I wanted to see
Sister Kim and Father Han.

707
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,802
Liar! You liar!

708
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,346
The thing is…

709
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,681
there's a ghost in my house!

710
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,351
-What?
-A real ghost.

711
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,562
She's got a pale face
with blood all over her

712
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,481
and glares at me in her polka-dot dress.

713
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,150
It's so scary.

714
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,736
Father Kim, can you perform an exorcism?

715
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,530
What kind of ghost nonsense is this?

716
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,825
You're so unreliable.

717
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,830
I should've covered my mouth
while laughing.

718
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,124
I must've looked like a lunatic.

719
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,919
Citizens are buzzing with excitement

720
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,879
for the biggest meteor shower,

721
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,590
which happens once every 60 years.

722
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,759
Tomorrow's forecast calls for clear skies,

723
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,302
and it seems that all the spots

724
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,971
-in Busan Observatory…
-If I don't catch it this time,

725
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,932
-I'll have to wait until I'm 100.
-…the best place to watch the show,

726
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,183
are already fully booked.

727
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,559
Go away. Go away.

728
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,186
In Jesus' name.

729
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,438
You see the cross, right?

730
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,109
Go away.

731
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,531
It's over here, where it looks like
there's gochujang on the wall.

732
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,032
I already did it there.

733
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,450
It's not there!

734
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,036
I'm done with this! Forget it!
I don't see any ghosts!

735
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,330
I'm telling you, she's here.

736
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,125
She's got long hair…

737
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,627
…a pale face,

738
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,546
a choke mark on her neck…

739
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,758
and she's wearing
a polka-dot dress covered in blood.

740
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,553
Father Kim…

741
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,888
-Behind you!
-Behind me? What?

742
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,182
-What's behind me? Where is it?
-She was behind you.

743
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,976
Where?

744
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,270
There's nothing.
Are you trying to scare me?

745
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,272
She's there!

746
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,317
Excuse me, miss.

747
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,110
Ms. Polka Dot, get off him.

748
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,404
How old are you? What's your name?
Do you live here?

749
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,240
What are you doing? Stop it.
Stop trying to scare me.

750
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,409
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

751
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,785
Jeez, wait a second.

752
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,998
Geezer Park,
I have someone important to meet with.

753
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:55,499
Let's call it a day here.

754
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,584
Where are you going?

755
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,544
You're good now.
I've done more than enough.

756
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,754
What are you talking about?

757
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,882
She's on your back right now.
Isn't she heavy?

758
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,800
Oh, come on, stop it already.

759
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,011
-Don't try to trick a priest.
-Wait, Ms. Polka Dot.

760
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,180
-Wait, let's talk it out.
-I'm going.

761
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:10,639
- Wait.
- Bye.

762
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,142
- She's going with you.
- Stop it!

763
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,227
Stop it already!

764
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,689
Oh my!

765
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,901
Jeez.

766
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,612
That scared the crap out of me.

767
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,073
Yes, Chairman Kim?

768
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,533
Are you sure you don't want to see
the shooting stars tomorrow?

769
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,869
We'll have to wait another 60 years
if we miss this.

770
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,662
And from what I looked into,

771
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,331
they won't actually fall on you.

772
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,415
They don't get that close.

773
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,542
Oh, I see.

774
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,627
But I'm sorry.

775
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,545
What now?

776
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,713
The thing is…

777
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,341
they say it's bad luck
to see a shooting star.

778
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,510
Even in A Better Tomorrow,

779
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,637
one of the male leads got shot
after seeing a shooting star.

780
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,181
I want to live a long life.

781
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,599
Right.

782
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,017
One of the male leads.

783
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,395
He saw a shooting star
before the baby was born…

784
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,274
All right, I understand.

785
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,651
Goodbye then.

786
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,825
She's got it wrong.

787
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,745
I killed someone
the day after I saw a shooting star.

788
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,333
- You're back.
- Is this it?

789
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,626
Yes.

790
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,174
There are ghosts
clinging to this place like barnacles.

791
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,759
What's with this fishy smell?

792
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:31,595
All right, allow us
to do a little checking before going in.

793
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,431
Give me the bag.

794
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,766
-Give it to me.
-Jeez.

795
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,268
What is this?

796
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,691
A ghost will latch onto you
if you touch me.

797
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,068
You just need to give him your phone.

798
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,906
Why do you keep your phone there?

799
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,538
-What's this?
-Hey.

800
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,082
Oh, look at that.

801
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:02,418
Do you kill people with toothpicks?

802
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,502
Jeez, man.

803
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,714
You think you can kill people with these?

804
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,382
You really think so?

805
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,467
Oh.

806
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,471
All right, we can't keep our boss waiting
for too long.

807
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,847
Let's head in.

808
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,433
Let's go.

809
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,269
You're lucky, aren't you?

810
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,563
You're going out and about
and still not getting caught.

811
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,899
Were you a helmet of a battleship
or something?

812
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,983
I mean, helmsman?

813
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,569
Steer to the left, steer to the right.

814
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,362
What are you doing?

815
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,530
None of your business.

816
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,449
Shouldn't your boss at least say hi

817
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,910
to our Boss Maksan?

818
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,870
Next time.

819
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,540
- He's a busy man, you see.
- Right.

820
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,792
Why don't you introduce yourselves?

821
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,836
I'm Maksan.

822
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,214
It means "to live recklessly."

823
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,298
I see.

824
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,551
And he's a skull crusher from Bangkok,

825
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,636
also known as Skusher.

826
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,721
Hello. Hello.

827
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,726
Oh, wow. What was that?

828
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,146
That was cool.

829
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,439
Can you speak Korean?

830
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,982
Do you speak Korea?

831
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,317
Of course.

832
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,277
How much wood
would a woodchuck chuck

833
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,072
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
Your turn.

834
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,532
How much wood would a woodchick…

835
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,492
-Wrong.
-Damn it! Okay, one more time.

836
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,701
-How much wood would a woodchick--
-Wrong.

837
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,994
Damn it!

838
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,956
- You win!
- Nice!

839
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,374
Go easy.

840
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,543
And this is

841
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,127
Crapi from Dongducheon.

842
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,546
Crabby?

843
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,922
Has he got an attitude problem?

844
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:31,882
It's Crapi, not Crabby.

845
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:32,967
Short for Crazy Pig.

846
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,179
He's got a murderous spirit
in every layer of his fat.

847
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,684
-What do you want?
-I'm a former martial artist.

848
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,394
Don't make me hit you.

849
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,604
All right.

850
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,273
Go sit down.

851
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,901
Come sit.

852
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,570
Come to me.

853
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,239
Come to me! Come to me!

854
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,950
The spirit is gone.

855
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,619
I'm the foul-mouthed fairy shaman,
who received the divine energy

856
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,413
of the Oram Mountain fairy.

857
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,415
I'm Yuk Duja.

858
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:05,958
Yuk Duja.

859
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,043
So we've done the introductions.

860
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,920
Now tell us.

861
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,548
- Why do you want to kill the priest?
- Right.

862
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,968
That damned priest

863
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,847
ruined my 500 million won deal

864
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,975
and put me behind bars!

865
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,519
That three, four, five, sick bastard!

866
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,854
That asshole!

867
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,606
-That's right.
-I understand how you feel.

868
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,524
-Good.
-But you can't kill him right now.

869
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,695
Why not?

870
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,780
You just can't. It's a spatial order…

871
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,032
Special order from our chairman.

872
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,409
I don't care about his orders.

873
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:43,454
I'm on the run right now.
I have no time to waste.

874
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,497
All right, just wait, okay?

875
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,124
I'll let you kill him…

876
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,835
when the time is right, so just wait.

877
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,504
You'd better keep your word.

878
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,631
Don't worry.

879
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,549
You can stay here for the time being.

880
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,968
I'll give you a room
and take care of your meals.

881
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,763
I'll even give you drugs if you want.

882
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,808
I like it better at my place.

883
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,061
You don't have to.

884
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,314
- Hello, sir.
- Hey, Rockfish.

885
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,778
-I heard about them on my way here.
-Yeah.

886
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,615
Are you sure he's not the detective?

887
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,250
He's not.

888
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,212
We talked, and he's a complete bastard.

889
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,216
I have a feeling he's the detective.

890
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,177
Who the hell is this detective
you're talking about?

891
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,763
I'm telling you, it's him.

892
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,432
Give me a second.

893
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,351
Come here.

894
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,646
Back off.
I'm checking if he measures up.

895
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,939
-So just wait.
-Yes, sir.

896
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,023
-Wait, okay?
-Yes, sir.

897
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,608
Paw. Good job.

898
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,954
One second. Give me a second.
I got a text.

899
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,708
You idiot!

900
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,876
I told you so!

901
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,294
Look.

902
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,672
This was taken 20 seconds ago.

903
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,384
Who's that?

904
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,136
My baby's much more good-looking.

905
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:23,303
-I know.
-Babe.

906
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,472
What's wrong with your eyes?

907
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,640
Wait, Maksan.

908
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,811
It seems like your birthmark has faded.

909
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,979
Has it always been like that?

910
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,897
Really?

911
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,902
Did it?

912
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,947
I wonder why it faded.

913
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,454
He's been using a whitening serum lately.

914
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,621
Back off.

915
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,749
What do you guys know?

916
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,711
That's right. I highly recommend it.

917
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,131
-Send me the clink.
-Clink?

918
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,507
You mean link? I will.

919
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,718
-I'm going to try it out.
-Yeah, it's great.

920
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,679
Enough. All of you, get lost.
Except for you. Escort them.

921
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,806
-Okay.
-You get lost, unobservant punk.

922
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,683
- Go. I need to study.
- Let's go.

923
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,769
All right. What are you looking at?

924
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,021
How dare you?

925
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,147
Damn.

926
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,902
Come on in.

927
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,447
What the hell?

928
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,159
-What?
-What is this, a prison?

929
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,620
I don't like bunk beds.

930
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,829
Are you being serious?

931
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,582
This is a premium deluxe room.

932
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,334
It even comes with its own bathroom.

933
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,336
Jeez, it's hot in here.

934
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,171
I'm going to take a shower.

935
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,802
Goodness, your body
seems to have taken a toll.

936
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,095
Hey.

937
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,890
-Where's the cafeteria?
-Downstairs.

938
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,350
The food is always available,

939
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,185
so feel free to help yourself anytime.

940
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,604
You should get some rest now.

941
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,493
I can't feel my legs.

942
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,703
I'm wiped.

943
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,247
I have no energy left in me.

944
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:14,998
Hey, Yohan.

945
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,167
You're really good at acting like a thug.

946
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,919
What kind of life did you live?

947
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:22,589
Oh, I was just copying my older brother
who's a real thug.

948
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,719
Let's get changed and go eat.

949
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,972
No, we have to call Father Kim first.

950
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,016
-Jeez.
-Come on.

951
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,685
We'll be using that too, you know?

952
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,104
Did you really have to put it in there?

953
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,523
Yeah, I had a lot of space in here.

954
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:40,649
Here it is.

955
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,280
This is a device Father Kim gave me.

956
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,450
It's a micro cell phone
that can't be tracked or wiretapped.

957
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,374
And a magic pencil.

958
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,921
Dang it. Can you do it, Auntie?
I can't see anything.

959
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,631
Jeez.

960
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,259
This is gross.

961
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,390
Goodness, I can't believe this.

962
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,852
I shaved my beard
and dyed my hair to look like you.

963
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,063
Thank you so much, Uncle.

964
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,148
No worries.

965
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,610
Your aunt is very upset
that you haven't visited in a while.

966
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,695
Come visit us when you get back to Seoul.

967
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,779
Okay.

968
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,324
I'll make sure to go see you guys
once I wrap this up.

969
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,658
All right.

970
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:32,951
Be careful.

971
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,494
All right, bye.

972
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,954
Okay, bye.

973
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,041
Goodness, this kid.

974
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,377
Thank you so much for helping us out.

975
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,379
Of course I should help.
It's a matter of the country.

976
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,468
My goodness, with all due respect,

977
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,219
you guys

978
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:53,472
look identical.

979
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,892
You know, if Daeyoung's mom

980
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,771
cut her hair and grew a beard,
she'd look just like me.

981
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,481
We're a family with strong maternal genes.

982
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,443
-Oh, I see. I never knew that.
-That's right.

983
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,320
-Father Kim.
-Yes?

984
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,906
Can I order another plate of hog maw?

985
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:12,532
-Your family must really like hog maw.
-Yes.

986
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,659
We can order more.

987
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,536
Ma'am, can we have
two more plates of hog maw, please?

988
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,121
Okay.

989
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,414
Father Kim,

990
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,333
you're going bankrupt today.

991
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:23,126
That's no problem at all.

992
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,211
-Please eat.
-Goodness.

993
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,838
I've only heard about you before,
so it's nice to finally meet you.

994
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,256
It's truly a pleasure.

995
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,009
This moment's a treasure!

996
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,887
-Thank you so much for your help.
-No problem.

997
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,973
I'll make sure to give this
to my cheetah wife.

998
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,057
It's really nothing.

999
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,767
-I'll see you again.
-Goodbye.

1000
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,187
Let's go, KTX.

1001
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,108
It's my ride back home.

1002
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,151
-Goodbye then.
-Goodbye.

1003
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,202
- Hello?
- Are you Father Kim Haeil?

1004
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,286
Yes.

1005
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,039
I'm Prosecutor Nam Duhun from Busan
Southern District Prosecutors' Office.

1006
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,124
You know me, right?

1007
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:20,809
Oh my. It's nice to meet you, Father Kim.

1008
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,103
You're much better looking in person.

1009
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,731
Someone has a keen eye.

1010
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:26,815
Wait, no.

1011
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,693
Did you call me to play a game
of who knocks down the stick first?

1012
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,778
I just thought
we'd open up to each other better

1013
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,697
if we met
in the presence of Mother Nature.

1014
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:35,449
Plus, I get to enjoy a childhood activity.

1015
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,701
It's nice, isn't it?

1016
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,661
You want to join me?

1017
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,997
Have a seat. Here.

1018
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,086
All right, you go first.

1019
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,925
Why would someone like you,
with your close ties to drug dealers,

1020
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,886
want to meet with me?

1021
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,888
Kim Haeil.

1022
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,015
You were a top operative in the UDT.

1023
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,769
Top operative
in the NIS Counterterrorism Division.

1024
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:10,275
The mastermind
behind the 2019 Gudam-gu chaos.

1025
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,651
You must have good intel.

1026
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,528
That information's not easy to come by.

1027
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,782
I had to spend
quite a lot of my civil servant paycheck

1028
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,950
to retrieve such confidential information.

1029
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,161
Civil servant, my foot.

1030
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,622
You're just someone
who plays around with the law.

1031
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,166
A manipulator of the law, if you will.

1032
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,377
There's something you should know.

1033
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,297
If you go around
acting tough and being nosy,

1034
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,966
you'll end up
causing innocent people to suffer.

1035
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,392
You're not very good
at threatening people.

1036
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,936
I'm not threatening you.

1037
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,230
It's sincere advice.

1038
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:50,273
I'm even more offended
by you calling it advice.

1039
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:53,360
I'm saying all this for your sake.

1040
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,617
You know,

1041
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,454
you've got the kind of look
that makes you very untrustworthy.

1042
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,457
Am I not getting through to you?

1043
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,709
Then do as you please.

1044
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,503
Everyone will die except for you.

1045
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,422
Everyone at the seminary, Uma Church,

1046
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,216
and the elderly living in Haengseon-dong.

1047
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,926
Every single person who trusts you.

1048
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,223
You're not going to let everyone die
and survive alone, are you?

1049
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,475
I mean, you're a priest after all.

1050
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,396
I won't let that happen,

1051
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,606
so why don't you worry about
saving your own skin?

1052
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,694
Bye.

1053
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,321
It's too bad
my sincerity didn't come across to you.

1054
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,614
Oh, no, my ball.

1055
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,118
I got it.
I'll kick it back to you.

1056
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,247
Oh, jeez!

1057
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,750
It's nice to enjoy a childhood activity,
isn't it?

1058
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,043
Goodness gracious.

1059
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,257
Man, the sand sure is grainy and tasty!

1060
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,092
Goodness.

1061
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,013
So?

1062
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,973
You feel your fighting spirit kicking in?

1063
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,851
You'd better fight with all you've got
from here on out.

1064
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,769
"Take down an enemy using another enemy."

1065
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,606
You know what that means?

1066
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,444
Lonely Restaurant

1067
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,696
Father Kim, here.

1068
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,199
The fairy shaman told me to give you this.

1069
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,328
There are photos of the abandoned wharf
and the drug ship in there.

1070
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,373
By the way,
is everyone doing okay on the ship?

1071
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,212
Well, Daeyoung fainted.
But other than that, they're fine.

1072
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,005
Two, three.

1073
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,385
Nice.

1074
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:47,140
Ah… I see he got his bruise redone.

1075
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,316
Goodness, you must've been hungry.

1076
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,528
Wait, your birthmark is darker today.

1077
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,869
He's out of the whitening serum.

1078
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,704
Mm…

1079
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,039
Ah.

1080
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,500
You remember the day

1081
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,294
when you caught
that huge fish with Breadhead?

1082
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,339
Yes, of course.

1083
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,882
Off the coast of Namhae.

1084
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,967
It was at a reservoir.

1085
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:26,888
Exactly, a reservoir in Namhae.

1086
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:27,973
It was in Paju.

1087
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:32,644
Maksan.

1088
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,272
I feel like you've changed.

1089
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,148
You don't seem to remember things.

1090
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,945
-Headbutt.
-Headbutt?

1091
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,405
Yes, headbutt.

1092
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,408
Oh, yeah, headbutt.

1093
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,786
-In Jeju Island.
-Right, Jeju Island.

1094
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,414
It's known for its wind, rocks, and women.

1095
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,082
Dol hareubang?

1096
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,001
Yeah, the stone statue.

1097
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:59,129
He got drunk
and fought with a dol hareubang

1098
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,589
-and headbutted it.
-He sure did.

1099
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,592
Since then, he's been a bit forgetful.
He also sometimes mixes up his words.

1100
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,138
I up mix my words.

1101
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,889
Eat up, Capelin.

1102
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,600
Have some nabana.

1103
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:16,021
Jeez, you must've hurt your head badly.

1104
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,939
I had no idea.

1105
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,024
Goodness gracious.

1106
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,485
Hey, shaman.

1107
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,113
Can I have a word with you?

1108
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,700
Is he trying to hit on me?

1109
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,203
Tell me the truth.

1110
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,165
About what you said earlier
about my parents.

1111
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,167
You just guessed it, right?

1112
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,839
"Committed arson in middle school."

1113
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,591
"Parents died."

1114
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,553
What's the punk
who turned his parents to charcoal

1115
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,472
after burning down the house while drunk
yapping about?

1116
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,931
Oh, dear.

1117
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,268
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I was wrong to have doubted you.

1118
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:59,689
I wasn't trying to kill my parents.

1119
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,984
I wasn't in my right mind
because I was intoxicated.

1120
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:05,111
You're never going to live a full life.

1121
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,321
Wait.

1122
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,449
W-What happens to me in the future?

1123
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:10,658
Forget it.

1124
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,788
It's karma
to live the way your face looks.

1125
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,498
Ma'am!

1126
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,292
Please give me a prophecy.

1127
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,213
Bring me 20 million won.

1128
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,881
In cash.

1129
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,217
No negotiations.

1130
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,429
Okay, I'll have it ready in fresh bills.

1131
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,515
Live the way my face looks?

1132
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:36,393
I can't do that.
Then I'm screwed.

1133
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,519
Big time.

1134
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,359
Front of the abandoned wharf,
ship 1, ship 2…

1135
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,074
What is this?

1136
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,867
"Translate"

1137
00:56:56,162 --> 00:56:59,874
"Moon of Seoul"

1138
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:00,959
Sol duang jan.

1139
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,252
"Sol jang jan."

1140
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,711
"Sol jang…"

1141
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,004
Darn it,
I can't pronounce it.

1142
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,799
Moon of Seoul?

1143
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,217
Moon of Seoul.

1144
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,219
What does that have to do with the ship?

1145
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,058
Hold on a second.

1146
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,644
Leopard-patterned lizard

1147
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,111
This isn't a regular lizard.

1148
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,447
That's why I didn't get any results
last time.

1149
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,867
Leopard-patterned lizard, Laos drug cartel

1150
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,749
Damn it! I can't find anything.

1151
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,627
There's no information on them.

1152
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,840
Laos?

1153
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,969
Hold on.

1154
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,850
Grass Bookstore

1155
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,282
Father Kim.

1156
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:16,618
How've you been?

1157
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,418
Polka Dot.

1158
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,047
Polka Dot.

1159
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,758
Is she really gone?

1160
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:38,097
I do feel a bit more at ease.

1161
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,569
My stomach feels so heavy.

1162
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,155
Did the gimbap go bad?

1163
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:58,284
Gozaev can't do anything right.

1164
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,643
This is refreshing.

1165
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,354
Prosecutor Park.

1166
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,565
Why don't I quiz you on something
while we're on an outing?

1167
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:33,570
Who do you think would survive
if a nuclear war broke out?

1168
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,281
Cockroaches.

1169
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,283
That's correct.

1170
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:39,701
You got it right away.

1171
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,494
As expected.

1172
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,376
I'm afraid
we're going to be cockroaches soon.

1173
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,211
What do you mean?

1174
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:54,215
A big war is going to break out
on the drug dealers' turf soon.

1175
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,217
When that happens,

1176
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,470
we'll just watch from afar
and not have any part in it.

1177
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,432
Are you saying this based on anything?

1178
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,602
The dark horse is galloping away.

1179
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:08,771
Wait.

1180
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,565
He really is dark.

1181
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,359
Are people from another jurisdiction

1182
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:16,070
coming in to wage a war on drugs?

1183
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,405
What are you talking about?

1184
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,908
A lot of people lost their lives
by declaring war on drugs.

1185
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:22,869
Someone recently died too.

1186
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,997
Who, exactly?

1187
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,293
We'll talk details next time.

1188
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,842
Anyway, keep in mind what I said.

1189
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,510
Yes, I will.

1190
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,473
Take a look over there.

1191
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,475
Those are the Oryukdo Islets.

1192
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,644
Oh, so that's what they are.

1193
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,188
Ms. City Slicker doesn't know anything,
does she?

1194
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:53,816
A police investigation
has begun after a chief prosecutor

1195
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,069
from the Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office was reported missing.

1196
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,781
I have a bad feeling about this.

1197
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,745
Chief prosecutor missing,
investigation underway

1198
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,502
Uh… are you okay?

1199
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,089
Yes, I'm fine.

1200
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,391
Grass Bookstore

1201
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:36,567
- How are things here?
- Good.

1202
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,822
You have no idea
how beautiful and welcoming Busan is.

1203
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,657
You seem pretty free though.

1204
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,243
That's not true.

1205
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,453
It's busy here every day.

1206
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,415
You shouldn't have been so direct
with the director.

1207
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,418
That's because he kept giving me
menial tasks,

1208
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,836
and I couldn't hold back anymore.

1209
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,047
I came here
because I wanted to take a break.

1210
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,092
I didn't want to get you involved,
but I couldn't find anything on them.

1211
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:02,885
That's to be expected.

1212
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,972
Only the relevant Thai agency
had the information.

1213
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:09,809
And thankfully, I was able to get it
because I know someone there.

1214
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,979
You know that information's
hard to come by, right?

1215
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:14,605
There you go,
giving yourself all the credit.

1216
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,817
They knew right away
when I showed them the picture.

1217
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,194
-Saban.
-"Saban"?

1218
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,363
-Is that the name of the cartel?
-Yeah.

1219
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:27,285
They're the most infamous Laos drug cartel
in the Golden Triangle.

1220
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:31,914
They have the biggest drug production
and sales and the largest cash reserves,

1221
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:35,418
and they're powerful enough
to wipe out a whole military.

1222
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,880
Who are these guys with lizard tattoos?

1223
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,298
They're called the Geckos,

1224
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,383
and they're the front-line men
of the gang's battle team.

1225
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,845
They're all-rounders
skilled in firearms, martial arts,

1226
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,973
assassination, intelligence, and hacking.

1227
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:54,061
He's the head of the cartel.
General Bak Lak, a former insurgent.

1228
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,022
He had immense power

1229
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:58,316
and pretty much controlled
both the political and military forces.

1230
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:02,487
But he died of a heart attack last year.

1231
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,532
Right, he's the key figure.

1232
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,242
His name is Phukha,

1233
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,036
and he's General Bak Lak's right-hand man

1234
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,537
and the leader of the battle team.

1235
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,874
The Geckos act only on his orders.

1236
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,126
What's with the quality of the pictures?

1237
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,630
Simply put, he's a mass murderer.

1238
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:23,174
He's no worse than Hitler, is he?

1239
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,176
But the thing is…

1240
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,261
he suddenly disappeared.

1241
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,807
- Disappeared?
- Yeah.

1242
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,684
He and his underlings
all vanished without a trace.

1243
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,481
What if Phukha is in Korea?

1244
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:39,565
Oh.

1245
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:44,445
Then Korea will become
a drug kingdom in a year,

1246
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,364
just like the Golden Triangle.

1247
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,199
It'll take less than a year.

1248
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,743
Korea is just as corrupt as other places.

1249
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:53,871
See you.

1250
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,253
Why did these horrifying bastards
come to Korea?

1251
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:02,004
They should've just stayed back.

1252
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:07,218
They're no joke if they're that infamous
in the Golden Triangle.

1253
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,929
Am I the only one who can't see anything?

1254
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,682
Anyway, they're scary guys, right?

1255
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:15,601
I wouldn't have joined you guys
if this were the case.

1256
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:18,479
We're dead
the second they find out about us.

1257
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,816
We can't just sit back.
We need to figure out who the boss is.

1258
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,485
Hide it, hide it!

1259
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:27,530
Shaman,

1260
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,866
your cash is ready.

1261
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,617
That's not what's important right…

1262
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,997
All right, I'll see you in the cafeteria.

1263
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:39,876
Mm.

1264
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,383
What?

1265
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,853
I asked to meet because it was urgent.

1266
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:03,399
I think Nam Duhun meant you
when he said dark horse,

1267
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:07,528
and the person who died recently is
Chief Prosecutor Park, who went missing.

1268
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:12,450
Meaning everything is connected
to what we're going after.

1269
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,578
Does that mean the Special Drug Task Force
from Seoul that searched the ship…

1270
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,747
was led by Chief Prosecutor Park?

1271
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,206
That's right.

1272
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:22,501
He had all the dirt on Nam Duhun.

1273
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:26,339
So Nam Duhun had the drug dealers
get rid of Chief Prosecutor Park.

1274
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:31,177
He'll just be listed as missing
if his body isn't found.

1275
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:33,220
And then it'll turn into a cold case.

1276
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,140
Those guys can make
a body disappear without a trace

1277
01:05:36,223 --> 01:05:37,892
if they really set their minds to it.

1278
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:38,976
What do we do?

1279
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:49,070
Yes, Sister Kim.

1280
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,614
About the fundraising event
hosted by the show-off Chairman Kim.

1281
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:53,908
Are you not coming? It's starting soon.

1282
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:55,910
What?

1283
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,040
20 million won won't cut it.

1284
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,793
It doesn't matter
if they're fresh bills either.

1285
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:07,630
Are you saying I need to pay you more?

1286
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:09,298
Forget about the money.

1287
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,717
I'll need additional data.

1288
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:13,636
What's that?

1289
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:19,225
Your future depends on your boss.

1290
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,894
I need to get a read on your boss' face

1291
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:25,773
to be able to give you
an accurate prophecy.

1292
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:26,899
Oh…

1293
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,110
Hold on!

1294
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:31,320
You want to see the chairman's face?

1295
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,488
That's…

1296
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:36,158
That's not up to me.

1297
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,119
Just have her meet him.

1298
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:41,622
I received my prophecy
after showing her my boss' face.

1299
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,833
I killed him because she told me to,
and guess what?

1300
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:46,502
After that,
everything in my life was smooth sailing.

1301
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,505
Me too.

1302
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:51,716
She saw my boss
and told me to treat him well,

1303
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:53,926
and I did just that, and guess what?

1304
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,345
I made bank, man!

1305
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,805
Same here.

1306
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:01,225
I continued serving my boss
when she told me not to, and guess what?

1307
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:04,020
-I ended up in prison!
-Good lord.

1308
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:07,481
Damn it, this is driving me insane!

1309
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,693
You still want me to tell your future
even if it won't be accurate?

1310
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,570
But keep in mind…

1311
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:13,946
…no negotiations.

1312
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,198
Wait.

1313
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:20,119
Would… a picture be okay?

1314
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,662
-Absolutely.
-Of course.

1315
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,622
-It's more than okay.
-Finally.

1316
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,082
-Show her a picture.
-Now you're talking.

1317
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:27,209
It can be black and white. Or an ID photo.

1318
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,836
-Show it to her right now.
-Come on.

1319
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,880
-All right, all right.
-Any picture will do.

1320
01:07:30,963 --> 01:07:32,757
He's a total model.

1321
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,633
Even as a guy, I find him attractive.

1322
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,594
So I took this without him knowing.

1323
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,943
Hello, Chairman Kim.

1324
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,570
Hello.

1325
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,948
"A heartfelt gesture for the world"

1326
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,701
Oh my,
you've prepared so much.

1327
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,204
This is the least I can do
for an event I'm hosting.

1328
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:04,789
Thank you.

1329
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,209
- Everyone will be so happy.
- They will be.

1330
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:11,253
This shrimp looks evenly cooked.

1331
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:15,716
They really went all out
by combining flowers and food.

1332
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,511
Father Han.

1333
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,554
- He's here.
- Yes.

1334
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,015
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, my goodness!

1335
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,558
When did you get here?

1336
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,811
- You came.
- He went wild with his money.

1337
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,854
I'm not sure if we're meant to eat this

1338
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,108
- or just look at it.
- I know.

1339
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:34,360
Should we ask him to sponsor
our musical theater group?

1340
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,487
-What are you talking about?
-I'm sorry.

1341
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,866
-It does sound like a good idea.
-Sorry?

1342
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:45,204
I mean, he's rich,
so he has money to spare.

1343
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,705
He can sponsor things.

1344
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,999
Wish he'd give me some money too.

1345
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,752
I wasn't being serious.

1346
01:08:56,048 --> 01:09:01,220
The event will begin shortly.

1347
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,723
You probably already know this,
but in the middle…

1348
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:05,975
Please take a seat.

1349
01:09:06,058 --> 01:09:07,309
Hello.

1350
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,811
-Please take a seat.
-Thank you.

1351
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:11,188
You should stress this part.

1352
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,857
I'll keep this with me for now.

1353
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,486
What's wrong, Father Hong?

1354
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,407
I forgot my speech in the church.

1355
01:09:21,907 --> 01:09:23,784
Oh, I'll go get it. You can stay here.

1356
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,911
- I can go get it.
- No, it's okay. I'll go.

1357
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,371
You help them get started.

1358
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:28,831
-We can go--
-I said I'll go.

1359
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:31,709
-Okay.
-We'll be right here.

1360
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:36,213
We'll sing hymns later.

1361
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:40,509
Religious people
pay attention to all the words,

1362
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,845
so I think it's best
that you enunciate when you read.

1363
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:44,805
Uma Church, Catholic Diocese of Busan

1364
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,989
What is it?

1365
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:05,159
You know the young businessman
who donated a large sum?

1366
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,244
Who? Chairman Kim Hongsik?

1367
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,537
Yes.

1368
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,622
He's…

1369
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:11,790
the drug lord.

1370
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,379
You remember the guy named Phukha

1371
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:18,881
in the picture you showed us?

1372
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:21,550
We think
he's the head honcho of this drug ring.

1373
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,970
But we don't think he's on the ship.

1374
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,056
We have no idea where he is.

1375
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,185
He's here.

1376
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,729
No way.

1377
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:35,147
Thanks for letting me know.

1378
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:37,983
Wait, why is he…

1379
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:39,401
Father Kim?

1380
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,644
A fundraising event
with Chairman Kim Hongsik

1381
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,737
I don't think this works.

1382
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:25,823
You have to do this.

1383
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:27,866
Father Kim.

1384
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,204
-I'll take it.
-You can give it to me.

1385
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:33,831
Father Han, Sister Kim.

1386
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:36,375
-Yes?
-Gather everyone

1387
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:38,460
inside the church.

1388
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:39,712
What's the matter?

1389
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,756
What's going on, Father Kim?

1390
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,717
Chairman Kim Hongsik…

1391
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,221
is the drug lord.

1392
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,514
He's a dangerous man.

1393
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,823
All right then, we'll…

1394
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:10,034
It's going to start raining anyway,

1395
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,369
so take everyone inside.

1396
01:12:12,453 --> 01:12:14,788
- Okay.
- Okay, we will.

1397
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,918
- Sister Kang!
- Yes?

1398
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,921
-There are storm clouds overhead.
-Yes?

1399
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,132
I think it's going to start pouring soon.

1400
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:27,718
Why don't we all head inside for now?

1401
01:12:27,801 --> 01:12:30,137
-I think that would be best.
-Yes.

1402
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,597
Everyone, please follow me.

1403
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,932
- Yes.
- It's going to start raining,

1404
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,518
so let's go inside until it stops.

1405
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,020
- Inside the church, everyone.
- Goodness.

1406
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,104
Right this way.

1407
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,814
You should go too, Father Hong.

1408
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,441
Please come this way.

1409
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:58,832
Please go in.

1410
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,213
Will you be okay on your own?

1411
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,840
I'll be fine, so stay inside.

1412
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,133
All right.

1413
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:14,932
I've been made.

1414
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:53,887
I was holding out well.

1415
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:56,932
You'd better hold out from here on out.

1416
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:26,712
Thanks to Ssangmun-dong's Kim Sungkyun

The Fiery Priest Season 2

1419
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,502
Destroying things is your expertise.

1420
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,878
-I have to go!
-How are you so strong?

1421
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:10,005
I guess you know about my powerful backup.

1422
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,423
Let go!

1423
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,592
I think there'll be
an unexpected person joining our side.

1424
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,636
-Who?
-I picked this up…

1425
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,930
I'll teach you a thing or two
about romance.

1426
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,349
Our budget superhero.

1427
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,226
Mom!

1428
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:24,228
Let's just come up
with a detailed plan and catch him.

1429
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,522
Kim must be hot and bothered right now.

1430
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,650
Uma-gu is my territory
and soon-to-be heaven.

1431
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:31,944
Today's the day.

1432
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,446
- It's an order to make contact.
- Then let's look around now.

1433
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,323
Father Kim, it's madness in here.

1434
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,909
You'll have to sacrifice yourself.

1435
01:15:38,992 --> 01:15:42,079
Stay tuned for some bonus footage
