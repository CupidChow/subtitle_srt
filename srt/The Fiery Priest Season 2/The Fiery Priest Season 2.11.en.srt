The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,205
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,331
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,007
Suicide is forbidden
in Catholicism.

8
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:52,469
Will you go against the Lord
and save Park Kyungsun,

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,262
or…

10
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,224
follow his ways and leave her to die?

11
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,818
Don't do it, Father Kim. Please.

12
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,070
Don't do it.

13
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,576
-Father Kim!
-Stay back, it's dangerous!

14
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,119
Father Kim!

15
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,206
Stand back.

16
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,919
I don't want to live my life
feeling like I owe someone something.

17
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,421
Don't do it. I'm serious, Kim Haeil.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,299
That feeling…

19
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,719
will go away with time.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,262
Don't do it. I'll feel the same way.

21
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,680
Father Kim!

22
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,057
Don't do it, Father Kim.

23
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,310
Thank you…

24
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,106
for everything.

25
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,652
It's a sin to end your own life.

26
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,737
You'll go to hell, Father Kim!

27
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,531
Even if you take your life,

28
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,825
Kim Hongsik will kill Prosecutor Park.

29
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,493
Kim Hongsik.

30
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,288
You better keep your promise.

31
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,421
Don't do it! I'm serious!

32
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:15,593
Even if I die, I can still go to heaven
because this is murder!

33
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,804
I don't mind going to hell…

34
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,224
if it means I can save you.

35
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,561
Father Kim…

36
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,621
Yes!

37
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,834
Fautor?

38
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,627
Whoo-hoo!

39
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,837
Nice!

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,589
Huh.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,883
What happened?

42
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,635
It seems like they used a sonic weapon.

43
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,179
You mean them?

44
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,432
What do we do now?

45
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,392
You asshole!

46
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,359
No more fooling around.

47
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,529
Prosecutor Park!

48
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,032
Thank you. Thank you all.

49
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,452
-You must've been terrified.
-Goodness, this darn thing.

50
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,590
Let's go.

51
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes, sir.

52
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,719
We'll get the cash
and leave the country right away.

53
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,433
Sister Kim! Father Han!

54
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,517
Oh…

55
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,728
I'm not Sister Kim.

56
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,647
And I'm not Father Han.

57
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,106
We're…

58
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,776
-The fautores.
-…the fautores.

59
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,156
Sister Kim, Father Han,
you guys were the fautores?

60
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,158
-I said I'm not Sister Kim!
-I said I'm not Father Han!

61
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,535
Come on,

62
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,789
you definitely are
Sister Kim and Father Han.

63
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,750
Even if I squint, you're definitely
Sister Kim and Father Han.

64
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,879
Now that we've fulfilled our duty,
let's get going, Fautor Han.

65
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,924
Yes, let's disappear into thin air,
Fautor Kim.

66
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,842
- Wait, hang on.
- Where are you going?

67
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,052
-You have nowhere to go.
-Come on.

68
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,973
What are Sister Kim and Father Han saying?

69
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,518
-Nam Jin used to wear clothes like that.
-That's right.

70
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,437
Right, the famous trot singer.

71
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,197
-Great job! Nice!
-I survived!

72
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,949
-Thank you!
-Nice!

73
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,367
My gosh!

74
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,536
Episode 11
Real Prayers Are Made on the Move!

75
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,914
I really thought I was going
to become the damsel in distress.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,085
What would you have done
if the fautores hadn't shown up?

77
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,547
I would've let you go.

78
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,424
The dead should go,
and the living must go on.

79
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,634
You're right.

80
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,012
-There's too much good food in this world.
-Exactly.

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,098
-What should we eat?
-You guys are always messing around.

82
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,059
- Prosecutor Park!
- Detective Gu!

83
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,020
Are you okay?

84
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,938
Did something happen?

85
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,649
You tell me. Did something happen?

86
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,861
Drop the act. We all know.

87
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,446
-Sorry? About what?
-Sorry?

88
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,364
You guys are making it so obvious.

89
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,992
- Look at that and your shoes.
- Oh, our shoes.

90
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,995
How could you be
both a comes and a fautor?

91
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,332
Well, they're usually two separate people,

92
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,459
but because you're so reckless--

93
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,668
What?

94
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,131
I meant because you're so unpredictable,

96
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:45,053
we were told to stay by your side
and keep a close watch on you.

97
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,847
I'm well aware
of the Pyeongtaek Ten-Tailed Fox's skills,

98
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,766
but what was with your roar, Father Han?

99
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,477
You know how I can't control my anger.

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,354
So I just roared!

101
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,356
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,608
I channeled that anger
into a powerful roar.

103
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,193
Goodness me.

104
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,488
It was truly
a grueling training experience.

105
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:13,623
-I told you you had talent.
-You were right.

106
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,250
Thank you so much, my lifesavers.

107
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,004
What are you doing?

108
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,590
Anyway, thanks to me,
you guys get to be fautores.

109
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,175
What a spiritual upgrade.

110
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,260
It's truly amazing.

111
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,805
How did you settle everything
in a matter of two days?

112
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,809
Kim Haeil's other name is Kim Settle.

113
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,938
-I somehow settled it.
-Ah.

114
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,189
Let me tell you.

115
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,316
Stop!

116
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,318
Stop!

117
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,821
You have to go the other way.

118
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,073
- The road is under construction.
- That's right.

119
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,866
- You have to go the other way.
- Yes.

120
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,118
Go on then.

121
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,203
- The road collapsed.
- Right.

122
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,163
- It's under construction.
- That's right.

123
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,457
- Go on.
- Please go the other way.

124
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,000
The road is under construction.

125
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,336
Let's do the final review tomorrow.

126
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,465
Go the other way!

127
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,220
Thanks for your cooperation,
you drug dealers.

128
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:12,098
Get out of our country, you assholes.

129
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,726
I had the NIS bring in
a chemical weapons disposal team

130
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,437
to remove the toxic gas.

131
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,566
But wouldn't Kim Hongsik

132
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,484
have noticed if it was removed?

133
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,612
I replaced it with helium
so he wouldn't notice.

134
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,947
What about the bomb?

135
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,616
- Did you meet with Boss Park?
- Yes.

136
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,662
He went crazy at the mention
of the money on the boat.

137
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,497
Are they going to cooperate
with the bomb disposal?

138
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,082
Of course.

139
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,878
What else are they going to do
when their lives are on the line?

140
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,921
You didn't get any funny ideas

141
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,840
even knowing about the money.

142
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,844
The great Russian author Dostoevsky
once said,

143
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:56,142
"The people and society
come before one's desires."

144
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,730
Anyway, how are you
going to defuse the bomb?

145
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,024
Hmm.

146
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,651
I've heard a lot about you from Gozaev.

147
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,028
This way.

148
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,114
I'll send technicians
even NASA would be jealous of,

149
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,034
so just get them on the boat.

150
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,043
Please do your best.

151
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,127
Good luck!

152
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,713
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

153
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,598
Why are you crying?

154
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,809
-Just trust me.
-Okay.

155
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,611
Here I go.

156
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,828
Make sure to do it discreetly
so the censor doesn't go off.

157
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,834
Ah…

158
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,586
Kim Hongsik really has no luck

159
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,005
when it comes to
women and underlings, huh?

160
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,050
His underlings are just a bunch of morons.

161
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,177
We have to catch Nam Duhun and Kim Hongsik

162
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,804
if we don't want
to become morons ourselves.

163
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:15,930
Okey dokey.

164
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,390
Okey dokey it is.

165
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,016
Hey, Nam Duhun.

166
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,978
Let's go head-to-head, shall we?

167
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,271
Bring it on, punk!

168
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,482
What's wrong with her?

169
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,235
Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office

170
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,489
I wonder what I did so wrong

171
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,950
to have two men come for my life.

172
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,702
Oh my. What are you talking about?

173
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,996
"Oh my. What are you talking about?"

174
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,706
Enough playing dumb.

175
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,709
Let's just come clean.

176
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:45,876
Okay?

177
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,296
This is such a cliché line,

178
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,881
but you sure have a lot to say
for a traitor.

179
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,134
You can't call someone a traitor
for trying to take down

180
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,385
a corrupt prosecutor.

181
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,513
Well, you should've done better.

182
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,889
I'm not affected at all.

183
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,518
You want me to lay out all the evidence
that you and Kim Hongsik were in cahoots?

184
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,439
I've gathered a lot of evidence myself!

185
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,732
What the hell?

186
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,899
Are you also a traitor?

187
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,526
I didn't see this coming.

188
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,864
I heard you poured soju
over Chief Prosecutor Park's body!

189
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,241
You call yourself a human
after doing that?

190
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,493
Come on.

191
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,370
You're both people of the law.

192
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,748
You should at least have evidence
to make such claims.

193
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,750
You can't just blurt things
out of nowhere.

194
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:31,589
There are plenty of videos and recordings
of you and Kim Hongsik.

195
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,507
We can just claim they're deepfakes…

196
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,177
and prevent any analysis.

197
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,181
Wow, having thick skin is a skill
and an advantage in itself, isn't it?

198
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,266
Hey, Traitor Prosecutor Park.

199
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,311
You know that famous saying, right?

200
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,856
The law is like a spiderweb.

201
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,691
A fly may get caught in it and die…

202
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,110
But a wasp breaks through and escapes.

203
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,195
That's it.

204
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,907
That's the unwavering strength of the law.

205
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,284
Now, what am I in this metaphor?

206
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,995
The wasp.

207
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,247
Well, listen up, wasp.

208
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,501
I'll make a web tighter than chains
and have you trapped in it.

209
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,546
Launching real soon.

210
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,093
Let me know if I can preorder it.

211
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,764
All right, let's get back to work.

212
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,557
I don't think I will.

213
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,812
I'm sore all over
after surviving two close calls.

214
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,855
Then get lost.

215
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,692
I'll be respectful only until today.

216
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,361
I'm afraid I won't be able to treat you
like a human starting tomorrow.

217
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,530
-Likewise.
-Oh my.

218
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,408
Animals are treated better than humans
these days.

219
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,243
Why, thank you.

220
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,372
Prosecutor Park, the ultimate traitor.

221
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,456
What, you punk?

222
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,333
What the heck?

223
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,252
You said you'd be respectful until today.

224
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,754
A day has already passed in my head.

225
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,340
Whatever.

226
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,592
Tell me who you and the priest
are affiliated with.

227
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,887
You're better off not knowing,
or you'll be in deep trouble.

228
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,265
Fine, I never asked.

229
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,642
I'll just enjoy life without knowing.

230
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,852
Get lost!

231
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,232
That son of a gun.

232
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,358
That asshole.

233
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,486
That piece of shit.

234
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,741
Where in the world
did he learn to talk so annoyingly?

235
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,659
Do they have an academy for that?

236
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,787
What do we do now
that everything's out in the open?

237
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:27,872
What do you mean?

238
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,498
We go for it.

239
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,542
We'll raid the honey jar room tonight.

240
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,210
But there are CCTVs inside.

241
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,546
We can cover our faces.

242
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,052
Not that it'll help.

243
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,930
Okay.

244
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,057
I'll take the lead.

245
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,142
Let's go.

246
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,147
How did things escalate to this?

247
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,608
-Interpol?
-Yes.

248
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,569
I received intel that they're arresting
someone on an Interpol Red Notice,

249
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,237
and I think it's Kim Hongsik.

250
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:04,325
There aren't any notable global scumbags
in Busan other than him.

251
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,661
Doesn't Interpol usually request
cooperation from the local police?

252
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,748
-They do.
-They want him caught discreetly.

253
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,082
Who?

254
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,959
Prosecutor Nam.

255
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,379
He cut ties with Kim Hongsik,
knowing things were going south.

256
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,965
Who do you think
would benefit the most from that?

257
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,675
Nam Duhun.

258
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:24,637
You're right.
The departmental chief prosecutor

259
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,348
who played a key role
in catching the drug lord.

260
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,934
He'll lay out all the drugs,
corpses, and weapons

261
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,395
and take all the credit.

262
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:38,108
We have to catch Kim Hongsik first
and make sure to bring Nam Duhun down.

263
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,446
He'll most likely stay in hiding
and escape the country by boat at night.

264
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,948
We'll be on the move,

265
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,742
so let us know right away
if his whereabouts are found.

266
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,910
Wait.

267
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,038
I almost forgot
about the personnel transfer.

268
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,422
I heard the new leader
of the Narcotics Team is here.

269
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,550
Yes, she just arrived.

270
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,805
You have a long, tough road ahead of you,
Team Leader Gu Jayoung.

271
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,973
What?

272
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,188
Auntie, you're a team leader like me now.

273
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,648
You're climbing up the ladder real fast.

274
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,441
There's no way, Chief.

275
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,902
I can't take on
such a heavy responsibility.

276
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,404
You're more than fit to take it on.

277
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,573
Oh, there he is.

278
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,533
-Come on.
-Hello.

279
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,119
- Detective Bing Sangu.
- Yes?

280
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,662
From this moment on,

281
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,581
you'll be reinstated
to the Uma Police Narcotics Team.

282
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,125
Wait, me?

283
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,127
But I'm Capelin.

284
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,421
I dug through
the Drug Investigation Unit records

285
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,256
at Chungnam Provincial Police Agency

286
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:47,845
and found the only remaining
personnel record of yours.

287
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,722
Public official ID
Bing Sangu

288
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,100
A round of applause!

289
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,689
"Please be informed
of the following appointment."

290
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,774
My record. "Corporal Bing Sangu."

291
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,235
Thank you.

292
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,406
Thank you so much, Chief.

293
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,784
I look forward to working with you,
Detective Bing.

294
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,078
I'll help with all my heart and soul,
Team Leader Gu.

295
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,540
We'll go catch Kim Hongsik,

296
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,627
so Team Leader Gu Jayoung
can go catch Boss Park.

297
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,753
Okay.

298
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,296
Do we have his location?

299
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,008
I'll locate him and let you know
right away, Team Leader Gu Jayoung.

300
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,139
- Be more genuine, will you?
- All right.

301
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,766
Let's go.

302
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,405
Are you sure
this is where you hid the money?

303
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,657
Yes, sir.

304
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,533
I swear we moved it all here.

305
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,459
God damn it.

306
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,179
I don't care about that petty cash.

307
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,056
We have more stashed away.

308
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,474
But you know what pisses me off?

309
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,936
It's the fact that we survived
the hellish jungle…

310
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:24,441
only to come to this pathetic country
and become complete idiots.

311
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,905
I've been too generous, haven't I?

312
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,952
One mistake, one life.

313
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:40,916
Who wants to die?

314
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,446
Good work.

315
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,578
Boss Park, that asshole.

316
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,332
Hey, Kim.

317
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,294
You son of a bitch.
Where'd you hide the money?

318
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,006
Where do you think?
It's with me.

319
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,424
Thanks for the money.

320
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,009
Bye.

321
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:34,845
I hung up! I hung up on him!

322
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,765
Oh, he's calling again.

323
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,683
Hey, Hongsik.

324
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,769
Where did you hide the money,
you piece of shit?

325
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,604
I've gone into hiding,

326
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,148
so don't waste your time
trying to find me.

327
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,483
Bye-bye then.

328
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,748
Damn it, that hurts.

329
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,667
We really got that Kim Hongsik, didn't we?

330
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:08,962
By the way,

331
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,299
what if he finds us?

332
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,844
He won't ever find me. You know why?

333
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,138
I've got him in the palm of my hand.

334
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,140
-The palm of your hand?
-Oh, right.

335
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,435
One to two weeks
is too long for laundering money.

336
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,520
Can't you speed it up?

337
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,064
I'll look into it again.

338
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,982
Let me ask you something.

339
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,153
You're sure there's money
inside the boxes, right?

340
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,281
Of course. What else would be in them?

341
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,200
Are you doubting me right now?

342
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,701
You're hurting my feelings, Goza.

343
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,372
It's not like that, my friend.

344
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,958
I just…

345
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,420
…want to get a whiff of our money.

346
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,382
Go smell it all you want.

347
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,425
Hey.

348
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,262
Stop eating.

349
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,389
That's why you're fat!

350
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,684
My half of the money.

351
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,936
I'll see you soon.

352
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,730
I'm only nagging
because you eat so damn much!

353
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,871
You put the tracker with the money, right?

354
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,124
Of course. Look here.

355
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,293
I hid the tracker right here

356
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,379
and put it in a box
without anyone noticing.

357
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,548
I'll kill you
if you take off with that money.

358
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,716
Goodness gracious.

359
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,509
I won't, okay?

360
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,845
Do you see me as a bandit or something?

361
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,054
What? Bandit?

362
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,642
Anyway, was Boss Park anxious
after taking off with Kim Hongsik's money?

363
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,060
Not at all.

364
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,229
He's on his high horse saying he won't die

365
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,024
and that he's got Kim Hongsik
in the palm of his hand.

366
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,568
He's so full of himself right now.

367
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,737
By the way,

368
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:00,991
how are we going to catch Kim Hongsik?

369
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,367
I don't know.

370
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,786
We have to wait
until we get a location on his vehicle.

371
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,622
What if he takes a different vehicle?

372
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,461
What's the matter with you?

373
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,255
And what if he flees
to the other side of the world?

374
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,673
Stop it already.

375
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,717
-Spit out your words. Take it back!
-Take it back!

376
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,594
It's your fault if he runs away!

377
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,262
Why would it be my fault?

378
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,472
It's your fault!

379
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,182
Of course it is!
Did you spit out your words?

380
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,684
I told you not to speak without thinking.

381
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,269
Spit them out three times.

382
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,522
Is this where Hongsik is?

383
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,691
Yes, near Changrim Port.

384
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,276
Goodness me.

385
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,030
Even the great Kim Hongsik doesn't realize
there's a tracker on his car, does he?

386
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,867
But I don't think there's a boat
big enough for him to stow away on.

387
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,994
Aha, I guess you don't know.

388
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,580
It's a trend these days
to set off on a small boat

389
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,124
and transfer to a bigger one.

390
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,334
Is that so?

391
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,295
Hopping over and transferring
is the trend these days, huh?

392
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,214
Just like what you did?

393
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,883
They'll start moving at night,

394
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,136
so I'll call Interpol
and tell them to move in then.

395
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,182
Make sure you don't lose him until then.

396
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,102
Yes, sir.
Okay, I got it.

397
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,562
By the way, sir,

398
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:16,066
are you just going to let
Mr. Yong and Lee from customs be?

399
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,985
Of course not.

400
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,947
Speaking of which, you've got guys
in the detention center, right?

401
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,574
That's my turf.

402
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,701
Ah!

403
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,704
Are you thinking of getting rid of them
by sending them there?

404
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,125
New Era Unification Party
Chairman Kim Mancheon

405
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,669
- Hold on.
- Sorry? Hold…

406
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,130
Yes, Chairman Kim.
To what do I owe your call, sir?

407
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,800
You're in Busan?

408
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,138
You know Lee Eungsu from customs

409
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,223
who was arrested in the drug case?

410
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,894
Can you bail him out?

411
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:59,318
He's acquainted with my associates.

412
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,240
Can't you just pressure the Police Agency?

413
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,617
I already did.

414
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:13,957
But the chief of Uma Police won't listen
to the commissioner general.

415
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:18,628
You've got this place under control,
don't you?

416
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,048
Do something about Uma Police.

417
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:25,719
People will start talking
if I get involved.

418
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,137
You should just keep--

419
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,472
Hey, hey.

420
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,183
Prosecutor Nam.

421
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,893
Yes, sir.

422
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,938
Does it look like
I'm asking you for a favor?

423
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,861
You think you can talk back to me

424
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,823
just because I've catered to you
a couple of times because of my son?

425
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm sorry if I offended you.

426
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,038
Do as I say
when I'm treating you with respect,

427
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,625
and just take whatever's given to you.

428
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:00,879
Got it?

429
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,840
Yes, sir.

430
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,885
Team Leader Hyeon,

431
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,555
I'll send you a warrant later,

432
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,725
so send Mr. Yong to a detention center
and let Lee from customs go.

433
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,394
I've got bad news.

434
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:58,728
The thing is…

435
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,191
the female detective
is now the leader of the Narcotics Team,

436
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,111
so she has everything covered real good.

437
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,155
Anyone can be
a team leader these days, huh?

438
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,491
Then do something to take her down!

439
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,787
I'll take responsibility this time again,

440
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,081
you incompetent punk.

441
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,000
What did he say?

442
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,293
He'll take responsibility?

443
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,587
I might end up getting taken down

444
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,755
trying to take her down.

445
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:29,968
Whatever.

446
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,845
Let's go.

447
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,391
It's time to go home, Mr. Yong.

448
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,101
What the heck?

449
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,979
What's going on? Who are you?

450
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,063
Us?

451
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,275
We're Team Leader Gu's power supporters.

452
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,569
Why are you guys in the holding cell?

453
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,655
I guess you could call it
a simulated holding cell experience…

454
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,201
for the power supporters. Darn it.

455
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,162
Where did the legless man

456
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,165
and the incredibly average-looking man go?

457
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,711
- Lost again.
- I'm not sure.

458
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,338
-Oh, jeez.
-Jeez.

459
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,298
Perhaps they dug through the wall
and broke out.

460
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,218
They're probably
at the Gijeong intersection by now.

461
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,428
You could try opening
all the manhole covers there.

462
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,430
Right, ma'am?

463
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,349
Hey, you two who rolled in out of nowhere.

464
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,102
I'm not in the mood
to joke around with you.

465
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,479
Just go. Go.

466
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:25,315
Jeez, you're hurting our feelings.

467
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,275
Team Leader Hyeon Woocheol.

468
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,987
The Internal Affairs Division
from the Police Agency is asking for you.

469
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,240
- Inspectors?
- Ah.

470
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,492
The leader
of Criminal Investigation Team 1

471
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,160
and your teammates are waiting in the car.

472
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,372
He said he'd take responsibility…

473
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,624
…but it's just me that's going down.

474
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,543
Have a nice trip.

475
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,339
Goodbye.

476
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,097
I won't see you out.

477
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,598
Bye.

478
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,058
- Goodbye.
- Wait a second.

479
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,436
Don't worry.
They've been in there for a while.

480
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,897
Anything on Kim Hongsik?

481
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:06,982
Nothing yet.

482
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:09,234
They're searching but they got nothing.

483
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,403
Nam Duhun will have no way out
if we get our hands

484
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:12,612
on the honey jar, right?

485
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,365
Yes. Prosecutor Park
can immediately arrest him

486
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,742
and issue a travel ban.

487
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,954
I'll scrape
every last bit of the honey jar

488
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,622
like I'm scraping cheese crust off a pan.

489
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,958
Don't overdo it and be careful.

490
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,334
Don't mess it up.

491
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,879
I have to overdo it to make things work.

492
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,506
Make sure you get Kim Hongsik.

493
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,383
You're dead meat!

494
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,551
You're all dead meat!

495
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,845
All right, be careful.

496
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,764
Is this bastard not leaving today?

497
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,392
Is he just going to stay here?
Why is he so quiet?

498
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:46,771
You're right. He's awfully quiet.
Is he really going to stay?

499
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,413
You didn't bring a crowbar today.

500
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,749
Come on, not in this day and age.

501
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,334
Also, I have a fear…

502
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,127
…of crowbars now.

503
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,796
Then how will we open this?

504
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,382
With high-tech equipment!

505
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,260
Where did you get that?

506
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,889
There's someone
who can easily obtain things like this.

507
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,558
A lock like this will be cracked
in less than 10 seconds.

508
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,768
Two, four, six, eight…

509
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,355
- It's open.
- All right.

510
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,231
Let's go in.

511
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,609
Gosh, I'm nervous.

512
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,055
Why is it so empty?

513
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,807
I don't even see a safe or anything.

514
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,685
So he gets rid of the files
instead of collecting them?

515
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,270
Seeing how there's a scanner,

516
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,481
maybe he scans them
and saves them somewhere.

517
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,986
How can it be this empty?

518
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,238
Where did everything go?

519
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,781
There's no Wi-Fi in here either.

520
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,616
- Prosecutor Park.
- Yes?

521
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,702
I think that's a clue.

522
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,412
What's that?

523
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,914
It's a data transmission device.

524
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:32,460
To put it simply, he's transferring
the data from the computer elsewhere.

525
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:36,339
So he's moving the data
from this place to another.

526
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,424
Then what's this place for?

527
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,885
It's a data transmission center.
It's not where he stores the files.

528
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,973
So he sends the files
to a place only he knows.

529
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,934
Where in the world is he sending them?

530
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:53,314
The transmission range is limited,
so I'm sure it's not far from here.

531
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,526
Can't we just take everything here
and run a forensic analysis?

532
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,737
Prosecutor Nam is an expert in that field.

533
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,655
He would've ensured
these couldn't be analyzed.

534
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,951
Man, he's unbelievably cunning, isn't he?

535
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,121
Where is he hiding the files?

536
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,539
"Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office"

537
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,876
I found out the area where Phukha is,

538
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,754
so I will send you the coordinates now.

539
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,215
Then are you going to kill him
if he resists?

540
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,427
Oh, I see.

541
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,846
Why, of course you can kill him.

542
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Good luck.

543
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,060
I meant to give this to you earlier today.

544
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,230
Herbal medicine,
each one worth one million won.

545
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,984
You didn't have to.

546
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,779
Oh, jeez! You scared me.

547
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,948
You got beat up so bad that you drool
every time you open your mouth.

548
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,076
This is the least I can do for my friend.

549
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,578
You're the best, my friend.

550
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,499
Thank you. I'll make sure to eat these
and recover quickly.

551
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,629
By the way,

552
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,881
about Chairman Kim who beat you up.

553
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,633
Did he leave Busan?

554
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,596
No way. He's in hiding.

555
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,099
Where exactly?

556
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,436
Near Changrim Port.

557
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,896
Ah!

558
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,314
Oh, Changrim Port.

559
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,151
Gozaev

560
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,492
Hmm. Mmm!

561
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,910
That's waking me up.

562
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,453
Really? Give me one too.

563
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,164
Mmm!

564
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,000
Let's wake up and go to Changrim Port!

565
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,168
- Go!
- Yeah!

566
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,296
You're dead meat, Kim Hongsik.

567
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,798
Tracking location…

568
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,300
Father Kim Haeil

569
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,469
Thank you for the location on Boss Park.

570
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,138
I'm just a bit anxious,

571
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,266
so can't we go together
after we catch Kim Hongsik?

572
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,892
You don't even have enough guys.
Right, Chief?

573
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,604
Yes. I requested backup,
but it's been declined.

574
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,148
I'm sure Nam Duhun's behind that.

575
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,525
Don't worry.

576
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,194
I have
my old colleagues and Detective Bing,

577
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:05,071
and my power supporters are here too.

578
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,907
-Call me if anything happens, and be safe.
-Stay safe, Auntie.

579
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,202
Trust me, Boss Park and his guys
are a bunch of ragtag gangsters.

580
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,871
All right, let's head out now.

581
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,998
Father Michael Kim Haeil

582
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,376
Yes, Father Kim.

583
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,257
Listen up.

584
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,551
- Are you all ready?
- Yes!

585
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,720
Let's put our fears aside,

586
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,764
believe in the power of God and our guts,

587
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,933
and face them with our bare hands!

588
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,227
Hey.

589
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,229
Are you going out to catch a vampire?

590
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,356
I'm sorry, my hands felt empty.

591
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,568
Hallelujah!

592
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,196
Noah! Noah!

593
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,823
Oh.

594
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,700
What is this, a religious war?

595
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,327
That's too much. It's excessive.

596
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,454
It's such a waste
to only use it during Christmastime.

597
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,248
Okay, I'll leave it behind.

598
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,751
All right.

599
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,377
Let's go!

600
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,212
Let's go!

601
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,882
Cheers!

602
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,969
Hey.

603
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,513
Hey, Rockfish!

604
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,640
Good work.

605
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,767
You hid the money well, right?

606
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,686
What's wrong?

607
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,022
I feel bad doing this to Gozaev.

608
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,273
And?

609
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,692
But he'll never find it!

610
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,363
Listen.

611
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,282
You don't need to feel bad. You know why?

612
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,952
He's well aware that we're bad guys.

613
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,456
- Sit down and eat, Rockfish.
- Here, have some.

614
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,749
Here.

615
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,833
Ah…

616
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,418
Ah…

617
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,503
Jeez, what's that?

618
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,922
What the hell?

619
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,096
What's going on?

620
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,141
Stop eating and get up!

621
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,602
Jeez.

622
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,230
I feel like she's my younger sister now.

623
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,315
I'm both annoyed and glad to see her.

624
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,485
Wait, isn't that Capelin?

625
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,904
What are you doing there?
Come here.

626
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,614
What are you doing over there?

627
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,157
Capelin, my foot.

628
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,784
I'm not Capelin anymore.

629
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,744
I'm Detective Bing Sangu!

630
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,788
You were a cop?

631
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:21,958
How interesting! What a turn of events!

632
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,376
Are you also a cop?

633
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,919
Shut up!

634
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,964
We'll give you a good beating
before locking you up,

635
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,841
you drug-dealing assholes.

636
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,554
Tell you what.

637
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,348
I'll make sure to visit your graves

638
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,851
and pour soju over them.

639
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,103
You talk too much.

640
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,896
All right!

641
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,524
Come on out!

642
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,485
- Come on over.
- Get your weapons!

643
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,741
Two, four, six, eight, ten…

644
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,284
Oh, there's quite a lot of them.

645
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,869
I feel so reassured!

646
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,620
All right!

647
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,123
Kill them!

648
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:09,547
Changrim Port

649
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:19,766
Hold your position
until they reach the boat.

650
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:20,850
Standby.

651
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,795
Hold on.

652
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,131
It's so hot.

653
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,633
Bring it on.

654
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,326
Here. You bastard!

655
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,828
Just you wait.

656
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,037
Wait? Wait for what?

657
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,665
Block him!

658
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,087
-Move!
-Hey, Capelin!

659
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,514
Oh, I'm sorry.

660
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,117
Man, you guys suck at fighting.

661
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,702
Sir.

662
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,912
-Get up. Come on.
-Come on.

663
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,956
The batteries ran out.

664
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,792
You should've brought more guys.

665
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,253
You overestimated us.

666
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,629
You underestimated us.

667
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,049
Let's go!

668
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,427
What's that?

669
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,891
-What the heck?
-What?

670
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,058
How many Kim Haeils are there?

671
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,604
What is this, a field day?

672
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,398
It's a rematch, punks.

673
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,277
Hey, kid, don't do that.

674
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,821
-It's dangerous!
-Yeah, don't do that.

675
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,198
Get ready!

676
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,116
Guts!

677
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:44,827
Taekwon!

678
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,208
You're so cool!

679
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,628
What's that?

680
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,254
-What?
-Huh?

681
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,897
It was a bust! An absolute bust!

682
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,815
You really didn't find anything?

683
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,361
There was absolutely nothing
apart from an outdated karaoke machine.

684
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,696
Then I guess we won't be able
to catch Nam Duhun right away.

685
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,908
Jeez. Where in the world
did he hide the honey jar?

686
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,328
Stress!

687
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,789
Let's catch Kim Hongsik first
so you can relieve your stress.

688
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,374
Did he show up?

689
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,458
Yeah, we got his coordinates.

690
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,878
Okay, let's get it! Let's go!

691
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,349
- What the hell?
- No, Father! That's dangerous!

692
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:52,937
When the flame of judgment
falls between them,

693
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,065
go forth with the will of the Lord.
Got it?

694
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,818
Yes!

695
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,111
It's dangerous, Father!

696
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:03,823
Let's go!

697
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,329
Ouch, my shoulder.

698
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,623
Father Lee!

699
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,667
You've got to be kidding me.

700
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,918
Fire!

701
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,920
- Father Lee!
- What are you waiting for? Go!

702
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,172
- Let's go!
- No!

703
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,264
There are too many of them. I'm going.

704
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,766
You go. You go fight them!

705
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,075
Hey.

706
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,537
I'm tired of this.

707
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,498
Let's end this.

708
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,464
What the hell?

709
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,424
Damn it.

710
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,676
Guts!

711
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,107
Let's go!

712
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,033
It looks like Boss Park ran away.

713
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,661
Let him.

714
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,836
Oh, that's nice.

715
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,385
The last one laughing
is the victor, right?

716
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,058
What the…

717
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,230
Looks like…

718
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,233
I'm the last one laughing.

719
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,317
Goza!

720
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,195
I was going to call you.

721
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,573
This is our money, Goza!

722
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,699
We'll split it 50/50.

723
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:11,826
Tell me.

724
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,745
-Who's 50?
-You, of course.

725
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,333
You were just born an asshole.

726
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,669
Wait, wait, wait!

727
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,672
Okay, you take 60!

728
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:28,592
No, 70! 70! Fine, 80! 80!

729
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:34,181
Changrim Port

730
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,903
Is that the boat?

731
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,989
Yes, sir. Let's go.

732
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,496
Freeze, you tall ass Phukha!

733
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,259
Interpol here.

734
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:13,345
Hands up, on the ground.

735
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,222
Any resistance…

736
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,475
whoo, we're happy to shoot you down.

737
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,854
Oh my.

738
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,483
Thank you very much for arresting them.

739
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:29,320
Oh, you must be
Nam Duhun, the chief prosecutor?

740
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,821
-Yes, I am.
-Oh.

741
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,239
Thanks for your cooperation.

742
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,326
Wow, you look so handsome, as I thought.

743
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,953
Oh… well, you too.

744
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,291
Hey, Phukha.

745
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,543
You are going to get shot.

746
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,505
Just get down.

747
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:53,135
You befriended Interpol, huh?

748
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,600
I said…
get your ass down on the ground!

749
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,734
It was an honor
to work with you, my brothers.

750
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,736
It was an honor for us as well.

751
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,322
You drug dealers are so full of it.

752
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,533
Hey, hey!

753
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,453
If they don't respond,

754
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,539
let's kill them.

755
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,167
Last warning!

756
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,630
Get down on the ground! Now!

757
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,307
Hmm?

758
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,476
- You're here.
- Hey.

759
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,103
-Where's Kim Hongsik?
-Over there.

760
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,565
Wait, isn't that Nam Duhun?

761
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,691
Why is he here?

762
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,526
Won't it end if we just leave them be?

763
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,778
Yes, and it'll be a total victory
for Nam Duhun.

764
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,823
Lord, please don't give a happy ending
to the devils.

765
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,741
-Wait, where are you going?
-You're going to get shot!

766
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,868
- Now!
- Everybody, stop!

767
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,036
Stop, stop, stop!

768
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,663
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

769
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,373
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

770
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,874
- You scared me!
- Hey, hey.

771
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,376
So you're Nam Duhun.

772
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,545
Oh, you're from
the traveling theater troupe.

773
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,963
Hey.

774
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:14,133
I'm a prosecutor of the Republic of Korea.

775
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,217
I'm a detective.

776
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,385
I'm a priest.

777
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,636
You're a journalist, right?

778
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,929
No, no, no. Interpol.

779
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,932
- What? Interpol, my foot.
- You're Ki Deokgi. You have dark brows.

780
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,643
He is Phukha's accomplice.

781
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,479
He betrayed Phukha to find a way to live.

782
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:28,939
- Ignore them.
- Yes.

783
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,735
And the purpose of using Interpol
is to get rid of Phukha.

784
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,819
It's true. No lie.

785
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,362
N-No lie?

786
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,530
What are you doing, Captain?

787
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,948
We are going to miss them!

788
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,450
- What are you on about?
- You bastard!

789
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,327
Okay, shut up! Shut up!

790
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,539
Your problems are your problems to solve.

791
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,291
Me? I'm only here for Phukha.

792
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:49,710
-No, no, I told you, he's an accomplice.
-No, no, no.

793
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,211
Okay, enough with this shit!

794
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,463
On the count of three!

795
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,797
We will fire!

796
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,923
-No, no!
-One!

797
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,884
-Hey, hey, no, no, no! Hey, hey!
-Wait, wait!

798
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,969
- Hey, hey! No! Hey!
- Two!

799
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,305
Hey, hey, hey…

800
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,088
What just happened?

801
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:37,216
Kim Hongsik sure is lucky, isn't he?

802
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,177
I'd better go before he comes for me.

803
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,013
I'm never coming back here.

804
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,432
Later, seagulls!

805
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,435
Breaking news.

806
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,270
At 11:35 p.m. today,

807
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,481
an aircraft door fell at Changrim Port,

808
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:56,485
resulting in three fatalities
and two critically injured.

809
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,780
The three deceased were members
of a Southeast Asian drug cartel,

810
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,532
while the two injured individuals

811
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,450
were Interpol officers
attempting to apprehend them.

812
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,661
Passenger A illegally opened the door

813
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,454
at an altitude of 300 meters
before landing…

814
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,791
What the hell were they thinking,
opening that door?

815
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,544
At least the drug dealers were punished.

816
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,630
The person who opened the door
should also be punished.

817
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:20,259
You're right.
They could've easily killed more people.

818
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,846
Meanwhile, the surviving
drug cartel boss and two of his associates

819
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,472
took advantage of the chaos
to flee the scene,

820
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,141
and Interpol is currently in pursuit.

821
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,978
This is Ki Deokgi with ZBS,

822
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:33,522
bringing you only the facts.

823
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,690
Goodness.

824
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,443
We didn't get Kim Hongsik
nor the honey jar.

825
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:41,155
Our efforts aren't paying off.
It's all in vain.

826
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,157
We should still thank God.

827
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,118
At least he didn't give Nam Duhun
a happy ending.

828
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,495
On a brighter note,

829
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,581
we've arrested Boss Park and all his guys.

830
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,416
Thanks to Dokseong.

831
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,211
Gozaev of Vladivostok.

832
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,631
I'm still alive!

833
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,764
Although that's been our only win,

834
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,558
it's still nice being here
all together like this.

835
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,810
-You're right.
-It sure is.

836
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,687
And Chief, Ms. Kim, and Detective Bing,

837
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,274
thank you so much for being on our side.

838
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,151
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

839
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,819
No, not at all.

840
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,697
You all are the true heroes.

841
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,909
She's right.
You're doing what the world can't do.

842
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:30,788
No, you three are the true heroes.

843
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,540
Being a true hero
isn't doing what the world can't do,

844
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,417
but doing what the world refuses to do.

845
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,798
Regardless, our country
needs people like you.

846
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,800
People like us can't change the world.

847
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:46,053
People like you who do
what needs to be done make a difference.

848
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,137
That's right.

849
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,681
What the world needs
isn't private justice,

850
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,768
but proper
and well-established public justice.

851
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,854
That's right. That's the real hope.

852
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:56,939
Indeed.

853
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,817
Whatever the higher-ups say,
we just do what we need to.

854
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,778
By the way, what are you eating?

855
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:06,114
I'm aching all over
from fighting all the time.

856
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,241
Oh.

857
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,284
I'm aching way more than you.

858
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,745
-I have bad knees.
-My joints are aching.

859
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,664
-Form a line.
-I'm first!

860
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,834
How are we going to catch
Kim Hongsik and Nam Duhun?

861
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,961
You ruined the mood.

862
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:20,921
You're such a mood killer, you pig.

863
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,340
We can talk tomorrow.

864
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:24,842
I'm going to go home and get some…

865
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,718
Actually, I can't.

866
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,887
That damn house.

867
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,472
I hate it!

868
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,140
Why do you hate it there?

869
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,433
Is there a ghost or something?

870
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,061
-Bingo. How'd you know?
-Sorry?

871
00:47:36,144 --> 00:47:38,397
There's Polka Dot and the pigeon.

872
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,482
Let me tell you while we're on it.

873
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,776
- So…
- No, I'm not listening!

874
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,862
- Wait!
- I don't want to listen.

875
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,030
-Goodness.
-Where are you all going?

876
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,616
So there's a ghost at your place?
Tell me.

877
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,618
You're the best, Yohan.
Our worldwide star.

878
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,453
-Oh, please.
-You ready to stay up all night?

879
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,539
-Yes.
-So the thing is…

880
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,958
there's a ghost,
and she's actually a murder victim.

881
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:09,511
Do you think Kim Hongsik fled the country?

882
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,473
I looked through his records,
and he's all about getting revenge.

883
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,309
He'll get revenge on Nam Duhun
before fleeing.

884
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:19,688
I wonder why Kim Hongsik,
the infamous drug cartel boss,

885
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:21,440
can't make a dent in Korea.

886
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,649
You want to know why?

887
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,775
Hmm?

888
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,694
-Do you?
-Yes.

889
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:26,778
Listen carefully.

890
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,406
In Korea, it's the intelligent people

891
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,117
who form cartels
and get into shady business.

892
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,746
So there isn't
a single bad guy in the world

893
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,248
who can take on Korea's elite cartels.

894
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,459
True.

895
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,837
These cartels don't use guns.
They use the law as a weapon.

896
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,631
Bullets would be better.

897
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,133
With the law, even a scrape
can destroy your entire family.

898
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,556
How have you been, sir?

899
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,016
It's Nam Duhun.

900
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,186
Have you seen your kid's criminal record
and interrogation details,

901
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:00,771
along with all the other nonsense?

902
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,814
-This little…
-The reason I ask

903
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,859
is that I have a rather bold request.

904
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,444
I'm planning to go to Seoul

905
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,614
to pursue my dream
and make a name for myself,

906
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,824
and I'm in desperate need of your help…

907
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,576
- …to make this happen.
- This bastard.

908
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,870
Please help this lost lamb

909
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,705
find a good pasture

910
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,959
-that's flowing with milk and honey.
-This sneaky bastard.

911
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,377
I apologize for the sudden request,

912
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,545
but I'd appreciate your response
within 10 minutes.

913
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,922
Damn it.

914
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,925
If I don't hear back,

915
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:33,095
I'll make sure the records I sent you

916
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,596
go off like fireworks

917
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,099
tonight on the eight o'clock news.

918
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,976
Boom, boom, boom!

919
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:46,733
Nam Duhun, that bastard,

920
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,111
has gotten so cocky that his ego blew up.

921
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,780
How dare he threaten us?

922
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:55,367
That nutjob has completely lost his mind!

923
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:56,493
Chairman Kim.

924
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,037
Please say something.

925
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,999
Just because a dog barks

926
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,709
doesn't mean
we should join in and bark too.

927
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,129
Let's just toss him a bone for now…

928
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,965
and see how things go.

929
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,888
Oh my, have you all been well?

930
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:19,891
You took a lot longer than I expected.

931
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,662
Hot news that just came in
five minutes ago from Seocho-dong.

932
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,248
These damn bastards.

933
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:45,625
These scumbags.

934
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,252
"Nam Duhun appointed as new head of
Special Drug Investigation Headquarters"

935
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,339
Isn't the head of the SDH a high rank?

936
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:54,217
It's a position where you can take down
anyone except the president.

937
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,678
This sneaky bastard teleported all right.

938
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,555
SDH? As in subdural hematoma?

939
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,891
Is he planning to kill innocent people
with brain hemorrhages?

940
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,851
Seems like
there was a magnitude 9 earthquake

941
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,229
in Yeouido and Seocho-dong
that nobody would have noticed.

942
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,983
It's the kind of quake
only those in the honey jar would feel.

943
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,485
You should head back to Seoul.

944
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,279
Team Leader Gu and I
will take care of things here.

945
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,323
Yes, I think that'd be best.

946
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,241
Kim Hongsik also probably went to Seoul
to pursue Nam Duhun.

947
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:21,495
Okay, we'll be counting on you two then.

948
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,579
Sounds good.

949
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,790
All right, we're heading back
to our home field then.

950
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,625
Let's go!

951
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,960
They're all done for.

952
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,296
I have to pack first. Father Kim.

953
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,633
You're not going to send me back
to that haunted house alone, right?

954
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:40,222
It's broad daylight anyway.

955
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,974
Why do you need me
when you're just packing?

956
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,310
Because I'm scared.

957
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:46,978
You're scared too, right?

958
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,773
Me?

959
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,525
Why would I…

960
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,944
I'm a priest.

961
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,612
Don't lie.

962
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,698
I saw you trembling.

963
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,575
And you even passed out last time.

964
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,244
I wasn't trembling, okay?

965
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,829
I was just dancing.

966
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,124
Don't act tough.

967
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,333
Oh, right.

968
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,127
You said that the ghost
you saw in your dream

969
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,629
and the picture of the victim
are the same person.

970
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,713
Right?

971
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,717
No, no.

972
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,470
It was a dream, so I'm not sure.

973
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,973
I was mistaken.

974
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,685
Wait.

975
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,562
I'm sure it's not the same lady.

976
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,896
No, it can't be.

977
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,905
Stop being so distressed

978
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,575
and bring me the stuff on my bed.

979
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,493
You want me to go into the bedroom alone?

980
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,578
Well, yes.

981
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:47,038
Hurry up and go.

982
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,415
Okay.

983
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,834
It can't be.

984
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,711
Why is the door shut?

985
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,005
Goodness gracious.

986
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,883
I don't think
the exorcism worked properly.

987
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,637
Geezer Park!
Come here! Hurry!

988
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,849
-Come here! Oh, my goodness!
-What now?

989
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,185
What is it? What?

990
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,021
- My goodness.
- Look, look!

991
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,480
The coins.

992
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,566
What about the coins?

993
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,360
I dropped them
while opening my coin box yesterday.

994
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,612
Jeez.

995
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,197
I didn't have time to pick them up.

996
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,073
Don't touch them!

997
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,325
Why not?

998
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,327
You need them
for the vending machine or something?

999
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,536
You want them?

1000
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,787
It's just that…

1001
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,956
it's the same shape I saw in my dream.

1002
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,334
-In your dream?
-Yeah.

1003
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,841
I hear it. I hear it again.

1004
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,051
What's that sound?

1005
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:45,013
Where is it coming from?

1006
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,806
I think it's coming from there.

1007
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,516
Why are you going there?

1008
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,311
We need to know what it is
and where it's coming from.

1009
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,687
You scared me.

1010
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,943
Don't leave. Stay there.

1011
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,538
I hear something.

1012
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:11,706
Are you saying…

1013
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,668
there's something in there?

1014
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,965
Wait for me!

1015
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,268
Oh, my goodness.

1016
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:36,481
I think it's the murder victim.

1017
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:38,275
Ms. Polka Dot.

1018
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,609
Why is she…

1019
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,779
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1020
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,121
It's the person I saw in my dream.

1021
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,292
How did she end up like that?

1022
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:12,183
It's all thanks to
your spiritual intuition.

1023
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,185
I've been told that I have that.

1024
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:15,895
Spiritual intuition?

1025
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,522
Spiritual intuition?

1026
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,191
A priest with spiritual intuition?

1027
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,444
Lord,

1028
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:26,990
thanks to you, we were able
to find the body of the last victim.

1029
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,617
How is this even possible?

1030
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,952
Tell me about it, Auntie.

1031
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,371
What is this, some horror story?
Who would believe this?

1032
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,416
An aircraft door falling off,
and now a corpse behind the wall.

1033
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,835
Shouldn't we call a shaman or something?

1034
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,712
Come to your senses, Angela!

1035
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,007
God's will reveal itself
through meaningful coincidences.

1036
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:45,717
I take it back.

1037
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,511
Emmanuel. Hallelujah, hallelujah.

1038
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,317
Mom.

1039
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,527
Sangyeon.

1040
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,946
Sangyeon.

1041
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,199
Do you recognize me?

1042
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:14,329
Thank you, Lord.

1043
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,414
Sangyeon.

1044
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,384
Are you okay, Sangyeon? Everyone's here.

1045
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,135
It's me, holy altar boy Lee.

1046
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,137
Hi, Mr. Gu. Or should I say, "Young Gu"?

1047
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,098
Hey, Sangyeon.

1048
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:36,101
It's Sister Sarah.
I'm so proud of you for holding on.

1049
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:37,268
Sangyeon, it's me, Father Mark.

1050
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,855
I'll buy you a bunch of tteokbokki,
sundae, and malatang when I get to Seoul.

1051
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,816
It's me, Angela. Are you okay?

1052
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,193
I am. I'll hold you to your word.

1053
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,613
I heard you're all in Busan.

1054
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,907
Yeah, we're here to catch the devils.

1055
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,075
A whole bunch of them.

1056
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,327
Just you wait.
We'll catch them all

1057
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,830
and make sure to show them
that God exists.

1058
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:58,748
I know he exists,

1059
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,375
so make sure to beat them…

1060
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,712
Make sure to beat them up.

1061
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,423
We already did! There are only a few left.

1062
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,091
So just wait, and we'll see you in Seoul.

1063
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,385
Oh, Father Kim and Mr. Gu.

1064
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,095
Yeah? We're listening.

1065
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,472
I blame the meds for this…

1066
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,350
but I love you.

1067
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,269
-We love you too, Sangyeon!
-We love you too!

1068
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:23,189
-We love you lots!
-We love you!

1069
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,899
Take care of yourself.

1070
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,818
We'll be there in no time.
See you soon, okay?

1071
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:27,944
Yes, see you soon.

1072
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,071
-See you soon, Sangyeon.
-Bye!

1073
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,240
Thank God he's on meds, not drugs.

1074
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,200
-I'm so relieved.
-I knew he'd wake up.

1075
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,536
-I know.
-I feel more at ease hearing his voice.

1076
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,871
I know, right?

1077
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,790
Now let's go take down the devils.

1078
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,376
-Come on. Let's go!
-Let's get it!

1079
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,794
I'm hungry because we talked about food.

1080
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:47,005
- Can we get some hog maw?
- Absolutely not! Hurry up!

1081
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,718
Yeah?

1082
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,554
Then carry out a search and seizure
at Assemblyman An's house

1083
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,723
and leak it to the press.

1084
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,143
…the last victim,
and a police investigation is underway.

1085
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:04,022
I'll be working from home
for the time being,

1086
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:05,565
so call me if anything urgent comes up.

1087
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:11,029
…she was located
due to a smartwatch's alarm going off.

1088
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,530
There was a corpse next door.

1089
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,782
What a cruel scumbag.

1090
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,160
How can he hide a body behind a wall?

1091
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:19,871
No wonder.

1092
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,458
She was safeguarding the secret.

1093
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,377
How interesting.

1094
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,838
I'm one lucky guy.

1095
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,382
Hey.

1096
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:35,929
Take a look.

1097
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,230
I didn't know I'd see this gun in Korea.

1098
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,693
We carry every kind of gun
from around the world.

1099
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:52,987
Please reach out to us again.
We're always happy to assist.

1100
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,661
Mom.

1101
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:04,707
This life of evil isn't easy.

1102
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,340
Wow.

1103
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:14,634
It's the moon of Seoul.

1104
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,122
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1105
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,593
Now that we're back on our home field,
we're just going to go for it.

1106
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,804
Keep in mind that we might get hurt.

1107
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,806
How exactly might we get hurt?

1108
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:03,891
We're about to headbutt titanium,

1109
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,810
which is way stronger than solid ground.

1110
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:09,105
Even as the Night Guy,
just the thought of it is painful.

1111
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:12,400
This isn't news to us. It's okay.

1112
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:14,402
This is very different
from what we've done before.

1113
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:16,654
We're causing trouble out in the open.

1114
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,573
Believe in your fautores

1115
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,450
and cause all the trouble necessary.

1116
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,869
We've got your back.

1117
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,415
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

1118
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:29,459
- Not here. What are you doing?
- Are you okay?

1119
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,918
What's the matter with you?

1120
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,512
It's over for them.

1121
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,722
Oh, jeez.

1122
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:43,890
Ah!

1123
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,183
Wow.

1124
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,643
You're amazing.

1125
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,020
I can't hear a thing.

1126
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:51,230
Anyway…

1127
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:53,691
…we might be on TV.

1128
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,234
- What?
- What did you say?

1129
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,570
-Angela.
-TV.

1130
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,656
We might be on TV.

1131
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:00,865
- Oh, TV.
- Oh, TV.

1132
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,034
-Oh, TV.
-Yeah, yeah.

1133
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:06,996
Then I'd better get a massage
to make my face smaller.

1134
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,748
I have to go get a haircut.

1135
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,625
I should go get a skin treatment.

1136
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,918
-Let's go.
-Me too!

1137
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,712
-A massage, huh? Wait for me!
-Wait, Father Han. Hang on.

1138
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,839
Are they serious?

1139
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:18,424
We haven't even started yet.

1140
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,552
Stress!

1141
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,183
Lord,

1142
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,935
please help us out.

1143
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:34,857
Prosecutor Park Kyungsun

1144
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,859
of Southern District Prosecutors' Office's
Criminal Division 1

1145
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,237
and Father Kim Haeil
of the Catholic Archdiocese of Seoul

1146
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,906
have indicted Prosecutor Nam of
Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

1147
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:44,951
for colluding with a drug cartel,
conspiring to commit murder,

1148
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:49,414
and reducing charges for drug crimes
of children of high-ranking officials.

1149
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:50,790
Is there evidence

1150
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:53,084
for Prosecutor Nam's connection
to the drug cartel?

1151
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,837
Could you please say a word regarding
Prosecutor Nam's murder instigation?

1152
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,006
Could you please explain
how a priest and a prosecutor

1153
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,258
came to file an indictment together?

1154
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:02,468
"Indictment"

1155
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,553
"Nam Duhun and his colluders"

1156
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:06,305
This right here is a little preview
of the high-ranking officials

1157
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,641
who colluded with Prosecutor Nam.

1158
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,476
The real thing hasn't even begun.

1159
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,061
We would've brought all the papers,

1160
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,896
but we couldn't
because there's a truckload of them.

1161
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:17,692
You, trembling in fear
while watching the TV, just wait.

1162
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:21,112
The truth will come to light!

1163
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:23,614
In response,
both the ruling and opposition parties

1164
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,199
have recognized
the need to uncover the truth

1165
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:28,327
and have initiated
a joint truth commission,

1166
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,997
and some are even anticipating
the possibility of a hearing.

1167
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,290
"Request for attendance"

1168
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,041
The committee

1169
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,962
is set to summon Nam
for the first round of questioning.

1170
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,757
Meanwhile, Prosecutor Park Kyungsun

1171
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,967
has referred to the illegal files
in Nam's possession

1172
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:45,136
as the honey jar files,

1173
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:49,182
leading to the case
being called Honey Jar-gate.

1174
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,517
"Honey Jar-gate
A hearing to investigate the truth"

1175
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,831
He'll answer
Father Kim's prayers this time too, right?

1176
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,333
Of course.

1177
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,919
He always has.

1178
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,962
I don't know if it's just me,

1179
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,925
but I feel like the Lord always answers

1180
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,678
Father Lee Yeongjun
and Father Kim's prayers.

1181
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,640
Of course.

1182
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:38,564
The two of them
always pray sincerely while on the move,

1183
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:42,777
rather than while standing in one place.
