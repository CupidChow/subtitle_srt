The Fiery Priest Season 2

2
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,952
The Fiery Priest Season 2

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,247
All characters, locations,
events, organizations,

4
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,540
and religious backgrounds in this drama
are fictitious.

5
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:41,750
Child actors and animals
were safely filmed

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,959
under supervision
and in compliance with guidelines.

7
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:50,717
Episode 4
Within the Devil's Circle

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,137
Ta-da!

9
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,849
This is it.

10
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,560
This is what I'm talking about.
It's nice and neat.

11
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,562
Is it to your liking, sir?

12
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:06,274
Yeah, I could proudly showcase this
to anyone and anywhere.

13
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,650
As expected of Korea.

14
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,444
A round of applause!

15
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,282
Stop, stop!
Stop clapping! Enough!

16
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,119
Enough with the cheap stuff.

17
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,622
Let's make something luxurious.

18
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,832
Korean people are crazy
about luxury goods,

19
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,542
so they'll go crazy for luxury drugs too.

20
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,835
You're right, sir!

21
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,212
With that being said…

22
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,256
stop making cheap dupes.

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,010
Yes, sir! I won't even look
in the direction of the cheap stuff!

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,596
We'll be making luxury goods from now on.

25
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,265
Ones that will slap
the South Americans in the face.

26
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,645
Where's my office? Is it set up?

27
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:44,896
Yes, sir.

28
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,564
This way, sir.

29
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,024
Good job.

30
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,320
What the…

31
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,572
It's been a while
since we fought on the streets.

32
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,698
Tell me about it.

33
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,785
Two, four, six, eight, ten.

34
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,121
Your tickets
for the express lane to hell are ready!

35
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,330
What is he saying?

36
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,434
Damn it.

37
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,729
What the hell is going on here?

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,651
Get them!

39
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,028
Detective Gu! Detective Gu!

40
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,489
Detective Gu!

41
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,494
-You okay?
-I'll die at this rate.

42
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,954
I won't run away, so uncuff me.

43
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,038
-Damn it.
-Hurry, hurry.

44
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,707
-You're dead if you run away.
-Okay, okay.

45
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

46
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,084
Jeez, that hurts.

47
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,266
Hey!

48
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,935
Oh, gosh!

49
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,646
Yeonggwan!

50
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,106
Seriously…

51
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,444
There's a car accident
with someone injured

52
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,778
at Sanyang intersection.

53
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,208
Oh, jeez.

54
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,587
Hey!

55
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,797
Wait, isn't this
the sound of an ambulance?

56
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,050
Jeez, they're fast.

57
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,385
Thank you for helping. You should leave.

58
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,054
Get Fire Eel and come with us.

59
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,139
My colleague is badly injured.
Just go first.

60
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,642
Your investigation will end here
if you get caught right now.

61
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,853
You have to stay alive
to catch the rest of the guys.

62
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,772
Things won't be any different
even if I go with you.

63
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,565
I'll make sure
you can continue investigating.

64
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,067
I'm telling you, we can help! Let's go!

65
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,985
Wait. Yeonggwan!

66
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,237
- Get the car.
- Right, the car.

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,572
Don't die! I'll get those bastards!

68
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,082
Who are you, really?

69
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,042
I'm a priest. Come on.

70
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,460
One, two, three.

71
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,049
It hurts.

72
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,260
It hurts so much.

73
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,972
Hurry! Hurry!

74
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,851
I heard my team get raided in real time.

75
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,728
Team Leader Lee called me in secret.

76
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,107
You don't trust Prosecutor Nam
or the Uma Station detectives, right?

77
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,818
It's more than that.
They're people who can't be trusted.

78
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,154
What's wrong with you?

79
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,781
Hey, stay with me.

80
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,283
What's going on?

81
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,951
I think he's losing consciousness.

82
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,160
His stomach is huge.

83
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,162
It's filling with fluid
from the impact earlier.

84
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,831
-Let's go to the hospital first.
-Okay, okay.

85
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,794
My mom is very unwell.
Please take care of her.

86
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,714
You have to stay alive
to take care of her.

87
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,799
Stay with me. Please hurry.

88
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,051
Please don't tell her

89
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,305
that I died as a drug dealer.

90
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,223
If you promise to take care of her,

91
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,058
I'll live a righteous life in my next one.

92
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,561
Fire Eel, hang in there.
We're almost at the hospital.

93
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,062
Speed up. We have to hurry.

94
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,356
"In the same boat."

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,277
"To be in the same situation
or predicament."

96
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,364
Come in.

97
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,244
Sir.

98
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,830
There's something you should know.

99
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,001
According to the guys who were here,

100
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,753
one guy was disguised as a priest,

101
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,589
and another guy looked rather stubborn.

102
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,090
Pretty similar to the last description.

103
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,925
Them again?

104
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,802
Who the hell are they?

105
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,764
I think they might be
with the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

106
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,600
I don't care about what you think.

107
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,518
What about the female detective?

108
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,520
I think she took off with the two guys.

109
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,231
Listen carefully.

110
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,525
Put out a wanted notice

111
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,779
on both Fire Eel
and that female detective.

112
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,572
But she's a detective.

113
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:05,782
Oh, is that so?

114
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,243
Just do as I say and stop talking back!

115
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,414
Tell me.

116
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,042
Why didn't you take care of it yourselves?

117
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,877
Sorry?

118
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,881
Well, we went to the nursing home
with you,

119
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,675
and then we went to the sturgeon farm
and came here for the ship.

120
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,344
We were with you the whole time.

121
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:30,390
Well, the thing is… Let's see…

122
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,811
We had the guys at Chano-dong
take care of it on our behalf.

123
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,981
You have to be extra careful
when outsourcing,

124
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,526
especially when it comes to
getting rid of someone.

125
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,363
Please kill us.

126
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,697
I mean, please forgive us.

127
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,449
We apologize.

128
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,953
I'm well aware
that mistakes are paid with one's life.

129
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,163
At this rate, you'll all die in a month.

130
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,083
Let's do this.

131
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,544
Kill Fire Eel as soon as you find him.

132
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,964
As for the pretend priest
and stubborn-looking guy,

133
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,091
find them and bring them to me.
In what state?

134
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,928
Cut both their Achilles tendons.

135
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,264
-Yes, sir. Noted.
-Yes, sir.

136
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,641
What's an Achilles tendon?

137
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,351
Get out.

138
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,894
Yes, sir.

139
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,605
He was in a car accident
and is losing consciousness.

140
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,399
Let me check his breathing and pulse.

141
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,235
- Initiating CPR.
- Yes.

142
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,714
For goodness' sake.

143
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,928
Is something wrong?

144
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,097
My team is under arrest.

145
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,560
All the drug dealers were released
due to lack of evidence.

146
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,688
This is what they do.

147
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,317
They say it's a lack of evidence
when they're the ones getting rid of it.

148
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,360
But thankfully,

149
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,529
my colleague is alive.

150
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,073
I told you he'd be okay.

151
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,075
As for me, I'm a wanted individual now.

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,204
They must be out of their minds.

153
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,997
On what grounds?

154
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,752
The patient…

155
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,504
has passed away. I'm sorry.

156
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,924
The cause of death was
multiple organ failure due to the impact.

157
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,676
There was a lot of fluid in his stomach.

158
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,888
Can we see him?

159
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,140
Yes, please come this way.

160
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,260
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

161
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,763
Lord,

162
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,891
have mercy on this sinner.

163
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,519
Christ, hear my prayer.

164
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,104
Have mercy

165
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,940
on this sinner.

166
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,366
Is the hospital going to cooperate?

167
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,619
Yes, they're going to keep the body
in the mortuary chamber

168
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,704
and ensure security.

169
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,039
Tell me the truth.

170
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,875
You don't know
the details of the drug ring, do you?

171
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,963
No. The boss and the cartel
are known to be ghosts.

172
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,381
We don't have much on them.

173
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,634
And I'm assuming you're trying to get
to Fire Eel's higher-ups.

174
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,679
Even if it's just one of them.
But it's harder than we thought.

175
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,349
Then Fire Eel was our only bait.

176
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,560
But he's dead.

177
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,107
No one knows he's dead but us.

178
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,916
I told them to stack these up nicely.
They just stuffed them in.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,794
It seems the lizard guys
were in a rush in Thailand.

180
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,963
Organize them into bags.

181
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,090
The rats will eat it all
if we leave them like this.

182
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,175
Yes, sir.

183
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,802
- Did you check the firework room security?
- Yes, sir.

184
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,271
What in the world has been going on?

185
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,939
Last year, Prosecutor Nam came

186
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,566
with the Southern District
Prosecutors' Office.

187
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,526
And we followed their orders.

188
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,363
But there was this one time
we went off on our own

189
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,864
before Prosecutor Nam got promoted.

190
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,909
You heard of Kim Hanna, right?
She was a druggie.

191
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,662
Senior Presidential Secretary
Kim Inyong's daughter.

192
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,666
Anyway, we found out
she was in Busan.

193
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,631
It's her.

194
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,342
Team 2, stay here. Team 1, come with me.

195
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,469
Good work.

196
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,306
Let's go.

197
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,602
Kim Hanna was meeting with
Sangman's guys, who we were going after.

198
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,313
We worked for months trying
to catch the core of the cartel.

199
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,856
We're the police, freeze!

200
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,982
Don't move.

201
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,862
We caught them red-handed, but…

202
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,364
Everyone, stop.

203
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,199
The operation is canceled.

204
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,034
-Everyone, stand down.
-What?

205
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,162
I don't know how he found out,
but Prosecutor Nam interfered.

206
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,580
Stay where you are.

207
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,749
We caught them red-handed.
What's the matter?

208
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,586
We'll restrategize
and arrest them next time.

209
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,255
We have them right now! Why?

210
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,132
I said wrap it up.

211
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,745
Let's go!

212
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,997
Come on, let's go!

213
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,878
Uram.

214
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,927
Uram.

215
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,014
Request for backup!

216
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,974
Call an ambulance! Now!

217
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,434
As we were trying to figure things out,

218
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:49,810
the drug dealers attacked us,

219
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,437
and one of our colleagues died.

220
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,191
And we lost Kim Hanna
and the drug dealers.

221
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,985
He was trying to stop you

222
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,279
from catching them.

223
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,406
He took his chance

224
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,909
knowing that she was the senior
presidential secretary's daughter.

225
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,913
Since then, he made his way up and is now
the departmental chief prosecutor.

226
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,916
Isn't he ashamed
to call himself a prosecutor?

227
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,960
How is he still holding his head up high
after all that?

228
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,380
It's a trend these days to be shameless.

229
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,635
Anyway, Prosecutor Nam,
the Uma Violent Crimes Team,

230
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,346
and the drug dealers
are all in cahoots for sure.

231
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,265
They're all rotten.

232
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,391
Father Kim,

233
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,352
how are you going to help me?

234
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,272
I'll get you off the wanted list
by tomorrow.

235
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,234
And how exactly are you going to do that?

236
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,152
Will you pray to God and have him do it?

237
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,946
Father Kim has a lot of connections.

238
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,823
He even has one in Rome.

239
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,990
Shut it.

240
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,704
Come on, just be open and honest with me.

241
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,414
We'll tell you everything in detail

242
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,916
when we get to know each other better.

243
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,459
Oh, come on.

244
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,336
We know each other well. We're close.

245
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,256
How much closer can we get?

246
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,174
Well, I don't mean the distance between…

247
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,968
We're close, aren't we?

248
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,053
We're family.

249
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,346
Where in the world were you?

250
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,515
You told me to keep an eye on them!

251
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,392
So I did just that!

252
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,310
I almost crapped my pants.

253
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,271
I set up a new hideout for us.

254
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,816
I have to go somewhere.

255
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,569
You take care of Detective Gu.

256
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,405
Father Kim. Wait, Father Kim. Father Kim!

257
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,532
-Tell me before you go!
-Be careful.

258
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:27,658
-Wait.
-They had guns.

259
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,994
- Okay.
- Father Kim. Father Kim!

260
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,706
Wow!

261
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,004
Who are you?

262
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,714
What?

263
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,507
Who are you?

264
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,719
Wait, you look really familiar.

265
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,013
I asked you first.

266
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,723
-One second.
-Who are you?

267
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,224
Oh, I know.

268
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,685
-I know.
-Who is he?

269
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,146
-I'm a financier.
-Father…

270
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,523
Are you sure you're not a swindler?

271
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,776
- What are you talking about right now?
- What a weirdo.

272
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,361
Hold on.

273
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,547
There were two drug rings in Uma-gu.

274
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,215
Lower your voice.

275
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,554
Continuing on,

276
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,849
the bosses disappeared
and the rings collapsed.

277
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,018
It sounds like it's growing.

278
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,937
A new ring was probably made.

279
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,522
One that was powerful enough
to dissolve all the other ones,

280
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,734
and they're the ones
that got rid of the existing bosses.

281
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,486
"Uma-gu becomes drug-free"

282
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,281
All the articles claiming
that this place was drug-free were false.

283
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,368
Ki Deokgi,
the journalist who wrote that article,

284
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,411
is a well-known presstitute.

285
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,288
He looks weird too.

286
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,416
I can sense that something is up,
but I can't pinpoint what exactly.

287
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,294
It's people like them
who are truly dangerous.

288
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,339
You know,
those who score big under the radar.

289
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,633
Scoring big under the radar, huh?

290
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,093
You used to do it too, didn't you?

291
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,553
Come on, why bring up the past?

292
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,056
-Was that necessary?
-I was just messing with you.

293
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,226
Anyway, from what I think,

294
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,228
those in cahoots with the drug dealers

295
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,939
are Prosecutor Nam Duhun
and Violent Crimes Team 1.

296
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,941
We need to catch them first.

297
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,067
What about the chief?

298
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,986
There is a record of her,

299
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,570
but I couldn't find much on her.

300
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,364
She seems to be a puppet chief.

301
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,659
You'll have to take Prosecutor Nam.

302
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,995
I already told JB everything.

303
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,664
Starting tomorrow,
I'll be working in the same office as him.

304
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,290
What kind of person is Prosecutor Nam?

305
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,501
You often see guys like him
in my line of work.

306
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:46,130
Ambitious, nasty, and absolutely rotten.

307
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,048
It's your expertise

308
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,842
to handle said nasty and rotten guys.

309
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,219
That's true.

310
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,471
On top of it all, he's younger than me.

311
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,099
He got his hands dirty at a young age.

312
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,977
I swear being in the prosecution
messes people up.

313
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,439
Make sure you only communicate with me
and teach them a lesson.

314
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,024
It won't just be a lesson.

315
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,527
I'll give them a taste
of every corner of hell.

316
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,696
I told you to lower your voice.

317
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,032
There's no one here but us!

318
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,786
They say the walls have ears.

319
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,663
-Goodness.
-We have to be careful at all times.

320
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,916
Oh, right.

321
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,377
Get someone off the wanted list
when you get to work tomorrow.

322
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,503
Who?

323
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,758
What?

324
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,929
The floor is all-natural marble.

325
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,765
And this is our office.

326
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,898
Oh my, Dokseong.

327
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,320
This is nothing.

328
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,782
There's CCTV inside and outside the house

329
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,284
and the security system alarms
are in place as well.

330
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,871
Also, you can't really see
because it's dark right now,

331
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:06,418
but if you open the curtains at sunrise,

332
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,589
you'll see the sea laid out right outside.

333
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,009
A very nice sea view.

334
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,135
Shit view?

335
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,262
Oh, sea view. Got it.

336
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,975
There are a bunch of rooms
downstairs and upstairs,

337
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,353
so you can use any room you like.

338
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,438
All rooms are the same.

339
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,817
I call this room with the big bed.

340
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,401
I was going to use that room.

341
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,778
I have really bad sleeping habits.

342
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,780
-You're staying with us?
-I already called dibs.

343
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,075
Of course I am.

344
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,786
I'm basically the Busan info hotline.

345
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,995
I'd like a cup of herbal tea.

346
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,080
Sure thing.

347
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,499
I'm not sure if we have it.

348
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,670
How are we going to catch the higher-ups?

349
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,088
Lure them? A drug transaction?

350
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,590
How about we send them
a fake text from Fire Eel

351
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,134
asking for help?

352
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,052
They won't fall for it.

353
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,388
They're suspicious about everything.

354
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,684
Then we'll have to find a way
to secretly and naturally lure them out.

355
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,854
Ah! If we're going to fake
that Fire Eel is alive,

356
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,689
we'll need a stand-in.

357
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,107
A stand-in?

358
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,069
I know someone.

359
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,620
Something's weird.

360
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,790
What's with this unsettling feeling?

361
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,087
Man, is this a house or a palace?

362
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,756
A public official's salary
could never cover this.

363
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,677
Just say the word
and I'll have one ready for you.

364
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,138
I don't like big apartments.

365
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:44,099
The kitchen and bathroom
should be within easy reach.

366
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,852
I'm just saying,
if you need one, let me know.

367
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,145
By the way, Kim.

368
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,565
It's a pain in the ass for me
if you take care of things like that.

369
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,485
You mean Fire Eel? I apologize for that.

370
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,654
The guys are quite soft.

371
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,531
I get it, it can happen.

372
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:03,035
But next time,
just go for it and do it right.

373
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,995
That way, I won't regret my decision.

374
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,414
Don't worry, I'll show you soon.

375
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,707
Just brace yourself.

376
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,834
Why did you want to see me?

377
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,377
There was something…

378
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,630
…I had to ask you.

379
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,006
The customs.

380
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,674
It's not easy to get through that.

381
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,218
The customs, huh?

382
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,346
It won't be easy.

383
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,015
They're not easily convinced.

384
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,352
But you can penetrate right through them.

385
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,021
Look, Kim.

386
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,358
I'm not some drill

387
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,859
without a working brain.

388
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,906
Hold on a second.

389
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,575
There might be
a couple of guys we could use.

390
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,869
That's right.

391
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,704
There are guys who profited from the dirt

392
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,457
and are even serving people back in Seoul.

393
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,501
Will two or so be enough?

394
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,795
How will I ever repay this?

395
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,505
What do you mean how?

396
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,590
With all your heart, of course.

397
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,934
Please don't tell my mom

398
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,479
that I died as a drug dealer.

399
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,773
If you promise to take care of her,

400
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,650
I'll live a righteous life in my next one.

401
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,953
The Feast of Saint Peter

402
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:29,913
Father Michael Kim Haeil

403
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,377
-Father Kim.
-What are you up to?

404
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,879
-Dozing off, I bet.
-I'm not.

405
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,298
I'm studying.

406
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,427
Let's prepare breakfast for Ms. Song
before she goes to work tomorrow.

407
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,387
Okay, sounds good.

408
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,972
And come out right now.

409
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,266
Let's go volunteer elsewhere.

410
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,435
Right now?

411
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,770
You heard me.

412
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,988
Oh, I guess she's going to work already.

413
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,494
I don't think she even had breakfast.

414
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,972
They must have good employee benefits.

415
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,737
- All right, speed it up.
- Hurry up.

416
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,656
- Watch your step.
- Come on, this way.

417
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,243
- Hurry up, this way.
- Come on. Keep it coming.

418
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,624
-Hurry and go in!
-Come on, old man!

419
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,919
- All right, watch your step.
- Watch out for the bump.

420
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,589
- Grannies, let's speed it up.
- Come on, hurry up.

421
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,924
We have lots to do today.

422
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,510
- Let's move it.
- Come on, move your feet.

423
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,803
Right here.

424
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,971
- Wear a vest.
- Come on.

425
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,765
Put it on.

426
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,351
Put it on.

427
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,103
Come on in.

428
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,229
Hurry.

429
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:22,567
- Stop looking around and come in.
- Old man, stand in line.

430
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:23,944
Damn.

431
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,531
Why are they taking so long to come in?
Speed it up!

432
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,242
You punks! Do your jobs!

433
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,954
I'm just frustrated.

434
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,749
- Hurry up!
- Get in pairs. Hurry.

435
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,293
- Speed it up.
- Stop looking around!

436
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,545
Come on.

437
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,838
All right, stop.

438
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,214
Until there.

439
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:45,715
Welcome, seniors.

440
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,968
I'm sure you've been informed.

441
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,846
You just have to do
as the gentlemen here say.

442
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,348
And as long as you keep this confidential,

443
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,769
we'll pay you generously enough
that you won't need support

444
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,729
from your children.

445
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,942
I'll be good to you.

446
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,278
Just trust me, okay?

447
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,738
Okay.

448
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,824
This factory and Uma-gu

449
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,784
will become a place for seniors.

450
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,536
I look forward to working with you.

451
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,746
A round of applause!

452
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,420
- Enough!
- Stop.

453
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,465
Stop! Stop clapping!

454
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,803
Did you not train them?

455
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,891
What's this?

456
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,977
It was on my desk this morning.
It's from headquarters.

457
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,938
I never asked for more personnel.

458
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,775
Why the hell did they send me this?

459
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,988
Look at that.

460
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:54,618
What did she do
to end up all the way here?

461
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,747
Is she coming as a punishment or to relax?

462
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,916
Name: Park Kyungsun

463
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,964
Are we going the right way?

464
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,134
What is this place?

465
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:22,395
Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office

466
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,981
You're kidding me.

467
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,733
"Busan Southern District
Prosecutors' Office"

468
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,944
Looks like some rebel camp.

469
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,071
It looks like just the place
to plot treason.

470
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,120
I'll be straightforward.

471
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,372
What trouble did you cause?

472
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,792
It was more of a misunderstanding.

473
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,210
Misunderstanding?

474
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:48,088
Double standards, is it?

475
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,714
When I mess up, it's a misunderstanding.

476
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,341
When others mess up, it's trouble.

477
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,928
I got involved in a financial issue
with the defendant during the trial.

478
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,181
I see, you took a bribe.

479
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:02,435
You should've done so discreetly.
How obvious were you about it?

480
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,520
I'm sorry!

481
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,438
Why'd you come here of all places?

482
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,983
You thought you'd have a shot here?

483
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,901
To be honest, yes.

484
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,697
They can't just keep sending people here
whenever they cause trouble.

485
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,616
Go elsewhere next time you cause trouble.

486
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,034
Yes, sir!

487
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,580
Stay low until you go back.

488
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,291
Don't get cheeky, got it?

489
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,919
I'll stay as low as I can.

490
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,504
Use whichever room is available.

491
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,881
-You can go now.
-Thank you, sir!

492
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:40,974
Why is she so energetic?

493
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,393
Is she insane?

494
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:49,399
It can't get any shabbier than this.

495
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,402
This is unbelievable.

496
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,577
Hello.

497
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,788
I'm Kim Mari, the assistant.

498
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,207
Oh, you showed me the way earlier.

499
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,792
I'm Prosecutor Park Kyungsun.

500
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,545
You can let me know if you need anything.

501
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,797
Don't you work for Prosecutor Nam?

502
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,759
It's a small place here,
so I handle everything.

503
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,385
Oh, I see.

504
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,970
I look forward to working with you.

505
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,431
Also, company housing
has been provided for you.

506
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,932
I'll take you there after work.

507
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,225
Okay.

508
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,563
By the way, can I get a list
of the wanted individuals here?

509
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,565
What for?

510
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,943
They're criminals in our jurisdiction,
so I should know about them.

511
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,196
Right, I'll get it ready right away.

512
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,447
Thank you.

513
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,207
A factory view!

514
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,087
No way.

515
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,548
My grandma used a sitting mat like this.

516
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,760
You're kidding me.

517
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,887
So it does get shabbier.

518
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,185
Goodness, welcome to Busan, I guess.

519
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,270
What's the update?

520
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,480
I'm getting Detective Gu Jayoung

521
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,606
off the list right now.

522
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,318
Why do I have to do this for you?
You should've taken care of it.

523
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,403
Wanted persons system

524
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,696
Name: Gu Jayoung

525
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,863
Wanted person information

526
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,824
Remove wanted status

527
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,951
"Remove from wanted list?
Yes"

528
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,035
Done.

529
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,662
But won't you get caught right away?

530
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,205
I will.

531
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,748
Prosecutor Nam will know right away too.

532
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:29,833
What?

533
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,543
Then…

534
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,796
Then what's the point of all this?

535
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,089
Come on, it's me.

536
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,091
Phoenix Sun!

537
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,175
Ah…

538
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,345
I wouldn't just idly sit back, would I?

539
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,472
I've already taken care of it in advance.

540
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,224
You took care of it?

541
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,767
Yes, that's right.

542
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,185
But you only ever cause trouble.

543
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,937
So what do you mean?

544
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,982
She did what? Gambling?

545
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,276
I got a call from internal investigations
from Busan Police Agency.

546
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,739
She's done everything from bitcoins
to sports betting to baccarat.

547
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,240
She also has a debt of 300 million won.

548
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,367
Man, I thought she was upright,

549
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,785
but she's a total nutjob.

550
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,538
They're under investigation and will hide
if a wanted notice is placed on them,

551
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:11,249
and they won't be able to find
the accomplices.

552
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,500
Wait a second.

553
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,085
Then those guys…

554
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,047
That sly brat got them involved
because she wanted to get her share.

555
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,175
That sly brat.

556
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,011
What should we do about the notice?

557
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,596
Just leave it.

558
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,306
Let them do whatever they want.

559
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,308
Right, okay.

560
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,644
This is interesting.

561
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,813
Father Kim!

562
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,900
My goodness. All right.

563
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,777
- Okay, okay.
- You can't do that.

564
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,279
You can't just hug a priest like that.

565
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,449
You boomer. You're so old-fashioned.

566
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,827
Thank you so much
for getting me off the list.

567
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,829
How'd you do it anyway?

568
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,706
With God's help.

569
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,416
Enough with that.

570
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,168
I'm getting sick of it!

571
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,420
Oh.

572
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,130
I mean, thank you.

573
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,466
I just don't want to be indebted to you.

574
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:04,469
There's no need to be at all.

575
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,222
You must be from a noble family,
considering you don't like being indebted.

576
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,557
I heard from Detective Gu

577
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,852
that your identity must be kept a secret.

578
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,398
It seems we're not that different,

579
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,317
so why don't we just be honest
with each other?

580
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,112
I don't know what nonsense he told you,

581
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,740
but I really am a priest.

582
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,450
If you don't tell me the truth soon,

583
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,911
I'll make sure
that you'll regret not telling me.

584
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,456
Why don't we focus
on the investigation first?

585
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,001
By the way,
you didn't answer me last time.

586
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,504
Which Gu clan do you belong to?

587
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,506
I was wondering when you'd ask her again.

588
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,216
You want a family gathering or something?

589
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,676
The Wonchang Gu clan.

590
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,802
The Wonchang Gu clan?

591
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,262
-Which branch?
-Gukdang.

592
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,389
I knew it.

593
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,308
I'm a 21st descendant
of the Gukdang branch

594
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,102
of the Wonchang Gu clan.

595
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,770
You little.

596
00:30:56,354 --> 00:31:00,775
I knew from the shape of her head
that we were related.

597
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,193
Nice to meet you, niece!

598
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,654
What are you talking about?

599
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,406
See that grumpiness?

600
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,866
It runs in our family.

601
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,450
Enough already.

602
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,994
Let's plan how to catch that ship.

603
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,620
- Oh, we have an idea.
- What is it?

604
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,746
One second.

605
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,874
Tell me. What's your father's name?

606
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,250
Enough already!

607
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,359
- Nothing yet, right?
- No, sir.

608
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,528
We looked everywhere,
but he was nowhere to be found.

609
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,488
I even checked the hospitals.

610
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,490
You know what?

611
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,202
Seeing how quiet things are,
I don't think Fire Eel exposed anything.

612
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,287
Right.

613
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,129
Come on.

614
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,256
What are you doing, granny?

615
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,841
I'm sorry.

616
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,011
I'm asthmatic…

617
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,431
…and the smells are very strong.

618
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,141
I'm sorry.

619
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:17,894
You should've just stayed home
if you're dying!

620
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,354
I'm okay.

621
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,523
I'll keep my mouth shut and do my best.

622
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,817
Hey, hey, hey!

623
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,486
Be quiet!

624
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,154
What's with all the talking?

625
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,364
I'm sorry, sir.

626
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,448
Hey, come.

627
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,165
Fire Eel's mom.

628
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,294
Where is she right now?

629
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,588
At a nursing home.

630
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,967
-Nursing home?
-She's become paraplegic from an accident.

631
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,635
I also heard she's not in her right mind.

632
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,058
This is why you need to use your head.

633
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,477
That way you don't delegate.
I mean, demonstrate.

634
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,895
Just get lost.

635
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,855
I can't speak straight with you around!
Get lost.

636
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,858
- Why?
- I meant "deteriorate," damn it! Get lost!

637
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,402
Go!

638
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,820
Jeez, you're so harsh.

639
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:13,908
That way you don't deteriorate.

640
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,494
Hanbada Nursing Home

641
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,788
- Get her.
- You can't do this!

642
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,123
Sure, I can.

643
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:22,834
-You can't just take a patient!
-Move aside.

644
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,837
He's our friend's mother,
so we're going to take care of her.

645
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,464
- You can tell the resemblance.
- You still can't take her.

646
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,258
There's a process to all this.

647
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,885
Damn it, nurse lady.

648
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,429
If you keep doing this,

649
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,266
I'm going to set fire to this place!

650
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,226
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

651
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,562
I'm not one to hit women,
but you almost made me today.

652
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:53,740
We need more cotton stuffing.
It looks much smaller than I thought.

653
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,283
We're out.

654
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,868
Should I get it from the blanket?

655
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,369
Are you serious?

656
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,621
Disguising as Fire Eel to lure them.
Not bad, right?

657
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,748
Yeah.

658
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,001
This is pointless.
How will this lure the drug dealers out?

659
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:09,047
As I said,
it's either making a deal or luring them.

660
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,050
I don't know what we can lure them with.

661
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,510
Then let's make a deal.

662
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,387
You'll be the gambler detective
who needs money!

663
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,805
What?

664
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,265
Ah…

665
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,518
That's right. You can ask for money
in exchange for Fire Eel.

666
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,146
Okay, but how are we going to call them?

667
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,190
It's not like we can publicize this.

668
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,068
Oh, Sangman! We can use him.

669
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,570
He might already be dead.
He ran away, remember?

670
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,531
Humans don't die that easily.

671
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,242
And even if he's dead,

672
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,411
someone might have his phone.

673
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,499
I'll try calling until someone picks up.

674
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,667
My niece.

675
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,127
Niece… Wait, no.

676
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,505
Should we stuff him more?

677
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,006
What are you doing?

678
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,426
It's okay, just stay still.
We washed this. It doesn't smell.

679
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,594
Come on, what are you doing?

680
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,054
It's hot.

681
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,780
Can you make me the president?

682
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:21,327
If that's what you want.

683
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,205
That punk.

684
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,916
He bluffs like he means it.

685
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,170
Sir!

686
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,381
You startled me!

687
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,634
Oh, I didn't know you were praying.
I'm sorry.

688
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,137
What is it?

689
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,347
It's my first day at work.

690
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,765
Do I not get a welcome party?

691
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,976
Welcome party, my foot.

692
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,936
Just go home.

693
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,563
Yes, sir!

694
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,733
That bastard.

695
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,318
That son of a gun.

696
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:55,987
That asshole.

697
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,071
Fine, I'm leaving.

698
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,831
That's the place.

699
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,461
Wait, that's company housing?

700
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,422
Yes, it's on the fourth floor.

701
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,800
But there's a karaoke and a pub.

702
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,429
-I see.
-It's a mixed-use building.

703
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,974
-There's an elevator, right?
-No.

704
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,227
It's not that high up.
Just consider it a workout.

705
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,650
Jeez.

706
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,416
You said it's not that high up,

707
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,709
but you sure are panting heavily.

708
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:57,882
Tell me.

709
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,259
Is this really company housing?

710
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,804
It used to be
a shared residence for chefs.

711
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,431
Chefs?

712
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,849
Yes.

713
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,393
I think they were chefs
at rib restaurants.

714
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,441
What's that on the wall?

715
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,401
Is it blood?

716
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,695
No, it's not.

717
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,740
I think the sauce
must've gotten on the wall

718
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,450
while the chefs were practicing.

719
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,069
Hey! Shut up!

720
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,999
Kim Haeil!

721
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,305
Jeez, I thought I heard Geezer Park.

722
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,619
You're here. Good work.

723
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,082
Everything's here.

724
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,170
Right. Ambulances are the best.

725
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,380
They're safe and fast.

726
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,882
Open up.

727
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,887
Look at how bland this is.

728
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,889
Bland? Have you tried it?

729
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,433
Can't you guess through context?

730
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,976
I obviously meant to say grand.

731
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,406
They're fresh.

732
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,784
They're great.

733
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:33,412
Hearing you say that
makes it feel like we've been healed.

734
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,254
-It's refreshing.
-Sorry?

735
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,714
- It's refreshing.
- Chunseop.

736
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,799
Yes, sir.

737
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,051
What day is it today?

738
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,387
It's Saturday.

739
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,846
I have to go to church tomorrow.

740
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,890
Are you a crystal?

741
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,309
-What?
-Cryst…

742
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,771
-You know, like Buddhism…
-You mean Christian?

743
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,898
Ah, right.

744
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:07,863
-I knew it.
-You punk.

745
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,534
Ms. Song!

746
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,785
Are you home?

747
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,212
We don't have all day.

748
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,714
- Jeez, old woman.
- Why are you so damn slow?

749
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,967
- I'm sorry, I have--
- Hurry up and get off.

750
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,844
-I have bad knees.
-Just hurry up.

751
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,470
- Oh my.
- Damn you.

752
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,682
-What are you doing?
-What the hell?

753
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,434
Who the hell are you?

754
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,729
- Oh, gosh. That's enough.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

755
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,982
-They're from my workplace.
-Let's just go.

756
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,358
- Let's get going.
- All right.

757
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,402
- Come out on time tomorrow.
- Okay.

758
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,028
- We're leaving if you're late.
- Okay.

759
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,488
Goodness gracious.

760
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,781
Goodbye.

761
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,033
They're so rough.

762
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,118
They're not.

763
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,870
They pick me up in the morning

764
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,913
and take me back home after work.

765
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,209
It was your first day of work,
so I wanted to ask how it went.

766
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,004
It went great. Goodness me.

767
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,131
You haven't eaten yet, right?
I'll make you dinner.

768
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,341
Goodness,
I should be the one cooking for you.

769
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,304
What do you like?

770
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,190
The rice looks good.

771
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,737
It's delicious.

772
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,448
Is it to your liking?

773
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,995
Where did your teeth go?

774
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,748
I thought you could use a laugh
after a long day.

775
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,375
How was work?

776
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,629
I'm still in the training period,
so I'm just getting used to it.

777
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,756
You said it was a snack factory, right?

778
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,050
What snacks do they make?

779
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,552
Twisted donut snacks.

780
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,638
Oh, that's a popular snack.

781
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,890
What's the name of the company?

782
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,437
Goodness, I forgot.

783
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,982
I forget things
the second I hear about it.

784
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,360
It's okay. It's not important.

785
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,945
I see.

786
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,030
Where is it? Is it far from here?

787
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:17,159
I'm not sure because I take the van.

788
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:24,500
A factory that doesn't sound legit?

789
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,544
We should expose them.

790
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,713
Okay, but how will we do that?

791
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,385
-We'll just go for it and--
-Go for it and beat them up?

792
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,512
Is that it?

793
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,472
And then get beat up yourself?

794
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,559
They should get a beating
if they mistreat the elderly.

795
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,895
Do you hear yourself?

796
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:48,065
You've been feeding
your temper, not your brain.

797
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,817
Listen carefully.

798
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,987
Anger should always come last.

799
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,741
We have to control ourselves
and be reasonable and only turn to anger

800
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,119
when nothing else works.

801
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,039
And God will forgive…

802
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,211
whatever happens due to that anger.

803
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,596
-Niece, come on.
-Welcome.

804
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,722
Hello.

805
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,017
This is Detective Gu Jayoung.

806
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,935
Hello.

807
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,981
You've been through so much.

808
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,774
I'm okay.

809
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,900
Nice to meet you.

810
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,403
Ah.

811
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,281
We don't have secrets with each other,
so it's okay.

812
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,575
Ah, then are you two

813
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,952
also like Father Kim?

814
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,621
Ah…

815
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,205
Sure, I guess you could say that.

816
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,833
There sure are
a lot of mysterious people in this world.

817
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,169
Goodness, please.

818
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:53,422
It's nothing.

819
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,507
-Ta-da.
-Oh my.

820
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,718
You've still got it.

821
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,220
I have to do something
about that hand of yours.

822
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,057
Why don't we play a round
with your hand on the line?

823
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,308
No, thank you.

824
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,269
Do it. Please do it.

825
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:11,023
I heard you were related to Detective Gu.

826
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,484
Well, we don't know for sure yet.

827
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,320
My uncle is going to get back to me
after he looks into the family tree.

828
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,822
I guess we'll find out soon, niece.

829
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,076
He loves his niece.

830
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:27,623
Anyway, there aren't as many churchgoers
as I thought.

831
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,293
I know.
The few that are here are all elderly.

832
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,213
I see young people over there.

833
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,297
-Sorry?
-Where?

834
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,537
Welcome.

835
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,331
Thank you for coming.

836
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,543
Is it your first time at our church?

837
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,878
Yes, it is.
I just moved here for my business.

838
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:15,963
I'll come every week.

839
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,048
-Oh, thank you.
-Thank you.

840
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,010
The church is nice and classic.

841
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:23,887
And you remind me of my father.

842
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,180
Oh, do I?

843
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,231
How great is it to be punctual?

844
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,118
There they go.

845
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,414
-I'll return it to you in one piece.
-Okay.

846
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,126
Thank you.

847
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,503
Thank you so much.

848
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,214
I'll bring it back soon.
I really appreciate it!

849
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,565
Who are you?

850
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,651
Ah…

851
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,946
I got lost on my way back
from the delivery.

852
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,824
How can a deliveryman
not know his way around?

853
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:29,244
Where's the Gyodam three-way intersection?

854
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:32,206
Go that way.

855
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,500
Get going.

856
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,712
You won't live to see another day
if I see you around here again.

857
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,881
Thank you.

858
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,637
Goodbye. Have a nice day.

859
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,514
Bye.

860
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,226
Let's pray.

861
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,483
Dear Lord,

862
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,401
may you,
who bring the fullness of salvation

863
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,238
through this Holy Communion,

864
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:09,785
grant us healing and strength
by your mercy

865
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:14,122
so that we can bring you joy
in all things.

866
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:17,334
In Jesus' name we pray.

867
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,920
Amen.

868
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,095
Yes.

869
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,429
You should stay here longer.

870
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,682
- Yes, the air is very fresh here.
- That's right.

871
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,725
- I'm getting a good rest. Thank you.
- That's great.

872
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:35,352
- It's not much.
- What is this?

873
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,702
Father Hong, is something wrong?

874
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:54,663
That man just gave me a donation.

875
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,128
Check
2 billion won

876
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,337
Excuse me.

877
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,384
Hello, Father.

878
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,013
I stopped you to ask

879
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,057
if you gave the right amount
for the donation.

880
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,143
-I did. What's the matter?
-Well,

881
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,145
it's quite a large amount
for a personal donation.

882
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,771
Please just take it.

883
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,274
It's not an amount we can just take.

884
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,775
Let me introduce myself.

885
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:27,446
I'm James Kim Hongsik,
and I do business here in Uma-gu.

886
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,531
I'm Father Kim Haeil.

887
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,909
I did some business overseas,

888
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,869
and I earned quite a lot of money.

889
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,204
So I just wanted
to show my gratitude to God.

890
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,290
Why don't you split the money
and also donate elsewhere?

891
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,627
I've already donated
to all the places I could think of.

892
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:42,753
Right.

893
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,339
I could look into some other places.

894
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,674
I noticed
that there weren't many churchgoers.

895
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,426
I'm sure you don't receive much offerings.

896
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,179
The church has to be strong
for you to fight evil.

897
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,100
The financial affairs of the church
have nothing to do with fighting evil.

898
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,895
I see. I thought it did.

899
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,730
Have you always been here?

900
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,024
No, I'm just here temporarily.

901
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:05,984
If you're just a temporary priest,

902
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,278
then just let the old priest
use the money.

903
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,696
You're young, you should know better.

904
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:14,451
I may look young,
but I'm not as young as I appear.

905
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:17,162
-Take it back for now.
-It's okay. I'll see you next week.

906
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,331
-You should just split the money.
-Is he a swindler?

907
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,916
- This is too much.
- It's Gozaev.

908
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,042
Hey.

909
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,088
By the way,

910
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,342
can you go to heaven
if you give a lot of offerings?

911
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,469
Money won't get you to heaven.

912
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,720
However,

913
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,347
it could get you to hell.

914
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,141
I see.

915
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,152
Father Kim!

916
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,904
Father Kim.

917
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,742
What are you, a deliveryman?

918
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,202
No.

919
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,246
I followed the van Ms. Song was in,

920
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,123
and it was an abandoned wharf,
not a factory.

921
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,083
There were no signs whatsoever.

922
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,419
Here.

923
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,753
Look at the street view.

924
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,717
I was going to take pictures,

925
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,052
but there were these huge men
guarding the entrance.

926
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,181
-How many?
-Seven to eight of them.

927
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,017
What are you going to do now?

928
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,561
I'll ask the local district office
and city hall what the place is,

929
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,731
and if it turns out to be an illegal
or unauthorized business, I'll report it.

930
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,233
All right, 10%.

931
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:29,317
Sorry?

932
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,154
10% of the nutrients you consumed
seemed to have gone to your head.

933
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,363
Come on.

934
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,657
I should've had more protein
for breakfast.

935
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,701
Be careful when you're out and about.

936
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,952
- Okay.
- Don't be reckless.

937
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,788
-Go back to the seminary.
-Will do.

938
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,252
Where's Father Kim?

939
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:48,545
It's melting.

940
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:50,547
He's back there, but he's taking a while.

941
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,840
Goodness gracious.

942
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,425
-He's always late.
-Hey, where's the car?

943
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,718
My goodness.

944
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:56,178
And why weren't you at the Mass?

945
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,096
Have this. I'll go next week.

946
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,431
As if.

947
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,308
-Jeez.
-Any updates on Sangman?

948
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,144
I sent around 500 texts,
but he hasn't replied.

949
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,313
Did he get rid of his phone?

950
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:08,523
Let's wait until the end of the day.

951
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,859
Oh, it's my uncle.

952
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,113
We're finally going to find out
how exactly we're related.

953
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,450
Hello, Uncle.

954
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,205
Yes, yes. Gu Jayoung.

955
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:26,750
She's our relative, right?

956
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,796
Oh, I see.

957
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,965
She's from the side of my great-uncle
in Goseok-dong.

958
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,259
Really?

959
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,599
Goodness, isn't this
why family is so great?

960
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,727
Of course. Yes.

961
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,355
Yes, okay. Goodbye, Uncle.

962
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,523
Bye.

963
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,153
What did he say?

964
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,035
Well, he answered my question.

965
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,704
Auntie.

966
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:08,375
What?

967
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,795
He said Detective Gu Jayoung is my aunt

968
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,171
in terms of generational ranks.

969
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,888
So that's what it is, Detective Gu.

970
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,977
You cheeky little rascal. Hey!

971
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,022
How dare you speak informally
to your aunt?

972
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,151
Don't you think
the change in attitude is a bit sudden?

973
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,318
Hey!

974
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,112
Where are your manners?

975
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,364
Why do you keep yelling at me?

976
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,199
- What did I do wrong?
- Hey!

977
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,369
I'm sorry.

978
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:45,495
Hey!

979
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,914
Let's go.

980
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,250
A naughty nephew
should be taught a lesson.

981
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,252
- Goodness. Hey!
- Hey!

982
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,920
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey, you're in big trouble.

983
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,047
Hey!

984
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,591
Auntie.

985
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,092
Hey.

986
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,595
Mr. Lee Eungsu, the old-timer at customs.

987
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,973
I don't care about
who has your back in Seoul.

988
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,517
You just have to do as I say.

989
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,394
Wait.

990
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,062
Are you crying?

991
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,568
If you don't do as I say,

992
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:19,487
I'm going to deliver you and Kim

993
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,948
to prison as a package deal.

994
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,158
Got it?

995
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,619
Why the hell is he weeping?

996
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,539
Is this good enough for you, Chairman Kim?

997
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,958
What is he saying?

998
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,648
What are you looking for?

999
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,733
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

1000
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,110
No, that's okay.

1001
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,697
Where's Chairman Kim Mancheon's son,
Kim Inseok's case file?

1002
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,242
Oh, that's not here.

1003
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,160
It's with Prosecutor Nam.

1004
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,080
-It's not kept in the file room?
-No.

1005
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:13,375
He said not to keep
high-profile cases here.

1006
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,628
Oh, I see.

1007
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,589
Okay, thank you.

1008
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,676
There are a lot of files here.

1009
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,802
Thank you for your hard work.

1010
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,388
Who knew there'd be this much?

1011
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,141
Is that true?

1012
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,352
Yeah. A gambler.

1013
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,813
That Detective Heidi

1014
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,315
is playing games to pay off her debt.

1015
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,442
She's going to make a deal
with Fire Eel soon.

1016
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,152
Is that good or bad?

1017
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,071
It's a good thing.

1018
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:45,073
We could make sure
Fire Eel doesn't spill anything.

1019
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,157
Isn't that right?

1020
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,577
Then what about the money?

1021
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,246
Are you going to pay?

1022
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,376
Don't get scared.
He's not worth that much anyway.

1023
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,670
You take care of Fire Eel.

1024
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,213
Bring me the priest,

1025
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,924
the rough-looking guy, and the girl.

1026
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,969
Yes, sir. I'll cut them up right here.

1027
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,679
- I'll make sure to…
- Sir, we've got bad news.

1028
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,931
-You have to hear this.
-What is it?

1029
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,101
I kept Sangman's phone,
and he got a bunch of texts.

1030
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,853
Who was it? Right, Heidi.

1031
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,896
- Isn't that the detective?
- Yes, it is.

1032
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,149
That darn three, four, five, sick brat!

1033
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,650
Three, four, five, sick brat!

1034
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,402
- Three, four--
- Enough.

1035
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,070
-I'm sorry.
-What did she say?

1036
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,405
Yes, sir.

1037
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,282
"Heidi"

1038
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,825
He's smiling.

1039
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,410
He's such a softie.

1040
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,747
I'm sorry.

1041
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,206
She said,

1042
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,374
"The price of Fire Eel

1043
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,836
is ten billion won in cash."

1044
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,381
Ten billion won.

1045
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,216
"If you're in,

1046
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,471
come to Jirimland at 6 p.m.
for the exchange."

1047
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,766
"If you play any games,
Fire Eel will be sent

1048
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,559
to the National Intelligence Service."

1049
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,444
What a fun turn of events.

1050
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:06,321
It never gets boring, does it?

1051
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,448
Oh, I got a reply.

1052
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,116
"Don't you dare hurt our Eel
or I'll make you pay."

1053
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,911
-Make sure you wear it properly.
-What?

1054
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,538
Wear it properly, Auntie.

1055
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:19,751
Don't I get a stab proof vest?

1056
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,295
I'm sorry, we only have two.

1057
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,172
What a shame.

1058
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:27,008
I'm the only one
who's going to get stabbed.

1059
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,594
You want us to wrap you in faux leather?

1060
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,972
What am I, a sofa?
Why would you wrap me in that?

1061
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,891
It doesn't look like you need it.

1062
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,522
Oh, Father Kim is going to join us
after stopping by somewhere.

1063
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,691
That's what he said, Auntie.

1064
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:47,487
All right, let's get going, nephew.

1065
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,406
Let's do this.

1066
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,617
I'm never going to look into
the family tree again.

1067
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,827
I'll just live like a commoner.

1068
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,122
Let's go, you bastard nephew.

1069
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:06,256
You don't think any of these foreigners
understand Korean, do you?

1070
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,841
I don't think so.

1071
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,302
Anyway, this feels more like an outing
than a secret rendezvous.

1072
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,804
We're killing two birds with one stone.

1073
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:14,848
How are things with Prosecutor Nam?

1074
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,600
He doesn't let his walls down easily.

1075
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,311
Those who have a lot to hide
are like that.

1076
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,730
He stores the case files himself.

1077
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,566
You need to earn his trust first.

1078
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,818
I thought he'd greet me with open arms

1079
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,070
if he found out
I was a corrupt prosecutor like him.

1080
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,655
I don't think
he's the type to take bribes.

1081
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,532
I don't think so either.

1082
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:36,327
There's this mad, ambitious look
in his eyes.

1083
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,582
So the same look in your eyes.

1084
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:42,500
What are you talking about?

1085
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,295
They're completely devoid
of any desire and ambition.

1086
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,589
Fine, I'll give it to you.

1087
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,760
Anyway, I wonder
what we can do to coax him.

1088
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,262
I know. What can we do?

1089
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,763
Oh, right.

1090
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,184
People like him love to be served
rather than pampered with wealth.

1091
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:00,643
Served?

1092
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,353
He doesn't have a solid background,
does he?

1093
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,397
You're right.

1094
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,358
All right, I'll serve him like a king now.

1095
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,277
Great.

1096
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,488
Are you going to go through
with the Fire Eel plan?

1097
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,782
There's going to be a lot of drug dealers.
Will you be okay?

1098
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,119
I have a plan, and it's not about numbers.

1099
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,831
Why are you so much
like a con artist today?

1100
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,626
It's me, Kim Haeil.

1101
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,295
It's a nice day.

1102
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:28,796
It sure is.

1103
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,632
I love Busan!

1104
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,261
- Confidentiality is key.
- Right.

1105
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:41,476
Four, three, two, one. Ding!

1106
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,229
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1107
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:48,775
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1108
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:52,070
Move it, move it, move it.

1109
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,531
Go, go, go!

1110
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,908
Move it! Keep going!

1111
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,660
- Get in already.
- Go, go, go!

1112
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,915
Have you ever seen
such a childlike drug dealer?

1113
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,585
He has an update.

1114
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,255
Hello?

1115
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,423
Hey, brother.

1116
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:16,135
The details of the information
sent to the phone were deleted.

1117
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,388
But I was able to restore it,

1118
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,682
and turns out
the picture was taken three days ago.

1119
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,434
Get moving.

1120
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:31,693
Should we go watch a fight?

1121
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,996
These bastards.

1122
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,459
It feels rather eerie here.

1123
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:49,544
I know.

1124
00:59:51,337 --> 00:59:52,797
Fire Eel!

1125
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,090
Sir!

1126
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,717
Sir!

1127
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,926
Fire Eel!

1128
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,886
Sir?

1129
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,888
Fire Eel! Hey, Fire Eel!

1130
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,849
I'm here! I'm here for you!

1131
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,396
Don't cry!

1132
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,398
Hey, where's that Heidi or whatever?

1133
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,443
Hey.

1134
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,529
Isn't covering his face enough?
At least let him speak.

1135
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,156
This is a violet of human rights!

1136
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,824
I mean, violation of human rights!

1137
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,369
Stop crying!

1138
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,873
Man, you guys are loud.

1139
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,627
Drug dealers have no human rights.

1140
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:32,837
Hey.

1141
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,006
Ah…

1142
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:37,258
I see, you must be Sangman's ex.

1143
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:40,470
I've heard so much about you
that you're almost like family.

1144
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:41,679
But what's with the costume?

1145
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,932
- Family, you say?
- Holy crap.

1146
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,726
Prove it to me.

1147
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,561
- What the hell is this?
- Me?

1148
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,688
Night Guy!

1149
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,523
What the hell?

1150
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,525
I thought you were him!

1151
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,110
Get lost! Get lost already!

1152
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,946
Mr. Smith! Smith!

1153
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,868
This is ridiculous.

1154
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,287
I wonder how the priest will appear.

1155
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,331
Where is he?

1156
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,208
The priest?

1157
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,959
Probably somewhere "heaven" a good time.

1158
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,174
That's funny. Real funny.

1159
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:21,135
Being fearless is also a mental illness.

1160
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,220
Are you ill?

1161
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,180
You talk too much.

1162
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:25,598
Did you bring the money?

1163
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,808
I barely talked.

1164
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,935
Let's see if that's Fire Eel.

1165
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,063
To tell you the truth,

1166
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:34,732
we're not interested…

1167
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,651
in the money.

1168
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,362
What?

1169
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,908
I'm not Fire Eel.

1170
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,743
I'm Freshwater Eel.

1171
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,332
What's going on?

1172
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:52,500
Is this a prank?

1173
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,588
We're here to catch you
and the guys above you.

1174
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,799
Man, this hurts my pride.

1175
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,551
How did we fall for such fools?

1176
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:02,969
Where's Fire Eel?

1177
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,304
Where is he?

1178
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,889
He's no longer alive!

1179
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,599
Because of you guys.

1180
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,768
Right, I knew it.

1181
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,061
I saw him in my dream last night.

1182
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,146
Enough chatting.

1183
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,523
Let's go before the sun rises.

1184
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,692
Wait a second. Hold on.

1185
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,527
I prepared something
in case things went south.

1186
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:22,780
If you're all cops who fight for justice,

1187
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,450
there's one thing you can't overlook.

1188
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,869
-Bring it out.
-Yes, sir.

1189
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,165
This is fun.
It's very entertaining.

1190
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,253
Ta-da!

1191
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,588
Who is she, you ask?

1192
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,382
Fire Eel's mother!

1193
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:49,265
Stop laughing!

1194
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,267
Why do you have his mother?

1195
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,479
That's because you have to come with us,

1196
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:57,523
or else she will die.

1197
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,526
Then you'll feel guilty as well.
Understood?

1198
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,404
Don't do this.
Why get someone innocent involved?

1199
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:07,700
Exactly. Come with us
if you don't want to see her die.

1200
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,826
One more thing.

1201
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,829
The chairman wanted me
to cut off your adrenaline…

1202
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,623
I mean, your Achilles tendon.

1203
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,125
It'll only hurt a bit.
Let's go.

1204
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,839
Anytime now. Come on!

1205
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:25,760
What is that?

1206
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,054
Hey, guys!

1207
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,600
Wait, hang on a second.

1208
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:36,813
It looks like all the cures
for low blood pressure

1209
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,856
are gathered here.

1210
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,316
Are you the priest?

1211
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,153
That's right, that's me.

1212
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:45,655
Where have you been?

1213
01:03:45,738 --> 01:03:48,366
Wait. I should've gotten off earlier.

1214
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:51,452
Are you Fire Eel's boss?

1215
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:55,206
♪ Why don't you take a guess? ♪

1216
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:57,959
Why do old men sing their lines?

1217
01:03:58,042 --> 01:04:00,336
I know, right?

1218
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:02,839
I can tell right away.

1219
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:07,093
Given that your eyes look nastier
than Fire Eel's, you must be his boss.

1220
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,928
You're right.

1221
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,848
You should take omega-3.
It's good for your eyes.

1222
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,975
Anyway, why were you on that thing?

1223
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:17,520
I had to make sure
my appearance lived up to my look tonight.

1224
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,105
A round of applause.

1225
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,731
It's perfect.

1226
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,734
- Absolutely perfect!
- Get out of my way.

1227
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,778
Just perfect. Truly perfect.

1228
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,322
Perfectly perfect.

1229
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,867
I don't know what good they can be

1230
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:33,160
even if we take them with us, Father.

1231
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,997
Well, I'm sure they have
some guys to back them up,

1232
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:37,874
so I guess it's quantity over quality.

1233
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,209
What are we, popcorn?
Quantity over quality, my foot.

1234
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,046
Listen, if you don't come
with us right now,

1235
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:46,799
I'll kill her!

1236
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:48,551
Ma'am.

1237
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:53,973
You can leave now.

1238
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:56,851
- Okay.
- What?

1239
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,686
- Oh, my gosh!
- What the heck?

1240
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,271
Goodness me.

1241
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:02,273
It's a miracle, a true miracle!

1242
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:04,358
It's not a miracle.

1243
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,110
I'm just doing a part-time job.

1244
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:09,405
Goodness, my butt is so sweaty.

1245
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:12,658
Make sure to send me
the medical fee with my pay.

1246
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,703
-Don't deduct the tax.
-Okay.

1247
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,372
- Get home safely.
- Bye.

1248
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,124
- What's going on?
- Out of my way!

1249
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:21,709
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1250
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,462
What's going on? Am I dreaming?

1251
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,797
Is this a movie? Or a play?

1252
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:27,882
Or a musical?

1253
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,263
Let's go volunteer elsewhere.

1254
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:39,685
It was obvious
what you people were going to do.

1255
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,146
Using family as blackmail.

1256
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,108
Don't worry,
we took Fire Eel's mother somewhere safe.

1257
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:50,446
Father Kim, it'd be nice
if God made another commandment.

1258
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,448
An 11th Commandment?

1259
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,869
Something like, "Do not mess with family
for your wealth and honor"?

1260
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,122
All right, let's get our heads straight!

1261
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,375
Let's cut their ankles and get going!

1262
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,751
All right!

1263
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,503
-Bring in--
-I'm begging you.

1264
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,631
Please don't say anything
corny and childish.

1265
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:09,715
It's pathetic.

1266
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,260
Come on in!

1267
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:22,561
You stay back, Smith.

1268
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,736
All right!

1269
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,823
Let's go!

1270
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,432
Smith, you good?

1271
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,732
Get them! Man, this is frustrating.

1272
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,775
Why can't you hit them?

1273
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,134
Dokseong!

1274
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:37,428
-How dare you?
-Let go!

1275
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:38,763
- You okay?
- Let me go!

1276
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:45,478
Detective Gu!

1277
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,358
Wait. I'm going to transform.

1278
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,530
You can't hit me
in the middle of transforming!

1279
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,824
Stop it! You've done enough!

1280
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,035
Auntie!

1281
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:03,662
Show them, Auntie!

1282
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:08,918
-Auntie.
-Yes, my nephew.

1283
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,216
That's my nephew!

1284
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,598
You okay?
Who laid their hands on my nephew?

1285
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,686
You want a piece of me?

1286
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:30,439
-Go for it.
-All right.

1287
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:39,615
You're quite good.
You want to work for me?

1288
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:41,283
Bring it in. You guys go.

1289
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,451
Go on!

1290
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:47,540
This is ridiculous.

1291
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,500
- I'm getting a concussion.
- I can't see.

1292
01:08:49,583 --> 01:08:53,212
Hey, come on! Run! Let's go!

1293
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:11,647
We're with the Narcotics Team
at Dohan Police Station.

1294
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,024
Don't move, you drug dealers.

1295
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:16,318
Good evening, sir.

1296
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:20,573
Sir, those four guys
are the real bad guys,

1297
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,117
-so you should arrest them.
-Ah…

1298
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,785
We'll get going then.

1299
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,245
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.

1300
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,330
-Let's go, guys.
-Oh, yeah?

1301
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:31,750
My, that's a lot of guns.

1302
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,210
Why don't we talk at the station?

1303
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:39,466
-Let's go escort them.
-Okay.

1304
01:09:41,051 --> 01:09:43,554
-What?
-Are you going to go like that?

1305
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,556
-Well…
-Look at me.

1306
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:47,266
Do you have wet wipes?

1307
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,059
That's not going to work!

1308
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:50,519
-Oh, goodness.
-What is that?

1309
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:51,770
-I thought it was your actual stomach.
-Where's the bathroom?

1310
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:52,855
Let's go.

1311
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,118
Are we going to die like this?

1312
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,786
He said one mistake, one life.

1313
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,664
People make more than one mistake!

1314
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:13,584
Busan Dohan Police Station

1315
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,095
Oh, jeez. What the heck?

1316
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,389
No… He crashed into a police car?

1317
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:28,557
No way!

1318
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:30,643
There's no getting out of that!

1319
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,407
Those bastards!

1320
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:55,251
Who the hell are you?

1321
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:06,804
Wait, sir.

1322
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:08,764
We're safe!

1323
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,599
This is why you have to wear
your seat belt.

1324
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,268
- Let me get out first!
- Me too.

1325
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,019
Me first!

1326
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:16,522
- Thank you! Thank you!
- Thank you!

1327
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:18,691
- You're the best!
- Wear it, wear it.

1328
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,485
Hurry.

1329
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,575
- We're alive, we're alive.
- Are we going the right way?

1330
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:30,619
- Are we?
- Which way is it?

1331
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,038
- What's going on?
- What happened?

1332
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:23,922
Auntie, over there.

1333
01:12:24,548 --> 01:12:26,133
Are you okay?

1334
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,594
What happened?

1335
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,179
Are you okay?

1336
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:33,807
Father Kim, over there.

1337
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,729
Call 911 and stay with them.

1338
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:39,897
Okay.

1339
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,106
You'll be okay.

1340
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:44,026
Right, 911.

1341
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,871
The temporary priest?

1342
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:52,529
Special thanks to Ji Seunghyun
for his appearance

1343
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:56,992
Special thanks to Ji Seunghyun
for his appearance

1344
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,317
The Fiery Priest Season 2

1345
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,401
I think they're professional killers

1346
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,653
trained in martial arts.

1347
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:34,571
Does that mean
their cartel members are all here?

1348
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:37,115
We'll go for
the pressure points to hold them down.

1349
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,911
What are you getting up to every night?

1350
01:15:40,994 --> 01:15:42,162
We'll know who they are

1351
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,872
as soon as we run their faces
through the system.

1352
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:46,083
Let's go bully the villains.

1353
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,752
I've gathered information on those guys.

1354
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:50,212
These aren't tears.

1355
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:51,630
They're rusty water.

1356
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:54,883
Get ready!
You drug dealing bastards are dead meat.

1357
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,219
Hello, I'm Prosecutor Park Kyungsun.

1358
01:15:57,302 --> 01:15:58,804
So he knows
the National Intelligence Service?

1359
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:00,639
He's so cool.

1360
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,099
I need you guys to do something.

1361
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,892
Hey.

1362
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:06,395
There will be quite a few hits
coming your way.

1363
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:14,486
