is like an insult to me.

556
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,140
We can't go up anymore.

557
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,570
Zhou,

558
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,910
there should be backup power in this building, right?

559
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,550
Yes,

560
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,720
there's a diesel generator

561
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,600
in the equipment room on the first floor.

562
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,000
But we can't go up there.

563
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,070
Mom.

564
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,730
Where's your medicine? Where's your medicine?

565
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,870
I don't have it. I don't know.

566
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,720
You don't have it?

567
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,250
Mom.

568
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,940
Do you have a plastic bag?

569
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,910
It should be left up there. I'll go look for it.

570
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,880
You go find a plastic bag.

571
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,750
Wait, there's a supermarket.

572
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,460
I'll go check the supermarket.

573
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,260
There are chargers, candles, and everything in it.

574
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,940
I'll go take a look.

575
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,620
I'll go with you.

576
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,500
No need. I used to work at the supermarket,

577
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,790
so I'm familiar with it.

578
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,650
I can go by myself.

579
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:37,000
You all stay here and don't move;

580
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,370
try to hide in the triangular area.

581
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,410
We'll go check

582
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,470
if there are any other people trapped

583
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,820
or other exits.

584
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,370
Stay strong.

585
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,470
Zhengtai, don't scare me.

586
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,590
Is anyone there?

587
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,330
Is anyone there?

588
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,630
Is anyone there?

589
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,880
I'll strangle you.

590
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,710
[Shi Kai, the manager of the Luobai supermarket]

591
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,230
Tao Ye.

592
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,460
I've tried.

593
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,710
He's not breathing.

594
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,200
Get out of here. Go!

595
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,900
Wait a moment.

596
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,780
Get a bag and put these in.

597
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,700
Zhengtai.

598
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,220
He's coughing very badly.

599
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,620
Yeah, he has had asthma since he was little.

600
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,670
Pack this up.

601
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,540
Are you still worried about your dad?

602
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,000
Why should I care about him?

603
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,490
Luobai is his,

604
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,720
not mine.

605
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,710
If something really happens,

606
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,390
it serves him right.

607
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,080
Don't be stubborn at a time like this.

608
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,190
When the phone gets a signal later,

609
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,230
give him a call

610
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,510
and check on him.

611
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,330
He hasn't cared whether I'm alive or dead.

612
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,900
All exits are blocked.

613
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,460
We can only wait for rescue.

614
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,610
How's the situation upstairs? Is anyone trapped?

615
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,210
No.

616
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,810
This is yours, right?

617
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,130
Yes, thank you.

618

619
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,310
See if there's anything we can use.

620
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,910
Thank you.

621
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,590
Manager Zhou,

622
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,070
come here and help.

623
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,560
I rescued someone in the parking lot.

624
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,190
What happened?

625
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,420
Come, sit here.

626
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,380
His leg is injured.

627
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,600
What happened?

628
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,420
Didn't I tell you to close the parking lot?

629
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,890
No, no, no.

630
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:58,260
It's my fault; it has nothing to do with him.

631
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,080
Who here knows how to bandage?

632
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Let me take a look.

633
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,370
You do it, you do it.

634
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,460
The walkie-talkie.

635
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,810
Great.

Is anyone there? Is anyone there?

639

Is anyone there?

640
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,760
Is anyone there?

I am the captain of the Haizhou Fire Department.

642
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,220
May I ask who you are?

643
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,870
Zhu Wei, it's me.

644
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,330
I'm trapped down here.

645
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,750
-Xiaoguang?
-We've made contact with the rescue team.

646
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,080
Xiaoguang, is that you?

647
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,400
We're in the fire escape on the second basement floor.

648
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,060
Currently, I have found ten people trapped.

649
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,410
One person has a leg injury,

650
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,190
and there's a child with asthma.

651
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,860
The others are just a bit scared.

652
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,660
We're safe now.

653
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,870
What's the situation up there?

654
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,400

655
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,520
Right now, the entire building has sunk a few meters,

656
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,110
but

657
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,830
the main structure hasn't been damaged.

658
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,170
Tell the people down there that

659
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,580
it will take about two to three hours.

660
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,820
We'll do our best

661
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,620
to get you out before dawn, okay?

662
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,010
Xiaoguang, listen to me.

663
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,100
I'll keep this frequency open.

664
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,150
You go check

665
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,180
for any other trapped individuals.

666
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,330
Let's keep in touch.

Let's stay in contact.

668
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,550
Don't worry, I'm here.

669
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,400
Xiaoguang,

670
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,970
with you down there,

671
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,060
I feel much more at ease.

672
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,140
Don't worry.

00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,630

and they are currently working hard to clear a rescue route.

Simultaneously,

681
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,110
the cause of the incident is under investigation.

The specific situation of the building still needs further investigation.

688

There's a signal now.

689
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,140

I'm fine.

I'm fine.

694
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,430
Let me see.

695
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,500
It was caused by the building collapse;

696
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,300
it has nothing to do with you.

697
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,850
If anyone asks about this in the future,

698
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,910
you just say you don't know anything.

699
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,000
I'll keep this matter to myself.

700
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,140

701
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,320

It seems that you're worried about him.

703
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,330
Just let him know you're safe.

704

Hello.

and perform rituals every year using talismans

713

Why did this happen? Why?

715
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,219
I don't know why either.

716
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,300
Please spare me!

717
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,190
It wasn't me who caused the death!

718

It was all because of Luo Haoran!

719
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:44,920
It was all because of Luo Haoran!

720
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,750
He drove Wu Jianjun to death!

721
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,050
He forced him to his death!

722
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,050
You're a liar!

723
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,000
You're such a liar!
