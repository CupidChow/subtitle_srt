and the air is clear here.

189
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,420
I think

190
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,040
there's a passage at the bottom of the sinkhole

191
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,810
connecting to the outside,

192
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,030
so I'm trying to find a way

193
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,990
to go down and take a look

194
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,530
to see if I can find a way out.

195
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,640
Are you okay?

196
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,270
Why are you recording this?

197
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,180
I want to

198
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,180
record the situation down there.

199
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,090
When we get out,

200
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,440
the recordings

201
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,120
will be very helpful for future rescue efforts.

202
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,180
Then use this one.

203
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,160
This one has a longer standby time.

204
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,690
I've seen this before.

205
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,490
Thank you.

206
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,630
You're welcome.

207
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,550
Why did you

208
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,360
vote to cast Luo Haoran out?

209
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,700
I didn't want Ding Zi to be implicated.

210
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,410
Do you think I did the wrong thing?

211
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,370
Because if something

212
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,050
really happens to Luo Haoran,

213
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,830
it will be because of me.

214
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,270
You're not wrong.

215
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,510
This was a collective decision.

216
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,250
And don't worry.

217
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,460
I'll talk to everyone.

218
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,410
Luo Haoran will be fine.

219
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,420
Can I stay with you?

220
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,250
Aunt Chang,

221
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,910
did I do the wrong thing?

222
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,030
It's all Luo Haoran's fault.

223
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,910
Even if...

224
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,140
something unexpected were to happen to him,

225
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,120
it wouldn't be your responsibility.

226
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,140
Just looking at you,

227
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,060
I can tell you're a very simple girl.

228
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,670
But people

229
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,690
are much more complicated than you think.

230
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,470
Sometimes we only see

231
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,330
a small part of the whole picture.

232
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,150
Luo Haoran's fate

233
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,710
may have been sealed long ago.

234
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,620
This accident

235
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
just changed some of the processes,

236
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:46,590
but his outcome

237
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,470
won't change.

238
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,470
[Collapse Incident: Day 4]

239
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,750
Defendant Luo Haoran,

240
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,290
you are charged with the murder of Wu Jianjun,

241
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,800
a senior engineer

242
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,900
at the Sancheng Construction Group.

243
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:29,990
Now,

244
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,560
I will judge you

245
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,820
for my husband.

246
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,580
You're Engineer Wu's wife,

247
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,980
aren't you?

248
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,600
You should know...

249
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,000
what I want to know, right?

250
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,370
I've already told you

251
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,840
that your husband's death has nothing to do with me.

252
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,120
He committed suicide.

253
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,980
Wu Hanlei said

254
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,930
that you drove him to his death.

255
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,910
Wu Hanlei is mentally unstable.

256
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,380
Can't you see that?

257
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,870
Why would you believe him?

258
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,670
When my husband died,

259
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,750
he didn't leave any last words.

260
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
This wasn't like him.

261
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,980
If he really had wanted to end his life,

262
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,600
he could have chosen a simpler method.

263
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,190
I think...

264
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,720
the reason he chose

265
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:59,180
to commit suicide in the parking spot next to the locked room

266
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,020
was to draw

00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,350
the police's attention

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,750
to the problems with Luobai Shopping Mall.

269
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,319
Moreover,

270
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,150
I can ascertain...

271
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,540
that he must have had crucial evidence,

272
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,630
which

273
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,150
you all took away.

274
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,390
Just because you suspect

275
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,990
that your husband's death is related to me,

276
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,980
you tied me up

277
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,300
and poured gasoline around me

278
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,380
on the ground?

279
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,180
You're a lawyer.

280
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,860
I have relapsed with cancer

281
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,070
and won't live much longer.

282
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,290
Actually, I just

283
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,800
want to find out

284
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,260
how my husband really died.

285
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,580
I think

286
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,790
you should understand, right?

287
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,880
Lawyer Chang.

288
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,300
I'll tell you everything.

289
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,070
I believe you're a reasonable person,

290
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,100
so you can judge whether I was wrong

291
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,390
or if everything is just fate's arrangement.

292
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,520
I knew about the sinkhole's existence

293
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,070
five years ago.

294
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,670
But it's really not my fault.

295
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,940
Twenty-two years ago,

296
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,400
I invested everything I had to build Luobai.

297
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,410
At that time, this area

298
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,470
was an old and rundown neighborhood—

299
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,730
dilapidated and outdated.

300
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,530
There wasn't even a decent shop,

301
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,150
let alone a mall.

302
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,420
I was the first to take the risk.

303
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,560
The technology back then was very backward.

304
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,410
The people who surveyed the foundation

305
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,610
didn't even discover

306
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,860
that there was a sinkhole underground.

307
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,040
And so,

308
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,860
I built the business I had always wanted

309
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,350
on the edge of a chasm.

310
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,220
Five years ago,

311
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,450
this area became more and more popular,

312
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,320
and new commercial entities sprang up around it.

313
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,870
Luobai's business continued to decline.

314
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,760
I am not someone who can easily concede defeat.

315
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,030
I hired the best designers

316
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,920
and ordered the best construction materials from home and abroad.

317
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,080
I wanted to renovate Luobai.

318
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,300
The shareholders disagreed, so I persuaded them one by one.

319
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,330
When the money wasn't enough,

320
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,090
I mortgaged Luobai for a loan.

321
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,830
When everything was ready,

322
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,300
and we were about to start construction,

323
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,630
we discovered the problem.

324
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,410
The probability of ground collapse was very low,

325
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,860
only one in ten thousand.

326
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,870
I spent some money

327
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,410
and bought that report.

[Haizhou University of Technology]

329
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,670
The school I had sponsored gave me an opportunity.

330
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:32,680
That's how...

331
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,670
I met your husband.

332
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,240
You approached him from the beginning

333
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,460
just to use him, right?

334
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,910
Lawyer Chang, I had no choice.

335
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,590
Your husband was an authority in the field of construction.

336
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,870
If he agreed to help me,

337
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,630
the renovation of Luobai would definitely be fine.

338
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,370
I got five hundred thousand yuan

339
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,700
to talk to your husband.

340
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,810
But I didn't expect...

341
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,250
that he would turn against me.

342
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,850
He asked me to turn myself in.

343
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,390
He said if I didn't,

344
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,370
he would report Luobai's situation to the Housing and Construction Bureau

345
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,030
and have it classified as a dangerous building.

346
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,470
How did you...

347
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,250
drag him into this?

348
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,570
It was your illness that helped me.

349

that his wife had cancer

351
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,950
and needed a large sum for surgery.

352
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,430
I used all my resources

353
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,590
to find the best oncologist at Haizhou Hospital

354
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,990
to perform your surgery.

355
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,270
Your life was saved.

356
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,690

actively helping me smooth things over.

He even

360
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,370
helped me alter the blueprints.

361
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,810
I never expected

362
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,540
that I would be the one who pushed my husband into that abyss.

363
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,280
was actually me.

364
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,930
Lawyer Chang, don't say that.

365
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,950
No one wanted today's events

366
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,600
to happen.

367
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,510
At first, the renovation project for Luobai

368
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,040
was progressing smoothly.

369
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,010
But I didn't expect that...

370
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,470
Was it that big fire?

371
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,070
That fire

372
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,200
was the last straw that led to my falling out with your husband.

373
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,570
He was too nervous.

374
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,900
He was worried that the fire investigators

375
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,360

00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,250
We really diverted the investigation team's attention,

387
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,550

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,450
I'm next in line.

565
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,530
It's my turn.

566
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,140
I'm next in line.

567
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,270
[Dear Daughter]

568
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,790
My dear daughter,

569
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,950
by the time you see this letter,

570
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,150
I may no longer be in this world.

571
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,750
I should have said a proper goodbye to you,

572
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,590
but I really don't want you

573
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,510
to see me in my last moments.

574
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,670
No water, no food,

575
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,330
and no hope.

576
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,150
I can't imagine how horrible

577
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,050
that kind of death would be.

578
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,960
So I've decided

579
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,210
to end my life with dignity

580
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,830
while I still have a choice.

581
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,550
I've left you a gift.

582
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,410
You'll receive it when you make it out alive.

583
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:17,410
Ding Zi,

584
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,790
you must get out of here alive.

585
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,000
You must face all difficulties with strength.

586
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,680
I will be with you in my own way,

587
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,140
helping you through every challenge life throws your way.

588
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,660
Ding Zi,

589
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,660
Dad loves you.

590
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,140
Are you alright?

591
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,320
I just went to see Ding Zi.

592
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,270
I saw Luo Haoran

593
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,500
leave her a suicide note.

594
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,670
A suicide note?

595
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,050
It seems after he was driven away,

596
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,090
he had already decided to take his own life.

597
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
It's all my fault.

598
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,990
If it weren't for my vote...

599
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,440
Haimei,

600
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,190
that's not your fault.

601
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,600
The most important thing now

602
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,920
is to adjust your mindset

603
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,500
and maintain your strength.

604
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,630
Don't overthink it.

605
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,990
He killed himself...

606
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,710
But why didn't he choose

607
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,230
an easier way?

608
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,370
Luo Haoran

609
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,930
was a very superstitious man.

610
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,030
Maybe he believed

611
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,030
that a big fire was the path

612
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
to heaven.

613
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,650
Why do I feel like burning in fire is a punishment?

614
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,950
Aren't there mountains of blades and seas of fire

615
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,680
in the eighteen layers of hell?

616
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,670
Doesn't he deserve

617
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,880
to go to hell?

618
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,590
Wu Hanlei helped me come up with a plan.

619
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,520
To shift the blame for the accident

620
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,620
onto

621
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,080
that elevator installer

622
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,770
and his firefighter brother.

623
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,080
Give it to the police.

624
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,310
It can prove

625
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,730
that you and your brother are innocent.

626
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,790
I know

627
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:09,250
you hate Luo Haoran and Wu Hanlei,

628
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
but you really are a good person.

629
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:14,850
I don't want to see you

630
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,630
suffer anymore.

631
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,730
Let me take the fall

632
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,860
for all of this.

633
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,000
This is also

634
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,110
the only thing I can do for you.
