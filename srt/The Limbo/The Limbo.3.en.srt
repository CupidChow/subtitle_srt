00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,210
and get information about his close relatives
and friends,

190
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,740
family members, and lovers

191
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,080
from before he died.

192
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,360
Alright.

193
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,750
How is it? Can we go up?

194
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,760
We can go up,

195
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,000
but there's a collapsed section
in the middle.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,130
I can't get through.

197
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,150
Then let me try.

198
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,890
You can't get through either.

199
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,670
Uncle Xiaoguang, I can get through.

200
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,510
Zhengtai.

201
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,240
No, it's too dangerous.

202
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,510
It's okay, I'll protect him.

203
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,250
He's the only one able to get through.

204
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,340
Watch your head.

205
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,000
Be careful, Zhengtai.

206
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,430
Captain, we've checked everything.

207
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,010
Captain, there's still no signal.

208
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,790
We've checked three times already.

209
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,720
Let's withdraw.

210
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,660
Then just keep searching

211
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,770
for more times!

212
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,070
Calling command center,
calling command center.

213
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,190
Go ahead.

214
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,720
We've found survivors.

215
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,280
We've found survivors.

216
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,090
We've found survivors.

217
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,020
That's great!

218
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,130
That's great!

219
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,630
That's great!

220
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,720
Liu, contact the chief commander.

221
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,310
Yes, sir.

222
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,280
Be careful.

223
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:53,980
Mom, am I brave?

224
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,280
Do you think they'll receive our message?

225
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,110
Go refuel with diesel. Be careful.

226
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,990
It's on.

227
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,820
Zhou, get up.

228
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,680
[Subsidence, Day 3]

229
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,390
I've found some clothes.

230
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,710
Take some if you need.

231
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,110
Make sure to stay warm.

232
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,260
We should hurry to gather supplies now.

233
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,450
Water, food,

234
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,710
lighting, medicine...

235
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,350
Anything will do.

236
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,990
The more we can use, the better.

237
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,550
Auntie Chang can stay here
to look after Wu Hanlei.

238
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,420
Everyone else, pair up. Hurry!

239
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,590
Don't take all the water over there.

240
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,630
Keep some for yourself.

241
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,780
How can you be so selfish in such case?

242
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,740
A cunning rabbit has three burrows.

243
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,440
Always leaving yourself a way out

244
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,190
does you no harm,

245
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,920
especially at a time like this.

246
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,100
Luo Haoran.

247
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,870
Are you hiding something from everyone?

248
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,930
Speak up.

249
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,220
Are you hiding something from everyone?

250
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
How could it be possible for me

251
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,170
to hide something from you?

252
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,310
Are you worried about starving

253
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,670
to death here?

254
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,150
You've caused so much suffering to everyone.

255
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,150
And now you want to hide water alone?

256
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,000
Will you ever in your life...

257
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,590
feel any sense of guilt?

258
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:44,910
Do you really think...

259
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,650
that I knew this building would collapse?

260
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,630
Don't you know?

261
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,110
Speak up, don't you know?

262
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,550
Fine, fine.

263
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,870
Do you even know what you'll do next

264
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,000
to achieve your goals?

265
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,530
I know.

266
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,590
I do know.

267
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,270
I want to bury myself underground,

268
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,790
and bury my daughter underground too.

269
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,750
I know all of it.

270
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,350
I don't know what your mother told you.

271
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,600
I'm just telling you,

272
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,990
we are family, and you are my daughter.

273
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,300
Do you understand?

274
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,350
What's wrong with your hand?

275
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,150
It's nothing.

276
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,270
Just arthritis.

277
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,130
Sometimes when I carry heavy things,

278
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,890
or when it rains, it hurts.

279
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,090
How did you get arthritis?

280
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,230
It's from washing gluten when I was young.

281
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,510
It's the aftereffects.

282
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,580
Since I was born,

283
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,420
it was just my mom and me.

284
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,910
As soon as school was over,

285
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,510
I'd go help at the food stall.

286
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,740
After school, when I got home,

287
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,330
I'd help my mom prepare ingredients.

288
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,360
I would help her wash the dough.

289
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,640
Do you know how to make liang pi?

290
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,770
No, I don't.

291
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,890
Well, it's just

292
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,200
to knead the dough into a ball.

293
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,290
Then you keep adding cold water to it.

294
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,840
It's like washing clothes.

295
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,550
You wash it over and over again.

296
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,620
Gradually, the dough

297
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,070
will become like a small piece of cotton,

298
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,870
and the remaining starchy water
can then be used to make liang pi.

299
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,380
I did it too often

300
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,710
and my hands got some problems.

301
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,320
How did you and Ding Zi become friends?

302
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:41,340
Actually, I was Ding Zi's tutor.

303
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,430
Oh.

304
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,870
After my sophomore year,

305
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,620
I started tutoring part-time.

306
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,280
I wanted to earn more money,

307
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,830
so I could take my mom on a plane later

308
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,070
to go to the beach.

309
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,030
As for Ding Zi, she wanted to study abroad.

310
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,560
So she asked me to tutor her.

311
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,070
Later, we gradually became friends.

312
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:05,600
Hai Mei.

313
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,550
Aren't you scared?

314
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,680
You've already said you're a fireman.

315
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:12,990
I trust you.

316
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,700
When we get out,

317
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,150
I hope to go to your mom's store

318
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,150
to taste it.

319
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,870
Sure.

320
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,750
Let's go, let's check out other places.

321
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,950
Do you know
how many people struggle

322
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,110
just to buy these bags?

323
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,380
Are the things here very expensive?

324
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,370
Not expensive.

325
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,130
Just about 100,000 to 200,000 yuan each.

326
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,790
Don't tell me

327
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,910
that you've never bought one for your wife?

328
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,510
My wife doesn't like expensive things.

329
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,930
She joins group purchases for a snip.

330
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,750
Buy one for your wife.

331
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,200
See if she likes it.

332
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,180
No woman can refuse luxury goods.

333
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:07,550
Zhou.

334
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,980
Leave it with me for now.

335
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
We'll share it if we get thirsty.

336
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,810
What are you doing?

337
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,680
This is the rest area for family members.

338
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,350
Please rest over there.

339
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,990
Why did you bring me here?

340
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,100
-Where is Luo Haoran?
-Please calm down.

341
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,130
How could it be possible?

342
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,280
Do you know who I am?

343
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,110
This mall used to belong to my family.

344
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,140
I used to be the owner's wife of the mall.

345
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,100
Go find him.

346
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,740
Hurry up and find Luo Haoran.

347
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,530
He's not answering his phone or coming out.

348
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,130
Does he think I'll let him off the hook?

349
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,550
Such a big incident,
and he wants to hide like a coward?

350
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,750
Please calm down. Rest here for a while.

351
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,680
I have something to attend to.

352
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,750
I'll go over there first.

353
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,260
Wait.

354
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,710
No, you, you, you...

355
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,980
You can't just leave me like this!

356
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,470
You must be Ding Zi's mother, right?

357
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,810
[Ding Xiaoping, Luo Haoran's first wife]

358
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,090
I've seen your photo.

359
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,310
Who are you?

360
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,330
My daughter is Ding Zi's friend.

361
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,230
Ding Zi often comes to play at our house.

362
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,510
Oh.

363
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,140
So you're Hai Mei's mother, right?

364
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,640
I was wondering why my daughter

365
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,950
didn't stay at school at night,

366
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,160
but play outside.

367
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,110
My daughter was led astray by your daughter.

368
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,510
What?

369
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,940
What do you mean by that?

370
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,150
I'm telling you,
if anything happens to my daughter,

371
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,110
I won't let this go!

372
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,670
No, that's not true.

557
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,470
At the same time, I hope

558
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,000
that Luobai's shareholders

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,580
can come forward and explain to the public.

560
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,510
Stop being cowards.

561
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,300
Thank you all.

562
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:23,900
Director Yuan, can you say a bit more?
Director Yuan!

563
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,540
You vixen! You shameless woman!

564
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,030
You shameless thing!

565
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,160
You destroyer! Give me back my daughter!

566
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,790
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

567
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,610
Here are all the documents
and blueprints of Luobai.

568
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,710
I hope they'll be helpful to you.

569
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:45,870
Thank you.

570
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,190
"I've decided

571
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,230
[Latest progress on Luobai's subsidence.]

572
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,420
to donate 200,000 yuan in my personal capacity...

573
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,070
Look.

574
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,030
to compensate for some of your loss."

575
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,510
This woman is something, isn't she?

576
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,000
"At the same time, I hope Luobai's shareholders

577
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,930
can come forward..."

578
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,430
200,000 yuan.

579
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,010
She didn't even blink

580
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,040
when she said it.

581
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,160
Donating money is fine,

582
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,790
but what's the need of filming a video?

583
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,770
I just feel

584
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,470
this video looks particularly staged.

585
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,840
[Latest progress on Luobai's subsidence.]

586
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,710
Your thinking is outdated.

587
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,670
Who says good deeds
must be done anonymously?

588
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:17,950
I think this is quite good,

589
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,190
spreading positive energy.

590
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,560
It's true.

591
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,850
But I still feel something fake about this Yuan Mei.

592
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,200
Just wait and see.

593
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,100
She'll keep trending on social media.

594
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,890
[Latest progress on Luobai's subsidence.]

595
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,690
So she wants to use public opinion

596
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,980
to set herself apart?

597
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,510
You lack imagination.

598
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,690
[Latest progress on Luobai's subsidence.]

599
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,880
She's not after popularity.

600
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,690
She wants wind.

601
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,710
The wind that can stir up huge waves,

602
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,310
and spread a wildfire.

603
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,270
These supplies will only last for a week.

604
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,320
Give me a bottle of water.

605
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,850
What are you doing?

606
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,910
These supplies belong to everyone.

607
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,070
No one can use them without permission.

608
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:09,270
Who made you the boss?

609
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,740
Don't think that just because you saved us,

610
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,050
you're now our leader.

611
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,090
Do you want to get out of here alive?

612
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,820
Do you want to make it out alive?

613
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,950
Are you done talking nonsense?

614
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,130
If you want to get out alive,

615
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,370
you must listen to me.

616
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,830
Let me tell you,

617
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,070
I'm the only one here
with rescue experience.

618
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,060
Only I can lead everyone out.

619
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,420
If you don't trust me,

620
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,080
you can divide the supplies

621
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,650
and fend for yourselves.

622
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,650
Don't cause trouble for each other.

623
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,350
I trust Xiaoguang.

624
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,480
What about you all?

625
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,840
We'll listen to you.

626
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,030
We'll follow your lead.

627
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,550
Right, Xiaoguang saved all of us.

628
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,990
We need to unite, unite.

629
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,670
Unity is strength.

630
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,630
Since no one has any objections,

631
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:58,040
from now on,

632
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,100
I'll be in charge
of distributing supplies to everyone.

633
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,830
As long as we stay united

634
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,510
and face all difficulties together,

635
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,230
we will definitely make it out.

636
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:05,710
Right.

637
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,750
First, I hope everyone understands

638
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:19,040
that our supplies are indeed limited.

639
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,980
I will distribute supplies according to
the minimum survival standards

640
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,290
for each person.

641
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,290
One 500ml bottle of water per day,

642
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,160
and food that provides basic calories.

643
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,870
Xiaoguang,

644
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:35,540
one bottle of water for eleven people a day

645
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,290
is too little.

646
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,990
Didn't you say it would be just a week?

647
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,850
That's right.

648
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,110
These supplies should be enough
if distributed normally.

649
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,310
For so little water every day,

650
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,440
who can endure that?

651
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,960
One week is the best case,

652
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,530
but we also need to prepare for the worst.

653
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,770
What's the worst-case scenario?

654
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,700
What do you mean?

655
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,710
In the worst-case scenario,

656
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,570
how long will we have to stay here?

657
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,350
Since we've chosen to trust Xiaoguang,

658
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,030
we shouldn't overthink it anymore.

659
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:09,590
We'll start distributing supplies
at noon every day.

660
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,030
Equal distribution, everyone gets a share.

661
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,640
Wait.

662
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,790
I have no problem with everyone
following your lead.

663
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,790
I'm okay with however
you want to distribute.

664
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,030
But I don't think
we should share it equally.

665
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,790
Shouldn't we figure out

666
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:24,200
who put us in this terrible situation?

667
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,110
For the one who did this to us,

668
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,660
shouldn't he be punished?

669
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,170
It's Luo Haoran.

670
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,510
Luo Haoran is responsible for all of this.

671
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,060
Three years ago,

672
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,460
during the renovation of Luobai,

673
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,710
he had someone re-surveying the foundation.

674
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,810
He knew the sinkhole underneath.

675
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,510
But he didn't report it truthfully.

676
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,510
Because he knew if it's found

677
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,310
by the Housing and Construction Bureau,

678
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,750
Luobai would be ordered to shut down,

679
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,070
or even be forcibly demolished.

680
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,060
To protect his own interests,

681
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,780
he bribed the one
in charge of the foundation survey

682
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,070
to conceal the secret of the sinkhole.

683
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:04,130
He took the risk
and proceeded with the construction.

684
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,430
The person in charge of construction
was named Wu Jianjun,

685
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,310
who also discovered this secret.

686
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,450
Later, Wu Jianjun

687
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,250
was driven to death by him.

688
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,470
You're crazy!

689
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,550
According to your logic,

690
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,030
I knew the building was going to collapse,

691
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,670
and then I kept working
in the building every day

692
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:20,790
for business

693
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,700
only to bury myself
and my daughter underground?

694
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,170
Are you out of your mind?

695
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,360
Everyone saw it.

696
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,810
In the secret room,

697
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,880
he almost killed me.

698
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,480
What are you doing?

699
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,660
I'll fight you to the death!

700
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,510
Let go!

701
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,750
Why would I hit you?

702
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,990
I admit I lost control of my emotions.

703
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,830
I hit him.

704
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,430
He kept tricking me into donating money
and performing rituals.

705
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,830
It's not about the money
for donations and rituals.

706
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,550
He told me that it would make the mall

707
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,990
prosperous and safe.

708
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,150
I was just bewitched.

709
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,910
I can't believe I trusted him.

710
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,430
The building collapsed.

711
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,230
In the heat of the moment,

712
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,930
I hit you. I'm sorry.

713
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,830
You asked me to build the secret room,
didn't you?

714
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,910
You knew there was danger underneath.

715
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,750
You didn't take any remedial measures.

716
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,750
That's one thing.

717
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,780
But he asked me
to set up some feng shui formation for him

718
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,890
to change his fate
against the will of heaven.

719
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,640
Luo Haoran,

720
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,390
are you out of your mind?

721
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,710
Changing fate against heaven's will?

722
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,510
Who do you think you are? Nezha?

723
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,050
That's enough.

724
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,010
Let go of me!

725
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,350
So you mean

726
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,670
that all of us now are

727
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,230
trapped in some kind of sinkhole, right?

728
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,920
Can we still get out of here?

729
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:39,510
Huh?

730
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,800
Wu Hanlei, I'm asking you,

731
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,050
for all these things you just said,

732
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,110
do you have any evidence?

733
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,790
The feng shui formation down there,

734
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,470
didn't you see it yourself?

735
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,910
I'm asking you

736
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,710
if there's any concrete evidence to prove

737
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:04,190
that Luo Haoran knew about the sinkhole.

738
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,850
I...

739
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,870
It was three years ago

740
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,219
when I argued with him

741
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,580
that I mentioned it.

742
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,190
Without evidence,

743
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,429
no one can condemn anyone else.

744
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,710
If Luo Haoran is truly guilty,

745
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,190
we should wait until we get out of here

746
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,909
and let the court judge it.

747
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,300
Here,

748
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,610
no one has the right to judge

749
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,670
whether Luo Haoran is guilty or not.

750
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,420
Ms. Chang, thank you.

751
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,330
If I have the chance,

752
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,810
I will repay you.

753
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,340
If we can get out of here, I will definitely

754
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,770
fight for everyone's best interests

755
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,760
and the maximum compensation.

756
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,449
Xiaoguang is right.

757
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:53,080
Zhou just said it too.

758
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:55,630
At this time, we must unite.

759
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,480
We must unite and not fight among ourselves.

760
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,400
-It's internal friction.
-Luo Haoran.

761
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,520
You finished playing Nezha
and now you're playing God?

762
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,110
If you were truly innocent,

763
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,480
there would be no bad people in this world.

764
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,540
Let Mr. Luo think about it again.

765
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,770
I believe Mr. Luo will make

766
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,350
the right choice.

767
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,270
Right, Auntie Chang?

768
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,630
Get lost.

769
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,560
We can't drive Luo Haoran away.

770
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,670
If we drive away the first one,

771
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,130
there will be a second one.

772
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,750
If he has no supplies,

773
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,600
he will die of thirst or hunger.

774
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,480
This is collective murder.

775
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,030
Do you want to kill someone?

776
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,120
Don't talk to me about collective murder.

777
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,770
He's the owner of this mall.

778
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,990
If even he can't find supplies,

779
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,670
then it's heaven's will to take him.

780
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,510
I don't agree.

781
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:48,160
It's your business if you don't agree.

782
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,900
Didn't you say we're a group?

783
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,150
You need to ask everyone's opinion.

784
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,470
Why don't we vote by raising hands?

785
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,230
I agree with Zhou's suggestion.

786
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,970
Yes, yes, let's vote.

787
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,860
Voting is fair.

788
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,280
If everyone agrees,

789
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,670
then let's vote.

790
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,830
Those who agree to let Luo Haoran stay,
raise your hands.

791
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,750
Kid, why are you raising your hand?
What do you know?

792
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,350
What are you shouting about?

793
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,290
Don't raise your hand carelessly.

794
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,350
I know.

795
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,950
Raising my hand means
keeping uncle with us.

796
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,370
Five votes.

797
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,510
Those who agree to let him leave,
raise your hands.

798
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,830
It's a tie.

799
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,260
Hai Mei,

800
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,420
do you agree or disagree?

801
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,190
I disagree.

802
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:30,450
I don't agree to share supplies
with Luo Haoran.

803
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,310
Don't move.

804
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,510
Don't draw attention to yourself.

805
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,980
It's dangerous. Dad's fine.

806
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,560
If it were me, I wouldn't give her any.

807
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,960
It's like benefiting Luo Haoran, isn't it?

808
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,010
That belongs to her.

809
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,830
We have no right to interfere
with her choice.

810
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:42,030
I know everyone hates Luo Haoran.

811
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,990
The mistakes he made

812
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,670
will receive their due punishment.

813
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,570
But have you all thought about it?

814
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,910
If Luo Haoran dies because of us,

815
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,150
when we get out in the future,

816
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,450
we'll feel guilty about it
for the rest of our lives.

817
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,520
So I beg everyone

818
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,760
to give Luo Haoran another chance.

819
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,250
He's not dead yet.

820
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,670
Did they

821
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,610
bully you?

822
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,740
What Wu Hanlei said

823
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,960
was all true.

824
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,190
I knew it five years ago

825
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,830
about the sinkhole.

826
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:50,430
But what he doesn't know is that

827
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,710
this sinkhole

828
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,420
is nearly a hundred meters deep.

829
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,600
In a short period of time,

830
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,230
it's impossible to be rescued.

831
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,050
But Xiaoguang said
the rescue team would arrive in seven days?

832
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,400
Don't trust him at all.

833
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,160
His purpose

834
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,700
is to control the supplies.

835
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,530
The one who controls the supplies
can survive till the end.

836
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,670
If things are really as you say,

837
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,950
why don't you tell everyone the truth?

838
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,730
We can't tell them.

839
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,470
I've calculated those supplies.

840
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,130
At most,

841
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,630
at most, it's enough for everyone

842
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,910
to last for about ten days.

843
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,220
Don't trust anyone,

844
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,070
including your good friend Hai Mei.

845
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,590
Since she could throw your father out,

846
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,310
she might also do things unimaginable.

847
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,910
Ding Zi,

848
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,950
listen to dad.

849
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,030
You can't tell anyone.

850
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,510
Luo Haoran,

851
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,350
look into my eyes.

852
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,380
Are you telling the truth?

853
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,990
Luo Haoran,

854
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,950
everyone agrees to give you another chance.

855
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,480
But there's one condition.

856
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,830
You need to write down the whole story
of Luobai's sinkhole.

857
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,290
Make everything clearly,

858
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:12,580
and sign a confession.

859
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,870
I'll think about it.
