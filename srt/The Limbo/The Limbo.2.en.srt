Looks kind of scary.

to cut corners for profit.

Xiaoguang clearly doesn't have such a condition.

565
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,430
So we investigated his

566
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,750
Internet search history for the past six months

567
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,350
and found he had been looking up

568
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,150
artificial synthesis methods.

569
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,430
In other words,

570
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,550
he concocted poison

571
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,760
and replaced the powder inside the capsules.

572
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,480
So you should now understand

573
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,110
that his purpose in working at Luobai was

574
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,500
to get close to Luo Haoran,

575
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,470
forcing him to take the capsule

576
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,230
when he had an attack.

577
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,310
Of course,

578
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,080
he didn't get the chance

579
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,960
before the incident occurred.

580
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,310
However, at the same time,

581
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,430
Xiaoguang found a better

582
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,730
method of revenge.

583
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:21,830
Think about it:

584
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,280
in a chasm more than

585
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,510
a hundred meters deep,

586
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,470
there's nothing there,

587
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
but the one thing it doesn't lack

588
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,550
is accidents and danger.

589
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,830
In my view,

590
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,630
it's the perfect crime scene.

591
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,910
If a suspect

592
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,290
wants to commit a crime,

593
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,280
there's no need for them to act personally;

594
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,270
they just need to be good at disguising their intent.

595
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,180
At that moment, disaster is the best accomplice.

596
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,350
As long as they disguise themselves well enough,

597
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,040
they can evade consequences

598
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,820
without facing any repercussions.

599
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,340
So,

600
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,470
Xiaoguang may no longer be

601
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,130
the hero you think he is,

602
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,520
who only wants to save people.
