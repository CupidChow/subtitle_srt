1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not used to it, but you are the wind in the leaves.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I always want to be in the clouds and the mountains.

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a pity that I can't get through the difficulties.

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I met you.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Even if I have to travel 2000 miles, where will I go?

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Love is a flower that blooms like a magic.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will give it to you myself.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will never be able to get through the difficulties.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Love is a Flower

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Lord Yue Mu, what's the matter?

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You still call me Lord Yue Mu when there's no one around?

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Madam, just say what you want to say.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ji Nu, take me away.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Since the sword of the Aichi Sword was opened,

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
the business of the Heaven-Bound Sword has been falling apart.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I only know that you have promised to take revenge.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Liu Ji Nu, are you there?

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why is Meiming here? I'll hide first.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's really you, Madam.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm here. Come in.

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tian Xiang Chi's business has been falling apart.

23
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's been playing with his temper every day.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Even his temper has been falling apart.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm listening. You can continue.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Can you help us?

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
From now on, I will sincerely be your wife.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
As long as you can help us get through this difficulty.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Interesting. Really interesting.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But we have to talk about the future first.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Isn't that right?

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Aren't you curious about why your parents will agree to the marriage?

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I spent a lot of money on it.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Mother, why are you here?

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Your mother's transaction is different from yours.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
She just wants to see the world with you.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then she wants to take me away from the high-ranking consort.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm very interested in your transaction.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So I need to think about it.

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Shameless.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mother.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look at Meiming. I admit that

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
as a partner, I've done a good job.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I'm not wrong about this transaction.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But I, Liu Ji,

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
will never be ashamed of being unworthy.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I'm here to return this transaction to you.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Meiming.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I've spent my whole life on her.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I think it's over.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can help me this time.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Mother.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you know what you're talking about?

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're selling your house for money and your daughter?

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why are you so afraid of me?

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Miss Han, how are you?

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Greetings, My Lord.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,760
What is your son?

59
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,860
Will I店 you in his q議?

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,480
Ok

61
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,220
Is it really his daughter?

62
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,800
What are you栆thinking about?

63
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,460
Marquis Manual

64
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,600
Between you and my parents

65
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
Did something go wrong?

66
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,960
All immoral and pupil

67
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,600
until I was able to get the title of Marquis of Huanxiang.

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,200
Just now, I knew that your father and your mother had already married.

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:30,400
But unfortunately, I have no grudge against your mother.

70
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
I almost forgot the main thing.

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,800
I came here to change Mu Yu's place from Tianxiang to here.

72
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,200
I'm very capable of fighting with Fang Xian.

73
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
It's not all for you.

74
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Tianxiang is so experienced recently.

75
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,400
There can't be any difference between Mu Yu and the people in front of him.

76
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Otherwise, I will kill him.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Just kidding. Get ready.

78
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Just kidding.

79
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
Why would there be a weapon when I'm just kidding?

80
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Mei Ming?

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Mei Ming.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mei Ming.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Mei Ming.

84
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,200
What's wrong? Are you okay?

85
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm fine.

86
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,000
Brother-in-law, take me to see my sister.

87
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,400
I didn't expect Second Mother would do such a thing.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sister, I always thought that as long as I hold the power in my hands,

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,400
I can do nothing.

90
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,000
But seeing how Father and Mother are now, I feel so terrible.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,700
What do you want to do now?

92
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,300
I'm not as simple as we thought.

93
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,400
If Mother continues like this, I'm sure that even the bones and the claws won't be left.

94
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,800
Sister, I need your help.

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Okay.

96
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,800
But you have to listen to me.

97
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Madam.

98
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Promise me your money.

99
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Are you in a hurry to cure me?

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,400
I'll listen to you now.

101
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
I'm worried that Mei Ming will tell us about our matters.

102
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,000
If I don't leave, I won't be able to eat and walk.

103
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,200
So Madam, you want me to serve you well today, right?

104
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,400
What are you talking about?

105
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,200
I can serve you too.

106
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,000
As long as you promise to take me away.

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,600
You're here!

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,200
We've already worked with Tian Xiang Chi.

109
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,800
We've dug a well and brought the hot spring water from the mountain.

110
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,000
If we come here one day, we might not be able to distribute the hot spring water from a bathhouse.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But the hot spring water from the mountain.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I heard that the hot spring water has been on fire lately.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's okay.

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Before, we all took care of each other.

115
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,600
If everyone is willing to take care of each other,

116
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I'll take care of you.

117
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,000
If everyone believes in me, I'll take care of you.

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,400
After all, I've already taken care of you.

119
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,600
Then, I can't just leave you alone.

120
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Let's continue.

121
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
Let's go.

122
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Let's go.

123
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's go.

124
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
Look at the sky.

125
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,600
Young Master and them are almost here.

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
I, Tang Tang, have been leading the general's office.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
How dare to do such a trivial matter?

128
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,800
I must let Young Master marry me.

129
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
I see.

130
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,800
So, Young Master and General Ying Shao

131
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,600
will also be leading the general's office because of Yue Feng.

132
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,800
I was thinking about solving the case of Liu Jitong.

133
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,400
I didn't expect you two to come here on your own.

134
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,800
General Feng, you must stay alive today.

135
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,200
General,

136
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Feng Qingyang was seriously injured and escaped.

137
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
We hurt several colleagues. We couldn't catch up.

138
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,000
Nonsense!

139
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,000
Continue searching.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Feng Qingyang is the left-wing right-wing of Feng Xian.

141
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,400
I must kill him.

142
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,400
Why didn't we tell Mr. Liu that we're doing this?

143
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Tell him that we're doing this.

144
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm not telling him.

145
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm telling him that we're doing this.

146
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm telling him that we're doing this.

147
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm telling him that we're doing this.

148
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,000
Tell him that we're doing this.

149
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Second Mother, we're here.

150
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Get out of here!

151
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Or else, don't blame me for being impolite!

152
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,400
Second Mother, you're such a big threat.

153
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,800
How could you do such a thing to make Lady Jia pay for your family?

154
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,200
You...

155
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
Get out of here!

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,800
Get out of here!

157
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,000
Get out of here!

158
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,400
What's going on?

159
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
What's going on?

160
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,000
What's going on?

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
What's going on?

162
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Where did Qingyang go?

163
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's go.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
What?

165
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,800
What's going on?

166
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,800
What's going on?
