1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm back to you.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a place called light.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Time is like a diamond, and every moment is engraved in the memory of the past.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The words are engraved in the memory of the past.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm back to you.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There's a place called light.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Time is like a diamond, and every moment is engraved in the memory of the past.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The words are engraved in the memory of the past.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm back to you.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's a place called light.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Time is like a diamond, and every moment is engraved in the memory of the past.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 1

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Where are you?

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Fang Xian!

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Fang Xian!

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I thought I'd never see you again.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't see anyone.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I promise you I'll come back.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll definitely come back.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Li Zhen.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm very happy for that young boy.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,720
You're over the honorary rank of Crown Prince

29
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,000
he had given this 在線邝破マル Bullmet so him.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Live the world to the fullest.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Right, now we're Sang Liu Seven Peas Kang Tian.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Stop that.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
You already passed the audition at the audition.

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,160
What?

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,480
No.

36
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,280
I...

37
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,200
I've been drinking for half a month.

38
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,560
Why are you still drinking?

39
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,720
Lady,

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,840
you were injured last time and you were badly ill.

41
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,240
If you don't take care of yourself,

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,040
you'll regret it in the future.

43
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,320
You can't drink?

44
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,800
You're too bitter.

45
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,600
This medicine

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
can cure the external injuries

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
and protect your wound.

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,440
It won't leave scars.

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,320
What's the matter with leaving scars?

50
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,640
You're still not satisfied?

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,280
Here.

52
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
One more.

53
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,360
One more.

54
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,840
Okay.

55
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,920
Okay.

56
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,520
Lady,

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,800
what's wrong with you?

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,200
Are you still thinking about

59
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
the goods that were taken away?

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,120
Yes.

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,600
It's all because of those bandits who don't speak martial arts.

62
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,560
They're so many people.

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,560
They even attacked me.

64
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,840
Are you okay?

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,240
Look at you.

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,520
You're injured.

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
You're taking care of me.

68
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
In fact,

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,160
these injuries are not a big deal for me.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
Don't comfort me.

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,440
If you didn't go to the hospital,

72
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,320
you wouldn't have to suffer all this.

73
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
I caused you to suffer.

74
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,640
If you suffered a small crime,

75
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,400
you could have a good wife.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,640
Why don't you

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,840
give me a few more times?

78
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,440
Wait.

79
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,960
What?

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,040
A few more times?

81
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,000
Just one wife is not enough.

82
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,920
You want a few more?

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,760
I didn't mean that.

84
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,920
By the way,

85
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
how's Tian Xiangchi recently?

86
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,720
Lady.

87
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,120
Lady,

88
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
I thought you were

89
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,520
a good girl.

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
You scared me.

91
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,160
If you really got on your wife,

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,600
you would be a good girl.

93
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm fine.

94
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, she's fine.

95
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,280
You're really fine.

96
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,280
Don't worry.

97
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
So,

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
did my father give Tian Xiangchi

99
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,480
to Meiming?

100
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,520
I've put the sound

101
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,080
in a safe place.

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
They probably haven't found it yet.

103
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,920
But in the current situation,

104
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,800
even if the sound is in our hands,

105
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,440
it won't be Tian Xiangchi.

106
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,400
It's all my fault that I didn't catch the bandits.

107
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,760
Otherwise, we can find

108
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
the key to the problem.

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,920
Lady, don't worry.

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,640
I've already asked for the shadow fever.

111
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,240
You know the shadow fever?

112
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,280
Master.

113
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,600
Of course I know.

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Don't guess my chair.

115
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Come down here.

116
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,120
Yes, Master.

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm Feng Qingyang.

118
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm here to see you.

119
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,320
Who are you?

120
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,240
I'm the eldest sister.

121
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,120
I don't know you.

122
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,440
I'm Feng Qingyang.

123
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,760
I'm the master of the house.

124
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
I'm the most

125
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,800
good-for-nothing

126
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,120
in the world.

127
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,120
I'm the assistant.

128
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
Where did you go?

129
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,480
Give me the antidote.

130
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,480
Don't tell me

131
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,520
what the time is.

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,120
Master, the time is here.

133
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,440
I brought the antidote for you.

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,160
Don't be anxious.

135
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,120
Where's the antidote?

136
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,560
I'm kidding.

137
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,560
The antidote is here.

138
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,360
You're kidding me again, right?

139
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Master.

140
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,120
The antidote is in a good condition.

141
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
No matter you're a martial artist,

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,200
you still need to

143
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
take care of your health.

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,200
Take the medicine and cure it.

145
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't say that.

146
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
What time is it?

147
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
Where should I go to find the peach blossom?

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,120
Master, you forgot.

149
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,200
This is the mountain of Rong.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,960
The three-year-old three-year-old

151
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,360
three-year-old golden chicken

152
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,560
is served with honey sugar.

153
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,680
It smells good.

154
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,560
It's a good drink.

155
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,680
It's a plum wine.

156
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,840
It's a grape wine.

157
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,360
It's a good drink to get the bamboo charcoal.

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
Master.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,360
You never let me down.

160
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,400
You're so great.

161
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not good at it.

162
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
You're really kidding me.

163
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
The roast chicken is the best drink.

164
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
You can detoxify it.

165
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,280
And you can't eat it.

166
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,080
It's so fragrant.

167
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,080
It's so delicious.

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,720
Master.

169
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,400
As long as you finish this last step,

170
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,040
you can go back to the palace

171
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,880
and take the peach tree.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,440
It's so quiet here.

173
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,760
It's so quiet.

174
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,840
No wonder there's peach blossom here.

175
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,600
You're secretly eating here?

176
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,600
Yang Zi, you're back.

177
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,520
Madam, you came just in time.

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,360
Let's meet next time.

179
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,320
You...

180
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,000
You don't have to tell me about this.

181
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
What do you mean?

182
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Fang Xian, you're hiding something from me.

183
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,400
You're too much.

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,400
How dare I?

185
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
Qing Yang, tell me.

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
It's nothing.

187
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
Yang Zi.

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
You're the hero?

189
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,680
No.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,560
I'm not.

191
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,480
Congratulations to Young Master for recovering your power

192
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,760
and returning to the hero's palace.

193
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,400
I...

194
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,400
Madam lost her word.

195
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Young Master has sent back the news.

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,520
No.

197
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,280
Why didn't you tell me at the beginning?

198
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,520
The hero is sensitive.

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
It's more dangerous to know.

200
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
And I don't know

201
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,080
you're the hero who started the rebellion.

202
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,720
Plus, I'm a martial arts master.

203
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,160
I can't prove it.

204
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm not.

205
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm not.

206
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm not.

207
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,720
I'm not.

208
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,560
I'm not.

209
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,480
I'm not.

210
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,720
I can't prove it.

211
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,280
Why did you deny it?

212
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
I was the one who

213
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,720
took advantage of you.

214
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,880
If I admit it, I'll be ashamed.

215
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,960
What do you want me to say?

216
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,320
You're so stubborn.

217
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,080
I don't know

218
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,840
how you're the hero.

219
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,440
It's not the hero's fault.

220
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,840
Young Master, don't be modest.

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,400
I remember it.

222
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,640
That Yueye.

223
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,360
Young Master, it's late.

224
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
Go to bed early.

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,720
Qingyang, I went down the mountain today.

226
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
I heard that Hu Laoguo's sweet

227
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,240
was taken away by the Mo Ming.

228
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,720
Young Master.

229
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,760
The grandson of the Chen family

230
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,280
died in the battlefield.

231
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,400
Not only did he not only die,

232
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,080
but also escaped from the army.

233
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,800
There's no problem with the world.

234
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,000
Young Master,

235
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,240
do you really want to change the world?

236
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,640
If possible,

237
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,400
that's not bad.

238
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,560
At first, I let Qingyang

239
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,200
work for the Imperial Medical Society

240
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,080
to investigate the intelligence department.

241
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,200
When the reputation is at stake,

242
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Young Master has become

243
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,600
the first killer of the Five Regions.

244
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,400
And I,

245
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,800
I became the leader of the Mo Ming.

246
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,480
When I killed Song Kang,

247
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,360
I heard what you said to him.

248
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
I felt that

249
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,800
you and the one who was in the scene

250
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,160
were so thoughtful.

251
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
It seems that

252
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,400
Ying Yu is really strange.

253
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,680
I hated you so much at that time,

254
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,120
but I couldn't marry you.

255
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,080
I found out the result

256
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,000
and you were the leader.

257
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,320
Maybe

258
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,920
it's not just Ying Yu.

259
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,560
What do you mean?

260
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,200
It seems that you really don't remember.

261
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,320
We met ten years ago.

262
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,360
The King of the Four Seasons, Zhao Baxing

263
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,520
is so kind to his parents.

264
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,960
The King of the Four Seasons, Zhao Baxing

265
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,280
is so kind to his parents.

266
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,040
What are you doing?

267
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
You're bullying our family.

268
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,040
What are you bullying?

269
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,920
Isn't it just to stand by your side?

270
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,920
It's also our family's.

271
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,000
I just don't care about

272
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,160
your bullying Ruoxiao.

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,720
Who dares to bully her in the future?

274
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,040
I'm not done with her.

275
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
I'll take care of you in the future.

276
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,760
Don't be afraid.

277
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,560
Who bullies you? Tell me.

278
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
Who bullies you? Tell me.

279
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,480
My mother said

280
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,440
Fang Xian is a bad person.

281
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,000
He'll kill his parents.

282
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
He'll kill his wife.

283
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,160
It's a useless talk.

284
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,040
When I grow up, I'll marry him.

285
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,040
Let's see if he can kill me.

286
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,280
Miss, it should be a price.

287
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,280
Cut the crap.

288
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,680
I'll marry him if I say so.

289
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
You just wait.

290
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,320
I remember now.

291
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,480
My grandfather took you away.

292
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,280
I've never seen you before.

293
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,840
That's my grandfather.

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,320
I was afraid of you.

295
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,720
I knew

296
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,560
the robbers would protect Ruoxiao

297
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,000
and create a shelter.

298
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,320
You

299
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
wanted to marry me

300
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,040
because of the charge.

301
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,720
No matter how many people are in the middle,

302
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,840
you're the one in the middle.

303
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,360
I'll come to you.

304
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,600
Really?

305
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,720
But

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
you didn't want to agree

307
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,600
on the wedding that day.

308
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,120
I know

309
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,680
you didn't marry me.

310
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,640
If you make a mistake

311
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,760
and I miss you,

312
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

313
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,440
I'll marry you.

314
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,760
I'll marry you.

315
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,040
I'll marry you.

316
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,400
I'll marry you.

317
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,720
I'll marry you.

318
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,040
I'll marry you.

319
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,400
I'll marry you.

320
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,680
I'll marry you.

321
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,080
I'll marry you.

322
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,480
I'll marry you.

323
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
I'll marry you.

324
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,120
I'll marry you.

325
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,520
I'll marry you.

326
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,840
I'll marry you.

327
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120

I'll marry you.

331
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,440
I'll marry you.

332
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,840
I'll marry you.

333
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,040
I'll marry you.

334
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
I'll marry you.

335
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,880
I'll marry you.

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,280
I'll marry you.

337
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,640
I'll marry you.

338
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,120

I'll marry you.

340
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll marry you.

341
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,720
I'll marry you.

342
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,320
I'll marry you.

343
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,720
I'll marry you.
