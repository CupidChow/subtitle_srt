1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't help but think of you in the night wind

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Even if the clouds are vast, the mountains and seas are hard to balance

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The road is hard to cross, the clouds are hard to see

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I meet you, even if there are two thousand years of spring and autumn

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Love is a flower, the paper is like the ink, the paper is like the paper, and the paper is like the paper

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Harder to balance than hard to balance

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I feel a little strange

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you sure that the gold medalist said these?

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Then rub it hard, rub it, and then rub it down

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He said that, and he said it very seriously

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It doesn't look like a nonsense

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can write it on it, but...

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can do it

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This time we can't lose the face of the watchman and the five dynasties

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Must win

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Insurance

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is there a suitable candidate for the recruitment of Ting Yu?

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I guess not

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If there was, that girl would have come to ask for credit

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You don't play hard to get

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Feng I ... Feng Xie

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your hand

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Young Master

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,080
My dear, let me hug you for a while.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,880
Alright.

28
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:37,960
Young Master.

29
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
Your eye shadow...

30
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,240
I'm not a shadow.

31
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,040
I have something more powerful.

32
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,320
Let's go.

33
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,080
Let's go.

34
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
What happened to your clothes?

35
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,560
I drew it last night.

36
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,000
The black eye ring too?

37
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,880
It's normal to have black eye rings at night.

38
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,840
This time, it's important.

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
It's about my life.

40
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
My wife is in a bad mood.

41
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,200
You must help me.

42
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Don't worry, Young Master.

43
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,960
Why are you being so polite?

44
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
It's my honor to help you

45
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,760
with your life.

46
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
What are you waiting for?

47
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,600
Come down.

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,440
We grew up together.

49
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,560
Why are you shy?

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,240
Young Master.

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,440
I lost my tattoo when I was wet.

52
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,000
I want to keep it for a while.

53
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
It looks good after all.

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,280
What do you think?

55
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,560
You're hopeless.

56
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:44,840
Come on.

57
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,720
For today's stone-clad match,

58
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,420
it's inspired by my first skill,

59
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,880
looking down at the guard

60
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,940
from above,

61
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,480
the написore game is about to begin.

62
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,840
States have a great rock-climbing skill.

63
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
Veiling is the first skill.

64
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Same with stone-clad game.

65
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,360
Fingers crossed.

66
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,960
Now, the contestants will come on the stage.

67
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Good!

68
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
Good!

69
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Good!

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Now, I announce that the competition will start!

71
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Daughter, Xianxu,

72
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
are you confident?

73
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
In such a short time,

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,360
have you found a way to deal with Cai Song?

75
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,360
Last night, we were under pressure to find a teacher.

76
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,360
Can we deal with Cai Song?

77
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Today's judge is the one next to me.

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,360
He will decide who is the best.

79
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Now, let's welcome Cai Song!

80
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Good!

81
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Good!

82
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Good!

83
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Why is she kneeling down?

84
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
I'm so tired.

85
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I've never seen this kind of thing before.

86
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
What about you? I've never seen it either.

87
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Cai Song!

88
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
Cai Song, you're so weak.

89
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,360
You're so weak.

90
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Relax.

91
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,360
Can't break it?

92
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
Cai Song,

93
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
you're so weak.

94
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
You're so weak.

95
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Cai Song,

96
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
you're so weak.

97
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Cai Song,

98
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
you're so weak.

99
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Cai Song,

100
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
you're so weak.

101
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Cai Song,

102
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,360
you're so weak.

103
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Cai Song,

104
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
you're so weak.

105
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Cai Song,

106
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
you're so weak.

107
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Cai Song,

108
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
you're so weak.

109
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Cai Song,

110
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
you're so weak.

111
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Good!

112
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Good!

113
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Cai Song's service is over.

114
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Now, it's time for the representative of the Khan to come out!

115
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Good!

116
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Young Master,

117
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
are you looking for me?

118
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Yes, it's your turn to come out.

119
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Leave it to me.

120
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Good!

121
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
Don't worry.

122
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
Are you crazy?

123
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
This is the dark horse master you're looking for.

124
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,360
This is the dark horse master you're looking for.

125
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
You're so thin.

126
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
You're not only a man, but also a man of the public.

127
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
You're not only a man, but also a man of the public.

128
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
You're not even a little bit of a dark horse master.

129
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
Please.

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Lie down.

131
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
My back!

132
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
My back!

133
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
That's right.

134
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
It's a garuda.

135
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
So comfortable!

136
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
So comfortable!

137
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Good!

138
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Good!

139
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,360
That's great!

140
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
These three demons

141
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
have made so many mistakes.

142
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Good!

143
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,360
Now, the martial arts masters

144
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,360
have fallen to the point that they can't even see me anymore.

145
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Interesting.

146
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Really interesting.

147
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I wonder how you rate

148
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,360
the two sides of the service.

149
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
These two

150
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
are both very good at giving me the feeling.

151
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
If you ask me,

152
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I'll give it a score of

153
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
a score of one point.

154
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
Good!

155
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Wait a minute.

156
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
You're not a dark horse master.

157
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
You're looking for a martial arts master

158
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
and you're just a coincidence.

159
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Not every dark horse master

160
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
is a martial arts master.

161
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
This means that as long as we can offer the best service,

162
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
our family is willing to pay more.

163
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
Even if it's to invite a martial arts master.

164
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Just talk.

165
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Good atigh.

166
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
啊

167
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Yes.

168
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
Yes.

169
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
You just gave

170
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
SM assign a delicious dish.

171
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Now!

172
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
a healthful dish.

173
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,380
Easy.

174
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,080
Go, go

175
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
What else?

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,740
There is also something I made

177
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,740
Your contributions are thanks to this

178
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,880
I think it underlying

179
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,560
it owns you

180
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,160
What else?

181
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,200
You, you

182
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,760
put it on.

183
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm leaving.

184
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,960
Sister,

185
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,520
Mei Yuan will definitely lose this time.

186
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,160
What do you think?

187
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,800
Don't worry, mother.

188
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
I've already hired a teacher.

189
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,840
After Fang Xian loses,

190
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,560
I'll find a way to deal with Cai Song.

191
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,560
It's almost the same in theory.

192
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,880
It might not be the right way.
