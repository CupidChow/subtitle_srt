1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't win, you are the wind and rain

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Even if the clouds are vast, the mountains and sea are hard to balance

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The road is hard to cross, the rain is hard to wash

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I meet you, even if there are two thousand seasons, what's the use?

5
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,120
movements of threads

6
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,960
words of mountains and sea

7
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,660
they are all flatter than me

8
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,160
Episode 22

9
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,560
The boat of coupling

10
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,400
on the second day of

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,040
You just left

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,220
You really are one of our brothers

13
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,660
You even chased after me the whole time

14
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,140
Why did you chase me all the way here?

15
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,940
Our boss was killed by you.

16
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,740
Most of my brothers died because of you.

17
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,700
If I didn't kill you,

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
how would we live in the future?

19
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,700
If I kill your boss,

20
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
I can be a hunter of ten assassins

21
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,020
and meet the leader of the camp.

22
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,660
But if you keep being obsessed,

23
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,180
I don't mind sending you to the hell

24
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,460
and continue to be brothers.

25
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,900
So you're not willing to admit it?

26
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,940
I won't say the same thing

27
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,620
a second time.

28
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,660
You're unreasonable.

29
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,060
Boss,

30
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,060
how can you have so many assassins?

31
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,460
I, Ying Shao,

32
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,060
have always been good and evil.

33
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,660
You always dare to kill.

34
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,460
Look at what you've done now.

35
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,660
How can I tolerate you?

36
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,260
I've warned you before.

37
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,660
You insist on killing the innocent.

38
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,660
Don't you think you're

39
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,660
full of blood and blood?

40
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,860
You're not afraid of being punished?

41
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,660
You care so much about me.

42
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
We're assassins.

43
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
You're the only one who wants to

44
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,660
do justice.

45
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,060
Who do you think you are?

46
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,660
You don't know what you're doing.

47
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,060
I'm the leader of the camp.

48
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,660
Those who kill innocent people are rumors.

49
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,660
Do you believe him?

50
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,660
What?

51
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,660
You don't dare?

52
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,660
I'll give you a bowl of noodles.

53
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,660
Kill or escape,

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
it's up to you.

55
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Boss,

56
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,660
hurry up.

57
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,660
Boss, run.

58
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,660
I'm not.

59
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,660
While they don't find out

60
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,660
that I'm so evil,

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,660
go back and take the blood.

62
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,660
You're...

63
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,660
Damn it.

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,660
I haven't seen the leader of the camp.

65
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,660
I'm going to die here.

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,660
Hai Kan, run.

67
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
Miss, you're finally back.

68
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,660
You're back.

69
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Miss, you're finally back.

70
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,660
I'm so worried.

71
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,660
You're worried about

72
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,660
your lady's skills.

73
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
What's there to worry about?

74
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,660
By the way,

75
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,660
do you know

76
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
I met the leader of the camp this time?

77
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,660
It's the rumor

78
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,660
that the long-sleeved

79
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,660

80
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,660
and gentle

81
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
young master

82
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,660
Yao Yan

83
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
Yao Yan

84
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
My lady.

85
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
My lady.

My lady.

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
I'm so worried.

116
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,900
If the girl May be

117
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
a fake,

118
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,660
I'll kill her!

119
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Are you okay?

120
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
My lady.

121
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,660
My lady!

122
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,660
Can I have a look

123
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,660
of your facial systematic?

124
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,660
Wait.

125
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,980
Bo Han Lord tousse

126
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,700
You are the worst

127
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,140
Can't stop

128
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,740
Young master

129
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,500
I did this for your sake

130
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,460
Take this!

131
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,900
I change another grindstone every 20, 30 years.

132
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,420
My stress 느낌 is a little unstable now.

133
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,660
Give me the snack.

134
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,860
These are just rumors.

135
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,220
The Trucks.

136
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,460
They are insolent, big energy master, skillful in hunting.

137
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,660
It's all about the marriage and the marriage.

138
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,460
Those who killed him are the most responsible.

139
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,220
Meiyuan, grandpa is here.

140
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,260
Grandpa is here to ask me to marry him again.

141
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,060
Wait.

142
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,340
Miss, your clothes.

143
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,340
Meiyuan, grandpa is here.

144
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,220
Grandpa, you are here again.

145
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,620
Meiyuan, I tell you.

146
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,620
If you don't get married,

147
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,020
how will people say I'm good?

148
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,420
They say grandpa is a good-for-nothing.

149
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,020
But when we go out,

150
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,820
we can't lift our heads and see people.

151
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,420
I'm still dead.

152
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,220
Where are you going? I haven't finished yet.

153
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,020
Grandpa, I've told you many times.

154
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
I already have someone in my heart.

155
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,020
I must marry him.

156
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,420
Why do you have to force me?

157
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,020
Fine.

158
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
Since you say so,

159
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,820
tell me who he is.

160
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,420
Who is he?

161
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Who is he?

162
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,620
Who is he?

163
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,020
Then I won't say it again.

164
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,820
Every time I ask you, you are always like this.

165
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,220
I think you are sincere.

166
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,820
You are just a good-for-nothing.

167
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,020
You just want your grandpa to be a good-for-nothing.

168
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,220
You are so heartless, right?

169
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,420
What era is this?

170
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,620
You still do the marriage and the marriage.

171
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,220
Can you be mature?

172
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,620
What's wrong with marriage and marriage?

173
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,820
I'm not mature.

174
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,220
Okay, I'll tear it for you now.

175
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,620
My dear.

176
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,220
From this day, I'll think of you.

177
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,620
You said I was living alone.

178
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,020
Grandpa.

179
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,420
Grandpa, come up here.

180
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
I promise you.

181
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,220
Okay?

182
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,220
Okay.

183
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,220
If you don't agree, I won't count.

184
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,820
Oh, my.

185
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,420
Oh, my.

186
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,020
It's better to be a man than a woman.

187
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,020
I'll count it.

188
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,220
Today is the day of the emperor.

189
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,220
You're counting it now?

190
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
Yes.

191
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,620
Grandpa, can you stop joking?

192
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,420
Joking?

193
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,220
Oh, my.

194
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,420
Do you think I'm joking?

195
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,420
Come on, change my clothes.

196
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,420
Stop, I'll change it myself.

197
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,020
What did Qingyou do to me?

198
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,620
Why is my martial arts gone?

199
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,220
You're Fang Xian, right?

200
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,020
What are you doing?

201
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
I'm...

202
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,220
Don't be nervous.

203
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,220
I'm not a good person.

204
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,820
I'm not a bad person.

205
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
I'm not a bad person.

206
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,020
I just want to marry you.

207
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,420
With you?

208
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,420
Brother.

209
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
With me?

210
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,420
Come on, change your clothes.

211
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,820
I know that the eyes are burning and the eyes are burning.

212
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,420
Why do you still dare to fight with them?

213
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,020
Isn't this the old man's wish for nothing?

214
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,220
You know me.

215
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,820
Even if you give me two lives,

216
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
I don't dare to have anything to do with a young man.

217
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Right?

218
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,020
Tianxin, don't worry.

219
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,220
You're marrying my daughter, not me.

220
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,820
Brother, it's not necessary.

221
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,020
Your daughter is a mother tiger.

222
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,420
She wants to tie me down to get married.

223
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,620
What's your name, brother?

224
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,020
Call me father-in-law.

225
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,220
You're busy at the meeting.

226
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,420
You're busy every day.

227
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,820
I have no choice but to make a plan.

228
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Otherwise, when will you and my daughter get married?

229
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,020
Right?

230
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,220
I won't marry her.

231
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
I won't marry her.

232
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,420
I said I won't marry her.

233
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,220
I won't marry her.

234
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,620
I said I won't marry her.

235
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,820
Aren't you tired?

236
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,820
Put me down.

237
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,620
Come on.

238
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,020
Is this the so-called heir of the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce?

239
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,020
It doesn't look like him.

240
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,620
It's right.

241
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,020
It's better to be an ordinary person.

242
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,420
Don't give me trouble.

243
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,620
Don't think too much.

244
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,620
You let me marry you

245
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,420
just for the sake of the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce.

246
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,620
I've long been a boundary with the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce.

247
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,820
The Jinyi Chamber of Commerce is rich in talent.

248
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,420
You actually took the initiative to make a boundary with them.

249
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,820
It's just a comparison of each other.

250
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,220
The structure of the chicken and the dog is big.

251
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,620
The collusion in the dark and the dog is shallow.

252
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,820
Even the abuse of the bear is fierce.

253
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,020
It's not a Jinyi Chamber of Commerce.

254
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
It's a good comparison.

255
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,220
You're really my son-in-law.

256
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,220
Welcome the bride.

257
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,420
You think I'm good?

258
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,620
I can destroy my own image.

259
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,420
Wait.

260
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,020
You're so anxious to let me in.

261
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,820
This bride must be a super monster.

262
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,420
I've made it clear to you.

263
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,820
I, Fang Xian, have many beautiful women.

264
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,220
If your lady doesn't agree with me,

265
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,620
I'd rather marry a maid.

266
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,420
You're so ridiculous.

267
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,820
My lady asked me to do it.

268
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,820
Why is it you?

269
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,420
Boss, run.

270
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,820
I'm not.

271
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,220
Aren't you the owner?

272
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
I'm Xiao Xu.

273
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,820
Greetings, grandfather, father-in-law and mother-in-law.

274
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Please accept my respect.

275
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,420
I won't punish you

276
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,020
for being a shallow and ungraceful person like you.

277
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,820
What are you doing?

278
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,420
Si Lang.

279
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,620
It's just an accident.

280
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,820
You made me fall.

281
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,620
What's an accident?

282
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,420
You just keep your heart.

283
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,620
No, I just want to catch you.

284
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,820
What's going on?

285
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,620
Now that it's done,

286
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,420
don't go back on your word.

287
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,020
I'll go back on my word.

288
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,820
I'll go back on my word.

289
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,420
I'll go back on my word.

290
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,020
I'll go back on my word.

291
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,420
I'll go back on my word.

292
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,020
I'll go back on my word.

293
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,020
I heard that

294
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,220
Fang Xian is willing to do it.

295
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,820
Then I'll ask again.

296
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,820
Do you want to do it?

297
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,020
I don't.

298
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
I don't.

299
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,820
No.

300
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,220
You should change it back.

301
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,420
Maybe I can only do it with a smile.

302
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,620
You still want to take advantage of me, right?

303
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,420
I don't.

304
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,020
What are you doing?

305
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,220
Where are you touching?

306
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,220
Congratulations.

307
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,620
Congratulations.

308
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,420
Come on, give me a hug.

309
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,020
Thank you.

310
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,020
Thank you, everyone.

311
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,420
Eat well and drink well.

312
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
I'm so sorry.

313
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,020
I'm so sorry.

314
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,220
Eat well and drink well.

315
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,220
Miss, wait for me.

316
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,020
I'm a little anxious.

317
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,820
Everyone, be happy.

318
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,020
Eat well and drink well.

319
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
Good.

320
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Come on.

321
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Say it.

322
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,020
How can I change it back?

323
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,820
I'm also a bit confused.

324
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,620
I'm afraid I'll have to kiss you again.

325
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,820
Kiss again?

326
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Come on, my wife.

327
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,020
Close your eyes.

328
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,420
Don't move.

329
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,820
Don't move.

330
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
I kiss myself.

331
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,220
I kiss myself.

332
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
I can do it.

333
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,020
You don't, don't, don't, don't, don't come near me.

334
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Hurry up and get up.

335
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,820
I don't want to marry.

336
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
I want to get married.

337
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
I want to get married.

338
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
I want to get married.

339
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
I want to get married.

340
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
I want to get married.

341
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,020
I want to get married.

342
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,020
I want to get married.

343
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,020
I want to get married.

344
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
I want to get married.

345
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
I want to get married.

346
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
I want to get married.

347
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
I want to get married.

348
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
I want to get married.

349
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
I want to get married.

350
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,020
I want to get married.

351
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
I want to get married.

352
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,020
I want to get married.

353
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,020
I want to get married.

354
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,020
I want to get married.

355
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,020
I want to get married.

356
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,020
I want to get married.

357
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,020
I want to get married.

358
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,020
I want to get married.

359
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
I want to get married.

360
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,020
I want to get married.

361
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
I want to get married.

362
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
I want to get married.
