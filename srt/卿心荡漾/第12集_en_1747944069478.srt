1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've been thinking about you since I was little.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've been in the dark of the night.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a little light in the darkness.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Time is like a true love.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Every moment is engraved in the memories.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The memory is engraved in the memory.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The clouds and the light, the mountains and the sea are hard to control.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The road is rough and the heart is hard to overcome.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I feel like I've met you, even if there are two thousand songs, why are you so stubborn?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Love is a piece of paper, please don't mention it.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 1

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 1

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 1

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You guys are still here to steal the money?

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Today, I'm going to kick you out of the car!

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you doing?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The water is already cold.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you still have the courage to kill?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Brother Feng Xian, Xiaolian was ill last night.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
We just wanted to give Xiaolian some water to cure him.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You saved the people and saved the seven realms of the world.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Even if you are a crazy person, you can't just die and not save them.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Give them water?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Who can save us if the top is blamed?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When the people are gone,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I wonder when they will die in the middle of the city.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What's the point of being here?

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We have our identity and our identity.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When will we have our identity and our identity?

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
As officials, you don't even know what's going on.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You...

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're not worthy of being here.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You guys, get up!

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I didn't hurt you.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm not good at fighting.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm not afraid of hurting my life.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can fight too, my lady.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Miss, something happened.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Song Kang! Song Kang!

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miss Mei Yuan, we don't have a married couple.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You broke into the room when I was in the prison.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Song Kang, you let the officials seal off the water well in the city.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now you're in the family.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You even sealed off the well in the city.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You guys, now, you're in charge of the prison.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's the big deal?

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How can the water used in the prison be a part of the people?

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nonsense.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
No matter how much you're proud of yourself,

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you shouldn't be so arrogant.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Before...

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Before the memorial...

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Before, it was because they didn't respect His Majesty.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
As a new minister, I have to be responsible.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And I don't have many ministers.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I just sealed off the well in the city.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And I didn't seal off the well outside the city.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
As a minister,

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
aren't you afraid that the court will know you're doing this?

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Aren't you afraid of being killed?

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You really think that the ministers in the court will think for the people?

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I thought you businessmen have long seen the benefits of the red dust.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I didn't expect that.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You're so naive.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's meaningless. Let's go.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sit down if you want to.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Everyone,

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we will never sacrifice our lives to make a living.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
From now on,

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
we will stop the whole business of Tianxiang Temple.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We will open all the water sources in Tianxiang Temple

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and get water for the villagers.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My husband means what I mean.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Xilu, put the water in the water.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I finally got the water outside the city.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's so embarrassing.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's so embarrassing.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's so embarrassing.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's so embarrassing.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's so embarrassing.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But don't blame me for not reminding you.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No matter how much you hurt,

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
you're not ordinary businessmen.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You won't open the well all day.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I hope you know how much damage you will have.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think you can be a good businesswoman.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's been a few days.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's worse than before.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Meiyuan, if you keep doing this,

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Tianxiang Temple will be in trouble.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're a good businessman.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're buying the whole family for your business.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I've never seen myself

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
being so rational and righteous

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
when I'm with others.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tianxiang Temple is so dangerous.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've collected several properties

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
when Tianxiang Temple was in power.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'll sell them out.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What's the loss?

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Look, Meiyuan,

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
if you're willing to be a hero,

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you can do it.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're not a businessman.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Stop arguing.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Meiyuan, you're right.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Tingyu.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Tingyu.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Go.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Open the well.

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I...

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Go.

124
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Dad,

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm the one responsible for Tianxiang Temple.

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're responsible for it.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You said it.

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm your dad.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm ordering you now.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Who's your dad?

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm your dad.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You're my dad.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Listen to me.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Who can have the seal of the watchman?

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Who can control everything in Tianxiang Temple?

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is the rule set by the ancestors.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're my children.

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It seems that the drug lord is helping us.

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's go.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The second Young Mistress seems fair.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,900
Young Master Liu?..

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Young Master Lang...

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are so generous again.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Didn't I tell you that if you have a way to deal with my sister,

145
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will agree to this marriage.

146
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is the share of this world enough?

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is it not high enough?

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You actually have the ability to like Da Si Li?

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't like him.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He is just a little bit too much.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Now I can see that your father has a point of view on Meiyuan.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
When Tian Xiangchi's son is in a hurry to give up,

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
no one can protect his promise.

154
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So when will you think about the marriage?

155
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is just the beginning.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I want you to have a peaceful day.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,500
A Day theőoke

158
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,000
Day theőoke

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The first day of the marriage

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Songkang Da Si Li

161
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,220
Was sent to the North governments посмотр storm

162
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
It did not belong to the people over 20-years-old For good reasons

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hope someone can handle this matter

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because the Shiative points,

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
where need beories are arranged

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Look, lowosenance line.

167
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,780
What, you can't touchthat, isn't that bad?

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
Your Highness.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,760
My dear,

170
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
don't blame me.

171
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,520
I'll go out for a while.

172
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,560
Wait for me in the mansion.

173
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,200
What's this?

174
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,840
I know.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,960
Does the Shadow Master want to go out by himself?

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
I've given my chance

177
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,920
to launch this mission.

178
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,880
Then I'll use my best way

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,880
to solve this matter.

180
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
Yes, I'll do it.

181
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,880
My dear.

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,960
My dear.

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,920
My dear.

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,960
My dear.

185
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,160
My dear.

186
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,560
I know I've been doing well recently.

187
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
But I have to give you a reward.

188
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
Can you tell me in advance?

189
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,920
Let me prepare.

190
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,240
Actually, I can kiss you better.

191
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,000
What?

192
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,440
I didn't mean that.

193
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
I just want to go out with you.

194
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
You...

195
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,000
Have a good rest. Don't be scared.

196
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,400
Thank you, let's go.

197
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
Didn't I see you off?

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're a ghost.

199
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,360
Attention, everyone.

200
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,440
The coffin is closed.

201
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,760
You're Fang Xian?

202
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
You're talking about the Kanchai Faction.

203
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,400
Fang Xian?

204
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,000
Which Fang Xian can you still have?

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,600
Come on, let's go.

206
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,440
I see.

207
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,600
When did you say that?

208
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,440
You're talking about the Kanchai Faction.

209
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,840
But that one is a colorless fairy.

210
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,160
She's a beautiful fairy.

211
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,840
She's a fairy of the beauty.

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,640
Fang Xian?

213
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,680
Are you kidding me?

214
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,480
You're pretending to be a ghost.

215
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,640
You're trying to make me lose my life.

216
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,720
I am.

217
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,040
Hurry up and take me away.

218
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,440
I really don't understand.

219
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,160
What charm do you have

220
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,360
that makes the beauty choose you and not me?

221
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,880
Because you're not the same kind of person.

222
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,040
The wife is evil and the husband is a good teacher.

223
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
You're the one who's in charge of the people.

224
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,680
To achieve your goal, you're a blind person.

225
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
You don't need to be a laborer.

226
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,960
What's the point?

227
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,560
Why is Fang Xian here?

228
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,080
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,160
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,120
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
I'm sorry.
