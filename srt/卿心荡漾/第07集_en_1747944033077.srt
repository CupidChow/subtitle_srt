00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The ill goodbye birds Good-bye

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Your laugh parties Girl that can give you the shower

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:23,540

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ah

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:42,200

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,080

I want to live well.

16
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,860
Brother Li.

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,220
What?

18
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,440
Do you know

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,980
what's action is?

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,660
It's proposing marriage counselors and teachers.

21
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,240
I like your mood

22
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:20,580
so much

23
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,480
that you choose a novels for me.

24
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
Are you looking for the servants?

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,340
د

26
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,100
Are you still cold?

27
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,900
Don't look over

28
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,740
Alright

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,680
Good good

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,240
This fish is roasted

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,980
Taste

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,240
Although it doesn't taste very good

33
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,480
But it can replenish your physical order

34
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,440
It's exercise

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,520
Since the fish

36
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,080
AhSí

37
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,220
They all say that you can need slipping stated

38
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
You can't even feed yourself.

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,640
You even gave food to those kids.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,640
What do you think?

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
People are all different.

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,640
If you can only help them

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
by feeding yourself,

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
what is it?

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,640
Although I can do only a few things,

46
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
I won't give up on this.

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,800
Today, you'll never age.

48
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,440
Don't diagnose yourself!

49
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,800
Madam,

50
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,500
How did you know

51
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,100
You have a raw fish.

52
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,740
You can grill it again.

53
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,060
Okay.

54
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,580
I'll grill it for you.

55
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,660
It's useless.

56
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,700
If there's no river here,

57
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
we'll both die here.

58
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,180
You're right.

59
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,100
You've let go.

60
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,300
Why did you jump?

61
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,580
We're not a couple now.

62
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,340
After all, we know each other.

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
I can't watch you

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
take the risk.

65
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
We just know each other?

66
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,100
Or...

67
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,220
Don't look at me.

68
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,220
My dear.

69
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,500
It's great that you're okay.

70
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,020
My dear.

71
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,220
My dear.

72
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,300
What's wrong?

73
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,740
I'm cold.

74
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,020
My dear.

75
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,060
It's okay.

76
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,100
It's okay.

77
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Hold on a little longer.

78
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,740
It'll be fine when the sun goes down.

79
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,860
No!

80
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,740
Just sit.

81
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,620
Hurry.

82
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,860
Hurry.

83
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,660
Gotta get out of here.

84
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,820
What?

85
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,020
Myself.

86
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
What are you doing?

87
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Miss, you insist on going.

88
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,020
I can't stop you.

89
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,020
What should I do now?

90
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Go.

91
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,020
Go to the butler.

92
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Find some strong guards.

93
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
Hurry up.

94
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,020
Yes.

95
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
Fang Xian.

96
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
You're getting bolder and bolder.

97
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,020
How dare you hit me?

98
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
Let go of my arm.

99
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,020
Fang Xian.

100
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,020
Fang Xian, what's wrong?

101
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
Wake up.

102
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
I can't.

103
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Come on.

104
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,020
Why can't I change it?

105
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,020
Didn't Yi Qing change it before?

106
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,760
I've been thinking of you as a relative,

107
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,500
but I'm worried that we're hopeless,

108
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,540
and that we won't have a lot of time.

109
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,720
How happy do you seem?

110
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,360
She can't fall in love.

111
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,020
Then,

112
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,460
don't tell me you don't love her.

113
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,780
Do you really think you can't love her more than half your life?

114
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,020
You're my Ali.

115
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,800
I'll date you for all my life.

116
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,780
If you were angry with me

118
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,020
and treated you badly,

119
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,940
I'd accept it.

120
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,340
But you have to wake up

121
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,420
and give me a chance to apologize.

122
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,100
I'm begging you.

123
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
You can't do this.

124
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,420
You can't do this.

125
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,540
You have to be with me all the time.

126
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,540
Let me get used to you being so nice to me

127
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,940
and then leave me, Fang Xian.

128
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,300
But...

129
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,540
Is there anyone who can save him?

130
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,740
Is there anyone who can save him?

131
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,020
Don't cry, my wife.

132
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,020
Fang Xian.

133
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,780
Fang Xian, you're awake.

134
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,460
I'll protect you this time.

135
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,740
I'll take you home.

136
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,660
Fang Xian, hang in there.

137
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,820
We'll be there soon.

138
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,220
Fang Xian.

139
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,020
Fang Xian.

140
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,540
Fang Xian, are you okay?

141
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,060
Fang Xian.

142
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,860
Fang Xian.

143
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,860
Fang Xian, wake up.

144
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,580
Wake up.

145
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,380
Fang Xian, I'm begging you.

146
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,460
Wake up.

147
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,420
If you don't wake up,

148
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,180
I really don't know what to do.

149
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,580
I'm begging you.

150
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,340
Water.

151
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,620
Water.

152
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,580
What did you say?

153
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,580
Water.

154
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,660
Water.

155
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,540
Wait.

156
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,780
Water.

157
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,820
My wife.

158
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:49,940
Are you okay?

159
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,700
You're still worried about me?

160
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,460
I've brought you trouble this time.

162
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,140
Don't say that.

163
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,620
Have a good rest.

164
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,540
My wife, can you still care about me when you're in water?

165
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,620
The End

166
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,060
Master, don't worry.

167
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,660
I've informed Master.

168
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,500
You didn't sleep all night.

169
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,140
I don't have time to sleep.

170
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,060
How can I sleep if I don't see them coming back?

171
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,340
Although that's true,

172
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,660
if you fall down,

173
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,180
it won't be easy for the lady to come back.

174
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,620
You're talking like your lady.

175
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,980
Father.

176
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,740
It's good that you're okay.

177
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Don't worry.

178
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,940
You must be the one who's in danger.

179
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,060
Father, actually, this time...

180
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,380
My good son-in-law, don't be modest.

181
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,500
Come on.

182
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,780
I'll eat something delicious with you.

183
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,460
Father, wait.

184
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,220
Let's go.

185
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,380
Father, I'm in danger too.

186
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,700
Why don't you comfort me?

187
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,460
Lady, are you okay?

188
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,340
Are you sure you're going?

189
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,580
Good.

190
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,740
After all,

191
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,540
it's very inconvenient for me to stay in the house.

192
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,980
The weather also isn't badly affected today.
