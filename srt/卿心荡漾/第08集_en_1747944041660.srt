1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Since then, I've been wandering in the dark night.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's a light of the night.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Time is passing by,

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
every morning and night,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the memories are engraved deep in my heart.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The night is gone,

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the trees are gone,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it's you.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How many years have I been wandering?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can't see you.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The night is gone, it's you.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Even if the clouds are vast,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
the mountains and seas are hard to stop.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Even if the mountains and seas are hard to stop,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,800
There is no way to stop again.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,800
DrAfter, when will Grandpa wake up?

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
I'll rest for a few more days.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,160
Oh, my lord.

26
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,800
Grandpa.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,080
Oh, my god.

28
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Grandpa.

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,600
Feng Xian, you're back.

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Oh, my god.

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,200
Grandpa.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,800
Since my lord is recovered,

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,400
I'll leave now.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
Go and see him off.

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Be careful.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't see me off.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Grandpa, are you really okay?

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm fine.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
I know my body best.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,200
Feng Xian, you...

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,800
You've lost weight.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,200
You saved my life this time.

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
I know.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,800
We owe you a lot.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Don't go out and get sunburned.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Come back.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
As for the repair,

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
you can rest assured.

49
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
As long as I don't nod,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
no one will do anything.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Grandpa...

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Don't play this trick on me.

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Listen,

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
you don't want to stay at home, right?

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,400
If you can't make a thousand taels of gold,

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
don't go out and get sunburned.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Okay.

58
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,600
How dare you say that?

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,400
You think I don't know?

60
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
You're always thinking about

61
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,800
where to go with the hostess.

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm telling you, it's impossible.

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,200
I'm the one you love.

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,600
Come on.

65
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,200
Let's go out for dinner.

66
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
So, my wife and I...

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
Let's go.

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,980
Let's go to the

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
home.

70
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
Don't go.

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
If anyone bullies you,

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,400
I'll help you.

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I didn't expect

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
the hostess to really get the medicine.

75
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
The old man

76
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
must be more biased towards the hostess.

77
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Grandpa got the medicine

78
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,000
by looking at the beauty.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,200
It's a matter of life and death.

80
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
Don't talk nonsense.

81
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,400
This lady has good taste.

82
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,000
This piece of jade is a top-class item.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
It can be used for long-term treatment

84
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,400
to nourish people and heal people.

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,600
So,

86
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
it's good for grandpa's illness.

87
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,000
But this color...

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,800
If you don't know the problem,

89
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
don't talk nonsense here.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
What's your attitude?

91
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,200
Do you know who our lady is?

92
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,800
Do you know who our boss is?

93
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,200
Our shop is everywhere.

94
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,600
I've seen people like you

95
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,800
who don't know how to pretend to know

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,200
and want to suppress the price.

97
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,000
You...

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How dare a small shop

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
do such a big thing?

100
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,200
Second Young Master.

101
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,000
It seems that the management of the Liu family

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,400
in Runzhou is not small.

103
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Second Young Master, why are you here?

104
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
This is the second lady of the Kan family in Taizhou.

105
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
You can just leave the post

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
if you don't know Taishan.

107
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
You still use the name of our Liu family.

108
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Second Young Master, I was wrong.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,200
This is a misunderstanding.

110
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,800
Miss Mei Ming, please forgive me.

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,200
I'm sorry for being rude.

112
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Whatever you like today,

114
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
it's all mine.

115
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
It's not a coincidence.

116
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
I don't like

117
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
anything in your shop.

118
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,600
You're really personality-oriented.

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
Miss Mei Ming,

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,200
we'll see you later.

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,000
Fortunately, the old man is fine this time.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Otherwise,

123
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,800
something big will happen to the Kan family.

124
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Master, someone sent a invitation

125
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
to visit you.

126
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,200
Please come in.

127
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

128
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,000
Master, Madam, Miss,

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
I'm sorry for being rude.

130
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,600
You're from the Liu family?

131
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm here to propose a marriage.

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,200
I hope I can marry into the Kan family

133
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
and become your husband.

134
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
You're being modest.

135
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
The Liu family of Runzhou is marrying into our family.

136
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Master Liu,

137
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
I'm sorry for being rude.

138
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
Please don't be angry.

143
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,600
Master Liu,

144
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,400
we can't afford to see you.

145
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,800
Please go back.

146
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,800
Madam,

147
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't do it.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,400
My waist is broken for the first time.

149
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
It's broken again.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Madam,

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,400
I can't do it fast.

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,000
I think

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
it's better to do it gradually.

154
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,200
Alright.

155
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Actually, I'm doing this for your own good.

156
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,800
You can learn some martial arts.

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
You can strengthen your body and body.

158
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
You can also help with your body.

159
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,400
It's great.

160
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
You're right.

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,200
I'll pay attention to you in the future.

162
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,800
You're getting bolder and bolder.

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,600
You can get close to me at will.

164
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Madam, you're not bad either.

165
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
I...

166
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I didn't mean that.

167
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,000
I...

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,600
I did it to prevent you from touching me

169
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,000
and preventing you from getting close to me.

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,400
Your smartness is always used in weird places.

171
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Shut up.

172
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
But what grandpa said is right.

173
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,200
This time, it's all thanks to you.

174
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
I'm grateful for everything.

175
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,200
It's time to reward you.

176
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,400
Madam, don't.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,600
I...

178
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not ready yet.

179
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Madam, that's it?

180
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
You're still considerate to me.

181
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,400
Do you still like me more?

182
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
When will I have a good day?

183
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,800
Madam.

184
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
Madam.

185
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
We didn't even talk to each other well

186
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
after that farewell.

187
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
We really did neglect your family.

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,800
No.

189
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,400
I still need you to help me out.

190
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I neglected you.

191
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you talking about?

192
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm grateful to you

193
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
for giving me such a good opportunity

194
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I'll make it up to you.

195
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
Ying Zhu, are you joking with me?

196
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
I never joke with beauties.

197
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
No!

198
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Feng Xie?

199
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Explain to me what's going on!

200
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I...

201
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm just kidding!

202
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,800
You brat! Don't run!

203
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I'll teach you a good lesson today!

204
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Stop! Don't run!

205
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Miss!

206
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Miss!

207
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
What's up?

208
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
Are you thinking about Mr. Gu again?

209
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
You've been getting closer recently.

210
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
When are you going to cook the rice?

211
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Do you know how to use idioms?

212
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
What do you mean?

213
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Stop talking nonsense!

214
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,800
Go find someone to ask Mr. Gu to come back and order.

215
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I should be taking a bath now.

216
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I'm here to inspect the pond.

217
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
What's so strange about getting closer?

218
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Miss.

219
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
How did it work this quickly?

220
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Ha?

221
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Shuipeng Pond

222
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,440
I...

223
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,800
We're a couple.

224
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,480
Why didn't you come in and have a good time?

225
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,240
The memory of every morning and evening

226
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,520
is engraved in my heart.

227
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,400
The night is dark and the moon is dark.

228
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,720
I want to remember you.

229
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,240
I can't forget you.

230
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,240
You are in the wind and in the night.

231
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,440
Even if the clouds are vast,

232
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
the mountains and seas are hard to stop.

233
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,960
I can only see you in the road.

234
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,400
I meet you.

235
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,280
Even if we are far apart,

236
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,920
we will never be apart.

237
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,840
The flowers are all over the ground.

238
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,240
I can only see you.

239
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
It's hard to stop.

240
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
Don't worry, young master.

241
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,640
We've packed the place today.

242
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,680
No one will hear us.

243
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
Okay.

244
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,520
I've already entered Taizhou as a new person.

245
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,640
No one will find you.

246
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,320
I saw what happened a few days ago.

247
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,880
A large number of people went to Rong Mountain.

248
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,320
But recently,

249
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
it's normal.

250
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,520
Since it's normal,

251
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,560
there's no need to worry.

252
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,280
I have to say that

253
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,960
the Kan family did a good job

254
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,760
in the Tianxiang Pool.

255
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,520
Tianxiang Pool is good in every aspect.

256
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,640
But the massage

257
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,760
is really hard to do.

258
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
Since we are ready,

259
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,640
let's get ready to act.

260
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,480
Yes.

261
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,480
Anyway,

262
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,400
I want the Kan family to jump around

263
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,920
and give the token

264
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,680
of Jinyi pageant subtly.
