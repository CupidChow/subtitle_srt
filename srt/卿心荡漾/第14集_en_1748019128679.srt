1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm thinking about you, and I'm going back to my place.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a place called the light.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Time is passing by, and every moment is in the memory of the past.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The words are engraved on the back of my mind.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's you.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:12,160
You are the one who saved and

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,420
have championed in the end of their 이제.

11
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:53,300
But it has protein sugar and helps prevent the Uhrji- Alice Light well with breathing.

12
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,160
I bought three packs of discourages.

13
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,460
One size added to a District 10 packet of peach.

14
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,080
And the rest goes into astoppable product.

15
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:12,820
Well, have three of us do the next batch from this method.

16
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,180
Go ahead.

17
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,700
What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,860
What did I do wrong?

19
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,860
Why do you keep calling me idol?

20
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,980
You're not wrong.

21
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,500
How can you be wrong?

22
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,460
If I hadn't been standing on your body

23
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,100
and walked out, I wouldn't know.

24
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,900
You're so popular.

25
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,180
And someone calls you idol.

26
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,700
No, I don't understand what you're talking about.

27
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,260
Are you still pretending to be stupid?

28
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,340
I'll go get you some tea.

29
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,660
You're really here?

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,260
Master, idol, you...

31
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,620
Why are you here?

32
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,460
Don't talk nonsense.

33
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,180
Why are you here?

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Fang Xing, come here.

35
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,660
Why did you come to Taizhou?

36
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,860
It turns out that you've already had some kind of record.

37
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,060
I thought I was the one who...

38
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,100
Don't talk nonsense.

39
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,220
Don't expose my identity.

40
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,740
I'm telling you,

41
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,500
Fang Xing is my idol.

42
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,780
I'm not your idol.

43
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,060
I'm not your idol.

44
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,900
I'm telling you,

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,060
Fang Xing is my idol.

46
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,500
He's our family's fan.

47
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,580
Why do you want Fang Xing to be a fan?

48
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,740
He's married into our family.

49
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,980
He's our family's fan.

50
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,140
He's always been in your hands.

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,780
What's wrong with him?

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,820
What does it have to do with you?

53
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,060
We don't eat such food.

54
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,420
He doesn't love you at all.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,060
You're bullying me.

56
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,620
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,740
If you love Fang Xing,

58
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,260
why would you let him be a fan?

59
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,260
Why don't you love him?

60
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,460
You can go.

61
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,260
I've already been in the family.

62
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,500
I was born to be your wife.

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm your ghost.

64
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,180
I know you must have a lot of grievances in your heart.

65
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,780
I'll come back to you.

66
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,580
My dear.

67
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,380
Do you have a lot of grievances in your heart?

68
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,260
No.

69
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,660
He's still here to see you?

70
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,380
No.

71
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,660
He'll scare me later.

72
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,580
I didn't...

73
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,220
My dear.

74
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,420
No.

75
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,660
Didn't you just say you love me?

76
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,580
This kind ofND is something else.

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,860
Who's involved?

78
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,660
It's me!

79
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,620
I thought you were someone special.

80
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,500
I just cooperated some efforts.

81
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,300
I didn't know he only liked me.

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,700
You cooperate some work.

83
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,780
What are you cooperation?

84
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,260
I don't want my love to be ashamed.

85
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,980
Why would you be angry?

86
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,460
Please think about your own problems.

87
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,260
I...

88
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,660
Yiming, I don't feel wronged.

89
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,060
Nor regret.

90
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,260
And I don't know your feelings for me.

91
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
You heard that?

92
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,460
Now it's your turn to hate.

93
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,460
Fang Xing, I understand.

94
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,660
You must have a secret weapon

95
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,460
in your hands.

96
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,460
I will definitely save you from the Kangzhi.

97
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
What do you want?

98
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Let's go home.

99
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,460
Thank you.

100
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,860
Miss, what a great sword.

101
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,260
This jade pendant is yours.

102
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,860
Give it to that young master.

103
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,460
I hope he can understand my feelings.

104
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,460
Okay.

105
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,060
What do you want?

106
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,460
How do you know this jade pendant is yours?

107
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,860
Hold it.

108
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,660
I know.

109
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,060
If you want me to be lucky,

110
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,860
just take it.

111
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,660
Good.

112
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,260
Good.

113
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,260
How is it? Did you admit defeat?

114
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,860
Okay.

115
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,060
I can feel your determination from your sword.

116
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,460
I know you really love each other.

117
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,660
Since you are so wise,

118
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,260
you are a good woman.

119
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,460
Of course. I'm never a womanizer.

120
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,660
Since I didn't steal your heart,

121
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,060
I'm willing to do it.

122
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,260
You are so beautiful.

123
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Fang Xing is a liar.

124
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,860
How can you be so mean?

125
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,060
Then treat me well.

126
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,660
Otherwise,

127
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,060
Xiaoxin will be mine next time.

128
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,260
Yang Zi'an, don't be angry.

129
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,660
You know now?

130
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,260
Lin Wan is her own idea.

131
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,060
I'm going to be your friend.

132
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,260
Lin Wan is a single-minded person.

133
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,460
Who knows if you have any other crazy ideas?

134
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,860
How can I have any crazy ideas?

135
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,660
Do I have such a strong heart in the eyes of a woman?

136
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,260
Why not?

137
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,460
You used those tricks on me.

138
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,260
Who knows if others will like me.

139
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,060
Yang Zi.

140
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,660
You are too much.

141
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,860
You pulled me down again.

142
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,260
If my tricks are useful,

143
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,660
Yang Zi would have been mine long ago.

144
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,260
He pulled me down.

145
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,660
I'm not that casual.

146
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,660
I'm the same.

147
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Yang Zi is the only one in my heart.

148
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,560
This was the first chance I saw him,

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,060
but he is too shy to try everything on Browntown already.

150
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,260
He was never as happy as he remember.

151
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,260
Then I trucced in Seemsand haven't found a new woman.

152
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
He is too many for his own last location.

153
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,260
How can he be so normal now?

154
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,260
That was the most trusted man in the world.

155
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,860
He is so Very, very tall.

156
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,460
I heard that you are already married.

157
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,560
l'm wattt

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,960
You're such� I've looked in the dark.

159
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,760
I swear to make everything worse...

160
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,120
so I can be safe for now.

161
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,720
Anyway, about Courtesy,

162
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,640
I must look at you from here to gain the respect you deserve.

163
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,120
You've already糒'd enough.

164
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:53,920
Yet you may

165
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,440
face some difficult XYZ days.

166
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
I have something to tell you.

167
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I hope you will remember it.

168
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Since you are my beautiful husband,

169
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,440
you should know how to cherish him.

170
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Okay. From today on,

171
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
I will give you the second grandson

172
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
that I have seen.

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
I hope you two will be happy

174
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,440
and love each other forever.

175
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Thank you for your help.

176
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Hello.

177
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Hurry up.

178
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
What's going on?

179
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
It's all your fault. A man can't ride a horse.

180
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
It's too late to do that.

181
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
You are the wife who doesn't have the strength to drink.

182
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
You have been drinking all day.

183
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
You didn't get the Western Yang wine.

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
So it's still your fault.

185
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Okay. Come down. They are waiting.

186
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Can you help me?

187
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Be a little bit more stable.

188
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
My dear, you are so soft.

189
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
You are really upset.

190
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
How about I change the clothes?

191
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Look at the situation.

192
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

193
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
It's late.

194
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Look at you.

195
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Look at you.

196
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,440
When did you just come back?

197
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I didn't plan to wait for you.

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
I was afraid you would say that.

199
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Don't talk nonsense.

200
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Listen to the words of Fang.

201
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
It's so casual.

202
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
It's not the most important thing.

203
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
My wife didn't understand.

204
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
You are so used to the situation.

205
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
I have always heard that Fang is a man.

206
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I didn't expect that you are so impatient to meet him.

207
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
You are really a man.

208
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
My wife.

209
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
As a wife,

210
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I never care about what kind of attitude Fang Xian has towards me.

211
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
As long as I know that he only cares about me,

212
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
that's good.

213
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Don't use my words.

214
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
How can I see him in the future?

215
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Enough. Enough. Stop arguing.

216
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
What's the point of this?

217
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Brother Feng.

218
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Please give me your instructions in the future.

219
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Sister.

220
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
The front is behind you.

221
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,440
Sorry.

222
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Say it again.

223
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
You...

224
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Marquis Yan Jing is here.

225
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Marquis Yan Jing?

226
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Marquis Yan Jing?

227
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Help me up.

228
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
Marquis, you are so kind to me.

229
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Marquis.

230
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,440
We are waiting for Marquis Gong Hou.

231
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Marquis.

232
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Marquis.

233
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Marquis.
