1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The wind blows, the night falls, and the night returns

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's a ray of light

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Time is like a needle that stitches every morning and night

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The memories engraved deep in my heart

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The eyes are turned back, counting the seconds

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's you

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The wind blows, the night falls, and the night returns

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's you

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind blows, the night falls, and the night returns

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's you

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Even if the clouds are vast, the mountains are hard to reach

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The road is hard to cross, the clouds are hard to cross

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I meet you, even if there are two thousand seasons

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I meet you, even if there are two thousand seasons

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Wind and The Sword

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 16

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Fang Xian, the thing I gave you yesterday, give it back to me.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What is it?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That letter.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Letter?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This one?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What's inside?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't! Give it to me!

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you giving it to me or not?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you giving it to me or not?

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I said I'm not giving it to you.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Give it to me!

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A letter?

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why are you giving me a letter?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If I give you a letter, are you going to give me a letter?

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you?

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not giving it to you.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You're so annoying!

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Fang Xian!

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Grandpa!

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I know you love each other.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But this morning, you were just like this.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Look at you.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Here, take it.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is a divorce letter?

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What does this mean?

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's so obvious!

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you know that your marriage

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
is a promise between me and his grandfather?

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
How can you just say that

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you can divorce me?

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Grandpa, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Don't worry.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I promise I'll give you an explanation.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Mei Yuan!

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I want you to swear in front of me

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that you'll never divorce me!

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I saw you make a vow here today.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You'll never divorce me.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you break it, you'll be punished.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't worry.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Mei Yuan has sworn in front of me.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can just stand there

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and swear in front of me.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If that's the case,

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
don't blame me for being rude.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Aren't they having a good time?

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Young Master, I've been waiting for you for a long time.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Feng Qingyang.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Young Master, I did it for your own good!

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Unlock the antidote! Unlock the antidote!

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Unlock the antidote!

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Young Master, I'm just a pharmacist.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you keep shaking it,

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll break my neck.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's broken.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're even calling yourself a pharmacist.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You even used up my martial arts.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What kind of a ring is this?

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't worry, Young Master.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The time has not yet come.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
When the time comes,

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll definitely give you the antidote.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're just playing around.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Young Master, tell me.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What other side effects do you have

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
besides the use of martial arts?

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I do have some.

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Tell me.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I want to try it out.

96
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can I exchange bodies with you?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Exchange bodies?

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Tell me in detail.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Young Master.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, no, no, no.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Qingyang, don't go!

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
My dear,

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
we've acquired so many storefronts.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What are they for?

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You understand, right?

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Tianxiang Pond has been in a hot business.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a must to expand.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We're expanding?

109
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
To the opposite of Tianxiang Pond?

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How can we lose money like this?

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You don't understand.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm building a workshop.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I want to wake up the people's spirit of martial arts.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Just like that man.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That man?

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Tianyu, wait a minute.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Do you have a crush on him?

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How do you know, Young Master?

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Have you seen him?

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Actually, I've heard from Miss.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's said that that man,

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the good master of Zhang Yi,

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
is a famous and honest man.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm leaving.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then it's not me.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
After all, the inner corner of the outer ship of the hero is a horror.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have to perform well.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Tianxiang Pond

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Tianxiang Pond

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Tianyu,

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
tell me.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The broken shop I spent a lot of money to buy,

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
how did it become like this?

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Miss, I think this kind of shop

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
is necessary to buy with a lot of money.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I want to lose the money.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This...

138
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Miss, you're here.

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Fang Xian,

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
what did you do?

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I...

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I just lost a little bit of my strength.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But the time is limited.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can only do this.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Miss,

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
if we open the shop on time,

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
there will be no problem.

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't worry.

149
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay, okay.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Open the shop, right?

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Tianyu,

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
send an official notice.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The shop is open today.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
50 taels per person.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What?

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You paid so much for me.

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You don't deserve 50 taels?

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Miss,

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I know you love me.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But it's not worth it.

161
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're worth it.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're worth it.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're worth it.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Miss,

165
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
you don't really have to

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
set the price of our workshop so high for me.

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I just made a little contribution.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't think I won't dare to

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
hire you because you

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
used my body to swear.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When will you

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
be in charge of the business?

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Can you really

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
do business like this?

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're smart.

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You're smart enough to go out

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and borrow people with just an umbrella.

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Or do you think

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
you can make me moved

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
by taking me home?

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Childish.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If you catch a cold,

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you'll be doomed.

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Miss,

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
are you worried about me?

186
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh,

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
you brought two umbrellas.

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You took one out on purpose.

189
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Fang Xian,

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you're so thoughtful.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Miss,

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I didn't mean to be unkind.

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I just

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
want to get closer to you.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Be careful.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Wait a minute.

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Did something happen again?

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is it about the training room again?

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Did you make a lot of money again?

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Did Fang Xian

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
make a mess again?

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What's wrong with me?

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You didn't go to the training room today?

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll see who's

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
doing me a favor today.

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Miss.

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Miss.

211
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Wait for me.

212
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Miss.

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Miss.

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Miss.

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's okay.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's okay.

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't wait for me.

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't...

219
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't mind me.

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't mind me.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Keep practicing.

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm here to ask

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
if you're satisfied

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
with the service

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
of our training room today.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Miss,

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
your hobby is really simple.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Here's the thing.

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm the owner of this shop.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I just want to ask you

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
if there's anything

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
that you're not satisfied with.

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Just ask me.

234
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't...

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't hide it from me.

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll try to meet your requirements.

237
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay?

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I understand.

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I understand.

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I understand.

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Look, Miss.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's so dirty here.

243
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're so unkind

244
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
to clean here.

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You're the first one to open the shop.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Because I'm happy,

247
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I invite you to have a drink.

248
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
How about it?

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Okay.

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Okay.

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay.

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay.

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Okay.

254
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So that's your hobby.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I told you.

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're not drunk tonight.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Should I practice?

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's okay, sir.

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Miss is always so rich.

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll drink it.

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You guys drink as you like.

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Be careful.

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Eat well and drink well.

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
My legs hurt.

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Honey,

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
how about I massage you?

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can massage?

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't.

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I can't.

270
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can't.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't.

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't.

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I can't.

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Do you want to try?

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're a man.

278
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I didn't expect you to massage women.

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And you're still angry.

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So you care more about that man?

281
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You care so much about that man?

283
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I just want to know

284
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
who is so lucky

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to get your love.

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Maybe I'm not as lucky as that man.

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I'm sure you don't like

288
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
a man who is a man.

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Since I'm your husband,

290
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I have more advantages than him.

291
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't have the courage to fight for it.

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you like that man who is righteous,

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
kind and kind,

294
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll do it better than him.

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
A thousand times better.

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
A thousand times better.

297
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You...

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you doing?

299
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why do you do this?

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And you're not a commodity.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You don't have the right to say that.

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you want to leave me,

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you can say I'm not hard-working enough.

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why don't you

305
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
have a better husband?

306
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You know I'm not lucky.

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not lucky.

308
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Where did you get your love from?

309
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
From the first time I saw you.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Ying Zhu.

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
My lady.

312
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Get out.

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
My lady.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
My lady.

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know why.

316
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But I'll take responsibility.

317
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
My lady.

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, no.

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How could I

320
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
take Fang Xian as my mistress?

321
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How can I be worthy of her?

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm sorry.

354
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry.

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sorry.

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

359
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

379
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.
