1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're so sweet.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like you.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're so sweet.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I like you.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I like you too.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I like you.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I like you.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I like you.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,220
propagate to ourselves

18
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,680
Episode 23

19
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,080
I have received the Nighthow Spell Symbols

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,760
Why die like I want to die

21
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,560
What's going on?

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,680
Father.

23
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:17,200
Theちょっと

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,360
What are you doing?

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
Stop working

26
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
You are no longer family members.

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Don't say that.

29
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Tian Xiangchi will not refuse a guest

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
as long as he opens the door.

31
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
Whether it's a small meal on the street

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
or a royal meal,

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I'm a guest today.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Why can't I come?

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Guests?

36
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
They are here to stir up trouble.

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Tian Xiangchi doesn't welcome

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
such a guest like you.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
We are not just guests today.

40
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
We have other purposes here.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
This is the jade salt

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
that you took away?

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
You are so kind.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Guests,

45
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
bring me the jade salt.

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Wait.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
I wonder how much money

48
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,400
are you going to use to buy this jade salt?

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Look, Mei Yuan.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
You are so stupid.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
What do you mean?

52
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
We used the jade salt

53
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
to buy the stock of the family.

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
You even want to use these jade salt

55
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
to beat us up.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
The jade salt

57
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
that you used to buy

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
has been taken away.

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Fang Xian took it back.

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
So it belongs to him.

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Sorry, I'm just a random person.

62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
I don't have the right

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
to take away the personal things.

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm so stubborn.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Mei Yuan,

66
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
as long as you hand over this jade salt,

67
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
even if you can't re-enact Tian Xiangchi,

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
you are still my daughter.

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Father,

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
look at Master Yan.

71
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
You are so selfish.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Do you really think I'm a family?

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Cut the crap.

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Guests,

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
take the things back.

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
You are so stubborn.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
How could you do this?

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Sister, brother-in-law,

79
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I guess you came back

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
not just to be a little bit of a threat.

81
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I just said

82
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm here to trade.

83
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
As long as you can pay,

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I can sell this jade salt to you.

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
But you should know

86
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
there are not many shards of silver left.

87
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
There are things that are worth money.

88
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
For example,

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Tian Xiangchi.

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Don't be so reckless.

91
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Even if you put the jade salt

92
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
in my grandfather's pillow,

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
it won't be a problem.

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
Mei Yuan is going to take the jade salt out of the house.

95
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
She is going to take the jade salt out of the house.

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
You said we need this jade salt.

97
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Tian Xiangchi can't keep the gold and silver.

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
We don't need this jade salt.

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Tian Xiangchi can't keep it.

100
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Ji Nu,

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I don't know about you.

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Of course I can make a few money.

103
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
But they are so ambitious.

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm afraid they won't give me time to make money.

105
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Well...

106
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Master,

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I...

108
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
I found a solution.

109
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
I found the buyer.

110
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
As long as we can

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
take the jade salt out of the house,

112
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
we will have enough money to buy the jade salt.

113
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
As long as Tian Xiangchi is still here,

114
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
we can make money

115
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
from this kind of house.

116
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Did you trust the buyer?

117
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Don't worry, Master.

118
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
I'm begging you to find the buyer.

119
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Forget it.

120
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
It's not the time to pick the jade salt.

121
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Fine.

122
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Not enough.

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
You are not sure about the price.

124
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
It's not far.

125
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
I've signed it.

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I wonder when the price will be reached.

127
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Don't worry.

128
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
Since it's a treasure,

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I won't be a fool.

130
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
After half an hour,

131
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,400
I'll send the money to Tian Xiangchi.

132
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Since that happens,

133
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
we'll move out tomorrow.

134
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
If my father is sick,

135
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
we might need more time.

136
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Since Grandpa is not well,

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
don't make trouble.

138
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
We'll have to wait for him

139
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
to come back.

140
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I'll take care of him.

141
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
What?

142
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
You have a tight hand.

143
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
You can't use the jade salt.

144
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Don't worry.

145
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Tian Xiangchi will have enough money soon.

146
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
You want to take away

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Tian Xiangchi's jade salt.

148
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
You can't do that.

149
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
I'm not the one who knows.

150
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Who are you?

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Of course, it's me.

152
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
No one knows you.

153
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Why do you have to be so hard on yourself?

154
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
It's him.

155
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm a doctor.

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
I'm a doctor.

157
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
What are you touching?

158
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Sister,

159
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
is this the way

160
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
your goal starts from the beginning?

161
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Since you've calculated it,

162
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
I've got it.

163
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I have money now.

164
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
You can buy the jade salt

165
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
you have in your hands.

166
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Sorry, I don't want to sell it.

167
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Are you crazy?

168
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
You don't have Tian Xiangchi.

169
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
What's the point of keeping the jade salt?

170
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Or do you want to

171
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
die with us?

172
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
I have the jade salt.

173
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I don't care if I eat it or not.

174
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Now, please leave my house.

175
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
Kanmei Yuan,

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,400
do you really want to cut off my grudge?

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
Okay.

178
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Then give me the sound of your house.

179
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
From now on, we will not be separated.

180
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Look at you,

181
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
are you serious?

182
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I'm the one who wants to cut off your grudge.

183
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Is this how you get the black and white?

184
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Ying Yu,

185
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
the sound of your house

186
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
is always in my jade salt.

187
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I don't know

188
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
if you can take good care of it.

189
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
I haven't found it yet.

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
What's the result?

191
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Is there any connection

192
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
between you and me?

193
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Now,

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I have no connection with you.

195
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Please leave my house

196
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
tomorrow morning.

197
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Don't worry.

198
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,400
That couple can't hold on for long.

199
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Anyway,

200
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
the Taoist masters of the ten times,

201
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
will be able to study

202
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,400
the jade salt again.

203
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Don't say that.

204
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I know.

205
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I know.

206
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
I know.

207
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I know.

208
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I know.

209
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I know.

210
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
I know.

211
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I know.

212
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I know.

213
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
I know.

214
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I know.

215
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I know.

216
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I know.

217
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I know.

218
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I know.

219
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
I know.

220
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I know.

221
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I know.

222
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I know.

223
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I know.

224
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Aren't you going to listen to me?

225
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Just say a few words.

226
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I was talking for my family.

227
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Look at your equality.

228
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Do you want to see the beauty?

229
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Now,

230
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
there must be a dumb girl.

231
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Are you still speaking

232
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
of me as your misdeed?

233
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Mom

234
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
forget it now.

235
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Don't talk about it.

236
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Fine.

237
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Your father and daughter

238
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
now don't know

239
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,520
Miss, there's a scene in Rongshan.

240
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,160
It seems to be about Miss Meiyuan and Fang Xian's old man.

241
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
This...

242
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,240
Did Yue Fu leave?

243
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,360
Do you think I did the right thing?

244
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
I don't know.

245
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,480
I just know that no matter what,

246
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,240
I will always be with you.

247
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Here, this way.

248
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Come.

249
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Rongshan Special Welfare Center.

250
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
No need to add heat, no water, no rain.

251
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'll give you a different experience.

252
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Did I really do the wrong thing?

253
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Master Young Master, you want to see me?

257
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Of course, I'm looking for you to make a promise.

258
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Madam,

259
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
you can just tell me if there's anything else you want.

260
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm sorry.

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320

I'm sorry.

271
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
I'm sorry.

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,320
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm sorry.

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
