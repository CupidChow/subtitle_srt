1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
From time to time, you've been in the dark.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a number of light and shadow.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Time goes by like a flash.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Every moment is engraved in the memories.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're the one who's in the dark.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're the one who's in the dark.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're the one who's in the dark.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're the one who's in the dark.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're the one who's in the dark.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're the one who's in the dark.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The clouds and the light are always in the mountains and seas.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The only thing that can be done is to be alone.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I've met you.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Even if there are two thousand songs, what's the point?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Love is a flower that blooms like a magic.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's you who's in the dark.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can't hear you, I can't hear you.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Love is a Flower That's In The Sky

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 1

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Love is a Flower That's In The Sky

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Episode 1

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Father, it's a good deal.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We can't ruin something.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, father.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We've been together for so many years.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You really plan to see me?

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who is it that you don't see?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You've been blinded by Yan Qing.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you think?

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Me?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, father, what do you mean?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What do you mean by asking me?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What do you mean?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can't bear it at all?

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's me.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I've been raising you for so many years.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I went to Marquis Yan Qing's mansion to get married.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I...

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Your mother saw it for a long time.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She was pregnant for so long.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I thought I was the one who got pregnant.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So that woman, Zhao,

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
knew that Marquis Yan Qing didn't have a chance to marry me.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
She asked me to raise you.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Father, stop it.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't call me father.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You still have a bad temper.

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Didn't you see that this is a good opportunity?

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You two will be married.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The business of Tianxiang Chi is always in vain.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Liu Dong Zi Jin I saw is already in a hurry.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You said that you two are so bad.

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm just looking forward to your future.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You two are Yan Qing's descendants.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I saw it was chaotic.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The Liu Dong Zi Jin I saw is not enough.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm afraid that I'll be in trouble.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I saw the Liu Dong Zi Jin I saw is not enough.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How come I don't know?

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How come you don't know?

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or else, how can you let the Kans' family have a big headache?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've been giving the family trouble.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Do I really have the right to be a Kans' heir?

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Bastard!

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Grandpa, don't be angry.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Kansiang!

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're so smart when you're dressed up in that dress.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're so naive when you're in the air.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Can't I tell whether the Kans' family is the real thing?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Dad, I'm not even sure of being a father.

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're sure of being a grandfather?

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Dad, you'd better be a father yourself.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What are you saying?

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're a bastard.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Say it again.

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay, I'm not a father today.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Grandpa, are you mad at me?

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Kansiang, remember.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm the Kans' heir.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No matter what, I'm the good son.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No one wants to leave.

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Unless...

87
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Unless I die.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Grandpa, grandpa.

89
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on, come on.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Grandpa, grandpa, you're leaving.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Grandpa!

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You accompanied me all night.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Thank you.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're awake?

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How's your sleep?

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're asking me?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why didn't you go back to sleep?

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Can you sleep well here?

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So many things happened yesterday.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to stay with you.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You don't have to bear it.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm the only one here.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm not worthy of being a Kans' daughter.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But you didn't do anything about the marriage.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I know.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It has nothing to do with blood.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What have I been doing these days?

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Actually, the Kans are no longer as good as before.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
My father and grandpa wanted to take the blame on me.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He hoped I could re-establish the family business.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But I did something.

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:26,880
I only know the

113
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,000
responsibility of escaping from the Kans.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's me.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's me.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Grandpa please calm down.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will pull you back.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Miangzi,

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not a GPU,

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Rence was never an accident in the past.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can't take it anymore.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The blaming was excessive in the future.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Grandpa,

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
I was sick.

125
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,320
My father thought I was the daughter of His Lordship.

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
It's too late.

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
How can it be late?

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
You forgot what my grandfather said.

129
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,720
As long as you don't give up now

130
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,120
and try to make up for it,

131
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,520
you won't let him down.

132
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,720
All right.

133
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,720
I'll be with you all the time.

134
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,440
It's okay.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,520
It's okay.

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Go and clean up.

137
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,440
I'll wait for you outside.

138
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,680
Well,

139
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,920
I'll sleep in the bed next time.

140
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,120
You can take another one.

141
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,560
My lady,

142
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,160
my grandfather asked you to come over.

143
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,800
I'll talk to you later.

144
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
I don't know

145
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,040
if you have something to say.

146
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,600
But I hope you can

147
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,400
give me the seal.

148
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
I know.

149
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,160
You're already very tolerant.

150
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,120
But we can't just watch the seal

151
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,720
and think of a person who is not clear.

152
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,440
Father,

153
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,720
you've been watching the house for so many years.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
Is it your granddaughter

155
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,800
who needs to prove something else?

156
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,760
Mr. Feng,

157
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,760
we're all the people who take the blame.

158
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,600
You don't have the right to say something.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,040
I don't want to say anything else.

160
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,160
Tianxiang Chi is very powerful.

161
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,520
Maybe he can't even hold on to the day

162
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,480
that Yan Qing Hou was born.

163
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,080
Can you keep him safe?

164
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
No.

165
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,600
All these years,

166
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,120
I've done nothing but to pay the debt

167
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,920
to Tianxiang Chi.

168
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,480
I've always said that I don't want to inherit the city.

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,280
Now that my grandfather is sick,

170
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,320
I'll leave immediately.

171
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,040
No matter what,

172
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,760
I'm the only one who is qualified to take over my father.

173
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Even if you don't believe me,

174
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,760
I can only wait for him to wake up.

175
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,320
As for Tianxiang Chi,

176
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,480
we've already set up the early pretext.

177
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,480
When the pretext comes,

178
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,120
we can launch the early pretext.

179
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,440
By then, we'll be able to keep Tianxiang Chi.

180
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,160
The pretext is high and far away.

181
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,560
We can't make a wish.

182
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,960
God knows what will happen.

183
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,760
I'll personally go to the pretext this time.

184
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,560
I'll go to the pretext this time.

185
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,440
I'll go to the pretext this time.

186
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
I'll go to the pretext this time.

187
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
I'll go to the pretext this time.

188
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,000
You don't believe me, do you?

189
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,160
Then I'll prove it to you.

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,560
Fine. I agree.

191
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,120
Since that's the case,

192
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,200
then it's settled.

193
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,120
You may leave.

194
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,520
What did you do again?

195
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,400
Tomorrow is the day

196
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,760
I'll go to the pretext tomorrow.

197
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,680
I've arranged for a killer to be killed.

198
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,480
Why didn't I notice that

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,280
your hand is so cold?

200
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,200
Is it very spicy?

201
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,960
You're the one who got the money.

202
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,360
Didn't you think so?

203
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,160
Otherwise, how could you let your sister

204
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,440
go to the pretext?

205
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,160
Then where did she go?

206
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,960
As we said,

207
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,000
now I have found

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,160
an hour's rest.

209
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,280
Teacher, now is the chance to tell you

210
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,660
where your sister and my brother lived.

211
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,680
We're talking about Xiao yan.

212
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,400
Our gathering is

213
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,200
on the other side of the boat.

214
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,760
We're going to put it on in our bus tonight.

215
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,500
Host, you're very worried about Sinamedak.

216
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,580
What about you?

217
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,660
Is he here yet?

218
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,060
I'm still worried.

219
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,740
How about I go with you?

220
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,340
Enough. I'm not a three-year-old kid.

221
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,660
You're not that exaggerated in the hall.

222
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,420
I'm really worried about Grandpa's illness.

223
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,500
I still need you to take care of him for me.

224
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,620
Don't be mad.

225
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,020
I can't change with you now.

226
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,780
I won't marry you.

227
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,460
My dad is really...

228
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,960
He really is...

229
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,900
24 Thanks. You may sleep in bed now.
