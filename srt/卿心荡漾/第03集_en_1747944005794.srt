1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
From now on, I'll walk down the road and return to the past.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's a book of glaring rain.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Time is passing by,

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
every morning and evening,

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
the memories are engraved deep in my heart.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The sky is receding,

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the trees are swaying,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
it's you.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The book of glaring rain.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's you.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The trees are swaying,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
it's you.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if the clouds are big,

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the mountains are hard to stop,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the roads are hard to cross,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
the stars are hard to see.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Even if the clouds are big,

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the mountains are hard to see.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm afraid I'll be lost.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The flowers are blooming,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
the rain is hard to stop,

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
the waves are hard to stop.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The Legend of Chusen

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 16

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Miss Ban,

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
don't be angry.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's outrageous!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I must fix it!

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's the business of my Fang Xian Hero Heaven Fist!

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Miss Ban!

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Miss Ban,

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
are you sure?

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What did you do?

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What did you do?

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It looks delicious.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is this?

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It smells so good.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't worry.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The Heaven Fist has prepared enough food for you.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I promise you won't suffer any loss.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you're satisfied,

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
please visit our Heaven Fist.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Good!

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's such a big feast in the world.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can eat whatever you want.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's a bit expensive.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you thinking?

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's just a meal.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're not that big.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can eat whatever you want.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Miss.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Good luck!

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The Heaven Fist

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're not looking for a restaurant?

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why are you here?

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm looking at the night view.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's so good about it?

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've been looking for years.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I've just been here for a few days.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is the night view of Rong Mountain good?

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to go there.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course,

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
it's not as good as here.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And it's not just the night view.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There are also people who miss it.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're really a good son-in-law.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're so talkative.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm not.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Every scene

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
changes because of the characters.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The night view of my wife

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
changes because of someone else.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's taste the taste of the Miss.

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Miss.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't be afraid.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm fine now.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm the master of the shadow beast.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Miss.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss!

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How was it?

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How much did you lose today?

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll make 300 taels today!

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I know!

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Go!

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I won!

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I won!

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're here, Miss.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I made your favorite dumplings.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't want to eat it.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't give me cash.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How did you make so much money?

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I...

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I told you.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You have to use real money.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can't make it up at once.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yan Qing and Mu Yu will meet soon.

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can't do this to our family.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Miss, you...

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You misunderstood.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I dare not disobey your instructions.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have a family of three.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
They saw my big purchase.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So they gave me a better price.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have a single set.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Meiyuan!

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You two are a surprise to me.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Surprise?

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Surprise!

119
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Fang Xian, I know you have high requirements.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But if you're too demanding,

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
it will only increase your pressure.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You've broken the 30-year income record

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
of Tianxiang.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Your grandpa praises you.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're great.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Meiyuan,

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
grandpa wants to reward you.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go home and eat.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wait.

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yu Jia,

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
you should understand what I mean.

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't worry, Miss Meimin.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll give Fang Xian the fish.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I promise the guests won't be disappointed.

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Fang Xian,

137
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm just waiting

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to see how you'll use this trick.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How will you use it?

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sir,

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
stop joking.

142
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm busy.

143
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ting Yu,

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm your lady. Stop calling me sir.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm really busy.

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
And what you said is

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
very, very,

148
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
ridiculous!

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Forget it!

150
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I can't let Fang Xian buy anything tomorrow.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If this continues,

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll be the heir.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No matter what, you'll be the heir.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't worry.

155
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't make trouble here.

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Get out!

157
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll go.

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You look happy.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Meimin, good evening.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You and I know

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
what it's like to get married.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're not afraid of hurting others' feelings

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
but of your wife's feelings.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How can we say that

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
we're helping each other?

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Besides, Fang Xian knows about this.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Although he's not capable,

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
he's willing to help me.

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What a good trick!

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've never seen you before.

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Fang Xian is so kind.

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Does he know

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you're still thinking about someone else?

174
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My wife is thinking about someone else?

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What?

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You didn't tell him.

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He told me

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that he's the only one who's not getting married.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But now he wants to get married to Fang Xian.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It seems that

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
there will be many good shows in the future.

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
My wife's lover?

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Is it me?

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Today we're going for an entertaining dinner.

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
How about a date?

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you Capricorn discovered that

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
a stranger...

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
colour with me.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I must invest money

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
into this opportunity with Skitts.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you know

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
why after meeting this little unlucky cat

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He's like...

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Tang Xian can eat with this?

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,640
Fang Xian,

196
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,000
it seems that there is no one else

197
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,280
but me who can do this to you.

198
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,120
I can't blame you for that.

199
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,640
You must withdraw the money.

200
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,440
My lady,

201
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,440
you don't have to worry about this.

202
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,880
I'll think of a solution.

203
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,240
A solution?

204
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,600
What solution can you think of?

205
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,880
If you don't explain it to the client,

206
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,840
our brand will be ruined.

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
Indeed, my arrangement may not work.

208
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,160
I was not careful enough.

209
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
What's wrong with your Mu Chi?

210
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,440
Yeah.

211
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,440
Be careful.

212
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,040
Tian Qiang,

213
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,760
we're both strong.

214
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,680
Don't be so mean.

215
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,880
Don't be so mean.

216
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,440
Little fish,

217
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,920
do you want to change the fish tank

218
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
to a bigger one?

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,720
My Lady.

220
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,400
My Lady.

221
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,120
My Lady.

222
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,480
My Lady.

223
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,320
Why are you looking at me with a mirror?

224
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,560
My Lady.

225
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,960
It's me.

226
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,240
My Lady.

227
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,080
Why didn't you go home to sleep last night?

228
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,760
Leave me alone.

229
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,360
I want to sleep.

230
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,360
I'm just worried

231
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
that you wouldn't have a good rest here.

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,320
It doesn't mean anything.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600
I'm afraid we haven't exchanged for too long.

234
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,200
So I want to change it back.

235
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
If you want to change it back,

236
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
can't you just ignore me?

237
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Yes, my lady.

238
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
But can you let go of it first?

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,600
You...

240
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,000
You have to be your own face.

241
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
My lady, my lord, something bad happened.

242
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,400
Someone is making a scene outside.

243
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,800
What?

244
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
What's going on?

245
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
What's going on?

246
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,800
What's going on?

247
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
What's going on?

248
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
What's going on?

249
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
What's going on?

250
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,600
It's only noon.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,200
And they are fighting?

252
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,200
My lady.

253
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
It wasn't like this before.

254
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,200
What's going on?

255
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Am I right?

256
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,400
My lady, don't worry about it.

257
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll think of a solution.

258
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Solution?

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,400
Let you go to the tomb and offend the customers.

260
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
We'll ruin the reputation of the family.

261
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Indeed, my arrangement may not work.

262
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
I was not thoughtful enough.

263
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
How can I fix it this time?

264
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,800
It's settled.

265
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,400
Take this.

266
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,800
Why is it back?

267
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
My lady.

268
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,000
Since it's my fault,

269
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,200
I'll take the responsibility.

270
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,200
Everyone.

271
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,600
If you have any questions, just tell me.

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,600
I was very reluctant at first.

273
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
But I didn't expect that

274
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,200
the fish was not itchy on the legs.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,400
The skin is gone.

276
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,600
Like the eggs that hatched.

277
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
What's wrong with your tomb?

278
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,800
Why is there only a tomb for the fish?

279
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
Arrange it for us.

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Or we'll complain to you.

281
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,200
These fish were arranged by my lady this morning.

282
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,000
We really don't know the details.

283
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
Arrange it for us.

284
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,800
Give me a big one.

285
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Give me a big one.

286
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
Is there any problem with our children?

287
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Yes.

288
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
We'll also be fine.

289
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,600
I want that effect, too.

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,800
Why is the plot different from what I thought?

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,200
It's great.

292
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
The fish is gone.

293
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
The fish is gone.

294
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
The fish is gone.

295
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
The fish is gone.

296
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
The fish is gone.

297
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
The fish is gone.

298
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
The fish is gone.

299
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
The fish is gone.

300
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
The fish is gone.

301
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
The fish is gone.

302
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
The fish is gone.

303
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
The fish is gone.

304
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
The fish is gone.

305
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
The fish is gone.

306
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
The fish is gone.

307
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
The fish is gone.

308
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
The fish is gone.

309
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
The fish is gone.

310
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
The fish is gone.

311
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
The fish is gone.

312
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
The fish is gone.

313
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
The fish is gone.

314
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
The fish is gone.

315
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
The fish is gone.

316
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
The fish is gone.

317
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
The fish is gone.

318
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
The fish is gone.

319
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
The fish is gone.

320
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
The fish is gone.

321
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
The fish is gone.

322
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
The fish is gone.

323
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
The fish is gone.

324
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
The fish is gone.

325
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
The fish is gone.

326
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
The fish is gone.
