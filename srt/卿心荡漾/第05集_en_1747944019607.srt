1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Since then, I've been wandering in the dark night.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's a light of light.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Time is like a needle that stitches every morning and night.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The memories engraved deep in my heart.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The night is being recorded, the book is being written.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's you.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm afraid I can't see you.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's you.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't help but look for you in the night.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Even if the clouds are vast, the mountains are hard to reach.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can't stop my heart from beating.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I met you.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Even if there are two thousand seasons, why be afraid?

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Love is like a flower, the ink is like a brush.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This time it's you.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's hard to stop, I'll try.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Love is like a flower, the ink is like a brush.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This time it's you.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's hard to stop, I'll try.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The Legend of Chusen

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 26

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
My dear!

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Get out!

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My dear!

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You're the one who should be responsible.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How could I look Fang Xian as the hero?

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How can I deserve the hero?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My dear!

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't do anything stupid!

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know why this happened.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But you have to believe me.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I must be responsible.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Fang Xian, I don't need you to be responsible.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't know why this happened today.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But we're not from the same world.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You may be longing for peace and happiness, but I'm not.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's just pretend that nothing happened today.

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Fang Xian.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Look, you want to change the things you want for me again.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why do you have to love someone so lowly?

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's why I think you're inferior to that person.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now that it's clear,

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
although I failed, I'll still fix you.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you feel guilty,

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't mind the person you love.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But the person I love is you.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My dear!

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can do this when you're pregnant.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When you opened the workshop,

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I thought you were just playing.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The workshop not only made money,

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but also led to the business of Tianxiang Pool.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Look, after the guests finished their work,

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
they were all sweaty.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They came to our Tianxiang Pool to take a bath and change clothes.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Isn't this called the management of the group?

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I knew you were my favorite girl.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're great.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Only you can think of this kind of method.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I won't do it if I can think of it.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's okay, father.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Father, are you very relieved about me now?

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Of course.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm glad to hear that.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have a good idea.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What idea?

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Miss, this is the massage area you've built.

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How is it?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Miss, you're finally willing to do business.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How is that possible?

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is the best idea I could think of.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Think about it.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We have experienced the management of three generations.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As long as there is no accident,

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
even if the management is not good,

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
there won't be any big problem, right?

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And we are now launching new services.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There is massage, there is acupuncture.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The best makeup is the best makeup.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The price is the highest.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
These are different from the food and the workshop.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
As long as we can't serve,

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
we will be out of the picture.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We will definitely lose money day by day.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right?

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Miss, you're really...

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This won't affect the big event of Yan Qing Hou's bath and face, right?

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Of course it will.

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So you have to work hard

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
to get rid of the identity of the heir.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then the people can prepare for Yan Qing Hou.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you happy now?

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Stupid.

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Young Master,

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Madam has opened a new massage area for you.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It must be because she knows your massage skills are very advanced.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You think too much.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Welcome.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This way, please.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Now, your first test will start.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Ready to start.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have to finish the last one.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The rest will be in the next round.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Miss, you...

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What's wrong?

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We're looking for a massage,

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
not a big event.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you work too hard to get the guests to come,

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
who will be responsible?

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think there are some reasons.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay, the second test starts now.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Use your fingers to remove the paper in front of you.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You broke it.

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're out.

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The rest, go and sign the document with our people.

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Dismiss.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Miss,

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I could understand the massage just now,

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
but the massage at the bottom of the foot

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
needs some strength.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What do you know?

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Although the acupoint has been around for a long time,

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the massage at the bottom is a fresh thing.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you work too hard to get the guests to come,

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
we will be responsible.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is that so?

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Miss, don't worry.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I won't interfere this time.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're a little bit

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
self-conscious.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're mine from now on.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't know what he's doing now.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Does he miss me?

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But I miss him so much.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I hope he can appear in front of me.

145
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Qingyang,

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
if you ever touch my voice again

147
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and poison my heart,

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I promise you won't be able to do it next time.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Young Master,

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you used to be a person who couldn't make jokes.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That was before.

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Young Master,

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
you've been in a dream.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Now you're in a relationship with your wife.

155
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You should be happy.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a pity that you're not in love.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then...

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Young Master,

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
wait for me.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ting Yun,

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
tomorrow you must show us

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
how much you can exaggerate

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the massage at the bottom.

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you hear me?

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, I understand.

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I've thought it through.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Everything is in my plan.

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So you're really scheming.

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I knew you wouldn't give up.

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Of course I won't give up on what I've been pursuing.

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Mei Ming, don't worry.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Just move the stool

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and wait for my surprise.

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay, I'll be looking forward to it.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Is he angry?

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't know.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He's not angry.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is he angry?

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't know.

181
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Young Master,

182
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
what happened between you and your wife?

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Did you really...

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
break off the engagement?

185
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can't decide that.

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
By the way, Young Master,

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
contacted us again.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They were the ones who made a deal with us.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was just being nice.

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
After all, we share the same blood.

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The Jinyi Chamber of Commerce

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
needs our young master

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to be on the outside.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What do you think?

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No matter what,

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
the young master now

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is no longer the same.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Besides, the seniors of the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
are all old.

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They're still being used.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Young Master,

203
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that was Fang Xian?

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It was him.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Get ready.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You seem to be in a good mood.

208
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Of course.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
A big thing is about to happen.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm happy.

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't worry.

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
After it's done,

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll make it up to you.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm happy to spend

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
these days with you.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't need to make it up to you.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sad if I don't make it up to you.

218
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My dear,

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
do you really like me?

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
How is that possible?

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Why did you exchange again?

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What kind of joke are you making?

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
My dear,

224
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
maybe this means

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
we're meant to be.

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Change it back quickly.

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have something important to do.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What?

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Sister,

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
your surprise really surprised me.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Surprised?

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Didn't you see that we were busy?

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The day is bright.

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It seems like you've already decided to make the move.

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Then come here.

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's continue.

239
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
My dear,

240
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
let's continue.

241
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If you're embarrassed,

242
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
why don't you close your eyes?

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yuan Fang Xian,

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
don't be so busy.

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Come with me.

246
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll be looking for you.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hmph.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Now,

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
give me a perfect explanation.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
in just three days,

252
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Tian Xiang Pond's customers

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
have been reduced by 60%?

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Grandpa,

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
don't be soft-hearted.

256
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Say something.

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
From tomorrow,

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
everything about Tian Xiang Pond

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
will be handled by the beautiful ladies.

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Besides,

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
the family seal

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
will also be handed over to the beautiful ladies.

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Kan Mei Yuan,

265
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
are you

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
convinced?

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm convinced.

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Also,

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I know

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
that you two

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
are still not married.

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm afraid that

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
this marriage

274
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
is all my wishful thinking.

275
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Ning Zi.

277
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why is my heart

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
hurting suddenly?

279
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But I don't like him.

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I just feel bad for him.

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
After all,

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
he's innocent from the beginning.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Fang Xian,

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
this marriage

285
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
will end here.

286
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Just think that

287
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
nothing happened before.

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Then,

289
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
let's do this.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let's go.

291
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The marriage is being fixed.

292
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's hard to live in the future.

293
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Grandpa,

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
how about giving Fang Xian some money

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
to let him go back to Rong Mountain?

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's a compensation.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Kan Mei Yuan,

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
are you mistaken?

300
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I never said

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
that I would let Fang Xian

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
leave this family.

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

308
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

323
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

327
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm sorry.

330
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

334
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

335
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm sorry.

339
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm sorry.

351
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm sorry.

352
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

367
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry.

369
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000

372
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000

375
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
