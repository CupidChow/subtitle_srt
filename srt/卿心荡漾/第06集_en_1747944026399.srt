1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't help but think of you in the night wind

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Even if the clouds are vast, the mountains and seas are hard to balance

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The road is hard to walk, the stars are hard to see

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I meet you, even if there are two thousand years of spring and autumn

5
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Love is a flower, the sky is silent, the ground is flat

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This life is hard to stop, I will stop

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 14

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's just leave it at that.

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
My son-in-law is being repaired, so his life will be hard to live.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Grandpa, how about giving Fang Xian some money to let him go back to Rong Shan?

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's a compensation.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wait, wait, wait.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Kan Mei Yuan, did you misunderstand?

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I never said that I would let Fang Xian leave this house.

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I am just a friend of his grandfather.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I will take good care of him no matter what.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But you, from the beginning to the end, you can't accept this marriage.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, the inheritance of the Kan family,

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
naturally has nothing to do with you now.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
My family has rules, people who don't raise useless people.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, the person who left at this time should be you.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Grandpa, are you serious?

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Grandpa, this is too much of a punishment.

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are just a man of iron.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please take back your order.

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I... I...

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have already cleaned it up.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Can we go now?

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No, no, I can't.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't laugh yet. I have to hold it in.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can soon realize Zhang Jian Zeng Tian Ya's dream.

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay, go. Go!

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Leave now!

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Wait.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My dear, do you know?

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Every time you appear, you will change my life.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have always wanted to work hard to get close to you.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I never thought that I would become your husband with the power of the wind and the rain.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But I know very well that

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I won't let my beloved suffer because of my own will.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So, this time, let me do something for you.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Grandpa, this time, I didn't give you an urgent order.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's why Mei Yuan made a mistake.

45
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If I really need to leave alone to make up for my mistakes,

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
this person should be me.

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you for taking care of me during this time.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This...

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, you... you can't...

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
My dear, take care.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You take care.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yuan Feng!

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Mom, why are you here?

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mei Ming, I heard that you returned Tian Xiang Chi's seal.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is a great opportunity!

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You just let it go like that?

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How can it be so easy to deal with Sister and Fang Xian?

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think they have a backer long ago.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They dug a trap and waited for us to jump.

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think Sister's expression now must be very depressed.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This trap...

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will definitely find it.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Miss, Master said that you must return Tian Xiang Chi's seal today.

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I know.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Fang Xian?

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Miss, you're all recovered.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you still want to be in the lower realm?

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I have to live so lonely

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to protect you.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you were to stay at home and not suffer from these sins,

81
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
it was all her doing.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you, Brother.

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're too young to protect yourself.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you, Brother.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But Miss, do you still like this kind of person?

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
If you were not this person, I would have already fulfilled my dream and left.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ting Yu, do you think I should go look for Fang Xian?

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What kind of look is that?

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Miss, you do care about Master.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I...

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I just feel that he was kicked out

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
because of me.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't just stand by and watch him get angry.

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But Master has also ruined your plan.

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's fine if you don't get angry at him.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're still so concerned about him?

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm worried about him?

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Young Master, come back with me for a while.

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Qingyang?

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I...

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I won't be able to see my wife here.

102
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, Young Master.

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Your trust is even more important than mine.

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You were kicked out of the house, you could have come to see me.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Right? Why are you here begging for food?

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I couldn't think straight for a while.

107
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I felt like I was being kicked out, so I had nowhere to go.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Young Master, what should we do next?

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know.

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Please help me get some medicine.

111
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Those children were all sick.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I can't just leave them alone.

113
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Also, help me find out which hospital

114
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
those children are staying in.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They're all poor people.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We can't just sit around and do nothing.

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Young Master, I mean,

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you and your wife,

119
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
what's your plan?

120
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I understand.

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
A man should never be angry.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Young Master,

123
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
don't be sad.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Having a wife is my best dream.

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's unique.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Young Master,

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
dreams do come true.

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Young Master!

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Qingyang!

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Qingyang!

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Qingyang!

132
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I see that you're going to stand here today.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You'll never get married again.

134
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you do, you'll be struck by lightning.

135
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll never love you!

136
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This place is not just beautiful at night.

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There are people who miss it.

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I just want to know who's so lucky

139
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
to get a wife's love.

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Maybe I'm not as lucky as that man.

141
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But my wife will never like

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
a man who's always in trouble.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Since she's become your husband,

144
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
she has more advantages

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
than the courage to fight for it.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you like that man to be righteous,

147
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and be a good teacher,

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll do something

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that's a thousand times better than him.

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Ten thousand times better.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Am I on two different boats?

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I'm not the wife of the master.

153
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Forget it.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not thinking about it.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What are you looking at?

156
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Young Mistress!

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Something happened to Master!

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What should we do?

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't worry, Father.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Everything will be fine.

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Doctor, how is Grandfather?

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
He's having a heart attack.

164
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He's having a heart attack.

165
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He's having a heart attack.

166
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's unconscious.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If he goes on like this for too long,

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
he might die.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Then you should use the medicine.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We must make a lot of money.

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Of course.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Of course.

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But we still need a medicine.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's called the wood incense.

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It can cure this illness.

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But this medicine is very cold.

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's not easy to buy.

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I only saw it in Rong Mountain.

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I only saw it in Rong Mountain.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If that's the case,

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll go to Rong Mountain.

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, no, no.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't be reckless.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Rong Mountain is dangerous.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why don't we make money to buy medicine?

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Everyone,

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
be quick.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We can't wait for long.

189
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Father!

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Doctor, please take care of Grandfather.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
We'll go find the medicine now.

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Okay, okay.

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Doctor Zhao,

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
how is it going?

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
They all believe it.

196
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
According to your order,

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've told everyone

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
that we can only buy medicine in Rong Mountain.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I hope that this time,

200
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
the dollar can be brought back smoothly.

201
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do you think I'm old and confused?

202
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
How do I know that now I remember

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
that I can only find it in Rong Mountain?

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
By the way,

205
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
how can I pretend to be sick

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
to prevent them from suspecting me?

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Okay, okay.

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
How about this?

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Great!

210
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Ting Yu!

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You!

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I didn't hear anything.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I didn't hear anything.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He's quite practical.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Miss!

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What are you doing?

217
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are you going to go to Rong Mountain by yourself?

218
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you really not going to take your master?

219
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
After all,

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
he's always lived in Rong Mountain.

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And he's also a master of the art.

222
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He's not one of our family.

224
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We can't get him involved.

225
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm leaving.

226
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Miss,

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
aren't you going to be in danger

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
if you go alone?

229
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm not taking him with me because it's dangerous.

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He used to be one of our family.

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Of course, I have a responsibility to protect him.

232
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
No, Miss.

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you want to hear what you're saying?

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Okay, okay.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't worry.

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You know my skills.

237
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Just cover up for me and our family.

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you understand?

239
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I've already found out that

240
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:21,060
the wood-burning

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
is a very dangerous thing.

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm going to take care of it.

243
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay.

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Miss,

245
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm going to take care of it.

246
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Okay.

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Miss,

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm going to take care of it.

249
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Okay.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Miss,

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm going to take care of it.

252
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay.

253
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Miss,

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm going to take care of it.

255
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Okay.

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Miss,

257
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm going to take care of it.

258
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okay.

259
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Miss,

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm going to take care of it.

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay.

262
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Miss,

263
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm going to take care of it.

264
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Miss,

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm going to take care of it.

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Okay.

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Miss,

269
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm going to take care of it.

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okay.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Nope!

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It hurt!

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It hurts, Miss!

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can you go back?

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And look at me.

276
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Okay.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Miss,

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,280
You must hold me tight.

279
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,560
I won't let anything happen to you.

280
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,680
Fang Xian, let go of me.

281
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,880
I won't.

282
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,280
It's better to die alone than to die with two people.

283
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,240
My dear.

284
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,040
I won't let go.

285
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,800
My dear.
