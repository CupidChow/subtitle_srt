1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm thinking of you, I'm going back to my old days.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a little light in the darkness.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Time is passing, every moment is in the memory of the past.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The words are written in the book, how many are you?

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm waiting for you in my memory.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The hell is laughing at me.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
On the night I know that its you.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
time is passing, every moment is in the memory of the past.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The light is in every mountain.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We split ourara hwpf, together we'll have a happy new year.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What do you bring along?

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Even if I had two thousands s of springs

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can still fulfill my craving for you.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,500
The more difficult it is, the more difficult it is for me to fight

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 4

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
I really don't understand

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
what charm do you have

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to make Mei Yuan choose you and not me?

22
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Because you are not the same kind of person.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Your mother is as evil as a enemy,

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
and she is a good teacher in Le Mountain.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You are a commoner, and you are a commoner.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why do you have to be so arrogant to achieve your goal?

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You don't need to be so hardworking and to be so generous?

28
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
From a merchant's pursuit,

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,000
you have heard this, why are you so adamant?

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You must have the right to be the best in the world,

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and the right to be the winner.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you are the winner, you don't have the right to give your opinion.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We are not in the same boat.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We have nothing to say.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You are not in a boat.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are in a boat?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are not in a boat.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You are not in a boat?

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You are not, but you are.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you are not in a boat,

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you must give your opinion to the winner.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Kill him.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Look clearly.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I am your master.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I said the one who just left.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
First, you are not my master.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Second,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,800
It's so easy to be found out that the Shadow Shao has been forced to escape.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
You are the assassin of the Shadow Shao?

50
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,300
Song Kang, you heard what Fang Xian said.

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,640
You have been fighting against the people,

52
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,800
and have been trying to kill the merchants,

53
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,900
and have been trying to kill others in public.

54
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,800
You are the biggest evil!

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Episode 1

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
The Great Four is alive!

57
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,000
The evil will win!

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,600
The Great Four is alive!

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
The evil will win!

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,800
Sit down.

61
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,600
This cup of wine

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
will clear our family's mind.

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,400
It's not that simple.

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,200
In order to avoid losses,

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
we have already put in all the profits we have made.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
You are doing very well.

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
Think about it. We used to be the gatekeeper.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,600
But the Shadow Shao is a group of evil officials who have been forced to win.

69
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,400
They even helped the Great Four.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
That's right.

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,000
In fact, the Shadow Shao might not be as evil as the people.

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And the Shadow Master.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Maybe he is not as scary as the people.

74
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
The Shadow Master is a murderer.

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,800
It has nothing to do with me.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,400
I don't want to be his family member.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
Such people are still very rare.

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
But I...

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Don't be like that.

80
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,400
Let's start over.

81
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't talk about such a bad thing.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come on.

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,200
Let's drink.

84
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,800
Lady, you have worked hard these days.

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Come on. Eat more meat.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Lady, what do you need to do today?

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
To apply poison to the shop.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have been looking at the beauty of the couple.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know what beauty I have left.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will let them have a good time.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If you don't know how to make a contribution,

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what good wine is there?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I wonder if you are willing to give it a try.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The Shadow Master

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Lady, why are you looking at me like that?

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't like the Shadow Master, do you?

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You were so impulsive that you came here.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You love to be impulsive.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I like it.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I hope everyone can change the Shadow Master.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I thought you knew the power of the Shadow Master.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You are going to leave.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You want to leave me behind?

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You can leave anything.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I am your mother.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can't leave me behind.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No one can do it.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The Shadow Master is the same.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then why do you know the Shadow Master?

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Have you seen him before?

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Didn't you say this before?

112
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I just learned it from you.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Fang Xian is quite talented when he comes in.

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Wait for me.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Is Fang Xian the Shadow Master?

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But he doesn't know martial arts.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is he disguised?

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You are so stupid.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Didn't you just switch your body to the Taizhou branch?

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can just go to the Qu Stone again.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Welcome.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You may go in.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Welcome.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why do you exchange the ring?

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you talking about?

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You are so stupid.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why are you still walking?

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's almost done.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If it hadn't been for Feng Shui,

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I would have completed the goal of the Shadow Master.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't want to leave now.

132
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You are so firm before.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why did you change suddenly?

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why did you say that out of the blue?

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Look.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's not just that you can only do business outside.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I did something good for the people at home.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I wanted to make Mei Ming a successor.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But I found out that it's not that simple.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
My father is also unreliable.

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Is it because of me that you have no doubts?

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I will definitely follow your footsteps

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
if you want to leave the family.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I want to know

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
if you want to stay, it's really not because of me.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
My lady, you are drinking my cup.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's okay. I'll take another one.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
ガ chop

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
shallot

151
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
My lady, I...

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Download ある

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
I've already thought about it.

154
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,240
I promised my grandpa that I'd watch a TV show.

155
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,840
Now I'll punish you!

156
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,400
You can replace me.

157
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,840
I'll let you think about it.

158
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,760
I'll ask you many times.

159
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
I finally came to the city of Yingzhu

160
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,640
after a long journey.

161
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,000
I must take good care of the idol.

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,120
But how can I find the idol now?

163
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
With the power of the idol,

164
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,200
I'm afraid I won't be able to find it easily.

165
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,360
Will I have to go to the branch to touch the soul?

166
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,960
I finally found you!

167
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,720
Do you know how much I've suffered

168
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,240
to find you?

169
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
Miss, you've mistaken me.

170
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,280
I can...

171
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,280
You recognize me?

172
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,680
Of course.

173
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,840
How can I not recognize you?

174
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,520
I remember clearly

175
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,880
every scene we've been together.

176
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,520
Then tell me more about it.

177
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm thinking of hearing it.

178
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Have you forgotten

179
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,680
our story?

180
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,600
I want to hear how you feel about our relationship.

181
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,400
idol, you finally thought about it, right?

182
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,720
Whatever.

183
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,840
Tell me.

184
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,000
What kind of person am I?

185
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,400
Am I the shadow?

186
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,880
That's right.

187
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,800
We used to be blind and laugh at each other.

188
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
Then?

189
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,600
We're more famous idols in the city.

190
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,080
The idol I admire the most.

191
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,120
Great.

192
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,520
I see.

193
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,240
How can you say that?

194
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,840
I'm the one who pays the debt.

195
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,680
I owe it to you

196
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,120
to pay the debt.

197
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,880
Master, look.

198
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,360
Since Fang Xian entered the sect,

199
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,920
what's going on?

200
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,760
What kind of big talent can this be?

201
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,120
Listen, your daughter is in debt.

202
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
What are you talking about?

203
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
That's my daughter.

204
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,840
Besides,

205
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,040
there's nothing to lose in marriage.

206
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,560
They're all in the Fengxiu Flower Festival?

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,360
Can we go through the Fengxiu Flower Festival?

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
If we continue like this,

209
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,680
my daughter won't be in debt.

210
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,400
Tian Xiangchi will be in debt.

211
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,760
Master,

212
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,120
can we make a decision

213
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,880
about the marriage of the famous?

214
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,880
Let's not talk about it.

215
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,200
Master Liu's strength

216
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,200
is in front of us.

217
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Master.

218
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,880
Let me think about it.

219
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,400
Think about it.
