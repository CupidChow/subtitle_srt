00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm back to you.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a place called light.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Time is passing by, and every moment is in the memory of the past.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The words are engraved on the back of my mind.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's you.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm back to you.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There's a place called light.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Time is passing by, and every moment is in the memory of the past.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The words are engraved on the back of my mind.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's you.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm back to you.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There's a place called light.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Time is passing by, and every moment is in the memory of the past.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The words are engraved on the back of my mind.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's you.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The End

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 19

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 19

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Fang Xian,

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the sword is as sharp as a fog.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I was once a man who was a man who was a man of love.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I didn't know how to express my love to you.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I felt that it was just a feeling of being exposed to reality.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I couldn't express my love.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But after we met,

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I found that the two of us were as good as each other.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was very proud of myself.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I felt that I was kind and kind.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I felt that I was kind and kind.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I wanted to have the ideal of the heroine.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I wanted the warmth you gave me.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I always thought that if you were the heroine,

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
you should have a good idea of the irresponsible one.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Until I found out that you had the same ideal and passion as me.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I finally understood that he was just a defeated opponent in my heart.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He can do it, and you can do it too.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But you can't do it.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The heroine can't.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because he won't be the one who would do anything for me.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He will only be the husband of trust.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's why the time has come to me.

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Only you.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's why it's you who deserve my life.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Not him.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You always worry that I will abandon you and leave.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In fact, my heart has already told you.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will be there for you.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Take care of grandpa.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wait for me to come back.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My dear.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Grandpa.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Grandpa, why is there no fish in the fishing pond today?

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Grandpa.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Be a little more careful.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The lady asked you to guard the sky.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
She also asked you to take care of grandpa.

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you keep doing this, you won't be able to do it.

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The lady called me husband.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
My little fish.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My little fish.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The weather is getting cold.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't be too cautious.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Be careful of the cold.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You are getting bolder and bigger.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You dare to joke with me.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will open the mountain.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Enough.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't talk old words.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This lady is TimeLD Normal around the room.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Although the words from she am just the greetings in Western Han,

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not a smart discuss.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hope you can breathe in well.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sadly, you are no section manager.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Besides, we were osmosis吾 show.

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Indeed I am over here for now.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Isn't that what you mean?

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Of course.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What a misjudgment.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You got too much on your feet.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Half of your life's worth is worth more.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,080
Who can no longer enjoy已經?

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,260
Take it.

87
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,700
Take it.

88
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,500
This man is Strawberry wamer

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,160
Who knows other Five Years?

90
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,280
Apply this gw мf 15

91
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,260
Return to the iron Mechanical

92
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,680
Return to the Iron Mechanical

93
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,860
書讓

94
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,920

95
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,660
60

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,500
We can't find an excuse.

97
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,460
We can't pay the money.

98
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,100
Exactly.

99
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,020
We can't pay the money.

100
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,700
We are just a small business.

101
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,100
If possible,

102
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,940
I hope you can

103
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,860
clear this episode's

104
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,740
fire-dry money.

105
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:21,860
When did we

106
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,740
sign the payment?

107
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,420
What do we need to clear the payment?

108
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,940
Now,

109
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,340
everyone knows

110
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,660
the name of Tianxiang Chi

111
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,740
is a disaster.

112
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,180
Now, Tianxiang Chi

113
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,460
is like a pig

114
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
who is hungry.

115
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,300
Can you bear it?

116
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,980
Enough.

117
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,300
Fang Xian,

118
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,820
you saw it.

119
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,980
Now, you and Meiyuan

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,780
are looking at each other.

121
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,740
What's the matter?

122
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,300
You'd better give the money out.

123
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,220
Miss Meiming,

124
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,540
are you satisfied?

125
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,700
Now, your sister

126
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
and your brother-in-law

127
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,060
will definitely not pay the money.

128
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,820
Now, you are dead.

129
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,460
You just want to be a master.

130
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,620
You are dead.

131
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,300
Why don't you give the master

132
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:06,740
the money?

133
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,020
When will you wait?

134
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,620
I'm going to find my wife now.

135
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,220
She promised that I'd come back.

136
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,460
If she doesn't come back,

137
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,740
I'll take her back.

138
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,660
Wait.

139
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,900
Leave the master.

140
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,620
No one wants to care about you.

141
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,900
Go find someone.

142
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,060
I'll go find someone.

143
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,140
I'll go find someone.

144
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
I'll go find someone.

145
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,300
I'll go find someone.

146
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,300
I'll go find someone.

147
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,460
I'll go find someone.

148
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,540
I'll go find someone.

149
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
I'll go find someone.

150
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,860
Someone!

151
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,260
Father-in-law,

152
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,180
is that really the case?

153
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,900
If you don't hand over the master,

154
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,260
don't you dare to leave the door of the family.

155
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,420
I've been away for less than a year.

156
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,580
But my wife has been calling you

157
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,180
the parents of your 20 years.

158
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,220
Cut the crap.

159
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,140
Beat them up.

160
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,460
Master Bai...

161
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,900
Master Bai.

162
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,580
Master Bai...

163
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,900
Master Bai,

164
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,140
Enough.

165
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,260
I'm glad that nails don't touch the mind.

166
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,620
I generally can understand.

167
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,720
Fang Xian,

168
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,760
let's go.

169
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
It's none of your business.

170
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,200
Take care of Grandpa.

171
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,200
Master.

172
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,080
Young Master Fang Xian, please come with me.

173
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
Sciences to the Junior Demon Sect

174
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,440
ascular reform.

175
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,680
Young Master Fang.

176
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,920
You've landed in such a small world.

177
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm no longer afraid to do anything so unass Howard.

178
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
You've got something else to say.

179
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,800
I'll let it slide just because I'm not hungry for you.

180
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:06,920
I see.

181
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,560
How long can you meddle?

182
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,600
I thought you're concerned

183
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,400
about Miss Mei Yuen's death.

184
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,400
Do you even know who my wife is?

185
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm a Hillsong.

186
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,360
You are also a member of the Jinyin Chamber of Commerce.

187
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,760
You are fair and kind.

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,760
Do you know that?

189
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,560
You also want to see the mastermind?

190
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Me Mastermind?

191
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,360
You see that I am willing to accept all your punishment,

192
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,040
even if I am not as capable as you?

193
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,240
Feel free to enjoy whatever you want.

194
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
I love you all the best.

195
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,800
Thank you.

196
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,920
Dr. Cuiyeon,

197
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,080
how about this death evil of you?

198
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm willing to treat you.

199
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
It's easy to save.

200
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,960
What are you doing?

201
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
What are you doing?

202
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Didn't you say you want it?

203
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,240
Here you are.

204
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,800
Tell me the whereabouts of my wife.

205
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,160
Okay.

206
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,240
Take it back.

207
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,480
Wait.

208
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,320
You're too tall.

209
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,160
I don't like to look at others too much.

210
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,800
Sister.

211
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,400
Sister.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,760
Turningcoat.

213
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,000
That's too loud.

214
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,600
Do you understand

215
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,040
why people keepGEUM?

216
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,800
Move aside.

217
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,920
Liu Jinnu, where is my wife?

218
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,920
When did I say that I know your wife's whereabouts?

219
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,320
You're lying to me?

220
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,720
Don't say that.

221
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
You still have time to discuss these with me.

222
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
Your wife has been in danger for more than a day.

223
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Even if she's still alive,

224
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
who would know what happened to her?

225
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,120
My wife!

226
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,520
My wife!

227
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,320
Where on earth are you?

228
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,820
My wife!

229
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,420
Where are you?

230
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,120
Where are you?

231
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
My wife!

232
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
My wife!

233
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
My wife!

234
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,120
Where are you?

235
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,120
My wife!

236
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,520
Where are you?

237
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,520
Can you hear me?

238
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Yang Zi.
