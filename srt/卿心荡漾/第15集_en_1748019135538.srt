1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm always in your arms.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There's a little light in the darkness.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Time is passing by, and every moment is engraved in the memories.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm always in your arms.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The words are engraved in the memory.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Time is passing by, and every moment is engraved in the memories.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The clouds are always blue, and the mountains and sea are hard to control.

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We can only walk alone, and we can't be together forever.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I've seen you, and I'm always in your arms.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dream.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I've always thought of you, and I'm always in your arms.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,500
I will never be able to stop you

16
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 1

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 1

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Episode 2

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
My Lord.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm waiting for Lord Gonghou.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,500
You don't have to be polite.

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,000
You are busy today.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's late.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My Lord, you are polite.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,500
My Lord, you are so polite.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,160
It's our family's

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,500
great fortune to have a family.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
The last few days,

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
I have been busy with the funeral.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
I have been busy with the funeral.

31
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,000
I really can't stop myself.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Where? Where?

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
In a few days,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will be at your place

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
to celebrate the birthday of Tianxiang.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I wonder if I can drink a cup of wine tonight.

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,000
My Lord, you are serious.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
Enjoy your trip.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
Look at the funeral.

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
The past is past.

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
Don't always think about it.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I came here this time

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
to see Su Su's child.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My Lord, don't be so impolite.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,500
It's my funeral's fortune.

47
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
My Lord, this way please.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Please.

49
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,000
Look at the funeral.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,500
I will bring you back soon.

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Come on.

52
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
My Lord, please drink this cup.

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Come on.

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,000
No matter who come here

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,500
again,

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,000
let me test the nerve.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Hello, E'erhand woman.

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
How are you?

59
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm very good in taste.

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,000
It seems you are nonsense.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,500
No.

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Sounds good.

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,500
Very good.

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,300
I will drink it to demonstrate it.

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,200
Why do women rarely wait

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,500
until the nobility comes?

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
If you think so, you should be my niece.

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
If I have children, I will be like you.

69
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,900
I wonder if Miss Mei Yuan can talk to me more.

70
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:11,100
I'm just afraid that you will be too bored to listen to us.

71
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,700
How can that be?

72
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,100
My Lord, why don't we drink another cup?

73
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,700
Okay.

74
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,900
Come on.

75
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,700
Don't kiss me in front of everyone without my consent.

76
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Mei Yuan, don't you think what His Lordship said just now is a bit strange?

77
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,700
Did you grow up with Meiming?

78
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
It's a bit strange.

79
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,500
He kept asking me about Meiming and I when we were little.

80
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,300
He was so serious about such a trivial matter like this.

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,100
It's strange.

82
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,300
What's going on?

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,900
I just asked around.

84
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,300
When Lord Yue Fu and His Lordship were young,

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,900
it was a bit too much.

86
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,500
That's because he's a young man.

87
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,300
He's a young man now.

88
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,900
He still doesn't know how to deal with such a thing.

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,300
He's not a good father.

90
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,100
He's a good wife.

91
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,100
He's a good wife.

92
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
He's a good wife.

93
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
He's a good wife.

94
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,100
He's not a good wife.

95
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
He's really a good wife.

96
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
A good wife is still a good wife.

97
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
But His Lordship used her parents to protect us.

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,100
That's a good wife.

99
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,900
No wonder he kept asking about Meiming.

100
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
It must be when His Lordship was young,

101
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,500
he was so friendly with Erniang.

102
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,300
So he suspected that Mei Mei was his child.

103
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,500
That's what he was like.

104
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,900
I didn't even ask about it.

105
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
You started to get upset.

106
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,900
Now I've made my promise

107
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,700
and asked you to come after us.

108
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,100
Then should you tell us

109
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,900
what you really want to do to deal with them?

110
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,900
Don't worry.

111
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,900
I won't let you down.

112
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Just wait and see.

113
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,900
Why?

114
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
You still want to fake it?

115
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
By the way, there's one more thing.

116
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Although I'm not a good wife,

117
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,900
I still want to be a good wife.

118
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
There's one more thing.

119
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Although I've agreed,

120
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,900
how do you convince my parents to let you in?

121
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Business is a secret.

122
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
You can't be a stranger.

123
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
What?

124
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,900
Mei Mei is the daughter of Marquis and Second Sister?

125
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,900
My Lady,

126
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
why don't you just laugh at me?

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,900
I just suspect that

128
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,900
I always feel that

129
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
I have some kind of

130
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
bad temper between you and Marquis.

131
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
And I've been in a bad mood lately.

132
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Maybe I've just found something.

133
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,900
That doesn't mean

134
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Mei Mei is Marquis's daughter.

135
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
You don't know that.

136
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
When I was in the wedding,

137
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Marquis always asked me about Mei Mei.

138
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
If I didn't have some bad temper,

139
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
why would I care about her?

140
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,900
What are you doing?

141
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
You scared me to death.

142
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
No, My Lady.

143
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
I've heard that

144
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Second Mistress often brings a maid to the door.

145
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
And sometimes

146
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
she comes back late at night.

147
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Second Mother often goes out to buy food.

148
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
And she comes back late.

149
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
But

150
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,900
in the wedding,

151
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,900
there's no such thing as heaven.

152
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Maybe it's the wedding in the mansion.

153
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
I can only see that I can't buy it.

154
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Although I'm not in a good mood with Mei Mei,

155
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
the sisterhood of the past years

156
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
won't be destroyed by these evil spirits.

157
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
But is it unfair to the old man?

158
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
He has the right to know the truth.

159
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
We can't just keep looking at him

160
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
and bring him a green hat.

161
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Ting Yu,

162
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
please keep a close eye on Second Mother's whereabouts.

163
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,900
Are you sure this is the place?

164
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
I'm sure.

165
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
It's been a while since I've been with her.

166
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Second Mistress will come here every four days.

167
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,900
She will stay here for three or four hours every time.

168
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,900
My Lady, what should we do now?

169
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Stop.

170
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,900
Look at the eldest daughter,

171
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
look at the beauty,

172
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
and look at Yan Qing.

173
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
Look at her.

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
The Marquis is not in the mansion.

175
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
He will leave every four days.

176
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
I wonder when the Marquis will come back.

177
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
I have something important to discuss with her.

178
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
We don't know the Marquis's whereabouts.

179
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Miss,

180
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
why is it so coincidental

181
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,900
that the Marquis is not in the mansion today?

182
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Father,

183
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
why are you here?

184
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,900
Wei Yuan?

185
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
Why are you here?

186
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Answer my question.

187
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Father,

188
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,900
it's not what you think.

189
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
It's not what I expected.

190
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Father,

191
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
you know everything.

192
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,900
Wei Ming,

193
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
you must be very good later.

194
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
No matter what happens,

195
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
even if we don't have blood ties,

196
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,900
our sisterhood will not be broken.

197
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
I will protect you.

198
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
What are you talking about?

199
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,900
I will take care of the other.

200
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,900
My Lady,

201
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
don't be nervous.

202
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
What if you don't think it's that bad?

203
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
How can you be so kind?

204
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,900
I'm not that kind of person.

205
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,900
My Lady.

206
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
I'm really unlucky.

207
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
I'm really unlucky.

208
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,900
I didn't expect that

209
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
we can have such a family

210
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,900
to go to the house we want.

211
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Father,

212
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
can you say something straight?

213
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,900
I am just a person.

214
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,900
You should be the one to blame.

215
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,900
Father, do you plan to lose a daughter?

216
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Father, it's easy to talk.

217
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
We can't destroy something.

218
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Yes, father.

219
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
We've been together for so many years.

220
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,900
I plan to see you.

221
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,900
Who is the one who is going to see me?

222
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
I'll be so busy with my relationship with you.

223
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
Tell me.

224
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Look at Wei Yuan.

225
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Me?

226
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
No.

227
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
Father, what do you mean?
