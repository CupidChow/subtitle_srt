1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,020
From now on, I'll be a little bit of a

3
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,020
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

4
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,020
From now on, I'll be a little bit of a

5
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,020
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

6
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,020
From now on, I'll be a little bit of a

7
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,020
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

8
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,020
From now on, I'll be a little bit of a

9
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,020
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

10
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,020
From now on, I'll be a little bit of a

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,380
What?

12
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,520
Hey!

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Okay.

14
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,020
Come, come, come. Get up now.

15
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:20,020
Fang Xian, I'm sure you've learned a lot from your grandfather's skills.

16
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,020
You must be good in the future.

17
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Help your beloved wife, Mei Yuan, take care of her business.

18
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,020
A month's loss is 300 taels.

19
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,020
How much skill can you help?

20
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Fang Xian is here.

21
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,020
He'll be fine in the future, right?

22
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
That's right.

23
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,020
Fang Xian is in the Khan family, so he'd better be careful.

24
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,020
He'd better not do unnecessary things.

25
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,020
What do you mean unnecessary things?

26
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,020
Fang Xian is in the Khan family, so he's a member of the Khan family.

27
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Tian Xiang Pool is his business.

28
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Father-in-law, you're wrong.

29
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,020
I think Erniang and Meiming are right.

30
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,020
The Khan family's business is a big deal.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm the heir.

32
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:13,020
How can Mei Yuan rely on others for her business?

33
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
As the saying goes, talent is born with a purpose.

34
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,020
How can she lose confidence in her because of a small mistake?

35
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,020
Does the Khan family really need a heir who only relies on others?

36
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,020
If that's the case, then the Fang family is in a bad position.

37
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Well said.

38
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,020
You're really a good grandson.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,020
My son-in-law is indeed a great man.

40
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,020
I'm not wrong.

41
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,020
No, father.

42
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
I said that.

43
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Shouldn't you say it with a smile?

44
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,020
I don't have a son-in-law as arrogant as you.

45
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Mei Yuan, take your husband to the Tian Xiang Pool.

46
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Mei Yuan.

47
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Say it.

48
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Yes.

49
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
You...

50
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,020
My husband.

51
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,020
Cooperate.

52
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,020
Cooperate.

53
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,020
I'll take him there.

54
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,020
Look at them.

55
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,020
Okay.

56
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,020
Let me see what your son-in-law can do.

57
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,020
This is the Tian Xiang Pool of our Khan family.

58
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,020
Please.

59
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Please come in.

60
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,020
Please.

61
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,020
Please.

62
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,020
The Tian Xiang Pool of our Khan family is the biggest pool in the South.

63
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,020
The customer's range is high.

64
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,020
It's a threat to the people.

65
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,020
And next month, we'll be responsible for Yan Qing Hou's bath.

66
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,020
Let's go to the next place.

67
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,020
Miss Khan is good at business.

68
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,020
Great.

69
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,020
My lady, it seems that you and the customer are close.

70
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
Of course.

71
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,020
Remember, they paid for the trust of our Khan family.

72
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
We'll give them the best service.

73
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,020
I understand.

74
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,020
I'll do my best for you.

75
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,020
You can help me make a big loss.

76
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,020
You can help me lose my right to be an adult.

77
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,020
I'll clean it up and fix it.

78
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,020
I won't be blamed by my grandpa.

79
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,020
I'm a genius.

80
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,020
My lady, where are you going?

81
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,020
What are you doing?

82
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
I'm going to look for the pool.

83
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,020
No, my lady.

84
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,020
That's the female bath.

85
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
We exchanged bodies.

86
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,020
It's not appropriate for you to go in like this.

87
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,020
It's not appropriate to go to the male bath.

88
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,020
My lady.

89
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,020
Don't open it.

90
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Don't open it.

91
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,020
Welcome to our house.

92
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,020
Welcome.

93
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,020
Welcome.

94
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
What are you doing?

95
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Are you looking for trouble?

96
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
Don't go.

97
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,020
Come back.

98
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,020
Don't go.

99
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
Come back.

100
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,980
Your father is biased.

101
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,540
He lost so much money.

102
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,020
He even wants to find a suitor

103
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,260
to turn the situation around.

104
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,780
What are you doing?

105
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,460
You still want to find me?

106
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,260
Do you know?

107
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
Do you know?

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,220
Useless.

109
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,300
I'm covered in the smell of the smoke.

110
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,780
I was found before I went into the water.

111
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
This is the reason

112
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,940
why you tried to control me?

113
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,340
let me try this with you.

114
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,300
Enjoy your food,

115
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,400
and enjoy thisannonce you wish!

116
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,560
I must help my wife.

117
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,120
But as the head now.

118
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,500
It will hurt her.

119
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,240
Do me a favour.

120
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,180
Where are you going, to see how tea booth host treats their guests?

121
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,380
Eat with the true ability to open their mouth.

122
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,500
Why not?

123
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,620
Three of us are not guests.

124
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,700
We cannot have the chefs idle then.

125
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,700
It looks like Tianxiang各www let me change it's way of running the business.

126
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,420
You're so good at cooking.

127
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,420
If you like it, I can cook it for you forever.

128
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Is this the charm of a drunk?

129
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
The little Jinyuan has changed.

130
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
The power of love.

131
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
Come here!

132
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,420
The power of love.

133
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
What are you looking at?

134
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,420
I've got an idea.

135
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
I'll let you take care of the housework.

136
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
Is that what you want to say?

137
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,420
Yes.

138
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,420
I plan to let Fang Xian take over the restaurant from tomorrow.

139
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,420
You'll be a good match for him soon.

140
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
When the time comes, you'll take over the housework.

141
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
I'll wander around the world from now on.

142
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,420
Perfect!

143
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
Hold this.

144
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,420
What are you doing?

145
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,420
I'm going to take over the restaurant.

146
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
I'm going to take over the restaurant.

147
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,420
I'm going to take over the restaurant.

148
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,420
What?

149
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,420
Miss, Miss Meiyuan is deliberately losing money

150
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
to let you take over the restaurant.

151
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,420
Deliberately losing money?

152
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
How can there be such a good thing in the world?

153
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Are you sure she and Fang Xian are still sleeping separately?

154
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Yes.

155
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,420
Fang Xian?

156
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
My dear wife, you're back.

157
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Why are you here?

158
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,420
Go to sleep in the second room.

159
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
My dear wife, don't be so formal.

160
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,420
It's just that the weather is getting cold.

161
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,420
I'm just here to warm your bed.

162
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
A man like you

163
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
is obsessed with such a trivial thing.

164
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
You're always a big man.

165
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
I really don't want to be a big man.

166
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,420
I just want to be a good husband.

167
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,420
I just want to be a good husband.

168
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,420
I just want to be a good husband.

169
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,420
I just want to be a good husband.

170
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
I just want to be a good husband.

171
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
I'm warning you, Fang Xian.

172
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Don't do those weird things with my body.

173
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Or I'll divorce you.

174
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,420
So...

175
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,420
My dear wife, will you still kiss me?

176
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Okay.

177
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
I'll go to the second room to rest.

178
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,420
Yes.

179
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,420
We only kiss to exchange.

180
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,420
How could I kiss him again?

181
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420
Why are you still here?

182
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
My dear wife.

183
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,420
You...

184
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,420
Don't come over.

186
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,420
What are you doing?

187
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Fang...

188
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,420
Meiming.

189
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
This is not right.

190
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,420
If I tell the people,

191
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,420
they will say that I'm old and unrespected.

192
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,420
Forget it. I'm going back.

193
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,420
Grandpa.

194
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,420
They're here.

195
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,420
They're here?

196
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,420
You're right.

197
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,420
My dear wife.

198
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
I can do it myself.

199
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,420
Fang Xian.

200
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
You... You... Stop.

201
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
No, my dear wife.

202
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Stop.

203
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
No, I can't.

204
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
Listen.

205
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
Your sister is very emotional.

206
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,420
Stop.

207
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,420
No.

208
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Grandpa.

209
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
My dear wife.

210
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
I can't stand it.

211
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
I'll kill you.

212
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,420
My lady.

213
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,420
You and Gu Yan are here to fight.

214
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,420
Why do you ask?

215
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,420
You two slept on the bed yesterday.

216
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Tianyu.

217
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,420
Listen.

218
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
Don't tell anyone.

219
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
Or I'll...

220
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
My lady.

221
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
I'm late.

222
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,420
Meiyuan.

223
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,420
Where is Fang Xian?

224
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,420
I have a top-class three-bottom wine.

225
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,420
My lady. Wait for me.

226
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,420
My lady.

227
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,420
Qianxu, this is a great wine.

228
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,420
I'm sorry.

229
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
I'm sorry.

232
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
I'm sorry.

233
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
I'm sorry.

235
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,420
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,420
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,420
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,420
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,420
I'm sorry.

240
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
I'm sorry.

241
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,420
I'm sorry.

242
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,420
I'm sorry.
