1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
From now on, I'll follow you to the dark night.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There's a book of glaring rain.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Time is like a needle that stitches every morning and night.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The memories engraved deep in my heart.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,980
The

7
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,000
Yans are being held back by the golden tree.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's you.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid they'll disturb my dreams.

10
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,000
You'll comfort me.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You'll be there.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if it's cloudy and windy,

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,440
Even if it'sukib.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,000
You will know when it's over.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Tell me I met you.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm afraid you forbears.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Love flower spreads silent.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Follow you back.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The World Is You

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Episode 16

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My dear, so it's my fault this time?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What else? Who allowed you to drag me into the tomb?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It was you who secretly watched me take a bath.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're almost there. I just watched it.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're still in the line.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Does that lady like it?

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So what if she likes it or not?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Does that lady like me or the bath?

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm tired.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have to say, the price of the massage is too low.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The incense pool is pretty good.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You Danwu people are really ungrateful.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You treat the wood-farm culture so casually.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're indeed a native who can't eat.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Compared to our Xintuo, you're not as good as Kang.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're all the wood-farmers who imitate our culture.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You're saying we're casual?

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're really arrogant.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm arrogant?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It seems I need to show you my power.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you doing? Don't come over!

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What are you doing?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're looking for trouble so early in the morning?

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm just in time.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Lady, this is the South Tree Pool.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Lady, this is the South Tree Pool.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Who is it?

49
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is our Xintuo's massage tree.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It has a thousand-year history.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's also the highest level of hospitality for the royal family.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not a massage technique that any ordinary wood-farm can master.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're being so arrogant.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You mean you promote the bath culture?

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Besides the opening ceremony,

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
the bath culture of the Wu Dynasty is no better than Kang.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Our Xintuo has surpassed you.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Can you talk properly?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're just a massage master.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're saying you're better than us.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're really a bad guy.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
After seven days, I'll set up a stage in the Sky Lake.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you don't accept me, you can come and challenge me.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll be the one to challenge you.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you don't accept me, you can come and challenge me.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If you lose, you have to admit that we are the king of baths.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's a deal.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Lady.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It doesn't matter if you look down on me.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But if you look down on our Wu Dynasty and the Sky Lake,

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think you're the first one to disagree.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm so angry.

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Lady, are you being too impulsive this time?

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We're not just representing the Kang family.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We're representing the whole Wu Dynasty.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Are you looking down on them on our territory?

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who are you on earth?

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Why don't you stand on my side?

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Of course I'm on your side.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You know you're on my side.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't know what you're doing.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you want to be punished?

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How?

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I haven't decided yet.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Lady.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Lady.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ting Yu.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're really good at picking a time.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Tell me. What is it?

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If we lose this time, our Kang family will be ruined.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The people will only remember that we lost the face of the Wu Dynasty.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe it will affect the great thing that Marquis Yan Qing was in the bath.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Meiming, what do you want to do?

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Of course I want to apologize to Li and invite him to join the Kang family.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't care if you want to be weak.

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I don't think Meiyuan has ever given up before the war.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why didn't I find out before that you're such a bloodless person?

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How can you take over the seal of such a selfish and narrow case?

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can take over the seal if you're so weak.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Stop arguing.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Good.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Look at you two.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't look like a family.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not dead yet.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're arguing for the seal.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Kneel.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you looking at?

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I told you to kneel down now.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Kneel until you're satisfied.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Old man, why don't I recruit a gold medalist from my mother's side?

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Although the skill may not be as good as that Xintuo,

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
at least he's experienced.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I have a plan.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Then I'll leave the matter of learning the art of making gold to you.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thank you, mother.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We're all family.

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll go to find my grandfather.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll ask for a favor.

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No need.

120
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Grandfather will definitely be angry.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Come here.

122
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Madam, you're...

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You have to be punished.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If grandfather is angry,

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
he'll punish you.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This...

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This lady, you're not angry?

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you understand what I said?

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I understand.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But I'm a cook.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She's not a massage master.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Nonsense.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're a massage master, I won't find you.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That drunkard will ask you to get the gold medal.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can say whatever you want.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I want them to show their tears.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Mother, I'm here.

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Master Kong, please give us your guidance.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're welcome.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're welcome.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Master Kong, you can say it.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm listening.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This matter...

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's a very good method that was passed down a long time ago.

146
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Our ancestors...

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Master Kong,

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
he...

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
He won't let outsiders say it.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But since you're here today,

151
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll tell you.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's like this.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You mix the dragon fruit and the beef together.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then you use the method of the上果.

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then you rub it hard.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
After you rub it hard,

157
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
no matter how hard it is,

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
it will become tender.

159
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's basically like this.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's so late and you're still in the tomb?

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Grandpa's been punished again.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's actually okay.

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
After all, cleaning up the tomb can fewer than 2 hours.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can always see you look at the stars.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You like to look at the stars?

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm always looking at the stars.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're not going to be able to get rid of it.

168
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I like that.

169
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I have to be able to do that.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can't do that.

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,600
I can see you looking at the stars.

172
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,240
You like to look at the stars?

173
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
My dear, do you know?

174
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,680
When I was little,

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,480
there was a change in my family.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,120
I didn't know what I should do

177
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
and what I could do.

178
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,440
Then,

179
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,560
my grandfather took me away.

180
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,200
I started taking care of my grandfather.

181
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,120
At first, I didn't think too much.

182
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,800
But since my grandfather died,

183
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,840
I suddenly felt like I was back.

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,840
But this time, I'm not lost.

185
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,800
Because I have a hope in my heart.

186
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,120
Do you know

187
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,600
what the stars mean to me?

188
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,200
If I can't sleep for a long time,

189
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,760
the starry sky

190
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,240
is the tenderness given by the night.

191
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,040
I can't see the stars in the daytime.

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,520
Then you are my starry sky.

193
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,240
Okay,

194
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,680
change it back.

195
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,760
But I've been on a long day

196
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
and did so much work.

197
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,120
It's tiring to change it back.

198
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,120
You've been punished

199
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,360
for me.

200
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,480
I can take the other hardships.

201
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,080
But...

202
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,800
But...

203
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
I'll change it back.

204
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,480
Honey, don't...

205
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
My legs are weak.

206
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,440
You always have weak legs.

207
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,680
I don't know if it's true.

208
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Of course it's true.

209
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,440
If you don't believe me,

210
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
I'll get up now.

211
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,080
That's it.

212
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,240
Give me the bookjiu.

213
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Give it to me right now.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
It's mine.

215
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,800
Feng...

216
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,920
Feng Xian,

217
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,840
your hand...

218
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,880
Honey,

219
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,800
Your Re害

220
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,400
Don't worry

221
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,800
The

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,740
Double��

223
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,320
is not about the service

224
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,740
and the concubine

225
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,680
I will go out

226
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,920
See hiring

227
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,940
in跟

228
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:12,960
The

229
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,480
el

230
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,840
looks

231
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,480
Thanks.

232
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,280
Mr Liu thanks for your demonstration.

233
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,840
You didn't give up the marriageBEFORE, right?

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,760
Miss Mei Ming sure brings people joy.

235
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,520
We'd be happy to agree to this marriageuro herb.

236
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,600
Why would I play that villain?

237
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
It makes sense.

238
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,640
You were containers in the last fight

239
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm afraid you won't be the one

240
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,920
to succeed in the future.

241
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,120
Are you really not anxious?

242
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,640
Miss Meiming,

243
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,080
it seems that you have

244
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,280
investigated my matter.

245
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,000
It's my honor.

246
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
Of course.

247
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
Suddenly someone comes to propose marriage,

248
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,800
I have to do it in my heart.

249
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,400
Although I was

250
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,960
suppressed by my brother in the Liu family,

251
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,360
I have been in business for many years.

252
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
I also have some enemies.

253
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,480
Now everything is not set yet.

254
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,000
30 years in the east, 30 years in the west.

255
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,400
Maybe everything is not set yet.

256
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,320
Miss Meiming,

257
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,680
you think so, too, right?

258
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,520
I heard that your sister

259
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
has caused you a lot of trouble recently.

260
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,600
It's hard to find a friend.

261
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,560
If you need help,

262
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,280
I will help you.
