5

how did you know

6
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,870
we had a party?

7
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,470
You have successfully booked a Hilton Presidential Suite

8
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,390
and its accompanying services.

9
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,550
You hypocrite.

10
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,550
On the surface, you gave me your credit card

11
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,590
and let me use it as I please.

12
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,550
In fact, I spend every penny,

13
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,830
you are so calculating.

14
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,460
Do I spend money on parties

15
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,550
for fun?

16
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,150
I threw the party to

17
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,990

18
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,430
Do you think I'm counting the money?

19
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,070
I'd be happy to let you use my credit card a few more times.

20
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,390

21

Then why are you angry?

Don't get me wrong.

I drank that toast

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,670
because I was pretending to be Bi Xiaoran at the time.

26

I wasn't my real self.

33

There is absolutely no way that he and I could be together.

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,190
I think these works are good.

Alas,

186
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,550
I've already said so.

187
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,630
No...

188

Doesn't Qin Yanfei

189
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,750
just want an apology?

190
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,710
No way.

191
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,230
Why is that impossible?

who does he think he is?

194
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,070
He came back only to hit on my sister,

195
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,350
and sent her a bad painting.

196

Yuck!

We are just ordinary friends.

198
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,429
An ordinary friend would send you this kind of painting?

199
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,950
Can ordinary friends make Qin angry?

200
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,270
That's because he overthinks himself.

201

206

Haven't you considered making him your official boyfriend?

207

is what I owe you.

322
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,710
I didn't expect that after all this time,

323
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,510
I still wouldn't be able to

324
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,710
control my emotions properly in front of him.

325
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,990
Xu Yuanhang is your nemesis, right?

326
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,950
You've had your heart broken for him so many times,

327
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,270
and he still wants to keep coming back to haunt you.

328
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,190
No...

329
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,390
between me and him,

330
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,670
he was the victim.

331
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,270
We met and fell in love

332
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,350
when we were in college,

333
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:02,390
and every minute we spent together

334
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,870
was wonderful.

335
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,030
But then we went on the fork

336
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,430
in the road of life.

337
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,070
After graduation,

338
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,910
I got an offer from the company of my choice

339
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,430
and embarked on a career as a producer.

340
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,350
He was accepted to

341
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,990
Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, as he had hoped.

342
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,700
But I was not willing to

343
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,110
give up my life.

344
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,790
Although I know that

345
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,430
this 10,000 kilometers distance

346
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,630
will wear out the feelings

347
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,830
between us.

348
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,270
Do we have to break up?

I wish you the best of luck in your future.

Xiaoran,

351
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,750
I'm not going abroad.

352
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,630
I'm going to stay with you.

353
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,390
Have you already decided?

354
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:48,590
Yeah.

356
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,080
[Mr. Liu of the Gallery]

357
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:00,950
Hello?

358
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,910
Hello, Mr. Xu.

359
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,870
Your paintings

360
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,350
have not been sold for two or three months.

361
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,630
If you have time,

362
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,590
just take them back.

363
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,790
Then,

364
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,940
one day he received a phone call.

365
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,230
He was offered an exhibition

366
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,430
and a studio.

367
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,750
He had been at rock bottom for too long,

368
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,790
so he was too eager to be seen

369
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,590
and recognized by others.

370
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,630
Even if he knew it was a scam,

371
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,990
he was willing to try.

372
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,310
In the end, he was foolish enough

373
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,430
to be cheated out of everything.

374
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,550
So,

375
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,590
you borrowed money from Lai Zhengyi

376
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,790
to pay his debt?

377
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,310
That's right.

378
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,430
But I didn't expect that

379
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,869
my approach

380
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,310
would deliver

381
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,150
the final

382
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,230
and heaviest blow to our fragile relationship.

383
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,099
Bi Xiaoran,

384
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,230
he gave you that money?

385
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,349
Yes.

386
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,869
But our relationship is fake.

387
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:25,750
We are just working with the needs of the project.

388
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,230
Bi Xiaoran,

389
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,670
The most regrettable thing

390
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,950
I've ever done in my life

391
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,870
is to give up the opportunity

392
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,110
to go abroad for you.

393
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,070
My life is completely ruined!

394
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,910
That's not true, Yuanhang.

395
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:38,590
Bi Xiaoran,

396
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,990
Let's break up!

397
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,150
If he hadn't given up on

398
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,510
going abroad at that time,

399
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,470
he wouldn't have gone through all these.

400
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,230
And,

401
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,140
I think he would be

402
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,270
better off

403
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,430
and happier now.

404
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,310
It was not your fault.

405
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,830
It was his choice.

406
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,990
He chose you,

407
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,670
but didn't have the courage to face the consequences.

408
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,990
He was the one who gave up on you.

409
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,510
You just chose

410
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,590
a hard path

411
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,310
It's a

and bumpy path.

414
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,670
You got tired

415
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,830
and burned out through

416
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,990
and went down

417
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,060
different paths in life.

418
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,190
In fact, none of you were wrong.

423

and he loved you.

424
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,190
Really?

425

Actually,

you were just on the upswing of your career.

427

You hadn't found a good balance

428
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,790
between your feelings

429
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,390
and your career.

430
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,870
But still,

431
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,110
I want to thank him.

If he hadn't given up on you,

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,070
When my sister was in college,

524
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,430
she was the women's swimming team competition champion.

525
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,310
You didn't expect that, did you?

526
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,750
She can save Lai Zhengyi

527
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,710
by herself.

528
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,910
No need to ask me that question.

529
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,190
I don't even have to help him.

530
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,070
What if I don't know how to swim?

531
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,750
Who will you save?

532
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,670
Sister,

533
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,950
such a childish question,

534
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,070
why are you so serious?

535
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,590
Who will you save?

536
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,070
I'll save...

537
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,070
It's okay, Lili.

538
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:58,470
I know how to swim,

539
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,670
you can save your sister.

540
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,190
You're more understanding.

541
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,190
Can you two stop

542
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,270
showing your love there?

543
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,430
I'm so disgusted by you guys that I can't eat.

544
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,110
Has the new project been set?

545
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,310
Which IP has been chosen?

546
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,150
Why do you want to talk about work after work hours?

547
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,150
Does getting off work mean

548
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,390
you can completely relax?

549
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,990
I am afraid that some one's minds

550
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,430
are not used to work at all.

551
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,870
You just think about living a comfortable life.

552
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,670
Someone was emotional,

553
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,230
so it led to a lot of difficulties in the project.

554
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,550
However, she stayed out of the situation.

555
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,510
In the end,

556
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,430
it was Jiang Lili who had to solve the problems.

557
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,510
Emotional?

558
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,070
Well...

559
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,350
That...

560
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,470
I've thought about

561
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,030
Jiangjiang's copyright.

562
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,750
Go and get the contract down.

563
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,390
Let's sign the contract right now.

564
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:47,990
Okay.

565
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:49,630
You are the best!

566
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,310
Go! Hurry up!

567
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,150
Lili cares about you so much

568
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,350
that she does whatever you say.

569
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,190
But you should

570
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,790
think more about her

571
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,790
instead of swaying her life.

572
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,990
What would she think

573
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,790
if she knew that you were deliberately approaching her

574
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,110
and secretly investigating her

575
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,750
behind her back?

576
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,670
God will never disappoint a child

577
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,230
who works hard.

578
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,150
I finally got the copyright.

579
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:45,230
What happened to you?

580
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,270
You've been moping around

581
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,830
since you got back from my sister's house just now.

582
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:50,900
I'm thinking

583
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,070
I shouldn't have gone back with you today.

584
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,950
Why did you say so?

585
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,310
Did my sister bully you?

586
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,150
No.

587
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,550
I'm just afraid

588
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,390
you'll be embarrassed.

589
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,750
How can I?

590
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,430
You all love me so much.

591
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,750
These are all very sweet things.

592
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,470
I'm happy.

593
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,150
What would you think

594
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,430
if your sister says that I actually approached you

595
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,590
with premeditation?

596
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,190
With premeditation?

597
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,670
Because you like me,

598
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,830
that's why you're approaching me.

599
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,030
There's no problem with that.

600
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:26,710
That's right.

601
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,550
Ah!

602
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,940
Where is this button?

603
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,790
When did it miss?

604
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,300
I guess it fell out.

605
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,590
What a pity!

606
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,500
You didn't find it at home?

607
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:45,230
Never mind.

608
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:45,750
It couldn't have fallen here, could it?

609
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,430
Don't look for it.

610
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,470
It doesn't matter.

611
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,430
No.

612
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,310
This shirt looks good on you.

613
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,270
It won't be complete

614
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,550
if this button is missing.

615
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,990
You have to sew on a button.

616
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,390
I got it!

617
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,030
I can give you this

618
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,710
to use as a button for you.

619
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,790
It's just fit.

620
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,070
That's good.

621
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:07,990
It's quite a match.

622
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,070
The size is also just right.

623
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,870
I'll put it on for you.

624
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:14,550
It's done.

625
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:15,590
Look.

626
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,470
Is that okay?

627
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,790
It's special.

628
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,270
And this side.

629
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,630
This side too?

630
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,150
Yeah.

631
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,870
Okay.

632
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,950
I'll put this on for you too.

633
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,230
It's done.

634
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,670
Wow!

635
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,590
This is the mark of Jiang Lili's stuff.

636
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,830
It's so pretty!

637
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,550
It looks better than on my ears.

638
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,390
So chic!

639
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,340
[Copyright contract of I am a maid in the Evil Cult]

640
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,670
You've signed the contract.

641
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,310
Sister Xiaoran,

642
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,990
you're so great.

643
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,550
Sister Xiaoran is awesome.

644
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,110
Sister Xiaoran's ability is amazing!

645
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:15,710
Well...

646
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,910
I just don't understand whether Qin Yanfei

647
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,830
has any principles or not?

648
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:18,630
Huh?

649
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,670
He signed the contract directly.

650
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,710
My carefully crafted The 108 ways to take down Qin Yanfei

651
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,870
has not yet come in handy.

652
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,230
Although your ways did not come in handy.

653
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,590
it is enough to have this heart.

654
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,430
Next,

655
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,310
you can stay rest.

656
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,910
No.

657
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,150
This is my project.

658
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,710
I must make the Maid

659
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,740
more explosive than

660
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,070
The Journey of the Youth.

661
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,230
Now that we have the copyright,

662
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,070
shouldn't we

663
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,190
have a launch party next?

664
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,270
That's right.

665
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,940
Yeah.

666
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,390
When the time comes, we must ask Mr. Qin

667
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,870
to go to the scene to warm up for our Maid.

668
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,630
Okay.

669
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,990
Everyone, get ready.

670
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,710
Yes.

671
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,630
You all pretend you can't hear me?

672
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,750
What's that sound?

673
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,390
Who's talking?

674
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,870
How can Mr. Lai Jr. and Mr. Lai be so different

675
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,550
when they both grew up

676
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,310
in the same family?

677
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,910
He just has nothing to do day after day.

678
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,510
He loiters every day.

679
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,190
No matter how rich the Lai family is,

680
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:10,630
it's not enough for him.

681
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,590
That's true.

682
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,830
This biological son is not as good as the adopted son.

683
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,110
It's no wonder Chairman Lai

684
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,390
doesn't give him a good look.

685
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,390
Come on.

686
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,830
Even if he doesn't try any harder,

687
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,270
he still has a rich father.

688
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,590
He is really lucky.

689
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,030
Are you guys done talking?

690
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,230
Here.

691
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,390
Have some cake and don't get angry.

692
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,270
No.

693
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,030
How can they say that about me?

694
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,740
How do they know I'm not trying?

695
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,670
Bunch of gossips.

696
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,470
They're talking nonsense all day long.

697
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,910
They said that

698
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,110
only because they are jealous of you.

699
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,150
Then balance their inferiority complex by

Don't be angry.

Hum!

703
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:56,030
How can a brave lion turn back

704
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,830
because a dog barks?

705
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,030
By the way, wait.

Come here and take a look.

707
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,150

716

Okay.

717
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,950
So you can have some cake now, right?

718
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,710
No.

You are responsible for contacting the media.

725
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,950
How can a brave lion

726
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,550
do such a small job?

727
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,470
Didn't you just say you want to

728
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,950
make the Maid an absolute hit?

729
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,670
How come you don't want to do this thing?

730
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,700
And contacting the media

731
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,990
is the most important part.

732
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,430
Is it possible that

733
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,070
a Lemeng Picture of this magnitude

734
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,750
has no media coverage?

735
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:51,900
The ones we contact

736
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,350
are important media.

737
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,630
And the Maid

738
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,990
needs positive coverage.

739
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,190
Stop.

740
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,630
I'll do it.

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,870
It's just a few phone calls.

Hello, Mr. Qin.

794
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,590
Through the communication just now,

795
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,830
we learned that you didn't want to

796

make I'm a Maid in a Evil Cult

in the first place.

798
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,550
I would like to ask you,

799
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:25,150
what were your thoughts at that time in the early stage?

800
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,310
Well...

801
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,310
In fact,

802
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,710
I thought this work is not particularly suitable

803
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:31,670
for remake into a film

804
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,550
and television series,

805
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,450
This work of his...

806
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,260
or put on the screen.

807
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,000
is a plagiarized work.

00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,670
What?

809
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,230
