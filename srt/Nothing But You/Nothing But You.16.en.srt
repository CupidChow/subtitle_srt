Meeting dismissed.

179
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,740
You can't just shoot

180
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,580
a plagiarized project.

181
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,740
How to fix this?

182
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,420
Mr. Lai.

183
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,810
You must trust me.

184
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,290
Qin Yanfei didn't plagiarize anything.

185
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,260
He can make a statement

186
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,620
and clarify himself.

187
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,460
Our company has wasted

188
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,170
so much efforts on this project.

189

Even Lai Zhengling has started learning IP adaptions.

190
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,980
So we really shouldn't give it up so easily.

191

203
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,420
All because of a bitch who made a scene?

204

They're going to give up this future blockbuster project?

205

No.

208
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,860
in the name of the future CEO.

209

Take your time.

210
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,180
Xiaoran will take good care of it.

There is no time for me.

212

Those shareholders are the black sheep of our company.

213
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,660
Once I become the CEO,

214
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,940
I'll fire them all.

215

Fine, fine, fine.

216

When you become the CEO,

you can do whatever you want.

Don't you have something to say to me?

You can't abandon Qin Yanfei's project.

221

I know you want to help Qin Yanfei.

222

He didn't plagiarize anything.

I'll find the evidence.

226

The company will look into it.

227
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,500
But Zhang Xueying struck first,

228
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,660
the public already has

229
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,330
a bias against

230
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,460
Qin Yanfei that he did plagiarism.

231
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,540
It's hard to

232
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,490
change people's bias.

233
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,580
You know that.

234
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,780
Lemeng won't use celebrities who caught in scandals,

235
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,530
let alone work with bad reputation.

236
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,419
Qin Yanfei didn't do anything wrong.

237
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,659
Besides, you said it's the bias,

238
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,340
which means their opinions must go wrong.

239
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,860
We should turn the table in time.

240

245

has been finished for so many years,

246
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,220
but why did Zhang Xueying show up at this moment?

247
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,610
Who knows what she's up to?

248
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,020
Because this novel will be adapted into film and television program.

249
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,940
It's a good time for her to gain fame and fortune.

250
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,380
She showed up now

251
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,620
and it must be for the money.

252

If our company continue making this project.

253
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,980
She's not going to let this go so easily.

254

If she wants money,

255
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,730
then we just give it to her.

256
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,860
Giving her the money means

257
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,980
we admit that Qin Yanfei did plagiarism.

258
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,380
What should we do?

259
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,450
I knew that you believe in him.

260
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,220
Then you have to clear his name,

261

and prove it to everyone.

262

This is very tricky.

it's a good opportunity

It was your fault.

So did you plagiarize or not?

372
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,670
It's impossible!

373
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,870
There's no way for me to plagiarize her work.

374
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,110
You didn't plagiarize her work,

and you didn't know her.

376
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,510
Then why is her novel exactly the same as yours?

377
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,510
And her book was published before yours.

What on earth is she up to?

I asked Ding Dong to contact her.

Then I'll read it with you.

519
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,130
There's no need to do so.

520
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,680
Go back and get some sleep.

521
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,000
Woman who stays up will gets older.

522
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,370
I like the young ones.

523
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,160
I'm older than you.

524
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,330
I didn't mean...

525
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,720
I...

526
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,450
I didn't mean that.

527
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,490
I'm saying...

528
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,840
Anway.

529
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,360
Fine, fine, fine.

530
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
Go back home and get some sleep.

531
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,040
Don't mess around.

532
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,450
There are more than

533
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,960
thousands of chapters of the two books.

534
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,680
You can't finish them all by yourself.

535
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,610
Then I will...

536
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,450
Do as what I say.

537
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,530
Then, how about

538
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,800
tomorrow...

539
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,610
I'll buy you

540
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,130
the most expensive cosmetic tomorrow.

541
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,210
Read your book.

542
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,160
Hurry up!

543
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,080
Understood.

544
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,320
You read it out loud,

545
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
I'll do the checking.

546
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,800
Alright.

547
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,170
She grimed,

548
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,170
there is no such time

549
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,800
more authentic than now.

550
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,770
Even if there is no love,

551
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:30,440
there will be a long-lasting couple.

552
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,250
Have you eaten yet?

553
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,590
No.

554
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,270
What's wrong?

555
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:10,410
I'm charging.

556
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:13,990
If you want to charge your power,

557
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,600
then take your time.

558
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,350
Zhang Xueying has sent another post.

559
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,190
An accusation to the plagiarists.

[Zhang Xueying accuses the plagiarist, calling for protection of originality]

561

[Entertainment news, Zhang Xueying accuses the plagiarist, calling for protection of originality]

563
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,590
Every work

564
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,030
is the creator's child.

565
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,560
Those plagiarists are thieves,

566
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,320
bandits.

567
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,090
They deserve to be

568
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,810
punished and condemned by the law.

569
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,290
Although I'm not famous.

570
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,690
I'm like every content creator.

571

572
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,560
and we love literature.

573
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,290
I will never allow the plagiarist

574
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:49,970
to turn our love

575

577

Ding Dong and I went to see her this afternoon.

578
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,760
She didn't say anything.

579
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,290
Now she says so much

580
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,570
on the internet.

581
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,420
You shouldn't go to see her in a hurry.

582
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,260
You should find out

583
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,420
what kind of person she is first.

584
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,540
How can I find that out?

585
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,380
Qin Yanfei didn't even know about her.

586
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,740
Qin Yanfei didn't know her,

587
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,380
doesn't mean she didn't know Qin Yanfei.

588
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,610
If she's the one who designed the plagiarism.

589
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,090
She must have known how would the story goes

590
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,770
of The Maid of the Evil Cult.

591
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,100
Is there any possibilities that she might have an access to the manuscript?

592
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,020
Make sense.

593
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,900
But how should I investigate this?

594
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,580
Should I hire a private detective?

595
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,140
It's not that complicating.

596
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,100
It's easy to

597
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,940
figure out one's relationship circles these days.

598
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,300
The internet is the best tool.

599
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
We can first

600
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,940
focus on

601
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,900
her former friends.

602
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,580
Her former friends?

603
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Why?

604
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,220
If an unrelated person gets famous,

605
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,900
you probably will give your congratulation.

606
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,260
But if you saw someone around you

607
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,620
is having a good life,

608
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,020
you'll get a bit of jealous or unhappy

609
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,980
about them, more or less.

610

611
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,690

You're so smart.

613

How are you going to thank me?

614
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,820
I need to charge again.

615

Here.

616
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,820
Fully charged!

Before I sent it out,

635

Everyone is asleep.

645

is 0.5 seconds longer than other photos.

676

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,780
Other than these,

689
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,740
she didn't post anything else.

690
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,500
She must have deleted them all.

691
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,100
What a scheming person.

692
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,210
Let's check her history avatars.

693
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,780
Look at this.

694
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,930
She was taking pictures with the same girl.

695
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,660
That's her.

696
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,730
Let's search what her name is.

697
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,090
Here, her name is "Sweet Orange".

698
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,820
[Sweet Orange]

699
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,180
She seems like an influncer.

700
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
Well.

701
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,780
Vienna Hotel.

702
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,030
[Sweet Orange: The coolest hotel, Vienna Hotel in Jiangbin City]

703
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,140
Ten hours ago.

704
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,420
Last night, Zhang Xueying made a scene,

705
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,770
and it goes viral on the internet today.

706
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,810
These books are almost identical.

707
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,330
Did Qin Yanfei plagiarize her work for real?

708
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,420
It's impossible!

709
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,860
Have you read it or not?

710
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,020
The two books are 90% similar.

711
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,220
It can't be such a coincidence, right?

712
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,740
If these books are almost identical,

713
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,940
which means Zhang Xueying must have

714
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,460
an access to the original manuscript.

715
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,460
Besides, she didn't just see some parts of it, but all of it.

716
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,460
Things have got

717
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,740
a lot of progress so far.

718
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,380
I believe there will be a new turn soon.

719
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,740
What kind of new turn

720
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,260
or progress is this?

721
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,620
These are just

722
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,820
a bunch of useless stuff.

723
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,620
If we don't get it right tomorrow.

724
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:00,820
This project

725
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,700
will be doomed, everybody.

726
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,900
We've worked so hard for such a long time,

727
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,700
and it will be all for nothing.

728
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,820
Don't effect our morales here.

729
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,500
Everyone, don't get discouraged.

730
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,420
Keep going! Cheer up.

731
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,410
-Keep going. -Cheer up.

732
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,420
Are you sure this is the place?

733
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,260
I suppose so.

734
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,010
This is the location in the picture she posted.

735
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:27,980
She's coming.

736
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,700
So in my opinion...

737
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,420
Is Bi Xiaoran not famous anymore?

738
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,220
Or is she not recognizable?

739
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,980
Xiaoran,

740
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,420
do you want a cup of coffee?

741
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,500
Bi Xiaoran?

742
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,260
Are you really the Bi Xiaoran?

743
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,140
Sister Xiaoran.

744
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,300
I took a glance at you,

745
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,660
and I felt familiar about it.

746
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,740
But I was not so sure about that.

747
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:58,620
I am Bi Xiaoran.

748
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,220
Let's take a photo together?

749
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,500
This is so beautiful.

750
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,860
I'm always your big fan.

751
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,590
I didn't expect

752
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,060
to see you here today.

753
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,020
Can I add your WeChat number?

754
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,380
This is my first time to come here.

755
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,620
I'm here to see Zhang Xueying.

756
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,460
Her?

757
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,260
She can't afford to live

758
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,820
in such a fancy hotel.

759
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,220
I heard that she's making scenes around these days.

760
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,860
She must have given you a hard time.

761
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,940
Do you know each other?

762
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,220
Of course we do.

763
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,410
We were classmates before.

764
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,090
She used to cling to me all the time.

765
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,300
Classmates?

766
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,140
Then did she write books before?

767
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,380
No.

768
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,900
It's quite funny to say this.

769
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,100
She used to be Qin Yanfei's fan.

770
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,500
Later, she made a boyfriend,

771
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,020
and his boyfriend was an editor of Qin Yanfei.

772
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,820
Now that

773
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,260
she was saying Qin Yanfei did plagiarism of her book.

774
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,460
Her boyfriend

775
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,980
was Qin Yanfei's editor?

776
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,980
It's her ex-ex-ex-ex boyfriend.

777
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,420
His name is

778
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,140
like Chen Tang or something?

779
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,700
I also have a picture of them.

780
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,660
Can you show it to me?

781
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,940
Then, let's add WeChat friends.

782
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,820
I'll send it to you.

783
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,780
No problem.

784
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,700
Here.

785
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,780
Let's take a scan to add friends.

786
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,650
Good.

787
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,580
I'll scan your number.

788
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:17,850
Okay.

789
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,970
I've sent it to you.

790
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,660
Hello?

791
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,420
Chunying.

792
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,300
How is it going?

793
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,180
I was waiting for Lemeng

794
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,300
to give me the message.

795
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,860
Let's see how much they'll compensate me.

796
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,100
They didn't come to you before?

797
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,300
Bi Xiaoran came to me once.

798
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,700
I thought she was there to negotiate about the compensation.

799
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,740
But turned out, she was saying she wanted to learn more about the situation.

800
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:43,860
They were so hilarious.

801
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,030
The longer it goes,

802
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,100
the better for me.

803
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,690
I heard it on the grapevine

804
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,370
that Lemeng might abandon the project of The Maid of the Evil Cult.

805
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,610
Are you sure?

806
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,460
Is this news reliable?

807
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,950
I don't know if it's true.

808
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,940
Anyway, it's up to you.

809
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,060
Don't play with fire.

810
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,730
Be careful.

811
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,700
Okay, I see.

812
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,340
Who are you?

813
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,610
The future

814
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,740
CEO of Lemeng.

815
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,700
You're from Lemeng?

816
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,180
What do you want from me?

817
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,340
Cut the bullshit.

818
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,600
I just want to know

819
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,170
what exactly do you want,

820
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,460
if you would let Qing Yanfei go.

821
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,620
Qing Yanfei plagiarized my book.

822
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,260
I'm protecting my rights in a legal way.

823
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Cut the crap.

824
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,670
I have no time to play with you.

825
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,940
Are you the boss? Is it up to you?

826
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,090
I'm telling you.

827
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,970
Lemng Picture is mine.

828
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,060
Actually,

829
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,980
I didn't want to make a big scene.

830
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,340
But,

831
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,100
someone has to pay for my loss.

832
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,360
Give me five million yuan,

833
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,300
then I'll give up pressing charge.

834
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,490
Five million yuan?

835
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,660
Are you crazy?

836
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,880
Why don't you just rob us?

837
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,020
You think it's happy beans, the game currency?

838
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,700
It's okay if you don't want to give the money.

839
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,680
I...

840
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,020
Crazy bitch.

841
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,580
Five million yuan?

842
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,660
She thinks life is a TV show,

843
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,840
and the money come from nowhere?

844
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,100
Tomorrow is the third day.

845
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,220
If we can't come up with a plan.

846
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,780
This project is going to be abandoned.

847
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,660
They grew up in the same family.

848
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,540
Why are Mr. Lai and Mr. Lai Jr.

849
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,940
so different?

850
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,900
See, he fools around everyday.

851
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,160
He's just a typical rich kid.

852
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,700
No matter how rich Lai family is.

853
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,930
He's going to dissipate his family fortune.

854
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,860
You're right.

855
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,900
The biological son can't compete with than the adopted son.

856
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,260
No wonder Chairman Lai gave him a hard time.

857
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,820
Five million yuan?

858
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,900
It's an easy task.

859
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,660
Sister, I'm back.

860
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,820
There's some progress.

861
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,020
Jiangjiang.

862
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,410
Last night, your sister wouldn't allow me to sleep.

863
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,180
She forced me to figure out a solution all night.

864
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,820
Later I thought about it.

865
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,140
I did know a few editors.

866
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,140
Right?

867
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,820
Take a look.

868
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,220
Is he one of your editors?

869
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,540
Is he the one?

870
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,860
Yes, yes!

871
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,020
He's the most enthusiastic one.

872
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,020
At that time, I showed him the story outline as well.

873
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,180
You showed him the story outline?

874
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,460
Then it must be him, with no doubt!

875
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,260
Go and confront with him.

876
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,530
I made a phone call with him last night.

877
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,780
He said he's out of town.

878
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,820
He'll be back tomorrow.

879
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,780
Tomorrow?

880
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,700
No.

881
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,780
Tomorrow is the last day.

882
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,940
We have no time.

883
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,090
If there's no turns,

884
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,420
we're about to fail.

885
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,980
Stupid girl.

886
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,180
Time and rules

887
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,570
are made to be broken.

888
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,020
If we tried our best,

889
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,290
there will be a favourable turn.

890
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,380
I'll trust you this time.

891
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,050
Speaking of time...

892
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,740
It's all your fault.

893
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,660
You're watching TV?

894
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,340
What do you want?

895
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,580
You want to charge your power again?

896
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,860
No.

897
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,380
I want to give you

898
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,970
a quick update about the work.

899
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:49,650
I did what you said,

900
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,900
I checked Zhang Xueying's information.

901
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,770
Then I found

902
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:52,940
the most important clue.

903
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,900
Zhang Xueying's ex-boyfriend

904
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,660
used to be Qin Yanfei's editor.

905
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,620
Isn't that surprising?

906
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,220
So I highly doubt that

907
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,660
he gave Qin Yanfei's manuscript

908
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,740
to Zhang Xueying.

909
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,820
So right now, we need to find the ex-boyfriend of Zhang Xueying.

910
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,980
Then the truth will reveal itself.

911
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,940
That's it.

912
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,940
So, based on such a big clue.

913
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:09,780
Do you think

914
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,100
I could get some rewards?

915
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,820
Hmm.

916
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,860
Clothes, bags, jewelry.

917
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,580
What do you want?

918
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,540
I'll buy them for you.

919
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,300
I don't want any of these.

920
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,140
Swipe my card.

921
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,900
What?

922
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,820
You don't need it?

923
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,500
Yes, I need it!

924
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,540
I need this, too.

925
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,700
I was actually thinking...

926
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,980
What exactly do you want?

927
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,900
It's nothing.
