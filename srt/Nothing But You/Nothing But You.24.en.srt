4
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,580
Lili,

5
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,820
your friend came to see you.

6
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,820
Friend?

7
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:48,660
Ning Xia.

8
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,220
Sorry,

9
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,539
I made you worried about me.

10
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,580
I heard Chenyang say you were sick.

11
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,860
So I came to see you.

12
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,500
I'm better now.

13
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,300
Where did you

14
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,660
get this shirt?

15
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,300
What's wrong?

16
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,660
Isn't this Lai Zhengyi's?

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,860
How do you know?

18
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,540
Because I scraped off

19
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,780
this button.

20
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,780
I sewed it on with my earrings.

21
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,970
Yes, right.

22
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,860
It's his.

23
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,140
Why are you

24
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,780
wearing his shirt?

25
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,020
What do you think?

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,100
But,

27
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,620
don't you like Ye Chenyang?

28
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,250
So,

29
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,180
you're lying to me, too.

30
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,860
Jiang Lili,

31
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,940
leaving Zhengyi

32
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,500
is good for both of you.

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,020
I don't need anyone to tell me

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,340
who I'm suitable for

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,740
and who I like to be with.

36
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,420
Are you angry,

37
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,660
aggrieved,

38
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,860
and unhappy?

39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,650
Or, hate me very much?

40
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,140
You need to know that,

41
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,980
even if it wasn't me,

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,940
there would be a lot of people around him.

43
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,900
Those lascivious women

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,220
are more seductive than I am.

45
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,540
Can you handle that?

46
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,820
No matter what will happen in the future,

47
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,730
who he'll be with,

48
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,620
or how many people will be around him,

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,410
I won't be afraid.

50
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,660
Because I love him.

51
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
You love him?

52
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,900
All you love is

53
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,260
the masquerade of his tenderness and kindness.

54
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,340
You can't accept

55
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,300
the other side of him at all.

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,220
The other side?

57
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,329
If you want to stay with him in the future,

58
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,180
you have to know the real him.

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,780
It's time to eat, Mom.

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,740
Lili.

61
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,700
Lili,

62
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,420
time to eat!

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,329
Come and get it!

64
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,700
Mom, stop calling her.

65
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,780
She doesn't want to eat.

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,300
Ah.

67
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,100
Why?

68
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,700
Unhappy again?

69
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,860
A friend came to see her this morning.

70
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,700
I thought she'd be happy.

71
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,930
But,

72
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,540
she hasn't left her room all day.

73
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,700
A friend?

74
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,620
Yes.

75
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:21,320
Crybaby,

76
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,710
your eyes are swollen like goldfish.

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,940
Parents and I

78
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,140
were opposed to you and Lai Zhengyi being together before.

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
Now you regret it.

80
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,030
I am sad,

81
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,820
but I never regret it.

82
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,980
Stupid girl.

83
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,540
Sister,

84
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,060
if you love a person,

85
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,380
should you accept all of him?

86
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,940
Love is not omnipotent.

87
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,260
Everything

88
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,180
must have a basic view of right and wrong.

89
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,860
Many things

90
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,850
are not what you think.

91
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,980
Maybe

92
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,180
Lai Zhengyi also has reasons

93
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,260
that he can't tell you.

94
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,580
Sister,

95
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,220
I've been thinking about it for so many days.

96
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,100
I'm also responsible for

97
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,180
what happened.

98
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,660
I didn't give him

99
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,170
enough sense of security.

100
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,420
I was too heartless

101
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,180
to notice his uneasiness.

102
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,140
We had a lot of quarrels

103
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,140
because of Ning Xia before.

104
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,140
It is all because I like him so much

105
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,820
that I am always nervous

106
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,220
and afraid of losing him.

107
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,060
Jiang Lili,

108
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,500
you are such an idiot in love.

109
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,900
You still speak for him.

110
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,100
I just consider others in their places.

111
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,000
So,

112
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,140
even if you don't see him

113
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,080
and snub him,

114
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,620
you still don't want to break up with him.

115
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,300
I really like him.

116
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,670
I know, I know.

117
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,270
What should I do?

118
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,220
Just cry out.

119
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,460
It's you who make me do this.

120
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,500
Concealing something deliberately

121
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,900
can be self-defeating.

122
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,250
Only a fool will be

123
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,460
penny-wise and pound-foolish.

124
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,180
Brother, it's time to get off work.

125
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,420
Let's go to get a drink.

126
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,140
Make it tomorrow.

127
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,260
I know you feel bad.

128
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,659
But an emotional setback

129
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,700
will never destroy

130
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,940
a strong man.

131
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,100
Let's have a drink tonight

132
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,820
and don't go home

133
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,740
until we get drunk.

134
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,540
When you wake up tomorrow,

135
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,140
you will have a new life.

136
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,659
I'm sure you have a way

137
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,780
to get Lili back.

138
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,659
No.

139
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,140
I'll get her back now.

140
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,820
That's the way you are.

141
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,740
♫I'll chase after you despite thousands of miles♫

142
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,060
Hey,

143
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,540
there's that boy again.

144
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,500
He is down there.

145
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,340
Again?

146
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,980
If he is always like this,

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,580
it will spoil his health.

148
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
It's terrible.

149
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:32,700
It's late now.

150
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,539
Where are you going?

151
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,020
I'm going to get a glass of water.

152
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,820
I'm thirsty.

153
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,900
Go to have a look quickly.

154
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,340
I'm just to see

155
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,740
if the garbage truck is coming.

156
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,300
I'm not going to see him.

157
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,380
Hurry up.

158
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,060
I don't want to see him.

159
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,730
I,

160
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,580
I,

161
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,740
I take out the trash.

162
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,020
I just did that.

163
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,500
I'm going to take out the trash.

164
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:44,980
Lili.

165
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,900
Don't touch me.

166
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,660
I have something to tell you.

167
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,100
What's this?

168
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,140
You,

169
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,940
you're spying on me.

170
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,900
Since Ye Chenyang returned to China,

171
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,140
I've lived in restlessness all the time.

172
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,580
I'm afraid.

173
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,940
I'm afraid that he'll take you away

174
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,260
like what he did when we were kids.

175
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,620
So I'm dying to know

176
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,700
where you are,

353
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:41,980
Ah.

354
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,500
What did you just say?

355
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,380
I said I haven't been very busy lately.

356

359

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,250

361
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,260

Lili,

363
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
I told you

364
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,900
it's okay if you don't forgive me.

365
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,540
But...

366
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,300
I hate to see you now.

367
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,660
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

368
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,860
Let's break up.

369
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:47,750
Lili,

370
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,620
what's going on?

371
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,660
It's over.

372
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,660
Let me go.

373
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,620
Dad and Mom will have a physical examination tomorrow,

374
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,540
and you drive them there in my car.

375
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,620
What're you doing?

376
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm afraid not.

377
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,220
I'm going to Australia

378
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,090
at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

379
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,380
Australia?

380
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,300
Why are you going there?

381
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,540
Just have a relax

382
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,980
and heal the hurt of feelings.

383
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,260
Heal the hurt of feelings?

384
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,820
Haven't you already

385
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,460
made up with Lai Zhengyi?

386
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,500
We broke up.

387
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,540
After thinking about it for a long time,

388
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,140
I still feel that I can't forgive him.

389
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,500
It was Ye Chenyang

390
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,580
who started the dirty work.

391
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,500
Lai Zhengyi,

392
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,900
he just gave tit for tat.

393
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,900
And if we hadn't found out in time

394
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,340
and remade the schedule,

395
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,140
Lemeng Pictures would have faced huge losses.

396
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,380
Did you know that he sent someone to track me,

397
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,380
investigate me,

398
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,900
and monitor my life?

399
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,780
Don't you think it's scary?

400
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,860
I can't be with

401
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,010
a pervert.

402
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,340
You went out the door with a bright face in the morning,

403
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,420
but changed your face in the evening.

404
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,500
Jiang Lili, don't try to hide something from me.

405
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,740
What's going on?

406
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,820
Nothing.

407
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,130
I just don't love him.

408
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,060
Why are you coming here?

409
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,380
Let's have a talk.

410
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,340
Sit here.

411
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,060
I went to see Jiang Lili.

412
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,300
What did you say to her?

413
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,020
You love her so much.

414
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,540
I just want to see

415
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,020
if she loves you enough.

416
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,500
I thought that

417
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,540
as long as I stayed with you,

418
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,380
one day

419
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,620
you would like me.

420
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,020
But the appearance of Jiang Lili

421
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,180
has wakened me up.

422
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,420
It turns out that everything is my fantasy.

423
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:15,740
I can never

424
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,750
get into your heart.

425
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,540
Senior, I...

426
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,740
I saw how confident she was

427
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,180
when she said she loved you.

428
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,540
I really envy her.

429
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,980
It's you who gives her the courage to be brave.

430
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,260
But I,

431
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,180
I'm just bluffing.

432
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,610
I'm tired.

433
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,140
So,

434
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,180
I decide to bless you.

435
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,380
Senior,

436
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,620
you are always my most trusted sister

and in the future.

440
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,700
I want you to be happy more than anyone else.

441
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,300
I really hope

442
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,500
you and Lili can be happy.

443
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,590
Thanks.

444
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,340
I'm going back to the company

445

Did you buy this new one?

I have one, too.

449
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,060
It is an Australian niche brand.

450
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,340
But mine is different from yours.

Where did you buy it?

453
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,860
This is a gift from Ye Chenyang to Lili.

454
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,060
I can't believe

455
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,380
he installed a pinhole camera in it.

456
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,850
He has always been an aboveboard man.

457
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,660
I didn't expect him

458
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,140
to be so unscrupulous for an end.

459

As a company executive,

463

You and your sister have completely different personalities

and ways of doing things.

471
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,260
You mustn't tell anyone about it.

472

Be sure to keep it a secret,

or else Lemeng Pictures will be finished.

It is true that the approach of Lemeng Pictures is inappropriate,

During that time,

606
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,820
there are people who hurt me,

607
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,220
people who protect me,

608
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,370
and people

609
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,460
who travel thousands of miles

610
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,700
against the light

611
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,780
to give me all the tenderness and love.

612
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,540
I will move on

613
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,900
with love

614
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,130
and hope.

615

616
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,220
is Mrs. Lai.
