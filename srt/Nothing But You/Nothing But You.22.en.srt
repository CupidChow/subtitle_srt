Okay.

Mr. Wang from next door.

Yangyang is now at our home.

Little Taiyang,

Why are you at my house?

23
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,670
I just passed by your house

Thank you so much.

74

about the type of girls he likes.

76
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,710
Surprisingly, he just happens to like your type of girl.

77
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,670
So I was wondering if you guys

78
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,790
might have a crush on each other?

79
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,590
A crush on each other?

80
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,150
Why don't I feel it?

81
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,190
That's because those closely involved cannot see clearly.

82
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,230
Don't worry.

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,070
And it together with

87

the sweet confession of returning to 18.

88

Great.

90
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,710

91
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,100
you must come with me.

Okay.

96
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,070
Mr. Lai, I covertly investigated the leak of the project schedule.

97
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,710
I found out that this matter may be related to Ye Chenyang.

98
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,950
Ye Chenyang has just returned to China not long ago,

99

he should be here to

100
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,990
solve the funding problem of Universal Picture's China branch.

101
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,470
He seems to have gotten very close to the people in Tianqi Video recently.

102
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,070
If he leaked the project schedule to them,

103
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,270
it would be a big loss for Lemeng.

We are both still working overtime,

179
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,950
that's so sad.

180
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,710
I really

181
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,390
envy Lili at times.

182
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,710
And I envy her freedom

183
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,950
to go out and play everywhere.

184
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,070
She is having a picnic

185
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,510
with Chenyang now.

186
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,909
I would like to

187
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,510
go out and relax sometime, too.

188
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,510
Picnic?

189
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,310
Yeah.

190
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,070
That's right.

191
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,710
Look.

192
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,430
How happy they are.

193
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:01,950
Yeah.

194
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,710
They look so happy.

195
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,710
Your phone keeps ringing.

196
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,310
You're busy, too.

197
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,710
Yes.

198
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,710
Now the company

199
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,710
is underfunded

200
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,630
and urgently needs funds to cover the deficit.

201
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,110
I have

202
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,140
just returned to China,

203
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,710
so this problem is a bit tricky for me.

204
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,910
I've done the job of looking for investment before,

205
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,150
and it's really hard.

206
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,430
It's exhausting and difficult.

207
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,909
But no matter how tired and hard it is,

208
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:36,990
I have to persevere.

209
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,390
I want to be the chief executive officer

210
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,550
of the branch.

211
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,590
You can definitely become the CEO.

212
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,510
I believe in you.

213
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,270
You are my little hero.

214
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,430
Mr. Lai,

215
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,190
why are you back so early today?

216
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,750
Where have you been?

217
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,790
I took my mom to go shopping today.

218
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,150
Is that true?

219
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,870
Yeah.

220
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,630
We had a lot of fun.

221
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,390
here is a lake in that park,

222
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,380
and it is very beautiful.

223
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,190
I can't believe that

224
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,190
you would lie to me.

225
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,870
What are you talking about?

226
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,270
Nothing.

227
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,830
Are you tired?

228
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,150
No.

229
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,100
By the way,

230
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,630
do you know

231
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,950
any investors?

232
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,590
Why do you ask?

233
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,710
Ye Chenyang's company

234
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,790
has a problem,

235
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,950
so he is in urgent need of a sum of money.

236
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,950
If he can find the right investor

237
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,430
to fill this deficit,

238
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,070
he may be promoted

239
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,020
to CEO

240
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,070
of Universal Picture's China branch.

241
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,270
That way he can stay here.

242
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,110
If he can't get investment,

243
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,740
Universal Picture will shut down the China branch,

244
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,580
right?

245
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,750
Yep.

246
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,550
That's why I want to help him.

247
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,870
But I don't know any investors.

248
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,030
No problem,

249
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,820
I can introduce him to a few investors.

250
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,550
Really?

251
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,510
You're willing to help him?

252
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,190
What reason do I have to say no

253
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,830
when my girlfriend says so?

254
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,430
You are so kind.

255
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,750
That's great.

256
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,230
I'll give you a massage.

257
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,390
Chenyang.

258
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:14,990
Lili.

259
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,430
Let me introduce to you,

260
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,830
this is Ye Chenyang.

261
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,270
This is Lai Zhengyi,

262
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,830
the most perfect boyfriend in the universe.

263
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,790
Nice to meet you, Mr. Lai.

264
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,270
I've heard a lot about you.

265
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,310
and I finally met you.

266
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,830
What are you standing around for?

267
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,470
Have a seat.

268
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,190
Here.

269
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,230
I have heard about the financial problems

270
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,310
of the Universal Picture branch.

271
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,790
I'd like to help you.

272
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,710
I know several

273
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,620
good investors,

274
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,710
if you need,

275
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,310
I can introduce them to you.

276
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,790
I won't

277
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:54,630
bother you with this problem.

278
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,070
I have recently talked to

279
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,910
a few investors.

280
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,710
There should be no problem.

281
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,470
Never mind.

282
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,550
Universal Picture and Lemeng

283
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,750
have been great partners.

284
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,710
And you are

285
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,630
Lili's good friend,

286
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,230
so I have to help you.

287
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,790
It just so happens that Mr. Shen of Qianxi Company

288
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,110
is interested in starting a career in the film and television industry.

289
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,710
If he is willing to invest,

290
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,990
he can fill half of your capital gap.

291
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,110
Little Taiyang, don't be so polite.

292
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,350
With Mr. Lai's help,

293
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,550
any problem can be solved.

294
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,990
In fact, I have my own plans.

295
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,790
We have several other projects that

296
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,750
we would like to work with you on.

297
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,030
You will have to return this favor

298
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,350
to me later.

299
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,670
Now that you've said that,

300
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,950
I'll

301
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,510
accept your offer.

302
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,790
Cheers.

303
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,870
Thank you.

304
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,310
By the way,

305
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,070
which investors have you negotiated with?

306
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,230
This has not been confirmed

307
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,390
so far.

308
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,150
I don't know yet.

309
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,670
If you don't tell me,

310
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,990
how do I know if there are

311
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,950
suitable investors to introduce to you?

312
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,030
Okay then.

313
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,430
Mr. Sun of Shiguang Culture Company,

314
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,350
and Mr. Yuan from Wenhua Company.

315
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,990
You even got the investment from Mr. Yuan?

316
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,230
It's all because of good luck.

317
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,630
In that case,

318
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,870
can we congratulate

319
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,670
your promotion?

320
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,550
None of this has been determined yet.

321
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,390
You have a great ability.

322
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,270
I believe in you.

323
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,870
Cheers.

324
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,510
My mother always said that

325
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,830
it's much better to rely on yourself than on others.

326
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,470
In my opinion,

327
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,830
it's better to rely on you than to rely on others.

328
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,390
Mr. Lai,

329
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,150
here is your trophy.

330
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,310
I've helped you so much

331
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,550
and you just repay me with a glass of wine?

332
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,390
I have no way to repay you

333
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,670
for your great kindness.

334
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,980
I can only repay you

335
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,790
with myself.

336
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,630
That's great.

337
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,990
Do you want me to continue?

338
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,150
Well...

339
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,710
I can help you.

340
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,950
You rascal!

341
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,270
You help me?

342
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:14,870
You're so...

343
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,870
annoying!

344
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,390
It's too late.

345
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,030
Honey?

346
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,590
Sweetie?

347
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,710
This is the sugar water I prepared for you.

348
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,310
What are you doing?

349
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,990
You're frowning so hard,

350
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,190
what's wrong?

351
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,150

You can go to bed now.

You are already a proud beauty.

354
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,910
When you frown,

355
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,310
it makes you look even less approachable.

Lai zhengling

357
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,590
is usually very fierce.

358

But if you stare at him,

359
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,190
he will not even dare to speak.

360
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,790
Am I usually fierce?

361
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,990
Do you want to hear the truth?

362
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:30,990
Yeah.

363
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,070
You are usually a little bit fierce.

364
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,470
and a little bit mean,

365

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,430
impersonal.

so beautiful.

Am I a very unapproachable person?

No.

You are a very kind person.

You're so glib!

Recently, when I come back to the office,

377

the others don't even dare to look at me.

378
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,510
But when Lili is there,

379
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,110
they get along like friends.

she can get along with anyone as a buddy.

384
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,550
I think colleagues

385
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,110
should get along with each other

386
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,390
in a businesslike manner.

But Jiang Lili

388
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,190
showed me

389
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,790
a different way.

390
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,310
How did she do it?

391
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,150
It's simple.

392
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,180

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,310

because of work.

You don't need to be so polite.

Did you solve the funding issue?

I've already solved it.

Lili took me to see Lai Zhengyi a few days ago.

00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,670
At that time,

699
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,830
he asked me which investors I had found.

700
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,830
Although I don't believe him,

701
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,190
I still told him.

702
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,390
But then those people

703
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,030
all cooperated with Lin Xiwen.

704
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,310
It was all too much of a coincidence.

705

But we don't have the evidence.

706
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,190
I think we should not

tell Lili first,

708
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,350

712
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,630
I've said before that

713
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:15,910
we

714
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,190
should be honest with each other.

715
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,710
Yeah.

716
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,030

Lin Xiwen is the new leader.

726
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,630
He sent wine to many companies

Is this true?

730

When have I ever lied to you?

731

But...

732
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,110
Why do you suddenly want to ask this question?

733
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,390
Nothing.

734
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,750
I don't mean anything else.

735
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,830
Don't think too much about it.

736

No.

739

As far as I know,

740
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,070
Zhengyi and Lin Xiwen

741
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,750
have never crossed paths.

742
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,150
But this morning

743
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,990
I saw the wine that Lin Xiwen sent to him.

744
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,670
If nothing happened,

745
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,870
how could he send him wine?

746
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,540
Lin Xiwen is the new leader.

747
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,790
He sent wine to many companies

In fact, I also suspect Lai Zhengyi.

I was very busy

870
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,190
and exhausted.

871
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,590
♫What do you love about me♫

872
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,110
But at that time, as soon as I went to that apartment

873
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,230
and saw you,

874
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,310
everything became lighter and fresher.

875
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,710
I silently felt your joys and sorrows,

876
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,110
and I looked forward more and more to the official meeting with you.

877
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:51,550
But...

878
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,710
you disappeared again.

879
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,270
I didn't look for you again

880
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,740
because I didn't know whether my feelings for you

881
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,110
were fondness or nostalgia.

882
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,870
I've spent a long time thinking about it

883
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,990
and still can't confirm my feelings for you.

884
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,350
Until you recklessly appeared

885
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,830
in the conference room again.

886
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,890
At that moment

887
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,200
I had only one thought...

888
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,120
no matter what happened,

889
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,850
I'll own you.

890
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,410
No wonder you knew my name

891
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,840
the first time you saw me.

892
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,330
It's okay that you forgot about me,

893
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,880
but I remember you.

894
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,930
I keep

895
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,440
moving forward,

896
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,450
I believe that one day

897
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,320
you will see me again.
