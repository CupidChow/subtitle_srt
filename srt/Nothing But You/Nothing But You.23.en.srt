00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,500
See you.

179
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,380
How about the talk?

180
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,340
Let's go home first and talk later.

181
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,700
Let's go.

182
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,100
Why are you still here?

183
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,460
Are you not feeling well?

184
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,180
Did you tell Lili about

185
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,300
Lin Xiwen?

186
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,540
I just had doubts about it.

187
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,820
I didn't tell her.

188
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,780
No matter what you did

189
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,020
and no matter what you want,

190
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,580
anyway,

191
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,580
I won't give up on Lili.

192
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,130
What's so special about her

193
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,380
that is worth you to treat her like this?

194
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,310
["The Journey of the Youth" Promotion Meeting]

195
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,740
I've been with you all these years.

196
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,690
Don't you know

197
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,740
what I want?

198
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,380
You're just a senior schoolmate to me.

199
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,500
We had lectures and

200
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,660
started a company together.

201
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,540
We failed

202
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,420
and succeeded together.

203
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,420
We've been through a lot together these years.

204
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,820
Where is she at that time?

205
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,410
How can she take you away from me now?

206
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,540
You belong to me.

207
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,860
Ning Xia,

208
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,260
I never belong to you.

209
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:26,800
["The Journey of the Youth" Promotion Meeting]

210
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,020
She doesn't like everything about you.

211
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,060
What she likes is your fake gentleness.

212
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,020
But I'm not like her.

213
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,140
I love everything about you.

214
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,020
You and I are similar.

215
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,340
I can change

216
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,020
what she can't accept

217
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,300
and become the person she likes.

218
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,050
So, I hope that

219
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,220
you won't do anything to stop us anymore.

220
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,700
Thank you.

221
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,380
I knew long ago that Ye Chenyang is up to no good.

222
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,380
Now, he's framed.

223
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,540
He deserved it.

224
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,660
How can a man

225
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,250
allow another man like a fly

226
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,580
to stay with his wife?

227
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,880
Just fly around and around her.

228
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,020
Thank you.

229
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,700
Jiang Lili is also a fool.

230
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,900
She can't even tell.

231
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,340
No.

232
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,820
I need to tell her the truth.

233
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,460
Don't do that.

234
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,260
In a relationship, it's not that simple to

235
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,220
find out what is right and what is wrong.

236
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,500
It's their own business.

237
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,860
You have to let them deal with it.

238
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Just leave it.

239
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,540
No.

240
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,500
For my brother's happiness for the rest of his life,

241
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,140
I need to interfere with it.

242
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,500
Don't do it, Lai Zhengling.

243
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,860
Three.

244
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,740
Two.

245
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,220
Okay. Fine.

246
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,540
If you don't want me to go, I won't.

247
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,380
So what?

248
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,100
Yes, that's right.

249
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,500
Why are you here?

250
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,340
You're not welcomed here.

251
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:28,940
Just leave.

252
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,860
Mrs. Bi,

253
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,100
I want to see Lili.

254
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,380
See what?

255
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,260
I knew that you were totally unreliable.

256
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,260
I shouldn't have allowed you to

257
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,300
date her in the first place.

258
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,940
Now, you see,

259
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,860
Lili cries every day.

260
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,780
She's heartbroken.

261
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,460
Go now. Go.

262
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,820
Don't come here again.

263
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,380
It's my fault.

264
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,820
It's okay if she doesn't forgive me.

265
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,980
I just want to see her.

266
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,220
Just leave. Go.

267
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,140
She doesn't want to see you right now.

268
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:54,780
Go.

269
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,060
Don't make Lili sad again.

270
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,580
Don't catch a cold.

271
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,460
Thank you.

272
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,380
How are you?

273
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,500
Are you feeling better?

274
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,450
Much better.

275
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,770
Ning Xia told me everything.

276
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,420
It's pretty much what I expected.

277
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,300
Sorry.

278
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,300
It's my fault.

279
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,620
If I hadn't

280
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,330
asked him for help,

281
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,620
you wouldn't have been in trouble.

282
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,020
Oh, it's okay.

283
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
It's not your fault.

284
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
It's because that

285
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,820
Lai Zhengyi acts too despicably.

286
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,220
It doesn't matter if he set me up.

287
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,820
He shouldn't use you

288
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,780
and lie to you.

289
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,290
Lili,

290
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,140
will you forgive him?

291
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm not important in this issue.

292
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,610
You're the one who got hurt,

293
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,620
not me.

294
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,540
You're the most important thing

295
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,980
to me.

296
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,130
Lai Zhengyi is an expert in disguises.

297
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,980
Being with him

298
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
is hard for you.

299
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,180
Maybe

300
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,619
the best choice now

301
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,339
is to leave him.

302
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,380
You...

303
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,859
Don't worry.

304
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,900
Take your time to think about it.

305
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,460
I'll wait for you.

306
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,140
Wait!

307
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,380
I can't take this.

308
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,900
Lili told me everything.

309
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,700
I don't expect that

310
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,530
we're fated to meet each other.

311
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,140
When we were kids, you didn't want Lili to play with me.

312
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,140
Now we're adults,

313
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,260
and you still hate me.

314
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,570
You never change.

315
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,940
What're you trying to say?

316
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,100
You tried so hard to set me up

317
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,300
because I'm the one

318
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,020
she's looking for.

319
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,260
The past

320
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,820
doesn't matter anymore.

321
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,860
I'm the person that

322
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,130
she falls in love with now.

323
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,740
If you're really confident about yourself,

324
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,460
why did you do

325
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,020
such a despicable thing?

326
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,220
Well,

327
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,020
when I was a kid, I liked her.

328
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,780
After leaving the orphanage,

329
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,020
I thought I'd never see her again.

330
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,380
When she showed up

331
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,980
in front of me with a smile again,

332
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,060
I fell in love with her again.

333
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,090
But she was with you.

334
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,540
She trusted you

335
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,740
and relied on you.

336
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,180
As long as you love her and cherish her,

337
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,420
I'm willing to give you my blessing.

338
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,060
But now, it seems that

339
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,780
you fail to do that.

340
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,660
You're not good enough for Lili.

341
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,180
So reasonable.

342
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,700
But did you do that for Lili?

343
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,540
I think you know

344
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,460
what you have really done.

345
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,780
No matter what,

346
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,380
I'll take Lili away from you.

347
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,940
If she wanted to be with you,

348
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,460
she wouldn't have returned the ring to you.

349
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,060
You were really there.

350
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,140
It's cold outside.

351
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,780
He's been sitting there for such a long time.

352
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,770
He's playing a trick to win sympathy.

353
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,100
Is there any misunderstanding

354
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,460
between Lili and him?

355
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,740
You forget why Lili fainted

356
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,620
in front of the house, don't you?

357
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,140
Misunderstand what?

358
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,180
What kind of misunderstanding

359
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,170
would make Lili so angry?

360
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,180
Angelic Bitch Lai always

361
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,810
has many tricks to

362
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,420
fool Jiangjiang.

363
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,300
Why do I feel he's serious this time?

364
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,620
He spent so much time on her.

365
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,260
Where are you going?

366
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,780
I'm going to tell him to go back.

367
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,090
It's cold and raining.

368
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,100
He can't stand that

369
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,410
with such a weak physical condition.

370
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,940
Otherwise,

371
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,180
he'll get seriously ill tomorrow even if he doesn't die.

372
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,810
This is their own business.

373
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,100
Let them deal with it.

374
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,180
But...

375
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,330
Some decisions can't be made for him by others.

376
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,260
Let him think about it.

377
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
You're drunk

378
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,610
also because of Jiang Lili.

379
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,180
I like her.

380
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,100
I know.

381
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,740
Both of you like her.

382
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,140
But she doesn't have feelings for me.

383
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,500
Although Lai Zhengyi hurt her

384
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,540
and lied to her,

385
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,180
she didn't want to leave him.

386
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,670
No one can take anything away from Lai Zhengyi

387
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,040
if he wants it.

388
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,260
You're my sweetheart,

389

my only sweetheart.

390
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,020
I may not be the most suitable one for you,

391
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,860
but you have to believe that

392
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm the one who loves you the most.

393
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,220
What will you think

394
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,060
if your sister tells you that

395
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,100
I was approaching you with other intentions?

396
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,900
Intentions?

397
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,420
You approached me

398
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,420
because you like me.

399
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,700
I can't tell any wrong with that.

400
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,060
There's something wrong with Ye Chenyang's company.

401
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,420
He needs urgent investment.

402
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,300
If he can find a suitable investor

403
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,780
and cover the shortfall in funding,

404
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,010
he may be promoted to

405
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:47,460
the CEO of the China branch of Global Picture.

406
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,300
Okay.

407
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,660

You're willing to help him?
