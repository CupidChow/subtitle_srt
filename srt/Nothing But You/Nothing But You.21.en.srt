4
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,780
Lili, come and look at it.

5
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,780
How naughty you were!

6
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,940
Look at this.

7
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,420
This is naive and cute!

8
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,259
Okay?

9
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,140
Look at your baby fat.

10
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,539
So fatty.

11
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,380
When was the photo taken?

12
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,259
This

13
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,539
was taken when I was

14
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,180
the volunteer of the orphanage.

15
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,900
How time flies!

16
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,500
It has been over ten years.

17
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,460
I heard that there is going to be dismantled.

18
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,850
Be dismantled?

19
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,420
Yes.

20
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,699
It will be moved to the new district.

21
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,780
And there will be a shopping mall.

22
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,620

It seems that it is going to be dismantled.

[Stay Away From the Demolition Area]

27
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,940
I didn't expect you are still there

28
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,500
after so many years.

29
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,450
You are much taller than before,

30
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,340
Here you are.

31
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,340
Thanks.

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,420
It's just a lift of the finger.

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,010
The fruits of the tree

34
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,900
are sweet.

35
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,300
It seems that you know the place very well.

36
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,420
I had been living there for a while

37
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,020
when I was young.

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,660
What a coincidence!

39
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,500
I often had fun there when I was young.

40
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,740
But I heard that there is going to be dismantled

41
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,250
and I come here to see.

42
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,020
I forgot to introduce myself.

43
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,810

44
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,020
You are Bi Xiaoran, right?

45
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,820
What?

46
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,740
How do you know that?

47

49
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,460
Well.

50

My name is Ye Chenyang.

51

Hello.

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,620
Why are you holding a shovel?

53
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:35,820
I've buried

54
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,900
a treasure

55
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,020
under this tree before.

56
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,060
I come back to see

57
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,020
if I can find it.

58
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,140
What treasure?

59
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,060
Previous memories.

60
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,820
I didn't expect that

61
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,020
it is still there after so many years.

62
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,130
I knew a girl

63
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,339
before.

64
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,779
We were good friends.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,980
However,

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,940
we lost connection

67
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,380
since I was adopted.

Sunny.

72
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,220
I saw there were yellow fruits

73
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,580
on the tree in the middle of the yard.

74
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,020
I climbed the tree to pick up them

75
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,060
and fell down

76
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,100
accidentally.

77
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,659
However,

78
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,580
I didn't feel pain.

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,140
As Lili

80
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,740
was under my body.

81
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,820
It's you!

82
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,620
Who are you?

83
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,980
I am the hero.

84
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,940
Thank you.

85
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,370
You are welcome.

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,900
Do you finish your writing?

87
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,900
Yes.

88
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,540
I want Lili

89
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,820
to be my bride.

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,460
I will be your bride

91
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,220
as long as you give me pink rabbit ring.

92
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,060
Okay.

93
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,700
I will find pink rabbit ring for you.

94
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,900
Director.

95
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,460
Where did little Taiyang go?

96
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,060
He's gone.

97
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,420
He went to a very far place

98
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,220
and he might not be back anymore.

99
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,260
Not anymore?

100
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,330
Did he die?

101
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,540
I thought you died

102
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,900
when I was young

103
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,180
and I was so sad

104
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,180
that I cried so badly.

105
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,860
Later I was seriously ill

106
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,060
and forgot a lot of my

107
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,100
childhood.

108
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,730
It is lucky that we have the exchange diary

109
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,860
that reminded me.

110
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,860
I left in a hurry

111
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,980
and failed to say goodbye

112
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,180
to you.

113
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,140
Look,

114
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,220
this is the pink ring

115
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,620
I found at that time.

116
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,570
Wow.

117
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,980
I got this by exchanging my sword.

118
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,980
It's so cute.

119
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,700
Will it be so late

120
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,450
to give it to you know?

121
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,820
No.

122
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,620
Actually I have been looking for you

123
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,940
of all those years.

124
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,660
I am really happy

125
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,180
to meet you again.

126
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,300
Do you remember what's

127
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,820
our favorite game?

128
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,500
Hopscotch.

129
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,780
I was the loser at that time.

130
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,740
I will revenge this time.

131
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,060
Then I will let you win.

132
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,980
Okay.

133
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,580
You lose.

134
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,580
I lose.

135
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,260
Your turn,.

136
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,060
My turn.

137
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,420
You are so good at this.

138
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,380
One, two, three, four.

139
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,980
Good, good.

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,260
I am back.

143
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,100
Lalala.

144
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,540
Why are you so happy?

145
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,220
Sit down.

146
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,500
I want to tell you some good news.

147
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:10,700
Tell me.

148
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Do you remember a hero

149
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,140
in the orphanage

150
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,460
that I have been looking for?

151
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,340
Yes.

152
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:15,980
I have been looking for him for long

153
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,020
and you haven't find him.

154
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,820
I found him today!

155
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,900
I actually met him today

156
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,540
at the Sunshine Orphanage.

157
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:22,940
There's going to be demolition.

158
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,660
I went to see it

159
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,700
and I met him.

160
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,820
His name is Ye Chenyang.

161
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,970
He deserves the name.

162
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,220
He is the sunshine.

163
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,330
He is a senior manager of Universal Pictures

164
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,540
and he came back to China for some work.

165
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,780
Fate is wonderful.

166
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,260
This is the arrangement of fate.

167
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,700
What's wrong?

168
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,860
Nothing.

169
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,140
I am happy for you.

170
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,210
I thought I was not going to find him

171
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,420
in my life time.

172
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,020
It is like a dream.

173
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,220
You must be tired.

174
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,540
Take a rest.

175
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,860
Okay.

176
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,460
Lalala.

177
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,130
Yangyang.

178
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,860
Come here.

179
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:00,860
Alas.

180
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,740
Yangyang,

181
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,980
it's been so many years.

182
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,980
I thought it must be

183
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,660
Lili's dream when she told me.

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,420
You met again.

185
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,500
What a fate!

186
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,100
Aunt,

187
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,300
you look like how you were before

188
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,300
and nothing has changed.

189
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,220
What a

190
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,420
delightful kid.

191
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,820
I'm getting older.

192
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,900
My sister doesn't clean

193
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,980
up the mess.

194
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,220
Is Bi Xiaoran your sister?

195
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:25,980
Yes.

196
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,660
She is a messy pretty.

197
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,660
Xiaoran hurt

198
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,500
her legs before

199
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,740
and she is living with us.

200
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,500
There are more belongings at home

201
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,340
as there are more people.

202
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:34,940
It is messy.

203
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,140
Hope you won't mind.

204
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:36,900
No.

205
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,900
It is cozy.

206
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,940
Here's the soup.

The soup prepared by your mother.

209
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,420
Mom, you even made the soup.

210
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,220
Yes,

211
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,940
this is the soup I made

212
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,020

213

Come on and

214
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,290

215
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:48,980
Thank you.

216
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,700
Hurry up and take a sit.

217
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,900

218

-Help me pack it up and take it with me. -Come on and eat.

220

I will.

221

Yangyang,

222
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,900

Thanks.

224
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,780
Since you just came back to China,

225
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,180
you can go to find Lili

226
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,100
as long as you have any problem.

227
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,500
Don't be afraid to bother her.

228
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,340
She is free now.

229
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,540
Okay.

230
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,220
As long as she won't think I am annoying.

231
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,780
Alas.

232
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,940
I'm looking forward to it.

233
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,020
I won't find you annoying.

234
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,660
Come on.

236
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,420

237
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:17,940

238
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,700
visit us

239
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,860
frequently in the future.

240
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,300
Okay.

241

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,100
Uncle, aunt,

243
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,170
it is cold outside

244
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,100
and you just stay in the house.

245
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,340
I am leaving now.

246
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,100
Be careful.

247
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,740
Okay.

248
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,740
Bye-bye.

249
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:28,780
Bye-bye.

250
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,820
What a good boy!

251
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,060
It would be great if you could be my son-in-law.

252
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,060
Mom,

253
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,140
Lai is your son-in-law.

254
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,660
Why are you still there?

255
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,020
I am packing up the soup.

256
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,500
Hurry up.

257
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:39,900
Do not have him wait for you.

258
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,610
It's going to rain.

00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,580
It's raining. Take the umbrella.

268

Thanks.

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,860
You packed up the soup for me?

270
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,620
It is not for you.

271
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,980
It is for my boyfriend.

272
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,820
Boyfriend?

273
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
I have a boyfriend

274
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,460
who is tall, handsome,

275
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,900

I will show you his photo.

278
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,260
Fine.

279
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,060
Is he handsome?

280
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,620
Isn't him Lai Zhengyi?

281

He is.

282
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,500
He and my sister pretend

283
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,810
to be a couple.

284
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,820
I am his that girl.

285
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,660
This is a secret

286
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,010
and you cannot tell others.

I have been looking for you

of all those years

292
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,340
and I created an

293
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,580
official account for that.

294
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,130
I am good, right?

295
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,100
Really.

296
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,570
You are back.

297
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,300
Yes.

298
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,180
Guess what I

299
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,740
brought you today.

300
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,620
What?

301
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,620
My mom made rib soup.

302
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,900
Her cooking is simply superb.

303
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,220
It was prepared carefully.

304
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,620
It is because him

305
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,260
that we can have the soup.

306
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,660
I will bring you a bowl.

307
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,300
Okay.

308
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,940
Your mother is satisfied with Ye Chenyang.

309
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,780
It's more than satisfied.

310
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,860
She even wants him to be her son-in-law.

311

Wow, this soup is good.

312
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,260
No.

313
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,820
My mother only has two sons-in-law.

314

One is Qin

315

317
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,220
Does it taste good?

318
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,100
It's good.

Is it Sunxue who wrote the report?

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,900
I just helped the HR department move things.

357
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,060
I will do it right away.

358
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,370
Which department do you belong to?

359
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,020
Does the HR department need your help?

360
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,250
That's enough, Bi Xiaoran.

361
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,100
Are you showing off?

362
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,700
Who are you showing off to?

363
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,500
Listen to me,

364
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,380
this is

365
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,500
the democratic era.

366
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,860
Tyrants like you are not welcomed.

367
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,700
Did you hear that?

368
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,740
What do you think you are?

369
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,980
What do I think I am?

370
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,650
Wait,

371
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,420
what?

372
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,020
I...

373
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,180
I am Lemeng's successor.

374
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,620
I am your future CEO.

375
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,380
Did you hear that?

376
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,140
I will fire you

377
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,500
when I am the CEO.

378
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,060
The younger brother of Lai Zhengyi,

379
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,580
listen,

380
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,100
I turned a blind eye

381
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,220
and let you horse around.

382
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,450
If you do any more nonsense,

383
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,500
I will be rude to you.

384
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,300
Oh,

385
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,140
will you be rude to me?

386
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,500
What can you do?

387
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,780
Being late for work 90 times.

388
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,780
Being absent from work for 47 times.

389
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,300
Delaying work 26 times.

390
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,690
Playing games 150 times.

391
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,220
Eating snacks 326 times.

392
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,140
Ding Dong,

393
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,860
report these to the administration department

394
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,180
Deduct his salary

395
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,060
according to the rules.

396
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,460
Wait.

397
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,060
-What is she doing? -Enough.

398
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,460
What is she doing?

399
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,340
Are you insane?

400
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,220
-Uh. -Shush!

401
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,980
Do not annoy Xiaoran.

402
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,610
Do you know that?

403
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,020
Wait,

404
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:19,940
bros,

405
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,500
is her crazy?

406
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,780
She wasn't like that before.

407
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,420
Okay.

408
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,020
The way she talked to me

409
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,380
is identical to which of Lai Zhengyi.

410
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,820
You are too arrogant.

411
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,660
-What are you doing? -Just shut up.

412
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,620
Are you crazy?

413
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,420
Uh?

414
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,140
You disobey me.

415
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,740
Do not annoy Xiaoran anymore.

416
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,180
She was right.

417
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,940
You should change your bad habits.

418
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,140
What?

419
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,180
How can you turn to her?

420
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,770
-I will be horsing around. -Enough.

421
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,940
I'm going to behave badly.

422
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,860
Do your work.

423
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,660
I don't want to work

424
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,570
Three,

425
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,500
two...

426
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:48,940
Where is my pen?

427
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,020
Xiaoran.

428
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,900
Come in.

429
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,260
Xiaoran,

430
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,210
this is the contract that you want.

431
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,500
They are stepping away from

432
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,340
work when I was not there.

433
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,090
Anyway, you are different

434
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,660
when you come back to work.

435
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,580
They may not be able to accept it all at once.

436
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,660
Is it?

437
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,340
How did Lili get along

438
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,300
with them?

439
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,740
Apart from anything else,

440
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,780
she was always smiling

441
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,380
when she came to work.

442
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,300
What was she smiling about?

443
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,580
Do what you need to do.

444
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,260
Okay.

445
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,550
[I don't know what kind of circle are you in, I'm in dark circles.]

446
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,140
What do you want to eat?

447
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,100
Order whatever you like.

448
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,420
I'll see.

449
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:00,900
Wow.

450
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,300
Do you have enough money?

451
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,700
This is an expensive restaurant.

452
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,020
Don't blackmail me.

453
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,020
Don't worry.

454
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:06,940
I am rich enough

455
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,780
to feed you.

456
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,099
The little Taiyang has become big Taiyang.

457
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:10,980
Generous.

458
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,180
-Let me see it. -Here you go.

459
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,099
Sorry.

460
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,020
I am late.

461
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,619
Take a sit.

462
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:16,619
Lili,

463
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,619
let me introduce

464
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,980
my friend Ning Xia.

465
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,740
Ning Xia.

466
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,380
She is

467
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:20,900
Lili.

468
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,060
We know each other.

469
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,500
Yes.

470
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,260
I didn't expect

471
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,740
the bride you mentioned

472
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,940
is Lili.

473
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,260
The world is too small.

474
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,020
After all those things,

475
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,900
we all know each other.

476
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,660
We are all friends.

477
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,580
Ning Xia,

478
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,460
look at this.

479
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,500
We are ordering food.

480
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,460
What do you want?

481
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,100
Okay.

482
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:35,820
Let me see it.

483
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,930
I'll order you a matcha cake.

484
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,100
That's your favorite.

485
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,450
Matcha is my favorite.

486
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:40,860
Is it?

487
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,900
You liked it when you were young.

488
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,420
Yes.

489
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,260
Then I will order two...

490
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,220
seven cakes.

491
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,130
I can't eat them all.

492
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:48,900
Here you are.

493
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,060
You are so slim

494
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,260
and you should eat more.

495
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,580
Don't give me more food.

496
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,340
My plate is full.

497
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,020
You weren't like that when you were a kid.

498
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,380
You even wanted to eat

499
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,700
in the pot.

500
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,980
I was growing then.

501
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,820
I have to control my weight now.

502
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,860
When you were a child, you were white and fat.

503
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,700
So adorable.

504
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,660
Of course,

505
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
you are more beautiful now.

506
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,100
Stop telling the truth.

507
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,490
You were white and fat.

508
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,540
You can meet each other

509
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,020
after so many years.

510
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,900
This must be

511
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,300
your fate.

512
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,860
Maybe it means something.

513
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,540
We are destined to meet.

514
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,620
Look.

515
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,780
Here, don't move.

516
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,010
Sorry.

517
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:42,780
I'll go pick up a call first.

518
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,460
Okay.

519
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,900
You should eat more.

520
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,690
Okay.

521
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,020
Lili,

522
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,050
can I ask you a question?

523
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,220
Ask as you like.

524
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,500
Chenyang said that

525
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,940
you were his childhood bride.

526
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,090
Will you be his

527
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,460
bride this time?

528
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,500
That's what we said

529
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,660
when we were playing.

530
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,740
It cannot be true.

531
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,740
Besides,

532
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,620
I'm dating with Mr. Lai now.

533
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,740
That's good.

534
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,220
Can you go shopping

535
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,660
with me later?

536
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:16,780
Uh...

537
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,100
Can we go

538
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,620
shopping together?

539
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,780
Aren't we rivals in love?

540
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,540
I feel like I have a special connection with you.

541
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,300
And you are Chenyang's good friends.

542
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,290
Therefore,

543
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,970
I hope we can go shopping together.

544
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,260
It would be fine

545
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,220
if you are busy.

546
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:33,930
No.

547
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,820
I am free now.

548
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,140
Then we can go shopping together.

549
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,420
Okay.

550
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,060
Good.

551
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,780
Hello. What can I do for you?

552
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,210
It looks good.

553
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,300
Mr. Lai seems to have a similar one.

554
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,540
But he doesn't like blue.

555
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:54,930
Uh...

556
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,980
This tie looks good.

557
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,060
It is dignified.

558
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:11,500
But it is to private

559
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,060
to give a tie as the gift.

560
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,020
How about perfume?

561
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,300
This will be great.

562
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,740
He doesn't seem to use perfume.

563
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,860
Uh...

564
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,900
Who is he?

565
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,780
A friend.

566
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,290
Just friend?

567
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,260
Impossible.

568
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,260
Just a friend.

569
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,660
Do I know him?

570
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
I will take this.

571
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,340
Please give me a new one.

572
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,210
Someone I know...

573
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,020
Alas.

574
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,860
Will the person be Lai Zhengyi?

575
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
It couldn't be like that.

576
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,940
She asked me to buy a gift

577
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,380
for Li Zhengyi with her?

578
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,450
[Custom Clothing]

579
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,500
It is packed up.

580
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,220
You can scan the QR code to make the payment.

581
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,810
She and Ye Chenyang...

582
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,050
Here you are.

583
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,660
Thanks.

584
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,380
You are welcome.

585
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,380
Is it a gift

586
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,140
for Ye Chenyang?

587
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,380
How do you know that?

588
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,940
I am right.

589
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,380
His birthday is approaching.

590
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,060
It is an ordinary gift.

591
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,020
You selected it carefully,

592
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,220
and it cannot be ordinary.

593
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,810
And

594
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,340
I noticed that

595
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,260
you were shy

596
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,860
when selecting the gift.

597
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,740
It is totally different from

598
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,660
the generous you.

599
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,220
Therefore I am guessing that

600
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,180
you like Ye Chenyang.

601
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,860
You are really smart.

602
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,860
There is nothing that I can hide from you.

603
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,260
We've known each other for so long.

604
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,700
But he always lives abroad.

605
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,340
As we live separately,

606
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,300
I think there will be no result

607
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,860
even I like him.

608
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:54,780
Isn't he

609
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,170
here in China now?

610
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,820
So what?

611
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,220
I don't even know

612
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,700
how to express my feeling to him.

613
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,300
I do admire you sometimes.

614
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,620
You are really brave.

615
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,620
I am not brave.

616
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,740
I just chase for what I want

617
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,340
when I realize that I like it.

618
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,380
What if I regret that

619
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,620
I didn't do it.

620
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,460
Yes.

621
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,860
I should chase for it.

622
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
But I don't know

623
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,540
what to do.

624
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,260
Leave this to me.

625
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,940
I have 36 stratagems for love.

626
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
I can help you.

627
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,460
Do you really want to help me?

628
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,620
I do hope you

629
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,180
could be happy.

630
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,900
That's great.

631
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,020
I have a request that

632
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,300
I don't want anyone else to know it.

633
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,460
Why?

634
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,500
It is not shameful for a woman to chase for a man.

635
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,620
I don't want to be someone else's talking point.

636
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,900
If I fail,

637
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,700
I will be the laughing stock of others.

638
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:45,740
Don't worry.

639
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,940
Only you

640
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,090
and I will know this.

641
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,340
Okay.

642
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:52,940
Deal.

643
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,740
Deal.

644
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,780
I didn't expect that

645
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:02,900
Ning Xia

646
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,620
likes Ye Chenyang.

647
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,060
I was surprised that

648
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,050
I thought her liked Lai Zhengyi.

649
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,620
I was thinking too much.

650
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,020
I had no idea of what the princely woman aspires .

651
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,940
I won't be worried anymore.

652
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,740
Jiang Lili,

653
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,100
you shouldn't be jealous

654
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,340
anymore.

655
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Where have you been today?

656
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,300
You look so happy.

657
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,460
I had dinner with little Taiyang

658
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,580
and knew that

659
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,780
he and Ning Xia

660
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,260
are good friends.

661
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,500
And Ning Xia even...

662
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,060
Anyway, we are all friends.

663
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,620
And fate

664
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,660
is incredible.

665
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,580
Hello.

666
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,220
Hello.

667
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:45,700
Oh,

668
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,540
little Taiyang,

669
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,500
I was outside of the house

670
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,620
and didn't notice your phone call.

671
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,460
Lili,

672
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,660
what are you doing?

673
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,460
What?

674
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,260
Lili.

675
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,100
What happened?

676
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,300
I get a stomachache.

677
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,700
Stomachache?

678
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,700
Is it serious?

679
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,660
Do you need to go to the hospital?

680
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,580
It doesn't matter.

681
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,820
I can take a few pills.

682
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:02,940
Oh.

683
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,540
Hello?

684
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,380
Lili.

685
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,410
-Are you listening to me? -I'm going to take the medicine.

686
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,100
Lili.

687
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,060
Can you hear me?

688
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,060
Hello.

689
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
My girlfriend went to bring me some medicine.

690
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,940
If there is nothing else,

691
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,900
I'll hang up.

692
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,420
Here you are.

693
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:32,860
Hurry up.

694
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,130
Take the pills.

695
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,540
Lili,

696
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,340
I feel cold.

697
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,100
Cold?

698
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,260
I'll go get you the quilt.

699
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,940
It would be warm

700
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,490
if I have you by my side.

701
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,260
Poor guy.

702
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,060
What did you eat

703
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,890
that makes your stomach ache.

704
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,700
And you're still shaking.

705
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,780
Poor guy.

706
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,540
I will warm you up.

707
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,100
Bi Xiaoran

708
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,320
[Elevator Lobby]

709
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,700
is in such a bad mood recently.

710
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,380
She looks angry all the time

711
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,540
and she is so tough.

712
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,740
That's annoying.

713
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,340
Fasten your seat belt.

714
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,380
Let's go home.

715
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,730
What happened?

716
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,020
I forget a file

717
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,180
and I need to find it.

718
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,060
It's time to leave work

719
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,900
and you are supposed to have dinner with me.

720
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,540
You can leave the work

721
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,540
to tomorrow.

722
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:35,970
No.

723
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,500
I need the file tonight.

724
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,460
Then

725
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,940
then you have to compensate me.

726
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:45,980
Give me a kiss.

727
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,060
Childish.

728
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,460
Unlock the door.

729
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,380
Give me a kiss.

730
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,380
Just one.

731
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,250
Only one.

732
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,180
Bi Xiaoran,

733
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,660
you are so skittish.

734
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,460
What were you doing?

735
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,580
Things are not the way you think they are.

736
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,140
Loosen your hands.

737
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,860
Things are not the way you think they are.

738
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,940
What not?

739
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,620
I saw you

740
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,900
kissed in the car.

741
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,060
Qin Yanfei,

742
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,100
I thought you were my friend

743
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
but you cheated.

744
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,340
You even kissed my brother's girlfriend.

745
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,580
No,

746
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,900
I didn't kiss your brother's girlfriend.

747
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,540
She kissed me.

748
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,740
No.

749
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,540
You can't turn your face to her.

750
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:43,940
Besides,

751
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,020
we didn't know your brother

752
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,300
when we were dating.

753
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,940
How dare you

754
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,060
make a false countercharge.

755
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,770
You mean my brother is the cheater.

756
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:51,860
No, bro.

757
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,580
Calm down.

758
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,340
I can't.

759
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,540
I want revenge for my brother.

760
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,780
You cheat on my brother.

761
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,700
I want revenge for him.

762
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,260
That's enough.

763
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,540
What revenge?

764
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,540
I am not the one

765
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,740
who is dating with him.

766
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,700
What do you mean?

767
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,420
This is the top secrete

768
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,220
of our company.

769
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,140
The fewer people who know it, the better will be.

770
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,850
But since you you know it,

771
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,020
and you know too much of it.

772
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,340
What...

773
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,420
What are you doing?

774
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,100
Xiaoran.

775
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,620
Deal with it.

776
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,180
Okay.

777
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,820
What are you doing?

778
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,380
Deal with what?

779
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,380
Listen,

780
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,180
-I'm not gonna forgive you. -Go.

781
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,980
Listen...

782
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,420
Don't push me.

783
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,460
Why do you push me.

784
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,180
Are you okay?

785
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,100
Don't push me.

786
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,060
No.

787
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,860
But I will be fine

788
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,220
if you give me a kiss.

789
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
This side.

790
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,010
This side.

791
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,660
Oh,

792
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,570
I see.

793
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,740
No wonder why

794
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,660
Bi Xiaoran is so weird.

795
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,500
I didn't expect that the woman

796
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,860
was a fake.

797
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,940
Even Xia Shan doesn't

798
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
know about it.

799
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,900
So you must keep the secrete.

800
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,810
Yes.

801
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,060
I know.

802
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,980
I am the future successor of Lemeng.

803
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,780
And the secrete of our company

804
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,860
will be my company.

805
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,020
What happened

806
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,090
to Jiang Lili?

807
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,210
Though she was always against me,

808
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,540
she is still better than this one.

809
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,380
Without her,

810
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,500
the company is not bustling now.

811
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,540
Jiang Lili is good now.

812
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,140
But Xiaoran is the one who will come to the company.

813
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,060
Though she is a little bit tough,

814
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,780
she

815
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,060
is very talented.

816
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,060
You should learn from her

817
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,130
and get along well with her.

818
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:29,940
Did you hear that.

819
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,580
Yes.

820
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,020
I do prefer the fake one.

821
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,660
What fake?

822
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,980
Happy birthday!

823
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,940
Thanks

824
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,500
Oh,

825
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,140
this is the gift for you.

826
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,060
Thanks.

827
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,100
Ning Xia selected it

828
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,060
very carefully.

829
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,100
You will definitely love it.

830
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,220
-Nonsense. -Thanks,

831
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,500
It is a ordinary gift.

832
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,380
Thanks.

833
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,940
I also have a gift for you.

834
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,140
It's your favorite thing since childhood.

835
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,980
I don't know if I like it now.

836
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,100
Open it.

837
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,580
Don't be so moved.

838
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,860
This is what I asked

839
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,740
the crew prop designer to make.

840
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,610
I hope you will like it.

841
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,300
Magic Sword.

842
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,420
I like it.

843
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,660
I still like it.

844
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,180
Let's eat.

845
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,780
Okay.

846
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:26,900
Alas.

847
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,340
Sorry, Chenyang.

848
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,460
The company has an emergency

849
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:30,690
and I need to go back.

850
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,460
What?

851
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,410
How could there be an emergency?

852
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,460
You haven't eaten yet.

853
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,940
Something went wrong with the contract.

854
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,700
I have to go now.

855
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,140
What a pity.

856
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,700
Never mind.

857
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,380
You go first.

858
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,930
I am sorry that

859
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,980
we are here to celebrate your birthday.

860
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,700
We still have Lili here.

861
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,460
See you next time.

862
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,460
Bye-bye.

863
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:46,020
Bye-bye.

864
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,980
-You go first. -Okay.

865
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
Though you have gone,

866
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
I will help you to

867
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,980
pursue him.

868
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,460
Yoo-Hoo!

869
00:29:59,460 --> 00:29:59,860
Lili,

870
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,730
this is for you.

871
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,780
Can I have a gift?

872
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,410
Yes.

873
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,300
This is a niche brand in Australia.

874
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,340
Here you are.

875
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,220
Wow.

876
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,140
This can also be used for flower arrangement.

877
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,020
Yes.

878
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,900
It would be great

879
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,090
to put it in the living room.

880
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,820
I will put it in the living room as soon as I go home.

881
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,740
Don;t you think

882
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,860
it looks

883
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,700
so alike you?

884
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,940
How could it be?

885
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:18,700
It is as beautiful as you.

886
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,180
You're pretty discerning.

887
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,140
Thanks.

888
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,060
As you are so discerning,

889
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,820
what type of girl do you like?

890
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,890
As long as I can get along well with her.

891
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,500
There is nothing special.

892
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,580
You should be more precise.

893
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,620
Precise...

894
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,140
Lively.

895
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,220
Lovely.

896
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,100
Optimistic.

897
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:43,900
Hardworking.

898
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,740
Anything else?

899
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,620
Pretty.

900
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,220
Gentle.

901
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,860
I knew you liked

902
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,940
this type of girl.

903
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,500
Are there any such people around you now?

904
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,900
There seems to be one.

905
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,380
That's great!

906
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,300
Cheers.

907
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,060
Cheers.

908
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,060
So pretty.

909
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,060
I will put it somewhere.

910
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,260
Where should I put it?

911
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,420
So pretty.

912
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,420
There are so many things.

913
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,880
I will put it here.

914
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,780
It's so pretty.

915
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,260
Why are you angry?

916
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,020
Of course.

917
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,980
You always behave like this.

918
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,860
I have told you several times

919
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,660
that I don't eat celery.

920
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,180
You always buy it.

921
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:55,860
You can't be the picky eater.

922
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,140
How can you be so selfish?

923
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,300
The expert says it is good for...

924

That's none of my...

925
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,820
How can you drive like that?

926
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,700
Didn't you see us?

927
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,260
-You are always so stubborn. -Are you okay?

928
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,100
Sorry.

929
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,100
Are you okay?

930
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:06,860
Did you get hurt?

931
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
Yangyang?

932
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,020
Aunt.

933
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,620
Did I hurt you?

934
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,620
No.

935
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,260
I'm fine.

936
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,700
Why are you here?

937
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,500
I met someone here just now.

938
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,180
Here? Then...

939
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,300
Since you are here,

940
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,420
go home with us.

941
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,540
I will give you a glass of water.

942
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,060
It...

943
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,020
It bothers you so much.

944
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,890
It doesn't matter.

945
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,260
Our home is nearby.

946
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:26,980
Let's go.

947
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,860
Okay.

948
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,820
Go.

949
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,780
There are a lot of fruits.

950
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,460
I'll park first.

951
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,180
Okay.

952
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:31,940
You go first.

953
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,780
Be careful.

954
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,020
Hurry up.

955
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,260
-I was passing by accidentally. N-Come on.

956
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:38,970
What a coincidence!

957
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,620
Here are the fresh fruits.

How can you eat without a knife?

960
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,900
Peel it.

961
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,140
-It doesn't matter. -I will do it.

962
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,860
I will do it.

963
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,980
Don't bother, uncle.

964
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,570
I will only stay for a few minutes.

Stay here and have dinner with us.

970
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:53,940
Okay.

971
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,540
Just stay there.
