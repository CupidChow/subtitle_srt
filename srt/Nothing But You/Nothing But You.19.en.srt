A small lazy pig.

5
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:00,620
Get up.

6
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,260
Don't bother me.

7
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,020
I'm doing something exciting with Mr. Lai.

8
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,660
Mr. Lai,

9
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,139
you are back.

10
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:10,780
Yes.

11
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,940
I have surely not been dreaming, have I?

12
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,860
You are missing me so much.

13
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,340
Of course, I need to come back early.

14
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,660
Who misses you?

15
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,100
I don't.

16
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,300
Eat slowly,

17
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,220
or you'll choke.

18
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,940
OK.

19
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,180
Is your work going well?

20
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:36,780
Yes.

21
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,820
It's going well.

22
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm already preparing for the next cooperation.

23
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,700
So

24
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,820
where is my present?

25
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,530
Oh.

26
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,820
Ah.

27
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,420
You forget!

28
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,020
What is this?

29
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,460
Is this a gift?

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,740
How beautiful it is.

31
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,100
I'll put it on right now.

32
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,620
This is a silk scarf,

33
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,900
not a ribbon.

34
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,620
It looks very beautiful.

35
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,820
When did you buy it?

36
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,180
I've been choosing

37
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,260
this gift for a long time.

38
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,860
You are so discerning.

39
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,100
I love you.

40
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,940
How do you like it?

41
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,900
Do you like it?

42
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,980
Yes.

43
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,290
Thank you.

44
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,340
Thanks only?

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,820
I'll wear it to work today.

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,420
I have to leave now.

47
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,260
Ding Dong.

48
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,020
Do I have any changes today?

49
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,900
The silk scarf that Mr. Lai gave you is very beautiful

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,220
and suitable for you.

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,100
It is tailored to me, isn't it?

52
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,180
It looks so nice.

53
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,860
Good morning, Xiaoran.

54
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:12,780
Good morning.

55
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,580
I think this color really

56
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,220
suits you.

57
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,140
I was hanging out with Zhengyi last night.

58
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,300
I loved the silk scarf at first glance.

59
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,740
But I thought the color was not suitable for me,

60
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,220
so I changed a blue one.

61
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,900
How do you like it?

62
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,020
Is it OK?

63
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,500
Very nice.

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,220
Thanks.

-A big liar.
-Calm down.

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,940
Calm down.

69
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,810
It may be a misunderstanding.

70
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,180
Misunderstanding?

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:43,900
What is the misunderstanding?

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,420

77
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,420
Would you like to eat with me after getting off work?

78
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,650
No!

79
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,140
Why don't you wear the silk scarf?

80
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,460
You ask while knowing the answer!

Ah.

87
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,580
I think this silk scarf looks great.

88
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,900
So I bought one, too.

89

Practice makes perfect.

108

You...

109

What are you doing?

110

That's enough of this.

111
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,930
Wash the vegetables.

Do you have no hands?

is this your first dating?

Who said that?

124
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,620
I've been in love before.

125

Seriously?

When?

127
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,659
That goes back to

my elementary school days.

129
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,940
At that time, she was our Class Beauty.

130
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,300
And she chased me.

131
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
So amazing.

132
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,340
Then why did you break up with her?

133
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,020
Well,

134
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,060

139

No, no, no...

140
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,420
I tell me now.

141
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,980
She just thought

142
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,460
my nose picking was ugly,

143
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,980
and she broke up with me the next day.

144
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,260
Definitely yes.

145
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,420
You've seen me pick my nose.

146
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,540
Well,

147
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,500
can you feed me now?

148
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,410
OK.

149
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,980
Alright.

150

I want to eat lettuce first.

151
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,060
It is delicious.

152
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,340
Eat fast.

Ah.

155
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,900
I want to tell you something.

156
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,659
Say it.

157
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,340
I want

158
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,490
to send you a gift.

159
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,500
What is it?

160
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,700
Have a look.

161
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,010
Everyone has couple pendants,

162
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,049
but we don't have.

163
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,380
We can fall behind them.

164
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,940
This is a magnetic

165
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,090
heart-shaped pendant.

166
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,460
Is it a bit...

167
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,620
Oh.

168
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,290
We are now in

a secret relationship.

170
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,610
The underground romance.

171
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,740
I am sorry.

172
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,660
I forget it.

173
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,770
It is OK.

174
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,260
Give me the pendant.

175
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,500
Ah.

176
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,060
Give me

177
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,260

Yes.

Not what?

190
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,140
Pictures don't lie!

191
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,540
Did you buy that silk scarf

192
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,980
with Ning Xia together?

193
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,100
I wonder the silk scarf of mine

194
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,220
is what she left after choosing.

195
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,300
I can't wait to give you the best things

you the best things in the world.

197
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,180
How could I

198
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,300
let you use what others have left?

199
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,300
What happened to that picture?

200
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,180
You hugged each other.

201
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,450
Because she fell on that day.

202
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,700
I helped her out of courtesy.

203
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,610
Then I released immediately.

204
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,700

205

Only you are in my heart

and without other people.

207
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,740
Although I know that this

208
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,170
kind of news is a picture at the beginning,

209
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,780
the content is all nonsense.

210
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,900
But I still feel very sad

211
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,820
because I know that Ning Xia

212
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,370
is gentler and more capable than me,

213
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,020
and I am an ordinary person.

214
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,100
Ning Xia is more worthy of you than me.

216
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,940
I like you

217
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,060
not because of how gentle

218
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,980
and capable you are,

219
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,620
but because you are Jiang Lili.

220
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,380
If

221
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,180
I really want to be with Ning Xia...

222
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,300
I will not give up.

I will never give up.

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,020
I'll try to be better.

225

00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,340
OK?

I sprain my ankle.

No.

Nothing serious.

very naive,

do domestic violence?

293
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,140
Yeah.

294

Consider this:

Although Mr. Lai's family is rich,

296
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,570
he has no personal ability

00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:47,940
Take a seat there.

354
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,820
Ning Xia.

355
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,020
I can't go with you.

356
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,460
Why?

357
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,220
Because Lili is still waiting for me at home.

358
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,540
I don't want to make her sad.

359
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,580
Then you can make me sad,

360
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,180
right?

361
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,380
Ning Xia.

362
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,940
You are my most trusted work partner

363
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,540
and my most respected sister.

364
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,260
We can be friends

365
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,220
or colleagues.

366
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:12,900
Apart from these two relationships,

367
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,940
I can't give

368
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,099
anything else.

369
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,300
I'll let Xiao He take you back.

370
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,220
No.

371
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,369
I can walk by myself.

372
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,370
What are your plans after graduation?

373
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,300
Are you looking for a job?

374
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,900
I want to start a business.

375
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,020
Well,

376
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,580
God's favored Lai Zhengyi.

377
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,260
How can you work for someone else?

378
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,220
The ankle is sprained.

379
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,940
Yes.

380
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,330
Take me back.

381
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,460
Come.

382
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,900
Hurry up.

383
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,620
OK.

384
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,500
Run.

385
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,340
How can I be willing to give you to someone else?

386
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,500
I'll pick you up tonight.

387
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,020
OK.

388
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,780
Wait!

389
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,180
The fare.

390
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:14,780
Jiang Lili.

391
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:16,970
Mom.

392
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,300
What are you doing?

393
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,460
Ah.

394
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,540
Now let me ask you something.

395
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,660
Didn't you and Xiaoran

396
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,060
pretend to

397
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,460
be a couple at first?

398
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,540
Why are you getting along with Lili again?

399
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,020
Uncle.

400
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,500
I really like Lili.

401
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,650
Hey.

402
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,740
Can the love be faked?

403
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:51,850
How can we

404
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,220
trust your sincerity?

405
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:53,780
Ah.

406
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,540
Stop talking about your news.

407
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,300
He hugged Ning Xia

408
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,860
two days ago.

409
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,730
Mom.

410
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,570
It is a misunderstanding.

411
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,140
Oh, come on.

412
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,580
children should be seen

413
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,700
and not heard.

414
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,700
You are just

415
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,100
fascinated by his face.

416
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,700
Aunt.

417
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,940
Ning Xia and I are

418
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,260
just ordinary colleagues.

419
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,060
There is nothing else.

420
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,580
It's really not appropriate to pretend to be a couple.

421
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,740
It was also for

422
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,100
the development of the company.

423
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,500
The company has to rely on

424
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,940
this method to develop,

425
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,980
this should not be

426
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,260
a good company.

427
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,460
You quickly break up this relationship.

428
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,780
Don't delay Xiaoran's good marriage.

429
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,700
I agree with you.

430
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,980
At such a young age,

431
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,500
You don't work hard and

432
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,050
take crooked ways.

433
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,220
Let me ask you something.

434
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,620
Is it your idea to

435
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,860
let Xiaoran and Lili

436
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,260
switch identities?

437
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,020
Uncle.

438
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,900
At that time.

439
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,610
Well,

440
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,220
Xiaoran's legs will be better soon.

441
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,620
They will change back soon.

442
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
And you had better leave Lili.

443
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,380
I like him.

444
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,060
I don't.

445
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,580
You...

446
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,820
You want to make me angry...

447
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,540
I'm obedient to everything,

448
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,900
and I've listened to you from childhood to adulthood,

449
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,530
but this one I can't.

450
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,420
Off we go.

451
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,260
You dare?

452
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,140
What are you going to do?

453
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:06,820
Ah.

454
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,060
Don't mind her.

455
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,540
Damn it!

456
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,250
It is hard to keep a woman at home.

457
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,020
She is spoiled by you.

458
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,940
You don't spoil her?

459
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,780
From childhood to adulthood,

460
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,420
everything is up to her.

461
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,700
What the era is this?

462
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,140
my parents still don't let free love.

463
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,810
They care about you.

464
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,300
Ah.

465
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,740
How much did they give you?

466
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,500
You still help them.

467
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,540
The things they gave me

468
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,460
are more valuable than money.

469
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,700
You're saying that now.

470
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,610
Why didn't you retort

471
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,820
when my mother pointed at you just now?

472
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,060
Because they are your parents.

473
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,090
And

474
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,580
I'm really touched and

475
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,740
happy that you can say that

Nothing serious.

479
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,020
Love should be spoken out loudly.

480
