How about the affairs I asked you to handle?

I did it.

Bi Xiaoran has

officially broken up with Lai Zhengyi.

The person dating him

is Jiang Lili.

I'm going to move out.

Jiang Lili,

15
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,090
you become strong now, right?

Yes.

31

Since I entered Lemeng,

you have always been investigating my sister's information covertly.

33

I don't know what you want to do.

I will never give her to you.

I don't know.

Such a big bunch of flowers

98
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,070

102

I think it doesn't matter.

Ms. Ning finished her work last week.

Ms. Ning will come back.

The post-production of "The Journey of the Youth"

Try this restaurant's udon noodles.

148
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,830
Very delicious.

Really delicious.

154
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,280
But it's a little salty.

155
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,990
Salty?

156
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,230
I think it's sweet.

157

Where did you learn that?

158
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,070
There is no need to learn that.

159
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,350
I taught it

160

by myself.

161

Are you eating shit?

No.

175
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,150
Inexplicable.

176
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,390
In fact, at the beginning,

177
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,110
I also thought Angelic Lai

178

00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,470
But afterward,

180
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,630
after I came into contact with him,

181
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,750
I found

182
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,630
he was sincere to Jiangjiang.

183
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:26,750
Because...Think about it.

184
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,270
What he can get from Jiangjiang?

185
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,570
First, she is not rich.

186
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,370
Second, she is not clever.

187
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,240
Third, she doesn't have a nice body shape.

188
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,210
What does he want?

189
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,450
Is it because she can bear children?

190
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,809
After all, Lai Zhengyi is not honest.

191
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,130
They don't match each other.

192
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,679
They must break up.

194
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,090
This is the post-production report of

195
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,490
"The Journey of the Youth".

196
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,770
I have checked them.

197
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,760
Have a look.

198
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,130
I heard that someone sent you flowers yesterday.

199
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,800
Who?

200
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,440
Hurry up to tell me.

201
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,650
I don't know either.

202
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,920
It's an anonymous gift.

203
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,930
Anonymous?

204
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,250
My instinct and smell tell me

205
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,600
it's Lai Zhengling.

206
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,170
Your relationship is unusual recently.

207
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,080
You become so close to each other.

208
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,010
Do you...

209
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,730
No. You think too much.

210
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,570
Lai Zhengling,

211
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,650
though a little naughty,

212
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,970
a little silly,

213
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,680
is handsome.

214
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,960
You can take him into consideration.

215
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,730
He is still a kid.

216
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,290
It's just a spur of the moment.

217
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:19,810
Besides,

218
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,090
I don't want to fall in love now.

219
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,210
I only want to work hard.

220
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,850
You should pursue both career and love.

221
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,600
Enough.

222
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,370
Stop.

223
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,960
Come and work.

224
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,040
Love is important.

225
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,690
Work.

226
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,760
Check the contract.

227
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,720
He is handsome.

228
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,610
I signed it.

229
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,090
How about working overtime tonight

230
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,930
to watch a movie with me?

231
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,160
Which movie?

232
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,530
Detective Wall Street 3.

233
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,720
I have seen it.

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,570
"A Chinese Odyssey" is shown again.

235

How about that?

This.

I can recite all its lines.

How about horror movies?

Bloody Jerry.

You can't have seen it.

241
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,330
I have the CD.

242

How about lending it to you?

How about

244
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,770
“Boonie Cats: Good Fortune"?

245
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,410
How about it?

246
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,450
No, no, no.

247

I don't want to watch this movie.

248
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,650
But whatever happens,

249
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,170
you must watch a movie with me.

Hey.

251
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,360
You pretend to be deaf again.

Watch a movie with me.

You don't have to pretend to be deaf and dumb.

257
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,970
You are a descendant of the deaf.

What do you want to do?

262
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,330
I just want

263
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,610
you to watch a movie with me.

264
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,840

What?

267
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,970
Cancel all your arrangements.

268
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:26,770
Hey.

269
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,120
You are silent again.

270
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,170
If you keep silent,

271
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,450
I will suppose you have

272
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:32,650
promised me.

273
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,360

Here.

Hey.

At 7:30 tonight.

278
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,290
Do you know which cinema?

279
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,840
Turn left at the crossing.

280
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,920
How about going with me after work?

I look for her in vain.

Why are you here?

289
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,560
Mr. Lai is so romantic.

290
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,570
You even sent me flowers.

291

Who sent you flowers?

292
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,400
Isn't it you who invited me to come here?

293
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,770
Who invites you?

294
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,850
The person I invited is Ding Dong.

295
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,130
Ding Dong left immediately after work.

296
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,450
She said you were lonely

297
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,690
and needed companion.

298
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,290
So, I take on this duty.

299
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,530
Who needs you to do that?

300
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,210
Besides, who is lonely?

301
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,650
I don't need your company.

302
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,490
I won't see the movie.

303
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,090
Why?

304
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,970
You have already bought the tickets.

What are you doing?

I will ask others to help me.

What do you want to do?

311
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,160
Why did you break the appointment last night?

312
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,890
Why did you ask the strange colleagues

313
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:05,610
to watch the movie with me?

314
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,650
I said I was busy.

315
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,450
So, I asked an

unoccupied colleague to accompany you.

I don't want them.

I want you.

319
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,050
I said

320
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,360
I was really occupied last night.

OK.

You were occupied last night.

Are you occupied tonight?

324

Tonight,

you must have dinner with me.

Why me?

You can ask your other friends to accompany you.

I don't have other friends.

329

I don't want other friends, either.

I only want you.

Hey. Don't go.

Stop there.

Don't go.

Go to deal with your business.

OK.

He was very unapproachable then.

Besides Xiao He and me,

there is a girl he liked very much before.

It's a pity that they didn't have a happy ending.
