I could move her

204

205

Is it right?

705
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,690
It changed, have a drink.

706
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,760
Let me ask you,

707
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,950
does the sport car

708
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:16,680
downstairs look good?

709
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,280
Good.

710
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,230
Is it handsome?

711
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,030
Yes.

712
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,350
Yifei,

713
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,000
As long as you sigh the contract,

714
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,420
as long as you sigh it,

715
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,980
I will give you a ride,

716
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,300
okay?

717
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,740
I knew that

718
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,180
you held the party

719
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,420
for some reasons.

720
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,500
What?

721
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,980
How can you speak like this?

722
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,290
I did not lie to you.

723
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,420
Slow down.

724
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,420
This is lemonade.

725
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,740
Who are you?

726
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,180
You can leave,

727
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
but you can leave this glass of water.

728
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,700
Okay.

729
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,100
I am so sentimental.

730
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,670
Professional. Here.

731
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,500
You are my best friend.

732
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:06,940
how

733
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,260
can you sell your copyright?

734
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,580
I can meet any of your demand

735
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,060
as long as I can do it.

736
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,660
It is possible for you

737
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:17,980
to buy my copyright.

738
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,380
But I have a requirement.

739
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,140
What is it?

740
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,180
I want your sister,

741
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,380
Bi Xiaoran,

742
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,300
to apologize to me.

743
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,740
Then you can kill me.

744
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,620
It is impossible

745
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,780
for my sister to apologize

746
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,460
even the world was destroyed.

747
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,140
Then there's no room for discussion.

748
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,780
Though my sister does not know what is right or wrong,

749
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,660
I do know that.

750
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,060
We look identical,

751
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,100
right?

752
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,900
Punch me to make yourself feel better.

753
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,420
Wait,

754
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,540
are you going to punch me?

755
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,180
I was just being polite.

756
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,380
How about pretending

757
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,020
I am Bi Xiaoran

758
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:01,300
and we can drink a cross-cupped wine.

759
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,060
Then forget all the wrongs that have been done to us.

760
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,860
Mr. Lai.

761
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,020
Let's have fun together.

762
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,060
Together.

763
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,950
Take a drink.
