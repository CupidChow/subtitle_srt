when encountering his own love problems

153
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,670
he will act like a beginner.

How about the tricks you taught me?

155

Have a look.

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,360
Pack it well.

179
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,170
OK.

180
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
Who will you send it to?

181
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,450
I have thought about it for a long time.

182
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,320
I don't want to hide it from you.

183
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,890
Actually,

184
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,920
my friend

185
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,130
introduced a girl to me yesterday.

186
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,010
I think it's the first time we meet.

187
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,490
I can't go there with my hands empty.

188
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,770
And I am no spring chicken.

189
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,760
My parents are always urging me

190
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,370
to find a girlfriend.

191
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,330
But... Thank you

192
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,530
for buying clothes with me today.

193
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,610
You have good taste.

194
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,610
There must be no problems.

195
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:38,960
Do you have

196
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,640
the black card of City Mansion?

197
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,850
What's up?

198
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,240
I'll see

199
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,070
the girl for the first time tomorrow.

200
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,070
I must take her to eat something good.

201
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,470
I can't lose my face.

202
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,310
Don't spend too much.

203
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,910
-Sir.
-Thank you.

204
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,870
Qin Yanfei.

205
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,470
It's an expensive place.

206
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,790
I, Qin Yanfei

207
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,190
never owe others a favor.

208
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,430
I ask you for help.

209
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,710
Then I must treat you to delicious food.

210
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,050
Right.

211
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,270
This is given to you.

212
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,240
To... to me?

213
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,590
So pretty.

214
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,790
I didn't expect that

215
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,640
you had such good taste.

216
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,470
It wasn't picked by me.

217
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,000
It was

218
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,680
her.

219
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,520
The taste of the girl I like

220
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,230
must be extremely great.

221
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,590
What?

222
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,720
You asked her

223
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,910
to pick clothes for your date?

224
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,190
You are so cool.

225
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,320
OK. OK.

226
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,350
Hurry up to try it on.

227
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,750
How about it?

228
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,430
Is it OK?

229
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,030
OK.

230
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,070
Qin Yanfei,

231
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,190
which girl do you fall in love with?

232
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,710
When is it now?

233
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,310
You still play such an old trick.

234
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,870
Though the trick is old,

235
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,870
it is effective.

236
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,830
Let me tell you.

237
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,110
Love needs sincerity.

238
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,270
Why are you here?

239
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,360
To have lunch.

240
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,990
This dress doesn't fit you.

241
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,720
Really?

242
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,430
It's actually not my style.

243
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,680
I'm having a blind date.

244
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,550
It's inconvenient.

245
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,630
Otherwise, you go first?

246
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,870
You are using my card

247
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,150
but ask me to leave?

248
00:10:59,070 --> 00:10:59,430
Yes.

249
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,350
We are having a blind date.

250
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,590
Just a blind date.

251
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,710
You haven't gotten married.

252
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:04,910
What's up?

253
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,190
I need to give you some money as a gift?

254
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,390
OK.

255
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,030
I won't have lunch here.

256
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,760
[I can't bear it. I go first. Come on, bro.]

257
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,910
I can't bear it.

258
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,590
I go first.

259
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,630
Come on, bro.

260
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,640
The girl isn't right you.

261
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,310
Why does what you said

262
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,680
sound so familiar?

263
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,230
It seems that I have heard it many times.

264
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,190
After all, your heights, constellations

265
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,600
and personalities are all incompatible.

266
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,870
So, who is right for me?

267
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,190
I don't know.

268
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,680
Eat your meal.

269
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,800
OK.

270
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,180
[Lili]

271
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,470
Hello.

272
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,480
"Discipline Inspection Committee in the Entertainment Circle" received the news

273
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,590
that the best producer

274
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,240
maliciously destroyed someone's blind date.

275
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,680
Let's interview the person involved.

276
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,710
Are you boring?

277
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,520
What?

278
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,870
It's rare for Qin

279
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,640
to have a blind date.

280
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,790
It was destroyed by you.

281
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,520
You should take responsibility for it.

282
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,390
What?

283
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,510
You know the answer to that question.

284
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,350
Say.

285
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,150
What are you thinking?

286
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,350
I also don't know what I am thinking.

287
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,560
[Lili]

288
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,710
Qin Yanfei has followed you for so many years.

289
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,030
Aren't you moved by him?

290
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,750
Is it important?

291
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,510
Yes.

292
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,160
If you also like him,

293
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,190
you should

294
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,630
have a passionate romance

295
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,550
and hold a magnificent wedding ceremony.

296
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,710
You can directly enter the new stage of life.

297
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,390
The next station of happiness.

298
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,840
Happiness.

299
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,150
I?

300
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,670
Right.

301
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,830
It's you.

302
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,030
Lili, I'm different from you.

303
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,550
I don't know how to manage love

304
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,070
and how to love a man.

305
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,100
[Sister]

306
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm afraid Qin Yanfei

307
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,830
will be the next Xu Yuanhang.

308
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,710
I'm also afraid the weak love

309
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,230
can't end with a good result.

310
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,310
Because of fear,

311
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,990
then you ignore Qin Yanfei's sincerity?

312
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,590
Qin Yanfei is not Xu Yuanhang,

313
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,510
And he is unlikely to become the next Xu Yuanhang.

314
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,430
You don't have a try.

315
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,230
That's unfair to your affection.

316
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,910
I don't have the confidence.

317
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,270
You don't have to believe yourself,

318
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,110
but you must believe Qin.

319
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,000
Sister,

320
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,990
you don't have to offer yourself an opportunity,

321
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,430
but you have to give Qin Yanfei

322
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,800
an opportunity.

323
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,270
OK. OK. I'm busy.

324
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,550
Thank you.

325
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,200
Why do you suddenly

326
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,710
bring me to have a meal here?

327
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,030
Don't you like here?

328
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,870
It seems that you know

329
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,830
all that I like.

330
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,150
Dear,

331
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,710
we haven't come here for a long time.

332
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,390
Yes.

333
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,110
Come. Sit down.

334
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,550
OK.

335
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,390
Let me tell you.

336
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,910
The steak here is very delicious.

337
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,630
Really?

338
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,910
Don't you have a boyfriend?

339
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,350
Qin,

340
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,630
why are you here?

341
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,360
What a coincidence.

342
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,670
What a coincidence.

343
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,320
Do you know each other?

344
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,950
Yes.

345
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,510
You have already had a boyfriend and still went for a blind date?

346
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,430
Wait.

347
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,910
A blind date?

348
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,960
What's the matter?

349
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,950
Actually, it's...

350
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,110
Therefore,

351
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,480
she is just one of my classmates.

She came to perform a play with me

356

Three ice cream cones are still not enough.

404
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,820
It's needless to ask.

If a rich person like you

I can take over the position of CEO

702
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,570
of the branch office in China.

703
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,200
This is a hot potato.

704
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,120
Others all want to avoid it.

705
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,490
Only you take the initiative.

706
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,410
But it is an excellent chance

707
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,090
for me.

708
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,570
If there is any problem

709
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,960
that I can help you solve,

710
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,800
feel free to contact me.

711
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,490
Of course.

712
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:51,050
I won't be polite to you.

713
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,010
OK.

714
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,890
Come.

715
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,970
What do you want to eat?

716
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,640
OK.

717
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,130
I'm outside.

718
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,240
With a

719
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,890
common friend.

720
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,010
A common friend?

721
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:15,680
A man.

722
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,690
You don't know him.

723
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,890
A man?

724
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,280
I'm not a man.

725
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,090
I'm female.

726
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:21,890
I'm a woman.

727
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,370
And I am not his common friend.

728
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,250
I'm his girlfriend.

729
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,970
You are his girlfriend?

730
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,200
Zhengyi has a girlfriend?

731
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,610
Why doesn't he tell me?

732
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,360
Mom.

733
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:35,170
My God.

734
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,330
She is my mom.

735
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,040
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

736
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,080
Zhengyi,

737
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,210
bring her home and let me see.

738
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,200
OK, mom.

739
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,680
I'm going to bring her home now.

740
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,530
OK.

741
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:51,690
This guy.

742
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:52,770
He has a girlfriend

743
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:54,210
and doesn't tell me.

744
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,320
Mom,

745
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,800
this is my girlfriend Jiang Lili.

746
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,040
She is Bi Xiaoran's sister.

747
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,730
No wonder they look the same.

748
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,520
You are in a relationship with her.

749
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,760
How about Bi Xiaoran?

750
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,440
Zhengyi,

751
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,930
you are in a relationship with both of them?

752
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,970
No.

753
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,570
I told you before

754
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,130
I pretended to be in a relationship with Bi Xiaoran.

755
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,810
Our Zhengyi

756
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,730
is very outstanding.

757
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,000
A common girl

758
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,680
doesn't deserve him.

759
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,760
Besides,

760
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,930
it's not so easy to

761
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,210
marry into our Lai family.

762
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,170
Some girls overestimate themselves

763
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,810
and have grandiose aims but puny abilities.

764
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,290
No matter what they do,

765
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,730
finally,

766
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,730
they'll humiliate themselves.

767
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,730
Our Lai family has a lot of business.

768
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,370
Zhengyi needs an intelligent and capable

769
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,320
woman with a well-matched family background.

770
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,200
I'm doomed. I'm doomed.

771
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,840
I'm neither clever

772
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,970
or capable.

773
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,930
Our family backgrounds are not well matched.

774
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,250
I overestimate myself

775
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,450
and have grandiose aims but puny abilities.

776
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
If they give me twenty million dollars

777
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,170
and ask me to leave Lai Zhengyi,

778
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,730
shall I accept it with pleasure

779
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,970
or bargain with them?

780
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:09,650
It doesn't matter.

781
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,170
Don't be afraid.

782
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,370
Un... Uncle.

783
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,450
You this girl.

784
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,850
I have already given you the welcome gift.

785
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,810
You still call me uncle.

786
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,490
Call me dad.

787
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,330
Dad.
