181
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,943
Also, use Nanami-san in this room

182
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:15,943
Koichiro-san

183
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:25,955
Who is this person? This is my son Koichiro

184
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:30,960
"I can't believe I have such a big son"

185
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,962
Kyotoku Women's University Faculty of Letters 4th year...

186
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,965
(Koichiro) "Motivation and energy Nanami" isn't it?

187
00:17:35,965 --> 00:17:37,967
You know well

188
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:41,971
Starting today, I'll be working as a live-in person

189
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:43,971
thank you

190
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:56,917
Do it

191
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:00,923
Huh?

192
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:03,926
Dogeza

193
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:05,928
Koichiro-san

194
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:07,930
(Koichiro) Can it be done for 500 yen?

195
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,932
I won't accept it unless I docked and asked

196
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:11,934
Nanami just said it in an analogy...

197
00:18:11,934 --> 00:18:17,940
Don't talk like a loud, lewd mother

198
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,946
It's okay, my wife is my selling point

199
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,946
But... It's good

200
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,955
thank you

201
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
(Koichiro) Hmm...

202
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:43,966
(Yoko) Koichiro

203
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:47,970
Wait a minute Koichiro-san, wait

204
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,970
(Footsteps descending stairs)

205
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:01,918
"What is that guy! I can't forgive it.'

206
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:05,922
{No matter how much you are a son of a family that you will be grateful for.}

207
00:19:05,922 --> 00:19:09,926
{Look, I won't lose}

208
00:19:09,926 --> 00:19:13,930
Okay, the housekeeper begins

209
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:33,950
・～

210
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:43,960
・～

211
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,962
(The sound of the door opening)

212
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:47,964
(scream)

213
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:50,964
Just knock a little!

214
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:57,903
What is it? Put on this

215
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,911
Um, I'm here

216
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:03,913
I'll take care of you as a housekeeper

217
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:05,915
Isn't it a maid?

218
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,918
Please take me, little boy

219
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:11,921
You have no choice

220
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:15,925
If I say a word to my dad, I'd be fired

221
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:19,929
He came to our house anyway because he didn't have a good place to work for?

222
00:20:19,929 --> 00:20:22,932
Get on quickly, I'll take care of you

223
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,934
What do you think you know?

224
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:26,936
It's fine now. Stop it! My wife is wonderful but

225
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,938
This house is already a sluggish thing!

226
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,940
I can say arrogant things in that outfit

227
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,942
(scream)

228
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:35,942
Ah... no...

229
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:39,949
Ah...

230
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:43,953
That's right, the best maids are honest.

231
00:20:43,953 --> 00:20:46,953
Keep your knees 20cm

232
00:20:50,893 --> 00:20:54,897
《Guu... What? That attitude

233
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:56,899
{Why am I like a maid cafe?

234
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:59,902
Do you have to dress? 》

235
00:20:59,902 --> 00:21:04,902
"My first choice is female announcer, and my second choice is...

236
00:21:29,932 --> 00:21:32,932
It suits you quite well

237
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:57,894
"I'm glad your husband seemed kind."

238
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:00,897
"We're a couple a little older than us,

239
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:04,897
His wife was the second wife.

240
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:11,908
(Kiuchi) Yes, a really good person came

241
00:22:11,908 --> 00:22:13,910
She cooks the food

242
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,914
I hope they do all the shopping and other household chores.

243
00:22:17,914 --> 00:22:19,914
yes!

244
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:26,923
Sorry, Koichiro made me dress like that.

245
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:28,925
Ah... no

246
00:22:28,925 --> 00:22:32,929
I wonder if it suits me quite a bit

247
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:35,932
(laughter)

248
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:39,936
Positiveness is important in everything

249
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:44,941
That's the deciding factor for hiring.

250
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:50,947
Um... can I ask you one?

251
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:52,947
Yeah

252
00:22:54,951 --> 00:22:59,951
Koichiro doesn't eat together?

253
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,962
Sorry! I've heard something unnecessary

254
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:08,965
No, it's fine

255
00:23:08,965 --> 00:23:11,968
Koichiro doesn't eat her food

256
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:14,971
I always have cup ramen in my room

257
00:23:14,971 --> 00:23:17,974
What do you mean...

258
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:20,977
Nanami is about the same age as Koichiro.

259
00:23:20,977 --> 00:23:23,980
I wonder if you treat me like a friend?

260
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,986
I think you're aware of it, but I'm blocking things

261
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:33,990
Friend... is it?

262
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:38,995
I saw Nanami and thought I could entrust Koichiro with her.

263
00:23:38,995 --> 00:23:40,997
See, it's not a bad idea

264
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:45,001
He's a little clumsy, or rather hardworking.

265
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:48,004
《Huh? There? 》

266
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:52,942
"Is that what made me a decision about recruiting? 》

267
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:56,946
Do you really not?

268
00:23:56,946 --> 00:23:58,948
Haa... No

269
00:23:58,948 --> 00:24:03,953
If Koichiro doesn't like it...

270
00:24:03,953 --> 00:24:05,955
yes

271
00:24:05,955 --> 00:24:07,955
good

272
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,962
Okay, then

273
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,965
Let's celebrate Nanami-san coming (Yoko)

274
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:17,967
There's a 2003 Bordeaux.

275
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,969
So it's a toast

276
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:22,972
Wow! Is it okay?

277
00:24:22,972 --> 00:24:25,975
Please it's in the wine cellar in the kitchen

278
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,978
I'm happy!

279
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:30,980
Hehe...

280
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,985
Yes she would do it

281
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,987
Sorry I just can't get it

282
00:24:37,987 --> 00:24:40,990
No, you don't need to apologise

283
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:44,994
My manager is not good

284
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:48,998
・(Crassing sound) ・Ah!

285
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:51,998
・Ahhh

286
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,942
Sorry

287
00:24:59,942 --> 00:25:04,942
I've lost it since 2003

288
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:10,949
(laughter)

289
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:21,964
{I'm not reluctant but

290
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:24,967
It's no use for a couple to tell you.

291
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,969
《Stay, Nanami》

292
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,973
With the spirit of "motivation, energy, Nanami"

293
00:25:30,973 --> 00:25:33,973
I'll face Koichiro's young man>

294
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:44,984
Koichiro's young

295
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:51,927
・(Koichiro) Who? ah…

296
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:56,927
I thought it might be a good night's dinner

297
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:03,939
・Is it just my mother's money anyway? I don't need it

298
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:07,943
No, I made it

299
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:10,943
For Koichiro's young man

300
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,952
It's going up

301
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,965
I'll be in the way

302
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:35,971
Ah, I brought a late dinner

303
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,971
Today I'm stewed udon

304
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,976
I'll put it there

305
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,984
(Sigh)

306
00:26:53,923 --> 00:26:59,929
I don't know if it suits your mouth or not

307
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,931
ah…

308
00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:06,936
I'm not good at cooking...

309
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:10,940
There's nothing special about it anyway, right?

310
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,944
Yes, yes I'll lower it

311
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:17,947
Huh? Ah, it's fine

312
00:27:17,947 --> 00:27:20,947
I just wanted to eat something bad

313
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:29,959
It's not honest

314
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:33,963
Huh? Ah, no

315
00:27:33,963 --> 00:27:38,968
Do you taste it? Young boy

316
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:42,968
It's bad, it's bad

317
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:00,921
Hehe...

318
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:06,927
What is it?

319
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:14,937
Once you've finished eating, place it under the stairs like you would have to serve it.

320
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:16,937
Well, good night

321
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,965

545
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,993
Oh... Your wife is like that?

546
00:54:45,993 --> 00:54:48,996
Is that what your husband does?

547
00:54:48,996 --> 00:54:50,996
Hidden camera?

548
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:54,935
(Koichiro) I prepared it

549
00:54:54,935 --> 00:54:57,938
No

550
00:54:57,938 --> 00:54:59,940
worst!

551
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:02,943
What about lost virgin in this way?

552
00:55:02,943 --> 00:55:04,945
It's too sad

553
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:06,945
Stop it

554
00:55:22,963 --> 00:55:25,963
Husband?

555
00:55:27,968 --> 00:55:29,970
・(ラット)

556
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,970
please

557
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:43,981
Ah well you came

558
00:55:46,987 --> 00:55:48,987
Ha... Yes

559
00:55:51,926 --> 00:55:55,930
I got a call from us, Koichiro is you...

560
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,933
Ah, no, sorry

561
00:55:58,933 --> 00:56:02,937
Apparently he got tired and went wild at home

562
00:56:02,937 --> 00:56:07,942
I'm feeling a bit tired of it, what should I say...

563
00:56:07,942 --> 00:56:10,945
I'm going to do something pretty much

564
00:56:10,945 --> 00:56:14,949
No, that's... it's fine

565
00:56:14,949 --> 00:56:16,951
I also went to Koichiro

566
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:19,954
There's something I've said too much

567
00:56:19,954 --> 00:56:22,957
I guess they won't be able to come back to us anymore

568
00:56:22,957 --> 00:56:25,957
My place is lonely

569
00:56:28,963 --> 00:56:33,968
My husband and wife really did well.

570
00:56:33,968 --> 00:56:36,971
I'm so grateful

571
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:41,976
But living with Koichiro is...

572
00:56:41,976 --> 00:56:45,980
Maybe I can't do it

573
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,917
Well, I'll have a job search for you properly

574
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:54,922
It's good to work hard at work, which is a shame

575
00:56:54,922 --> 00:56:56,924
sorry

576
00:56:56,924 --> 00:56:59,927
I'll wait a minute and finish it soon

577
00:56:59,927 --> 00:57:03,931
Finally, shall we eat a meal?

578
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:05,931
yes!

579
00:57:40,968 --> 00:57:43,971
Hey Nanami-kun, that's fine

580
00:57:43,971 --> 00:57:46,974
That's fine. Where should I put this?

581
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:49,910
Ah... uh, that's fine

582
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,912
yes

583
00:57:51,912 --> 00:57:54,915
So I'll be spoiled by your words and please copy this

584
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:58,919
And then I'll be happy to hear this one in order.

585
00:57:58,919 --> 00:58:00,919
ah

586
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:42,963
Um... can I listen?

587
00:58:42,963 --> 00:58:44,963
Yeah?

588
00:58:48,969 --> 00:58:52,906
Sorry for keeping you waiting, thank you

589
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:56,910
What is work for your husband?

590
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,913
Why do you ask that?

591
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:03,917
Even if I'm looking for a job, I'll dream of it

592
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:07,921
I don't think I can see the true nature of work...

593
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:11,925
That's why I've only failed

594
00:59:11,925 --> 00:59:16,930
Compared to my company's large size, it's as small as the nails.

595
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,932
There are four employees, including me.

596
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,935
Maybe it's helpful

597
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:24,938
Please let me know

598
00:59:24,938 --> 00:59:30,944
Ah... well, what kind of work do you do?

599
00:59:30,944 --> 00:59:35,949
When our work and sincerity are conveyed to the other party,

600
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:39,953
It feels very accomplished, not just profit.

601
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:43,957
I think something like priceless is my job.

602
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:47,957
Haha... I guess it was the answer Nanami wanted.

603
00:59:49,897 --> 00:59:55,897
No, I'm so moved right now

604
00:59:57,905 --> 01:00:00,908
<旦那様の金言をお聞きして・

605
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:04,912
I've been embarrassed up until now>

606
01:00:04,912 --> 01:00:07,915
<見栄えだけで職業を決めたり・

607
01:00:07,915 --> 01:00:10,918
I was able to kneel down for just 500 yen.

608
01:00:10,918 --> 01:00:13,921
"Okay, I've stopped looking for a job! 》

609
01:00:13,921 --> 01:00:16,924
"It's not just a part-time job to gain experience points,

610
01:00:16,924 --> 01:00:19,927
I'll become a professional maid! 》

611
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:23,931
"Motivation and energy Nanami is here! 》

612
01:00:23,931 --> 01:00:25,933
Husband, it's over now

613
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:28,936
It's not

614
01:00:28,936 --> 01:00:33,941
I would like to cancel the last dinner party

615
01:00:33,941 --> 01:00:36,944
What's up? If you're offended, I'll apologise

616
01:00:36,944 --> 01:00:39,947
I was able to do something that I couldn't help but feel uneasy.

617
01:00:39,947 --> 01:00:42,950
No... noppy? Excuse me

618
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,954
No no, Nanami? Nanami-kun

619
01:00:46,954 --> 01:00:48,956
(The sound of the door closing)

620
01:00:48,956 --> 01:00:56,897

621
01:00:56,897 --> 01:00:58,899

・～

623
01:01:04,905 --> 01:01:06,907
Hey Koichiro!

624
01:01:06,907 --> 01:01:08,909
A shut-in rape man!

625
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:10,909
Come out quietly!

626
01:01:14,915 --> 01:01:16,915
If you don't come out quietly...

627
01:01:21,922 --> 01:01:25,926
(Koichiro) Hey, what is it? Suddenly

628
01:01:25,926 --> 01:01:29,930
Hey, do you like me?

629
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:33,934
Don't be stupid, I hate it

630
01:01:33,934 --> 01:01:36,937
Right ha ha ha...

631
01:01:36,937 --> 01:01:38,937
I hate it too!

632
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:45,946
Huh? What are you saying?

633
01:01:45,946 --> 01:01:48,949
Even if you hate it now, you can like it now

634
01:01:48,949 --> 01:01:51,885
I'll do what I love to you

635
01:01:51,885 --> 01:01:57,891
I'll fall in love with you too now

636
01:01:57,891 --> 01:02:01,891
Huh? What? Huh?

637
01:02:24,918 --> 01:02:27,921
Come on a batch

638
01:02:27,921 --> 01:02:29,921
"Come a batch"?

639
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:33,925
Ah...

640
01:02:35,929 --> 01:02:40,929
Are you prepared to be able to unite a virgin and a virgin?

641
01:02:44,938 --> 01:02:46,940
And promise

642
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:50,940
Part 1: Stop being a shut-in today

643
01:02:53,947 --> 01:02:57,947
Part 2: I'll do my best tomorrow

644
01:03:00,954 --> 01:03:04,958
And #3 Here is the most important thing

645
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:06,960
Don't despise women

646
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,963
And take care of your wife

647
01:03:09,963 --> 01:03:12,966
I'll accept it as a mother

648
01:03:12,966 --> 01:03:15,969
Is it okay?

649
01:03:15,969 --> 01:03:17,969
yes

650
01:03:28,982 --> 01:03:33,982
