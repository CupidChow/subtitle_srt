ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,349
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:03,396
We don't keep those records to share
with those outside of our department.

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,026
I don't know where you heard
about the mortality conference,

5
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,028
but it's just a meeting
we, the doctors, hold

6
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,781
to discuss the cause of death

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,991
when a patient dies. That's all it is.

8
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,079
We don't hold it because there was
a problem. It is just a formality!

9
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,664
We'll note that your department
refused to provide the documents.

10
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,707
Do you consent?

11
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,466
Do you consent?

12
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:37,722
I'll stay here.

13
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,141
Why don't you go
talk to the deputy director?

14
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,357
Sure. Hold the fort down.

16
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,864
Where did he go?

17
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,657
As I told you, he's out at an appointment.

18
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,993
-When will he be back?
-He didn't say.

19
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,624
Gosh, Mr. Gu…

20
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,043
I just can't take it anymore.

21
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,714
Please, move me to another office!
Please! My goodness.

22
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,426
Oh, no. It's dialing. No. Cancel the call.

23
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,113
They're almost here.

24
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,908
-Damn it.
-We don't have time for that.

25
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,409
-Just delete them all.
-What?

26
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,952
-Delete them all.
-Okay.

Deputy Director…

30
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,753
What is this?

31
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,464
It's like they're exercising
a search warrant.

32
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,634
You get along the best with Mr. Gu.

33
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,011
You should go and talk to him.

34
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,388
He isn't in his office right now.

35
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,557
Did you think I was just
sitting back and watching?

36
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,142
I went up there, but…

37
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,312
I think he's avoiding us.

38
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,397
Then what? Do we have to let them do this?

39
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,567
They won't know what they're looking at.

40
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,611
Just pretend to cooperate.

41
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,739
They can figure things out
if they really try to.

42
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,408
They are asking for our records
on the mortality conferences.

43
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,372
I'm sure they have experts behind them.

44
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:12,377
Where did he run off to
after causing mayhem here?

45
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,214
EPISODE 4

46
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,434
Goodness.

47
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,208
Good. Stay.

48
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,626
Here.

49
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,464
Nice.

50
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,301
You like this, don't you?

51
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,635
Here.

52
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,895
Are you here for them?

53
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,647
Yes. Hello.

54
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,025
They have a guest? That's a surprise.

55
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,695
I'm sure their children visit often.

56
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,572
They say they have children. Sure.

57
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,658
They must
since they nag and order us around.

58
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,667
You poor thing.
You must have been lonely, too.

59
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,338
There you go. Good boy.

60
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,467
Even the dog is lovely at this place.

61
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,593
How cute.

62
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,973
Good morning, sir.

63
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,062
I think mutts are the cutest dogs.

64
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,856
That isn't a mutt.

65
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,816
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:00,693
What breed is it?

67
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,280
It's… Hey, I told you to stay inside.

68
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,866
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello.

69
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,368
We haven't had breakfast yet.

70
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,412
Take your time. I'll wait.

71
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,956
No. That's not what I mean.

72
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,708
Why don't you join us?

73
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,293
Don't!

74
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,600
I heard

75
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,478
our second son sent you here.

76
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,562
Is that right?

77
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,899
-Yes.
-He didn't send this guy.

78
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,027
He's here
because he wants the land in Songtan.

79
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,782
Is it really bad for our son
if we refuse to sell it

80
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,408
and hold onto it?

81
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,703
He's just saying that.

82
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,124
What Minister doesn't own
a little plot of land?

83
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,627
Why would he get in trouble?
He's such a coward.

84
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,421
My gosh. He must have his reasons.

85
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,052
Sir, technically,
it isn't just a little plot of land.

86
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,013
You have 30,000 pyeong
of registered farmland.

87
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,850
But you neither live there
nor farm the land.

88
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,353
It's only because
I'm not strong enough to.

89
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,021
It's a violation of the Farmland Act.

90
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,108
I don't know how he passed the hearing,

91
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,818
but this cannot…

92
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,778
go unnoticed forever.

93
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,240
This is a ticking time bomb
for a public official.

94
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,534
A bomb?

95
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,995
You've seen several Ministers
who were removed from office

96
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,371
for making bad land deals.

97
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,959
Sir. Ma'am.

98
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,419
You're right.

99
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,921
I want your land in Songtan.

100
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,468
But the reason I came all the way here
is that it's so clear

101
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,096
that the land will be an obstacle
to the Minister's political career.

102
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,599
As someone who respects him,

103
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,143
I'd like to prevent anything
that could harm him.

104
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,401
We'll buy it for 58 billion won.

105
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,240
Did the value go up that much?

106
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,452
I know you're not greedy about money.
I can tell.

107
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,579
But 58 billion won…

108
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:21,292
You can imagine how you can spend
your retirement with that, can't you?

109
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,170
Must you ruin your son's life

110
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:26,255
and keep that land

111
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,341
just because it's where your ancestors
were buried?

112
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,470
Ma'am. We have many sick people
in our hospital.

113
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:37,058
Those patients have nowhere to go
because the hospital is too small.

114
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,519
Please.

115
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,190
Let us build our hospital
on your land in Songtan.

116
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,620
Goodness.

117
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,380
Thank you for breakfast, ma'am.

118
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,264
Oh, dear. You hardly ate at all.

119
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,434
Make sure to eat something later.

120
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,394
Don't skip your meal.

121
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,659
You know smoking is bad for you.

122
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,162
What are you talking about?
I quit smoking years ago.

123
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,085
It's nice here.

124
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,590
Of course, it must look nice to outsiders.

125
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,968
If you bought a house in Seoul
and came here to visit,

126
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,303
it would look nicer to you, too.

127
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,474
A long time ago,

128
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,853
this used to be a total wasteland.

129
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,356
The townspeople cultivated
this wasteland together with bare hands.

130
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,733
All of this.

131
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,443
How incredible.

132
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,279
It wasn't out of choice.

133
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,116
If we didn't, they whipped us.
If we ran, they shot us.

134
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,576
We did it to stay alive.

135
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,622
I was dragged here
all the way from Pohang.

136
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,707
The soldiers

137
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,419
put their submachine guns on our backs

138
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,212
and shoved us into the huts.

139
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,550
What era are you talking about?
During the Japanese occupation?

140
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,218
Japanese occupation?

141
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,180
If I worked here back then,
I'd be over 100 years old now.

142
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,891
How ancient do you think I am?

143
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,527
They abused us for years,

144
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,282
but we still worked hard because we were
promised some of the land we reclaimed.

145
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,534
But now, they say the government owns it.

146
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,162
They're telling us to give it back.

147
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,082
You know,

148
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,210
I was a bit of a thug back in the day.

149
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,507
But still, my dad protected that land
in Songtan

150
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,385
until the very end and left it to me.

151
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,808
I wanted to live there with everyone here.

152
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,769
I cannot do anything here

153
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,356
since they keep reminding me how all
the land belongs to the government.

154
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,443
Everyone? Live together in Songtan?

155
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,903
All the townspeople?

156
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,740
It's not like there are that many.

157
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,493
It's a huge plot of land.
You can all go there.

158
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,704
Or you can just keep 1,000 pyeong
and sell the rest.

159
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,041
Or you can buy better land
with the money from the sale

160
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,584
and have everyone move there.

161
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,089
My second son won't allow it.

162
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,633
He'd blow his fuse.

163
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,262
He said he would rather kill himself
than have people find out

164
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,639
that I was one of the pioneers.

165
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,770
But will he really be in trouble…

166
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,482
if I don't sell the land?

167
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,695
Will he lose his job as Minister?

168
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,322
Will he?

169
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,995
Yes, he will.

00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,559
Our chief said to wait--

179
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,519
-Is it over here?
-How dare you let them through?

180
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:23,946
Who told you to let people in
without my permission?

181
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,409
Can't you distinguish
between colleagues and outsiders?

182
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,579
-The notice--
-Are you scared because they swarmed in,

183
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,746
wearing black suits?

184
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,042
Are you scared
because they act like gangsters?

185
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,670
"A medical practitioner shall not consent
to unauthorized personnel

186
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:42,923
accessing or copying patients' records."

187
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,012
Punks who know nothing about medical law
are running amok,

188
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,805
and you just watch?

189
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,224
Why aren't you doing anything?
Why are you just watching?

190
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,810
If they need our daily logs,

191
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,187
tell them to follow the protocol
and submit a request.

192
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,481
You and I have nothing to hide.

193
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,858
Let them take whatever they want!

194
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,571
However,
if they insist on using force like this,

195
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,282
I will report every single one of them

196
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,577
for violating the Medical Service Act
even if I have to risk my job here.

197
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,996
You do your duties.

198
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,205
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

199
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,668
Beat it.

200
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,227
Look up, all of you.

201
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,732
What's running through your mind
right now?

202
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,530
"I need to finish what I was doing.

203
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,449
I'm on call tonight.

204
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,160
I wonder what time I can go home today."

205
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:55,371
You're busy with your own stuff.

206
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,084
You lack the energy or interest
to worry about other departments, right?

207
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,710
I was like that too.

208
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,587
But…

209
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,590
if you continue to show
a lack of interest,

210
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,387
they'll keep coming at us.

211
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,724
They will eventually hold our future
in their hands. Got it?

212
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,118
The patients are waiting.
Let's wrap up the vote on the strike.

213
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,285
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

214
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,793
NEUROSURGERY

215
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,227
PEDIATRICS

216
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,812
ORGAN TRANSPLANT CENTER

217
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,063
For.

218
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,443
-For.
-For.

219
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,321
TO WORKER ANT, ENTIRE MEDICAL STAFF
IS VOTING ON THE STRIKE

220
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,281
For.

221
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,035
FOR, AGAINST

222
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,750
It's slow and quiet today
as if they wanted us to vote.

223
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,460
-Hey!
-Dr. Park!

224
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,837
I told you never to bring up
the word "quiet" in the ER.

225
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,464
Thanks to you, it'll get--

226
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,841
One fall victim and stab victim
are on their way.

227
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,760
-Coming.
-See?

228
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,182
Send them to the resuscitation room
and treatment room.

229
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,684
The stab victim
has severe bleeding from the face.

230
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,561
The other seems to have
multiple rib fractures.

231
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,146
-They will be arriving together.
-Okay.

232
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,773
Will it be okay?

233
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,442
We can't take part in it anyway.

234
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:53,072
Not the strike. The Restructure Team
took all of our logs.

235
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,075
They can easily find things
they can use against us.

236
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,411
Those mistakes were made
because we were so busy.

237
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,664
I guess we can't expect Mr. Gu
to understand since he's not a doctor.

238
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,791
Does he have to understand?

239
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,751
Sorry?

240
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,505
-Is he the fall victim?
-Yes.

241
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,589
This way.

242
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,761
What's wrong?

243
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,390
Dr. Lee.

244
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,559
One, two, three.

245
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,686
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

246
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,954
KIM JI-HUN

247
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,500
Mr. Kim, the wound isn't deep.

248
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,794
We'll get an x-ray and CT scan,

249
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:52,131
but it's just to check for nerve damage
or internal bleeding.

250
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,092
Don't worry. We'll give you
anesthesia and stitch you up.

251
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,552
Do you understand?

252
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,722
What happened?

253
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,642
That jerk…

254
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:05,894
That jerk…

255
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,399
The one who killed his daughter…

256
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,110
took a box cutter…

257
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,491
The wound's been treated,
but his diagnosis from Psychiatry…

258
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:20,951
Discharge him.

259
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:22,870
He says you may take him.

260
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,506
Jae-hyeok.

261
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,302
-Jae-hyeok!
-Yes.

262
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,429
Control the bleeding.

263
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,555
Yes, sir.

264
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,649
This is Emergency Medicine.
We need a brain CT for Kim Ji-hun.

265
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,990
Luckily, there's no nerve damage
or internal bleeding.

266
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,411
Do you want to get the stitches here
or at Plastic Surgery?

267
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,330
You'll have to wait if you want it there.

268
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,873
They're available after 7 p.m.

269
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,376
Is it okay… to get the stitches here?

270
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,587
The wound isn't deep, so it would be okay.

271
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:15,923
Okay.

272
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,926
Jae-hyeok, you do it.

273
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,595
-Pardon?
-Set it up, please.

274
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,722
Okay, Dr. Ye.

275
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,016
Come here. Do it with me.

276
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,436
Mr. Kim. You know him, right?

277
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,773
He's a good doctor,
so you don't need to worry.

278
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,399
We'll make sure it won't leave a scar.

279
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,653
-Okay.
-Please lie down.

280
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,988
Get ready.

281
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,063
LAND SALE AGREEMENT

282
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,419
LAND SALE AGREEMENT

283
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,161
Good job.

284
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:14,499
Things really work out better
when you do them yourself.

285
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,254
Thank you, sir.

286
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,008
The land matter is resolved now.

287
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,389
I hear you got everyone unified.

288
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,769
The Restructure Team's director
is quick with his job.

289
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,105
He hasn't been at the hospital
for 24 hours yet.

290
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,940
I can tell from my brother-in-law

291
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,109
that doctors lack a sense of unity.

292
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,280
They're too full of themselves
to unify for one cause.

293
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,451
I heard they are set to go on strike.
I've never seen them unify so quickly.

294
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,454
It's not a good thing.

295
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:57,125
-You're right, sir.
-The cargo union is still causing trouble.

296
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,004
And yet, I reassigned you, who is
the most competent in dealing with unions,

297
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,424
as the president of the hospital
because I would like you…

298
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,846
to generate revenue

299
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,224
that can sustain the entire group.

300
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,375
Medical school, hospital,
insurance, and pharmaceuticals.

301
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,753
We finally have all four pillars
of the medical industry.

302
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,091
Why do you think
I put you in that position?

303
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,302
How many of our subsidiaries

304
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,721
do you think will last
more than ten years?

305
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,099
The medical industry
is a promising sector.

306
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,686
In this era, hospitals are
where everyone eventually ends up.

307
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,606
Companies spent decades instilling
the idea that medical care is a service.

308
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,110
Do you think we built private hospitals,
added more beds,

309
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,195
and invested for nothing?

310
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:10,115
The market is finally ready.

311
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,409
Now is the time we grow our business.

312
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,707
People won't complain about the hospital
having problems after you took over.

313
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,041
I'll make sure of it.

314
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,794
I trust your words.

315
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,215
Regarding the construction
of the building in Songtan,

316
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,800
the headquarters will fund it, correct?

317
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,596
You can…

318
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,681
trust my words.

319
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,934
Not all of it though.

320
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,437
Not all of it. I see.

321
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:42,814
Thank you, Mr. Cho.

322
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,249
…to generate revenue

323
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,668
that can sustain the entire group.

324
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,801
Mr. Gu is here.

325
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,640
I'm Park Jong-sang from Hwajeong Chemical.

326
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,812
I must have kept you waiting for so long.

327
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,564
Please have a seat.

328
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:26,942
Have a seat.

329
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,545
Where should we begin?

330
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,382
We would like to start with drug muggers.

331
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,885
Long-term use of strong drugs
can lead to liver damage

332
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,264
or nutritional deficiency
due to the drug-mugging effect.

333
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,641
Since this is a general hospital,
we want to target that

334
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,726
and help patients make up
for the deficient nutrients

335
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,852
with our supplements.

336
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,856
The doctors could tell the patients

337
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,360
that their medication hinders
the absorption of certain nutrients

338
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,904
and recommend our products.

339
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:14,990
And this.

340
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,161
If you put these up on the wall
or in the elevators,

341
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,956
the patients will naturally
become aware of our products.

342
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,126
And these are weight-loss supplements.

343
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,877
These are the latest products.

344
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,880
We hired an actor who recently lost weight
as our model, so it's doing well.

345
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,383
Okay.

346
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,511
Why don't you leave these here?

347
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,680
I saw on my way up here

348
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:42,517
that the bakery on the first floor
has the best location.

349
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,019
It's the perfect size for us, too.

350
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,603
I will take that into consideration.

351
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,982
I'll let our president know
that you said you'll consider the idea

352
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,234
and look it over. Thank you for your time.

353
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,912
Put those away.

354
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,122
Okay.

355
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,425
Don't take those things. Just exercise.

356
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:23,475
Hwajeong Life Insurance said they'll buy
the data sets at 1.5 million won each.

357
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,185
Why did he bother fighting it?

358
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,315
Draft a contract with Hwajeong Chemical
stating that we get a 30% commission

359
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,067
on sales made through our hospital.

360
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,984
Okay.

361
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,614
And let me see the lease status
of the businesses in the hospital.

362
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,907
Okay.

363
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,371
GLUTTON: MOST SEEM TO WANT A STRIKE

364
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,914
WORKER ANT: LET'S MEET UP

365
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,502
What's wrong? It wasn't your fault.

366
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,713
Are you trying to make me feel guilty?

367
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,301
Because that cop got hurt
after I sent the patient with him?

368
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:08,853
No.

369
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,399
I was reminded of a patient from before.

370
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,485
I made a call to discharge that patient…

371
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,072
"Do you remember that patient?"

372
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:21,825
Pardon?

373
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,120
-Are you asking me?
-During my residency,

374
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,753
I was supposed to call a cardiologist,

375
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,298
but it was obvious that the patient
had congestive heart failure.

376
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,511
He had difficulty breathing
due to the blood in his lungs.

377
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,555
I could tell just from the stethoscope.

378
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,060
I prescribed him aspirin and diuretics,
and he got better in no time.

379
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,896
I felt good.

380
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,231
Did you discharge him?

381
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,442
Yes.

382
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,861
It was late,

383
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,572
and I didn't want to hear the specialist
whine about being called in.

384
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,616
They're all excuses.

385
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,327
I think…

386
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,622
I needed reassurance
that I can do it on my own

387
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,542
at the time.

388
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,923
The next day, Ms. Kim asked me
when I was leaving,

389
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:21,593
"Do you remember that patient?"

390
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,388
Do you remember that patient?
He came back.

391
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,473
"He came back."

392
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,021
Lee Gang-min died four or five days later.

393
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,401
That wasn't…

394
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,779
necessarily your fault.

395
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,032
I hate that question.

396
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,576
"Do you remember that patient?"

397
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,120
"He came back."

398
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,793
How did you feel?

399
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,887
I couldn't tell anybody in our department.

400
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,265
Not because of the consequences,

401
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,644
but because I knew they would feel
uncomfortable to hear about my mistake.

402
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,522
They tried to avoid me.

403
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:19,567
People in this field
do not admit to mistakes.

404
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,154
It's impossible not to make them,
but they insist they don't.

405
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,869
Doctors must admit to their mistakes, too.

406
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,789
But…

407
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,293
It's true, but if you do…

408
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,170
It's a good thing to remember patients.

409
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,966
It'll reduce the number of mistakes
you make.

410
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:48,930
Good night.

411
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,118
Over here.

412
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,833
Gosh.

413
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,672
One serving of tako wasabi, please.
The sake is good here.

414
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,133
And Daiginjo sake and grilled squid.

415
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,262
We'll also have grilled smelt.

416
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,263
Okay.

417
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,223
PRIVATE SPECIALTY HOSPITALS
ENTER FOREIGN MARKETS

418
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,755
They'll finish voting on the strike
by tomorrow.

419
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,549
Even if more oppose tomorrow,
it won't change the result.

420
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,801
Okay.

421
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,178
What? That's it?

422
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,805
Why did you want to meet?

423
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,225
-I found him.
-Who?

424
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,685
The one who played the dead man.

425
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,979
The one who posted
the financial statement.

426
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,066
-What?
-Do you know Ye Jin-woo?

427
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,901
The one in Emergency Medicine? It was him?

428
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,781
Is that why he spoke up
during yesterday's meeting?

429
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,659
-It's surprising.
-What is?

430
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,870
He was the type who never speaks up.

431
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,833
Is he one
of Chief Joo Kyung-moon's people?

432
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,210
What? Why?

433
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,128
Maybe they worked together.

434
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:47,632
Well,

435
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,803
It's not like Chief Joo is
a nobody from nowhere, but…

436
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,597
Someone from Sangkook must have been
considered for his position.

437
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,684
But the director hired him
instead of that candidate.

438
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,394
I told you. He is an outcast.

439
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,106
Chief Joo has no "people"
that he looks after or looks after him.

440
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:05,024
Then who are those two close to?

441
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,819
What are you scheming this time?

442
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,988
You'll find out if you tell me.

443
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,990
Ye Jin-woo's close to Dr. Lee No-eul.

444
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,158
I think there's something going on
between them,

445
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,410
but they act like there isn't.

446
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,996
Chief Joo likes everyone,

447
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,664
but isn't close to anyone.

448
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,917
You must be close to Jin-woo.
You even know about his woman.

449
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,128
Not necessarily.

450
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,339
What do you mean? Is Lee No-eul a man?

451
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,674
And he and Ye Jin-woo…

452
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,926
No. Lee No-eul is a woman.

453
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:37,348
I don't know Dr. Ye very well.
But I'm kind of close to No-eul.

454
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,516
How close?

455
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,520
Enough to feel bad for her

456
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,230
if something happens to her?

457
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,316
So, something bad will happen?

458
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,532
Forget it. It's all crap.

459
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,911
Doctors and nurses alike.

460
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,760
Do you want a different position?

461
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,305
It's nice having a friend
as the new president.

462
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,269
It's the same anywhere in the hospital.

463
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,480
Why bother?

464
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,483
Not within the hospital.

465
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,069
How about the Restructure Team?

466
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,237
They're already talking about
going on strike.

467
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,198
Whether you restructure or whatever,

468
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,741
you should've brought them in later.

469
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,951
It is the best timing.

470
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,747
This is the best timing?

471
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,208
Restructuring during this mayhem?

472
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,252
Yes.

473
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,645
-Seung-hyo.
-Yes.

474
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,939
Did we work that hard in school

475
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,066
just to do things like this?

476
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:14,153
Hey, you're the one who should make
your day-to-day life exciting.

477
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,364
With that attitude of yours,

478
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,282
you won't like other jobs either.

479
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,619
Hey, you're hurting my feelings
by stating the obvious.

480
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,208
Well, we had to do anything to survive.

481
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,628
True.

482
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,548
And I still do.

483
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,433
RESTRUCTURE TEAM

484
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,066
-Get me the printout.
-Sure.

485
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,911
We are only asking for internal documents,

486
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,747
but technically,
we still need to submit a formal request.

487
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,001
But other departments besides Neurosurgery
didn't mention that.

488
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,504
Chief Oh Se-hwa of Neurosurgery.

489
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:17,800
REQUEST FOR ACCESS TO INTERNAL DOCUMENTS
GU SEUNG-HYO

490
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,225
CANCER CENTER: DELETED RECORDS
ON CERTAIN DATES

491
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,187
What's with the Cancer Center?

492
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,522
Their participation rate is zero.

493
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,692
I think they intentionally deleted
some of their records.

494
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,070
The center's meeting notes

495
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,406
from certain dates were deleted.

496
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,285
We requested a resubmission,
and they said the data was lost.

497
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,120
We said we'd restore it, and they said

498
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,788
there were no records to begin with.

499
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,916
Which dates?

500
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,834
From March 3 to March 5.

501
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,171
It is before you came, but…

502
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,179
Let's check all of the Cancer Center's
records from those dates.

503
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,146
It says they are indistinguishable
because they have the same color.

504
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,358
Get the Cancer Center chief
to the staff room.

505
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,073
Please get the Cancer Center chief
to the staff room.

506
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:09,430
Choi Do-hyeong.

507
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,149
"Admitted on April 7, 2017

508
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,776
for Leukemia."

509
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,486
First, let me…

510
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,655
"On February 16, 2018,

511
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,866
changed to maintenance therapy
and discharged."

512
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,993
There's no record of him
being admitted again,

513
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,830
but there is Choi Do-hyeong's name
on the list of deceased

514
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,165
drafted on March 5.

515
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,417
Is it just the same name?

516
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,878
The cause of death is meningitis.

517
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,757
He was prescribed two chemotherapy
drugs for his treatment. What were they?

518
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,886
The chemotherapy drug, vincristine.

519
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,346
Vincristine and…

520
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,264
-Cytarabine.
-cytarabine.

521
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,849
How are they administered?

522
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,021
How are they administered?

523
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,860
Vincristine is injected intravenously
below the collarbone.

524
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,906
Cytarabine is injected intrathecally.

525
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:11,659
How do you distinguish the two?

526
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,495
By scent? Or by color?

527
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,165
We can't
since they're both colorless and odorless.

528
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,875
Then?

529
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:23,379
Thus, we bring labeled vials
to the patient.

530
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,507
We fill the syringe with the drugs

531
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,967
and inject them in order.

532
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,593
There's more.

533
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,680
Under supervision by a supervisor.

534
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,597
Oh, my.

535
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,110
What happens if they're switched?

536
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,587
If the drugs are switched…

537
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,632
If vincristine is injected
into the spinal canal, what happens?

538
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,846
The patient dies.

539
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,934
You killed him.

540
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,563
It was a medical error.

541
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,107
You killed Choi Do-hyeong.

542
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,609
You, so-called doctors, killed him!

543
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:29,195
You know what happens
if a person works without rest?

544
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,489
Do you have any idea what it is like
for the doctors here?

545
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,408
All of them work
at least 120 hours a week.

546
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,618
The schedule is killing them.

547
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,791
Even if the world calls you doctors,
don't you ever call yourselves that.

548
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,169
Those who kill patients
don't deserve to be called doctors.

549
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,797
What was the first thing you did
as soon as you came here?

550
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,550
Your first idea was to fire people
for causing losses.

551
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,261
If you cut down on labor,
who will do all the work?

552
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,014
Why do you think there is a special law
for residents?

553
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,933
To limit their work hours
to 88 hours per week.

554
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,353
You like comparing doctors
to office workers, right?

555
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,772
If office workers were
to work 88 hours a week,

556
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,650
they would need to sit at their desks
18 hours a day.

557
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:09,860
But that isn't enough.

558
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,446
Since it's not nearly enough
to handle the overflowing patients,

559
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,575
we pretend that we abide by the law
and make them work 120 hours a week.

560
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,286
Doctors are humans, too.

561
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,751
Then how did you find time
to delete the records

562
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,711
and cover up the patient's death?

563
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,341
When you lied to his family
that he died of meningitis,

564
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,593
were you delirious from lack of sleep?

565
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,304
The patient trusted you and came--

566
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,098
Doctors die from being overworked.

567
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,433
They even commit suicide.

568
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,769
You blame us for killing patients,

569
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,604
but we blame the hospital
for killing doctors.

570
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,109
We blame people like you who run us
nonstop in order to cut back on costs.

571
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,402
Let me ask you something.

572
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,864
Do you also work 100 to 120 hours a week?

573
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,785
Where were you when the drug
was being administered incorrectly?

574
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,620
If you felt so bad for them,

575
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,789
you should've spread the load
as per the law.

576
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,541
If you have nothing to be ashamed of,

577
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,711
you should've said you killed a man
due to fatigue and come clean!

578
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,463
You covered it up,
but now that you got caught,

579
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,591
you whine about how badly they have it?

580
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:18,053
And you act like you're defending
your juniors,

581
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,764
but you're basically saying
that you're innocent

582
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,224
and that it was all their fault!

583
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,523
No matter how valid your excuse is,
it doesn't change the fact

584
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,775
that there is a murderer among you,

585
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,111
and some of you

586
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,947
cooperated in covering it up.

587
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,619
We did not cover it up.

588
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,120
We reported it.

589
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:45,998
To whom?

590
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,499
Whom do you think?

591
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,461
The hospital director.

592
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,047
To Director Lee Bo-hun?

593
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,467
Yes. I reported it to Director Lee.

594
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,678
You must want to say we're cold-blooded,

595
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,513
but the director decided
to declare meningitis

596
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,599
as his cause of death

597
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,434
for the university and for the hospital.

598
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,193
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

599
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,905
You'd better be…

600
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,910
sincerely ashamed of yourselves.

601
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,990
It wasn't an accident. It was an error.

602
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:03,158
A medication error.

603
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,369
It occurs almost daily.

604
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,163
Patients are never notified of it.

605
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,082
Only the insiders know about it.

606
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,132
It's because it's too hectic here.
Because they're overworked.

607
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,802
It's okay as long as it's not serious.

608
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,890
I hear those drugs
are often given incorrectly.

609
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,685
They even enacted a law because of it,

610
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,019
but they still can't prevent it.

611
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,190
It's not just us.

612
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:37,985
Medication errors occur in every hospital.

613
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,461
Everyone hides it

614
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,880
since the patients would never know.

615
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,050
Even if they're suddenly transferred
into the ICU,

616
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,511
who'd imagine
it's because the wrong drug was given?

617
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,222
These crazy assholes.

618
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,226
Companies face claims
over one defective product.

619
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,066
Almost daily.

620
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,860
Always.

623
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,040

624
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,264
That shithead.

PATIENT RECORD
CHOI DO-HYEONG

626
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:02,611
Remember the patient who died of the same
medication error at another hospital?

627
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:07,199
It was a young boy, but the parents
had him buried without an autopsy.

628
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,409
They'll have to exhume the body.

629
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:12,955
No. They sensed the drug
was administered incorrectly,

630
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,164
but they buried him anyway.

631
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,546
They couldn't put him through an autopsy

632
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,881
because it felt like
they were killing their child again.

633
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,968
I can understand them

634
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,970
since I'm a mother myself.

635
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:33,141
They say it's extremely painful
if that drug is given incorrectly.

636
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,603
If my child suffered that pain
before he died,

637
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,605
putting him through an autopsy…

638
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,775
I don't think I could do it either.

639
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,735
I wouldn't be able to.

640
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,325
However, if I were killed,

641
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,705
I think I would ask my mom for an autopsy.

642
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,667
"Mom, I didn't die from my illness.

643
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,502
I died because of the drug.

644
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:03,880
It's so unfair."

645
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,967
I think that's what I would say.

PATIENT RECORD

Call the family.

648
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:39,374
Yes, sir.

649
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,088
Here's what you asked for.

650
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,930
What is it? Did they find
something on us, too?

651
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,307
No, but just in case.

652
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,477
Chief freaked out after hearing
the rumor about the Cancer Center--

653
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,145
It's not a rumor.

654
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,230
It's great that it finally got uncovered,
isn't it?

655
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:05,484
What do you mean? Chief was like…

656
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,654
Work hard.

657
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,492
They just want to hide things.

658
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,371
"The hospital is a public good."

659
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,791
Medical services must be provided
equally to everyone in the country.

660
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:25,212
Am I misunderstanding
the concept of public goods?

661
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:28,799
No.

I'm doing my homework.

664
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,094
Don't kick the ball!
You are making so much noise!

665
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,516
Jin-woo!

666
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:34,281
MD IN PSYCHIATRY

667
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:38,994
To whom were you talking?

668
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,372
To whom?

669
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,375
A friend? Your dad?

670
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,632
I won't tell anyone
what we talk about here.

671
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,760
Not even to your mom or Seon-woo.

672
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,595
I promise.

673
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,346
Don't!

674
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,434
No. Don't tell him.

675
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,394
He'll say you're crazy.

676
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,063
He'll lock you up in a mental hospital.

677
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:14,112
He will tie you up in a mental hospital,
and Mom won't even visit you.

678
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,739
Don't tell him.

679
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,325
I'm not crazy.

680
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,164
How many people are in this room?

681
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,421
I am…

682
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,381
not crazy.

683
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:38,053
Okay. I got it. I'll tell your mom that,
so she won't worry.

684
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,599
Remember what you said last time

685
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:45,185
when you and your mom
brought Seon-woo here?

686
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:49,481
You asked why he won't talk
when it's his legs that were hurt.

687
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:54,194
You said your mom was worried
because Seon-woo wouldn't talk.

688
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,320
Do you remember?

689
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:01,493
Seon-woo must have felt
the way you do now.

690
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,537
He must not have wanted to talk.

691
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,540
But Jin-woo,

692
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:10,710
you're older, so I'll be honest with you.

693
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,213
Your case

694
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,757
is different from Seon-woo's.

695
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:20,762
Some people don't talk for a while
after being in a major accident.

696
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,305
Like Seon-woo.

697
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,808
That is different

698
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,520
from having a person

699
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,939
that only you can see or hear.

700
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,568
I'm not saying
that you did anything wrong.

701
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,405
I'm saying you, of all people,
would understand

702
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:43,368
that having a friend that only you can see

703
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,996
isn't a very good thing.

704
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,207
That's why you don't want to tell me.

705
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,044
But if you don't tell me now, later on,

706
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,630
you'll only have that friend left.

707
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,510
Mom, Seon-woo,
and even your friends from school

708
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,345
will all disappear.

709
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:06,808
Don't!

710
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,060
He isn't a friend.

711
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,186
Don't tell him!

712
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,355
He isn't a friend.

713
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,275
It's Seon-woo.

714
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,862
I know he isn't real.

715
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:21,698
The Seon-woo I see can walk.

716
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,658
He can even run

717
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,536
just like he could before Dad died.

718
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,457
I know…

719
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,753
he isn't real.

720
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,674
My poor Jin-woo,

721
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,344
it must have been really hard for you.

722
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:12,749
You were very upset
because your brother got hurt.

723
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,087
You wanted to run around
and play with him like before.

724
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,005
Your heart created him

725
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,425
because you missed
how your brother used to be.

726
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:23,927
So it's okay.

727
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,974
Everything is okay.

728
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,694
Everything is okay.

729
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:45,865
Chief Joo.

730
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,203
Hey. Are you going home?

731
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:51,746
Yes. You too?

732
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,332
I need to stop by somewhere. Bye.

733
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:55,333
Chief.

734
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,422
Did you know about the medication error
that occurred in the Cancer Center?

735
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,635
-How would I know about another center?
-Director Lee didn't tell you anything?

736
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,972
He didn't tell you anything?

737
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,266
The Cancer Center says they reported it.

738
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,146
I see.

739
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,150
I'm sorry about last time.

740
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,030
For asking you if you told Mr. Gu

741
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,781
that I posted--

742
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,493
We're still within the hospital grounds.

743
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,872
There are many people listening
and more who will talk.

744
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,045
I'm not sure if Director Lee
knew about the medication error

745
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:41,921
that occurred in the Cancer Center.

746
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,050
Sometimes, being a supervisor…

747
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,430
Get some rest.

748
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:04,736
The director decided to declare meningitis
as his cause of death

749
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,529
for the university and for the hospital.

750
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,449
He funneled 360 million won
paid out to the hospital

751
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,242
into his personal account.

752
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,328
It seemed like he had already moved it.

753
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:18,541
Where is the person that I knew?

754
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,669
What kind of person were you,

755
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,421
Director Lee?

756
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,149
Hi.

757
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,443
My surgery just ended. My apologies.

758
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,237
Let's set the D-Day.

759
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:51,825
Let's do it right away. We can't give
Mr. Gu time to get prepared.

760
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,910
He's young, but he's a tough one.

761
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:57,747
Let's look into it first.

762
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,499
I've only heard of strikes.

763
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,793
I have no idea where to even begin.

764
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:02,961
Are we really doing it?

765
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:07,132
Gosh.

766
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:14,097
Do we have to come up with the signs
and chants ourselves?

767
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,058
We need to notify the public
for it to be effective.

768
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,687
It already began
the moment we decided to hold the vote.

769
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:24,065
This is a war now.

770
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,943
If we hesitate for a moment, we'll lose.

771
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,153
Then…

772
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,405
what about the patients?

773
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,288
That's right. The patients…

774
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,459
Let's go on a partial strike.

775
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:46,588
Let's have people rotate
between treating patients and protesting

776
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,923
until we get the public on our side.

777
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,470
-And if that doesn't work?
-We fight head-on.

778
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:58,808
We have justification.
We'll show we aren't just whining.

779
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,187
Chief Joo, put together a schedule
for when the staff members

780
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,731
should treat patients or protest
starting tomorrow.

781
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,065
Pardon?

782
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,651
Alone? For every single department?

783
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,948
He worries about the patients the most
in our entire hospital.

784
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:16,826
I have faith

785
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,787
that with that attitude, you can ensure
the patients won't be affected.

786
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:23,208
How could I decide
other department's schedule--

787
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,460
I'll have our list of staff
and schedules sent over

788
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:29,964
since you're excellent
at getting things done.

789
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,883
I'll send our department's schedules, too.

790
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,511
Oh, right.
We can't take part in the strike.

791
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,971
Okay, that settles it. Next…

792
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,515
Hold on.

793
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,768
I'm sure everyone has figured it out
within their departments.

794
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,978
-What do you mean?
-Who posted the financial statement.

795
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,731
The person who figured out
that the departments

796
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:49,400
were being kicked out for creating
losses, not for support purposes.

797
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:53,571
It was probably someone from one
of the three departments. Why?

798
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,615
We should find out who it was

799
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,784
and grill them to see what else they know.

800
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:00,286
We should use everything we can.

801
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,206
If that person knew more, I'm sure
there would've been more posts.

802
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,833
You don't know, Dr. Kim?

803
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,962
I don't think Mr. Gu knows, either.

804
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,630
If he knew,

805
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,715
he would've openly terminated
that person already.

806
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:20,640
The chief of Pediatrics and I thought
it was someone from our department,

807
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,060
but no one's talking about it.

808
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,402
Doctors in my department
don't even have time to eat.

809
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,738
If we find out,
everyone else will as well.

810
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,323
It would only expose the person.

811
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,450
No hospital will accept a doctor

812
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,369
who blew the whistle on their hospital.

813
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:44,539
That person kept us
from becoming helpless victims.

814
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,208
We should protect that person.

815
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,673
Everyone's drinking, right?

816
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,926
I'm on call, so I need to go. Excuse me.

817
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,037
I've never had a chief
do grunt work before.

818
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,165
It's nice having someone
who isn't from the same university.

819
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,796
Are you upset about this afternoon?

820
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:39,052
I understand. Mr. Gu has something huge
holding over his head now.

821
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,554
It's not just us.

822
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,765
Is there anyone here
who has nothing to hide?

823
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,683
There is.

824
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:49,854
You shouldn't have done anything
that could be used against you.

825
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,983
I wanted to applaud Mr. Gu on this one.

826
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,445
What? No matter what happens,

827
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,073
it always ends with internal reports
and confidential disciplines.

828
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,867
If you didn't want an outsider
interfering,

829
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,827
you shouldn't have given him ammo.

830
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,705
Once he starts to interfere with
every little thing,

831
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,832
our residents will suffer. That's why.

832
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,503
Don't just talk about
how much the residents are suffering.

833
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,088
Go to the hospital

834
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,965
and yell at them like I do,
instead of going golfing.

835
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,720
Are you leaving?

836
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,765
Yes. I need to sleep early
and get up early to yell at them again.

837
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,308
Goodbye.

838
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:35,233
-She never gives in.
-Why should she?

839
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:36,901
Sorry?

840
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:05,638
He's so frustrating.

841
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:15,523
Gosh.

842
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,775
How could you leave like that…

843
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,820
after bringing me here?

844
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,595
You're leaving late.

845
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,263
Yes.

846
01:02:47,346 --> 01:02:49,223
Good night. See you tomorrow.

847
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:41,984
ANNOUNCEMENT
OF SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL STRIKE

848
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,112
WITHDRAW EXPULSION ORDER
ON THE 3 DEPARTMENTS

849
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,240
WITHDRAW EXPULSION ORDER
ON THE 3 DEPARTMENTS

850
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,450
"Announcement of strike.

851
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,537
Sangkook University Hospital

852
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,958
will go on strike to demand
that the expulsion order

853
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:00,127
on Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics,
and Emergency Medicine

854
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,506
be withdrawn, as per the vote result

855
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:06,050
that showed over 80% of the staff
agree to go on strike.

856
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,682
The expulsion of the three departments
is an insult to the medical staff

857
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:16,018
who did their best for the patients

858
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,230
even in poor working conditions.

859
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:20,898
Our battle

860
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:24,193
is to protect the patients' lives
and basic rights.

861
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,697
Thus, we plead with everyone out there
desperately.

862
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,994
If we cannot come to an agreement

863
01:04:33,077 --> 01:04:35,955
with the foundation
by the predetermined date,

864
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,834
we will enter into a full-scale strike.

865
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,378
Everyone will be striking then.

866
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:49,927
The medical staff are not holding
patients hostage by striking.

867
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,180
We simply seek to cease the misconduct
by the management,

868
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,641
which is ignorant
of the reality of the medical field,

869
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:59,854
and to point out what is wrong.
This is, unfortunately,

870
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,606
a necessary recourse.

871
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,984
Through a fair and just strike,
we will build

872
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,320
the employees' faith in us

873
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:12,199
as well as the faith everyone
who visits this hospital has in us.

874
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:17,038
Regardless of the pressure
from the management, we will not give up,

875
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:19,916
and we will defend
our reputation and status

876
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,961
as the best private university hospital
in the nation."

877
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,854
SURGERY DEPARTMENT
DUTY SCHEDULE

878
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,690
Our end must be near,

879
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:29,110
seeing what Mr. Gu is doing
even with our threat of striking.

880
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:30,903
He isn't wrong.

881
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,154
It's all true.

882
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,991
You need to put an end to it
before he starts officially.

883
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:38,536
The cargo union is super tough,
but he destroyed them.

884
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:39,912
That young kid did.

885
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:41,580
He opened a can of worms.

886
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:44,709
Sangkook University Hospital
is fourth in revenue.

887
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,169
It means that it can lose its place
in a second.

888
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,714
Everyone makes money the same way.

889
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,383
Was the report
about the death at the Cancer Center

890
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,719
fabricated by the management as well?

891
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:58,014
You can't criticize the management
entirely, then.

892
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:01,350
How bad must it be for you people
to announce it publicly?

893
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:03,894
You'd never announce it
before it somehow gets out, right?

894
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,647
What if I didn't check
and ended up giving him double doses?

895
01:07:08,899 --> 01:07:09,734
I'm sorry.

896
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,986
Do you think it is okay
because it doesn't kill?

897
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:15,614
We're no better than the Cancer Center.
We've just been lucky.

898
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:19,243
Anyone at a chief level
can be a candidate for the director.

899
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,953
Why don't you register as a candidate?

900
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:28,044
