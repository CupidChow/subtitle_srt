1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,264
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,224
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,731
EPISODE 2

4
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,505
You're incredible, Director Lee.

5
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,716
I've never seen a financial statement
like this before.

6
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,843
It's all red.

7
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,470
What is up with these three?

8
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,889
"Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics,
and OB-GYN"?

9
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,559
Those three are eating up the money
other departments bring in.

10
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,188
I know. Essential departments.

11
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,941
Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics,
OB-GYN, Anesthesiology…

12
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,359
Psychiatry and Dentistry.

13
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,444
…Psychiatry, Dentistry, et cetera.

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,571
A general hospital shall have
nine or more departments

15
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,116
including them as well as specialists
in each department.

16
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,033
As per…

17
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,285
Article 3-3 of the Medical Service Act.

18
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,205
I get that they are essential departments,

19
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,499
but that doesn't mean
losses are essentially inevitable.

20
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:08,169
If this keeps up, I can't help but think
that you are derelict in your duty.

21
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,592
If the structure affects profitability
negatively, we should change it.

22
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,845
"That's how it is"? That is not an answer.

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,515
Forget it. I'm coming in two weeks.

24
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,767
Submit a plan before my inauguration.

25
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,185
What?

26
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:28,731
What did you say?

27
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,068
Try all you want.

28
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,445
Go ahead
and have a talk with the chairman.

29
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,448
On my inauguration day,
I'd like you to tell me

30
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,201
how each department will generate
more revenue. I'm hanging up.

31
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,829
Goodness.

32
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,831
He says that hospitals
always operate at a loss

33
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,084
and that he'll appeal to the board
to have them rescind my appointment

34
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,627
if I keep talking about money.

35
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,171
I sent you the profiles
of the hospital staff.

36
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,966
I'll have to grab a scalpel
as soon as I arrive.

37
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,806
Is this what the hospital director
had just sent?

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,059
I combined that
with what your friend had sent.

39
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,311
I mean, it's true.

40
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,606
If we brought numbers like these
to our meeting, we would've been slapped.

41
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,817
-Doctors don't know numbers.
-We have to teach them.

42
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,947
PHD, SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY

43
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,741
What is this?

44
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,200
"Sangkook University."

45
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,997
"Sangkook University."

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,750
They're all from Sangkook University.

47
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:34,839
OIL PRICES PLUNGE,
WTI TRADED AT A PREMIUM TO BRENT CRUDE

48
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,259
What are our subsidiaries?

49
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,221
Hwajeong Corporation, Hwajeong
Electronics, Hwajeong Life Insurance…

50
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,513
Hwajeong Life Insurance…

51
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,308
-What else?
-There is Hwajeong Display,

52
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,644
-Hwajeong Chemical--
-Chemical.

53
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,814
Right, what was that failed product
they spent billions on marketing?

54
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,484
An anti-aging supplement.
The weight-loss pill was a failure, too.

55
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,611
It didn't work at all.

56
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,947
"Gimhae University"?

57
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,073
PHD, GIMHAE UNIVERSITY

58
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,157
"Gimhae University…"

59
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,452
So, there is one who didn't go
to Sangkook University.

60
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,037
Should I keep reciting subsidiaries?

61
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,916
TEMPORARY RELOCATION
TO GIMHAE MEDICAL CENTER

62
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,917
"Temporary relocation"?

63
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,046
PRINT

64
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,096
Hey. Do you…

65
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,555
What?

66
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,599
Yes, it's been a while.

67
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,393
Do university hospitals
temporarily relocate

68
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,061
their doctors to different hospitals?

69
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,438
Would they relocate if told to?

70
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,615
I look forward to working with you,
Vice Minister.

71
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,158
Same here.

72
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,829
You used to work at Hwajeong Group,
one of the large corporations.

73
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,998
I'm sure you'll run the hospital well.

74
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm still with the company.

75
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,713
Of course. You're still
the president of Hwajeong Group.

76
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,840
What I meant was,

77
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,759
running hospitals
and corporations are different.

78
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,802
You're right.

79
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,763
I've read some reports already.

80
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,890
It seems like hospitals
are facing so many problems.

81
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,019
At least Sangkook is one of the Big Five.

82
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,228
They're much better off.

83
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,982
You will be surprised to find out
how rural hospitals are doing.

84
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,234
Is it that bad in rural areas?

85
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,611
Of course.
Doctors prefer to practice in Seoul,

86
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,488
and patients come to Seoul
for better care.

87
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,783
We've been trying to resolve the imbalance
by coming up with a program

88
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,077
that temporarily relocates doctors, but…

89
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,915
Temporary relocation?
Is there such a program?

90
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,835
There isn't much publicity,
so most people don't know about it.

91
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:40,673
We have been urging hospitals
to participate in the relocation program,

92
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,717
but not many of them
actively cooperate with us.

93
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,218
Well,

94
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,305
isn't that because the hospitals
are obligated to pay the doctors

95
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,598
even after their relocation?

96
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,641
For specialists,
some arrangements need to be made.

97
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,061
In general,
the receiving hospital pays them.

98
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,815
The Ministry of Health and Welfare
subsidizes their salaries, too.

99
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,859
You do?

100
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,197
You're trying so hard for a good cause.

101
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:08,326
Hospitals should actively participate
in the program.

102
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,703
That's why we're searching hard
for eager participants.

103
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,872
I see.

104
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,096
Director Lee Bo-hun just passed away
at the deputy director's house.

105
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,975
Have you ever had your hand
stuck in a machine?

106
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,896
Have you ever had a motorcycle
fall on you while making deliveries?

107
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,481
No, right?

108
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,567
Yes, rich people do get into accidents.

109
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,404
But they don't get victimized
like poor people.

110
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,198
Go check out the ER right now.

111
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,825
Most of our patients are not well-off.

112
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,911
How can we try to make money off
the people like them?

113
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,581
Do you know
how much blood they lose during birth?

114
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,922
I'm sorry.
He suddenly stepped in front of the car.

115
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,144
Do you know
how much blood they lose during birth?

116
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,938
Childbirth involves many risks.

117
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,858
Many people don't know that,
so if anything goes wrong,

118
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,818
they blame the hospital.

119
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,778
Despite the risks they may involve,

120
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,740
we have to have the essential departments
provide their services to patients.

121
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,035
The structure makes it impossible
for them to generate revenue.

122
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,419
Well…

123
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,756
If you get rid of them
without much deliberation,

124
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,008
it will probably cause problems.

125
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,222
I'll do whatever it takes,
even if it means

126
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,098
that I have to appeal to the board

127
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,100
or get the media
and other organizations involved,

128
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,771
to let the world know that you see
this hospital only as a profit center.

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,283
Come in.

130
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,594
What did the hospital staff say?

131
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,805
What could they say?

132
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,184
Everyone knows that he had a heart attack
and fell to his death.

133
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,396
I meant the funeral.

134
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,359
Shouldn't you have made arrangements
for his funeral already?

135
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:35,032
It's the first time
we've had a death like this, so…

136
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,869
"A death like this…"

137
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,705
His family…

138
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,458
wants a small family-only funeral.

139
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
You've already spoken to his family.

140
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,923
You really must've been close
to the director.

141
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,175
We shared so many years together.

142
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,388
Did you handle the issue
with the incentive?

143
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,433
Yes. I told them
we shouldn't make a big deal out of it

144
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,393
as the person to be held accountable
passed away.

145
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,563
I suggested we bury it
since we returned the funds already.

146
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,398
And they agreed?

147
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,316
Of course.

148
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,610
They said they'd make sure
we avoid bad press.

149
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,784
Should this be recognized
as work-related death?

150
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,086
It's up to how you wish to process it,

151
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,799
but he had left work, drank alcohol,

152
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,219
and also had a preexisting illness.

153
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,097
Right?

154
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,475
His end was a bit suspect,

155
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,603
but it is hard to say
that it was work-related,

156
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,688
right?

157
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,651
How was his end "a bit suspect"?

158
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,237
I'm just saying.

159
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,325
Though you shared so many years together…

160
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,164
I got it.

161
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,966
Regarding the incentive…

162
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,468
You are sure that you and I

163
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,470
are the only ones here
who know about it, right?

164
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,765
Yes. You and I are the only ones who know.

165
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,637
HANSEONG POLICE STATION,
CHIEF KIM JAE-HYEON

166
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,750
Through the history of illnesses,
you can see what illnesses they had.

167
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,171
The analysis of dormant risks
shows what illness they're likely to get.

168
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,590
The medication they're on
and their family medical history…

169
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,049
They are all here.

170
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,511
The cumulative number of visitors
to our hospital is 24.6 million.

171
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,889
We have such information
on all those people.

172
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,765
Mr. Nam.

173
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,311
Even if Hwajeong Life Insurance
is the largest life insurance company,

174
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,688
where else would you get

175
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,274
this much information on patients
if not through us?

176
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:01,322
You're enjoying being the president
of the hospital way too much.

177
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,617
Don't you think you are stressing money
too much with fellow subsidiaries?

178
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,495
I'm stressing money
because you're a fellow subsidiary.

179
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,705
If you weren't one,
I wouldn't even have offered this.

180
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,167
Why don't we agree to

181
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,128
just a million won per data set?

182
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,631
You said you have data
on more than 20 million people.

183
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,051
You can't ask for a million one each.
What does that leave us?

184
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,305
You obtained all the information for free
from the hospital database anyway.

185
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,892
Mr. Nam, do you think
I'm handing you over this information

186
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,561
just to help you increase insurance sales?

187
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,981
If you know about an insured's preexisting
conditions, you can deny their claim.

188
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,568
You can also prevent people
from purchasing high-payout policies.

189
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,654
All you need to do
is add an exclusion clause

190
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,031
to your policies
which no one ever cares to read.

191
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,576
Most of them don't understand
even if you explain it all to them.

192
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,121
Isn't it clear
that it's directly related to profits?

193
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,999
Mr. Gu, I know this is between us,
but strictly put,

194
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,335
this is illegal.

195
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,920
Let's cut each other some slack.

196
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,590
Because of the clause banning
commercial use of personal health records?

197
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,591
Exactly.

198
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,095
It was removed back in August 2016.

199
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,973
Stay updated, will you?

200
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,308
Forget it. Never mind.

201
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,815
Please arrange a meeting
with a salesperson

202
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,733
regarding the dietary supplement
distribution.

203
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,986
I need to know about the products
we will sell.

204
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,321
Of course. I'll arrange it.

205
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,908
DILEMMA OVER MINIMUM WAGE HIKE

206
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,203
It's a good thing that we sent you
to the hospital, Mr. Gu.

207
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,163
Our group chose

208
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,125
the best scholarship recipient.

209
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,797
Of course. It is one of many achievements
of the founding chairman.

210
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,799
Can you pull this off too?

211
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,182
Hello?

212
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,102
Not yet. Yes.

213
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,146
Okay.

214
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,981
SEOSAN FARM, KIM BYEONG-SU

215
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,360
-Seosan Farm?
-That's not the point.

216
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,947
He owns the most land in Songtan.
He owns over 30,000 pyeong of land.

217
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,741
I see.

218
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,035
Some hospital facilities
can serve as profit centers.

219
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,495
The ones to be expanded are--

220
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,998
The Cancer Center, Examination Center,
and Funeral Hall.

221
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,335
Do you mean to build those facilities

222
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,420
on this man's land in Songtan?

223
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,256
His son is Kim Seok-hyeon,
the Minister of Environment.

224
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,094
Sir, Songtan is a bit far from the school.

225
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,347
The market value of the land
is about 50 billion won.

226
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,307
Purchase it for 58 billion won.

227
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,100
Doesn't it sound nice?

228
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,727
Leading university hospital

229
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,813
invests in Songtan
and assists in developing the region.

230
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,149
From where will the fund
for the purchase come?

231
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,693
We're building hospital facilities.

232
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,946
Of course the hospital should pay.

233
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,866
Sir, if you are set to pay
eight billion won above the market value,

234
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,077
why do you ask me to take on this…

235
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,872
The son and parents
have different opinions.

236
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,248
Every family is like--

237
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,294
They won't sell the land.

238
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,339
The market value has reached its peak,

239
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,549
but they just won't sell the land.

240
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,843
Okay. I'll purchase it.

241
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,889
And please throw in
an additional 70 billion won.

242
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,099
-What?
-Seventy billion?

243
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,644
Anyone can get them to sell the land
with an additional 70 billion won.

244
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,020
Should I do it myself?

245
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,147
No. I mean for the expansion.

246
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,484
It'll cost the hospital
over 50 billion won.

247
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,443
They'd be so grateful

248
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,238
if the headquarters
would fund the expansion plan.

249
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,199
The examination center and funeral hall

250
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,994
are cash cows
that generate steady revenue.

251
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,663
Plus, all the facilities
will be under your name.

252
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,749
You will get your money's worth.
I'm confident.

253
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,087
What should we do? He says he's confident.

254
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,590
Please grant it, sir.

255
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,467
Purchase that land first.

256
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,345
Yes, sir. I will.

257
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,890
They're coming out.

258
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,995
You've gained weight, Ms. Kang.

259
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,997
The new job must be treating you well.

260
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,376
I guess your job
has also been treating you well.

261
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,337
I've lost a lot of weight thanks to you.

262
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,135
Mr. Gu. All the doctors have gathered
in the auditorium.

263
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,386
To discuss that issue.

264
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,142
If Mr. Nam of Life Insurance calls,
tell him

265
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,643
that we want 1.5 million won per set.

266
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,271
I doubt he'll swallow his pride
and contact me directly.

267
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,647
Noted, sir.

268
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
Find out if the Minister of Environment

269
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,865
has a close relative who is unemployed.

270
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,868
-Pardon?
-You know what I mean. Prepare a gift.

271
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,704
Make sure we're on the same page
with the Ministry on the relocation.

272
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,789
Yes, sir.

273
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,429
SEOSAN FARM, KIM BYEONG-SU

274
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,432
Hello?

275
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,478
Hello. Is this Mr. Kim Byeong-su?

276
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:28,190
I'm Gu Seung-hyo,
calling from Sangkook University Hospital.

277
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
Hospital?

278
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,862
Honey, someone called from a hospital.
Your test results must be out.

279
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,199
No, sir.
I'm not calling about a health matter.

280
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,577
Regarding the land you own in Songtan--

281
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,330
You called about the land?
I'm not selling.

282
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:47,292
No, sir. I wanted
to introduce myself first. I was--

283
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,129
The land is not up for sale.
You people just don't know when to stop.

284
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,713
Hello?

285
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,976
I heard he used to be the president
of a logistics company.

286
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,061
He may be an experienced businessman,

287
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,063
but he knows nothing
about how things work here.

288
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,359
They appointed a CEO

289
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,445
because they consider us as a department
within their corporation.

290
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,490
I ask you all.
Are we running a business here?

291
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,368
What does Naksan say?

292
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,871
They should be kissing our feet.

293
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,331
That's not what I heard.

294
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,710
Listen. No matter what we do,

295
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,753
the president won't even bat an eye.

296
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,507
Let me ask you this. Do you really think
a for-profit corporation

297
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,093
was so enthusiastic about education

298
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,887
that it had to acquire a university?

299
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,013
AUDITORIUM

300
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,558
That's right. This is just the beginning.

301
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,345
Gosh. So many of you came.

302
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,514
Then who's tending to the patients?

303
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,766
We left enough on the floor.

304
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,892
I see.

305
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:10,936
Go on.

306
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,773
Aren't you here to discuss the surgery?

307
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,612
What surgery do you mean?

308
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,741
The surgery to heal Korea
from its illness.

309
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,578
I heard that our doctors,
who swore to set aside

310
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,331
race, religion, and social status

311
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,917
and to abide by
their duties toward patients,

312
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,045
had gathered to discuss their willingness
to go to the remote areas

313
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,588
of our country to help patients.

314
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,550
Why don't you begin?

315
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,076
I'm really here to listen
to what you have to say.

316
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:16,251
First, thank you for attending the meeting

317
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,504
when we didn't even ask you to come.

318
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,174
I guess you were asked
to attend this meeting.

319
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,634
No.

320
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,970
The entire medical staff

321
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,348
is appalled by the recent decision.

322
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,934
I, too, think that we should
help out rural hospitals,

323
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,729
but to be honest, you're basically
telling us to pack up and go

324
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,356
for something we didn't sign up for.

325
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,276
You call the hospital "campus," right?

326
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,698
I heard the examination center
that was on this campus

327
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,158
was moved to Gangnam last year.

328
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:49,868
Is this how you all reacted back then?

329
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:53,830
That was--

330
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,208
Yes, that was what?

331
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,168
How is that the same?

332
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:02,130
If you were suddenly told to relocate
to a rural area, would you go?

333
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,257
You're the Chief of OB-GYN, right? Good.

334
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,842
I had a question for you.

335
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,970
I recently read an article

336
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,766
that I just could not believe.

337
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,851
It said more women die from childbirth

338
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,188
in Gangwon-do than in China.

339
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,190
Is that true?

340
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,234
It can't be true, right?

341
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,655
-Statistically--
-I can't hear you.

342
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,240
Is it not true?

343
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,826
It's true.

344
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,954
All of us do feel bad about the situation.

345
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:37,457
I see. So, all you do is sit there
and feel bad about it.

346
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,753
We can't solve every medical dilemma
in the world, can we?

347
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,464
You're mocking
the essence of this meeting.

348
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,842
Would I relocate to a rural area
if I were told to?

349
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,302
I'll answer that question.
Yes, I would go.

350
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,639
I'd go before anyone tells me to.
I really would.

351
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,059
Dear respected medical staff
of Sangkook University Hospital.

352
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,562
Did it really not bother you?

353
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,857
Double the number of moms
who live in Seoul are dying

354
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,151
just because they don't live
in a metropolitan city.

355
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,195
You're doctors. You're nurses.

356
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,365
If you go there,
those people will not die.

357
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,577
If this were a company,

358
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,164
and the company decided to relocate
certain teams to a rural area,

359
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,624
do you think the employees
would gather like this to complain?

360
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,959
Do you think they would…

361
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,336
even question the decision?

362
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,255
Not a chance.

363
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:29,217
They'd have gone there already,
looking for a place to live.

364
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,344
We're not like those
working for a regular company.

365
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,971
How are you so different?

366
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,775
A general hospital is a public good.

367
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,112
The problem isn't the relocation.

368
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,822
Do you know how many patients

369
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,033
Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics,
and OB-GYN see in a day?

370
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,701
On average, they see 500 patients.

371
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,622
Over 15,000 people get healed
and have wounds treated here in a month.

372
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:02,334
I know that there are many other
general hospitals in Seoul.

373
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,418
But let me ask you this.

374
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,963
Where do you get the authority
to send away 15,000 people

375
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,549
and disperse them…

376
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,302
to distant hospitals?

377
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,236
Ask the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

378
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,987
You are the president of this hospital.

379
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,240
How could you try to pass
the responsibility onto others?

380
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,075
Do you think
that is what we expect from you?

381
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:39,037
No. I'm just saying the Ministry
said the same thing.

382
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,873
"The hospital is a public good."

383
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,833
Sure.

384
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:47,462
Medical service must be provided
equally to everyone in the country

385
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,089
because it is a public good.

386
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,216
Dr. Joo Kyung-moon,
Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

387
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:56,221
Am I misunderstanding
the concept of public goods?

388
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,942
So? Anyone else?

389
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,112
-We're part of a union--
-Who are you from which department?

390
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,907
I'm Kim Eun-ha
from the Emergency Medical Center.

391
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,952
We, nurses, are part of a union,

392
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,621
so any changes to our employment
conditions must be discussed--

393
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:23,373
Yes, of course.

394
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:31,840
We are not against the idea of providing
support for rural hospitals.

395
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:35,302
I'm just saying relocating our doctors is
not the only way we can provide support.

396
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,305
You know,
we can provide financial support.

397
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,932
Then would the Department
of Emergency Medicine pay for that?

398
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,601
How much deficit has your department
accumulated?

399
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:48,356
Department of Emergency Medicine
is barely surviving off other departments.

400
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,483
How could you suggest
something like that so easily?

401
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,114
"Loss.

402
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,116
In the red…"

403
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,703
Your department is always in the red.
Don't you know who made it up for you?

404
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,288
Your department would've been long gone

405
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,956
if it weren't an essential department.

406
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,170
What? Are you… You can't put
a price tag on the service…

407
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,382
If a department produces enough profit,

408
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,472
can they pay money
instead of being relocated?

409
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,599
I'm Ye Jin-woo from Emergency Medicine.

410
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,892
Is that how it's going to work?

411
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,395
What's gotten into him?

412
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,731
He is not the type to speak up.

413
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,444
You know that doctors in rural hospitals

414
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,321
make more than their directors, right?

415
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,366
It isn't because they don't have money.
They--

416
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,452
No. I'm not asking
whether or not they have money.

417
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,497
Please stop evading the question.

418
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,836
So, if you can provide financial support,

419
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,339
you do not have to accept the relocation,
correct?

420
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,762
It seems like you would rather
make a payment than relocate.

421
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,474
How will you obtain the fund? You said
you were in Emergency Medicine, right?

422
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,479
Oh, right. Fund…

423
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,273
You are right.

424
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,692
We can't obtain the fund.

425
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:43,596
The only change

426
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,308
would be the location of employment
for a few.

427
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,185
Isn't that correct?

428
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,673
AUDITORIUM

429
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,268
He wasn't here to listen.
He came to make an announcement.

430
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:33,688
Deputy Director Kim.
What if we really end up going?

431
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,398
Let's do the best we can.

432
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,026
The young president is overly ambitious.

433
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,662
What do you think?

434
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,914
About what?

435
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,624
Will you really go?

436
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,751
If a doctor dislikes the hospital,
he should leave.

437
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,753
That's what they want anyway.

438
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,546
Is it that easy for you?

439
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,132
When did I say it was?

440
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,009
I devoted…

441
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,764
my entire youth to this hospital.

442
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,974
It wouldn't be easy to leave.

443
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,685
It's not just you.
What about the patients?

444
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,729
If the ER is gone,
there will be no patients.

445
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,981
You won't have to take in

446
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,317
the homeless patients
and non-paying patients anymore.

447
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,194
"Non-paying patients"?

448
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,823
I need to get back.

449
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,159
Dr. Ye.

450
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,204
What did you mean earlier
with your question?

451
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,336
Excuse me.

452
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,089
Chief!

453
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,188
He thinks of us

454
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,525
as some money-grubbing rats.

455
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,374
What? What is it? Ms. Ahn, what is it?

456
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,961
Aortic dissection. He received surgery
in Daejeon, but collapsed again.

457
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,556
You said the stomach
is the first to change, correct?

458
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,852
That once you can get it past
your throat without any difficulty,

459
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,562
you come to accept it.

460
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,522
Dr. Ye, over there.

461
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,819
"Your stomach is now able to endure this."

462
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,657
Only after you receive
this message from your body,

463
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,201
do you become entitled to work in the ER.

464
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,499
The question I get asked the most is,
"Don't you feel exhausted to death?"

465
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,504
People die from cardiac arrest
or blood loss,

466
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,964
not from exhaustion.

467
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:11,387
The second most asked question is,
"Why did you choose this path?"

468
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,641
-Please check his blood pressure.
-Okay.

469
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,231
He went into hemorrhagic shock,
but he's now stable--

470
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,985
-Please wait outside--
-Run some tests

471
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,487
-once the transfusion is done.
-Okay.

472
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,205
Because I studied so hard.

473
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,959
Because I studied like crazy
to learn how to save lives.

474
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,503
And…

475
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,547
because I'm a coward.

476
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,599
Dr. Ye. We have a patient
who seems to have peritonitis.

477
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,775
Do you hear me?

478
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,652
Does your belly hurt?

479
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,697
Because I lack the courage

480
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,575
to shun those who are dying
before my very eyes.

481
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,956
-Why did you leave him here for so long?
-No bed is available in pediatrics.

482
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:22,208
Don't wait around and go make room.
Take him there now.

483
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:23,418
Yes, sir.

484
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,113
I think

485
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,283
I won't ever be able to find that courage,

486
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,285
Director.

2017 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION REPORT

501
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,603
What the… Do they even know
what productivity is?

502
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,564
These so-called elites
have been doing nothing right.

503
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:32,982
I see.

504
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,570
If they worked like this at a company,
they would've been fired already.

505
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,654
I see.

506
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,535
Let's do two things first.
Restructure operation procedures

507
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,038
and bring the OR utilization rate up
to 85%…

508
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,497
No.

509
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:50,750
To at least 90%.

510
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,672
That's the average wait time
for patients per department.

511
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,634
The previous foundation
must not have been interested in that.

512
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,093
They didn't have any record of it.

513
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,721
For patients that registered themselves
into the system,

514
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:06,265
I recorded how long it took
until they were actually examined.

515
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,227
Let's see the number of doctors
per patient

516
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,855
and the utilization rate for the equipment
that costs over 100 million won.

517
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:17,068
The fundamental goal of a business
is to accommodate more customers.

518
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,946
What's the use in buying them
expensive equipment

519
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,949
when the system itself
cannot even keep up with the fast pace?

520
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,576
The same goes for the operating rooms.

521
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,745
During the ten hours
of regular operating hours,

522
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,039
they're used for only six hours.

523
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:34,335
How is this different from leaving
an expensive truck in the garage?

524
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,008
What is it?

525
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,219
What?

526
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,848
All you have to do is tell me
to find a way to bring up the rate.

527
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,935
But how am I supposed to do that?
I'm new to this industry as well.

528
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,985
One of the Big Five hospitals
has a utilization rate of 90%, right?

529
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,570
Let's get their data.

530
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,114
Yes, sir.

531
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,789
Also,

532
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,167
fill this in.

533
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,754
Oh, my gosh. Is he really a doctor?

534
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,840
Not a Greek god?

535
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,721
He's gorgeous.

536
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,898
Why are you asking me
about our department's profits?

537
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,358
Don't you know how things are here?

538
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,360
I do. That's why I ask.

539
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,362
You must run your own numbers.

540
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,198
I'm not the one who does it.

541
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,790
All right. We hit our lowest this month.
We topped all the other departments.

542
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,209
Must you rub salt in the wound?

543
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,674
My apologies.

544
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,345
Hey, what is this about?

545
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,766
Hey.

546
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,517
Hello.

547
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,271
-Tell me how your chief is doing.
-Our department chief?

548
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,316
General Surgery wants to switch
the night shift with another department.

549
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,026
If I ask your department to take it,

550
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,737
do you think she will bite my head off?

551
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,114
Ever since she returned
from the meeting earlier…

552
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,202
Shoot. I knew it.

553
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,121
I heard the president
showed up at the meeting.

554
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,165
How is he?

555
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,378
Anyway, is OB-GYN in the red, too?

556
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,129
The president looked annoyed.

557
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,175
Never mind. How would a mere resident know
if the department is in the red or not?

558
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,136
Why wouldn't I know?
I do all the grunt work.

559
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,597
I prepare all of our department's reports.

560
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,642
Anyway, since two months ago,

561
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,268
we've been on the top of the list.

562
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,020
In losses.

563
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,067
Hang in there.

564
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,334
You barely said anything,
and she volunteered the information.

565
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,837
It was so obvious that you were fishing.

566
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,005
-Shut up.
-What now?

567
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,967
You need evidence to prove your doubt.

568
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,814
Where should I go?

569
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,445
Wouldn't the accounting department
have it?

570
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,321
Accounting department…

571
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,202
They are not on this floor.
Where are you going?

572
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,601
Come on, now. You should know better.

573
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,357
Jin-woo.

574
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,460
HEALTH INSURANCE REVIEW
AND ASSESSMENT SERVICE

575
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,884
NONCOVERAGE

576
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,529
Don't watch me non-stop.

577
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,574
I think I ate too much for lunch.

578
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,952
I'm having trouble digesting
because I sat here all day.

579
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,205
-You should take care of off-site duties.
-Don't tell me to go. My goodness.

580
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,750
-I found this on my way back.
-Thank you.

581
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,380
We must be the only department
that hates going to appointments.

582
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,216
At least yours is a private hospital,
and it's close by.

583
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,344
Private hospitals are worse.
They whine so much.

584
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,888
Listen to doctors
at general hospitals complain

585
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,015
until your ears bleed.
See if you can still complain.

586
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:44,478
They must be pissed off
about being sent to a rural hospital.

587
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,273
Aren't you in charge of
Sangkook University Hospital this time?

588
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,607
I am.

589
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,902
Are they being sent to a rural hospital?
Why?

590
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,363
I haven't heard about this either.
Who's going?

591
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,949
Those in Pediatrics, OB-GYN,
and Emergency Medicine.

592
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,868
The hospital notified them.
Your brother didn't tell you?

593
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,758
JIN-WOO

594
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,891
It hurts!

595
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,103
I can't get it in place if you move.
Stay still.

596
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,104
-It hurts!
-Stay still.

597
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,606
Get off!

598
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,775
What the… Hey!

599
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,737
-Mr. Bang!
-Yes.

600
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,865
-Don't move.
-Hurry.

601
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,575
-I told you to stop. I will--
-Hold him.

602
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,994
Hey. This doctor is trying to kill me!

603
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,207
You're not dead yet. You're still talking.

604
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,878
Reduction is done.
Send him to get an X-ray.

605
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:51,962
Yes, sir.

606
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,341
Keep your hand on your stomach
until you get your X-ray taken.

607
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,217
-Thank you.
-Sure.

608
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,304
Where's Dr. Ye? He is nowhere to be found.

609
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,139
You're right. Ms. Kim too.

610
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,183
Where's my shoe?

611
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,853
Ms. Kim,
the trainees have been waiting for you.

612
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,396
Okay.

613
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,649
Ms. Kim, have you seen Dr. Ye?

614
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,860
How would I know?

615
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:16,987
What the heck?

616
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,784
Lee Dong-su speaking.

617
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,540
PROFIT AND LOSS BY DEPARTMENT

618
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,838
Obstetrics and Gynecology. Pediatrics.

619
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,633
Emergency Medical Center.
Those three departments.

620
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,219
Dear respected medical staff
of Sangkook University Hospital.

621
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,763
Did it really not bother you?

622
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,557
You're doctors. You're nurses.

623
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,936
If you go, those people will not die.

624
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:06,286
You've kept these money-losing departments
for too long.

625
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,330
You're all so patient.

626
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:10,124
I'm not.

627
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,919
-Let's get rid of them.
-Yes, sir.

628
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,557
-Eun-ha!
-Yes?

629
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,935
What's wrong? Did something happen?

630
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,395
No.

631
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,480
Are you going home?

632
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,566
Yes. How are things in your department?

633
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,359
Have you guys talked about it?

634
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,403
Not yet.

635
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,488
Everyone's against the relocation,

636
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,283
but it's not like there is anything
we can do about it.

637
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,786
Do you know how things are
in other departments?

638
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,539
They're all calculating already.

639
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,709
Some say they should band together
and oppose the decision,

640
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,212
and others suggest giving in as it'd be
impossible to overturn the decision.

641
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,465
That's only natural.

642
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,134
How is that natural?

643
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,971
Even if it doesn't affect you…

644
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,399
Jin-woo…

645
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,868
Let's go. I'll buy you dinner.

646
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,082
Where's Chief?

647
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,126
Over there.

648
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:48,472
Hey.

649
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,661
CURRENT TIME
TIME ELAPSED, ANESTHETIZED TIME

650
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,804
-Is Chief Joo around?
-He's in surgery.

651
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:32,182
-When will he be done?
-It will take a while. He just went in.

652
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,811
It's his third surgery today.
He won't be done until past midnight.

653
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,145
Send him to the ICU.

654
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,689
-What's the surgery?
-Check regularly.

655
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,232
OPCAB.

656
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,861
The patient is old,
and it's a difficult case.

657
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,156
Well, most of his cases are difficult.

658
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,950
Anyway, it'll be a while.

659
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,327
Okay. Call me when he gets out.

660
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,456
Dr. Ye.

661
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,258
You know Chief Joo
doesn't refuse patients, right?

662
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,471
So please, don't send them here.

663
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:14,433
Even today, he had to operate
on a transfer patient…

664
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,436
If anything goes wrong here,
we get blamed.

665
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:21,315
And please,
stop sending up homeless people.

666
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,862
That's why we don't send more than three--

667
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,865
What about us? It's tough for us too.

668
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,658
We need to collect payment.

669
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,870
We're the ones getting in trouble.

670
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,918
I understand Chief Joo,
but what about the nurses?

671
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,713
He's the one who has to hear
everyone's complaints.

672
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,633
I'm relying on you.

673
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,923
OUTPATIENTS

674
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,472
"ICU, Intensive Care Unit.

675
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,475
CSR, Central Supply Room."

676
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,105
"Metzenbaum scissors."

677
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,607
They look like hair-cutting scissors.

678
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,654
"Mayo scissors. Used for cutting sutures."

679
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,698
"Sutures"?

680
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,825
Does that mean "thread"?

681
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,245
Why are there so many scissors?

682
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,748
"Osteotome."

683
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:06,211
This won't do.

684
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:30,944
OPERATING ROOM

685
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,834
How do I open this?

686
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:04,770
This is the… It's the osteotome.

687
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,980
For cutting bone.

688
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:12,068
Is this the towel clamp? What was this?

689
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:15,947
Hold on.

690
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:18,575
Gloves…

691
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,788
Where are the gloves?

692
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,840
Shit.

693
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,218
That scared me.

694
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:40,972
What the…

695
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,106
Joo Kyung-moon.

696
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:58,156
WORKS 36 HOURS STRAIGHT TO MAKE UP
FOR THE LACK OF DOCTORS IN THE DEPARTMENT

697
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,201
TAKES IN ALMOST EVERY PATIENT

698
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,788
Hi. You must be tired.

699
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,831
Yes.

700
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,424
-Are you expecting someone?
-At this hour? No.

701
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,474
PARK JAE-HYEOK

702
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:49,768
Hey, what's up?

703
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,229
From Cardiothoracic Surgery?

704
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:55,941
Yes.

705
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,236
Get mine, too.

706
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,989
He just finished?

707
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,034
Okay. Got it.

708
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,835
You know Chief Joo
doesn't refuse patients, right?

709
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,964
He's the one who has to hear
everyone's complaints.

710
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,009
I need to make a call.

711
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,812
Is there anything I can hide from you?

712
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,740
Did you hear at work
that I'm being sold off?

713
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,079
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I was about to tell you.

714
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,416
I was going to as soon as I got home,
but you beat me to it.

715
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,878
Gosh, what did the hospital do

716
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,922
that made them volunteer
to relocate their doctors?

717
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:04,426
Did they volunteer for this?

718
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,844
The Ministry asked for funds,

719
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,346
but the hospital decided
to relocate the doctors.

720
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,435
What's the big deal?
It's the same no matter where you go.

721
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,105
People from Seoul think
they're at the center of the world.

722
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,275
-Let's be serious for three minutes.
-I'm not going. Don't worry.

723
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:23,945
Like you have the power to pull out.

724
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,906
It's not that big a deal.

No. I said I was going to Seosan.

733
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,365
I'm on my way. Why?

734
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,201
What was posted?

735
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:55,829

-Pardon?
-Go to the hospital in Hanseong.

Okay.

744

Are you still doing the reduction?
What's taking so long?

745
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,809
Lazy bums. We're so busy.

746
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,771
My goodness.

747
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,032
-Deputy Director Kim.
-Yes?

748
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,868
There's a post on the portal.
I think you should take a look.

DEPTS SUBJECT TO RELOCATION
= DEPTS IN THE RED

753
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,411
NOT ABOUT PROVIDING SUPPORT.
PURELY FINANCIAL DECISION.

754
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,228
-Who posted it?
-We don't know yet.

755
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,816
It was posted at 6:54 a.m.

756
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,111
The IP address is of a desktop
in room 307 in the annex.

757
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,363
But room 307 is the resting room
for specialists,

758
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,657
so there are no cameras.

759
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,826
I got the footage of the hallway instead.

760
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:41,744
Whose ID was it?

761
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,204
Well, it was…

762
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,291
Lee Bo-hun's. The late hospital director.

763
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:56,009
How did they get this?

764
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,971
Can anyone access the entire hospital's
profit and loss statements?

765
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:04,475
No. The chiefs get monthly reports,
but only for their own departments.

766
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,060
Previously, the foundation chairperson

767
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,187
and the hospital director
received the totals.

768
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,398
Why did this person post
February's report?

769
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,567
It's from two months ago.

770
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,901
Could it be

771
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,571
that the late hospital director
gave the documents to someone here?

772
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,992
Along with his ID and password so that
this can be posted after his death?

773
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,787
We are checking with Accounting.

774
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,081
They are the ones
who collect data and generate reports.

775
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:28,541
It probably leaked from there.

776
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,002
Check the IT Department as well.

777
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,631
Accounting works with the numbers,
but IT prints the reports out.

778
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,924
That's the best place to get ledgers.

779
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,260
But why the one from two months ago?

780
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,970
I doubt it's all that meaningful.

781
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,015
The departments being relocated
were always in the red.

782
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:47,435
I guess the person who posted it
only had that month's.

783
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:52,815
Someone who was particularly close
to Director Lee Bo-hun…

784
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:56,527
I'll see if anyone requested material
from the Accounting or IT Department.

785
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,446
Let's focus on those
who are being relocated.

786
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:01,741
And among them…
What time was it posted again?

787
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,451
This morning at 6:54 a.m.

788
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,037
Check everyone who went in and out
of room 307 around that time.

789
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,831
I've set it up so that you can watch
the hallway security footage.

790
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,126
But since it is a sleeping room,
many people go in and out,

791
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,586
so it'll take a while.

792
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,646
I guess…

793
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,440
you missed the director a lot.

794
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,153
Follow me.

795
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:19,444
Call the restructure team.

796
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,903
From the headquarters?

797
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:24,198
They brought this upon themselves.
I'm done playing nice.

798
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:25,950
Yes, sir.

799
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,038
GLUTTON

800
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:35,877
NO ONE KNOWS WHO POSTED IT.
PEOPLE HAVE MIXED REACTIONS TO THE POST.

801
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,566
You're the one who posted that, right?

802
01:04:05,049 --> 01:04:06,884
Don't hide behind the dead man.

803
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,386
You know there's a better way.

804
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:11,389
-How do you think he found out?
-You've given us a weapon.

805
01:04:11,472 --> 01:04:13,391
However,
it should not involve any trickery.

806
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,350
How did you know?

807
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,186
Are you afraid that I might tell Mr. Gu?

808
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,523
You said our weapon
should not involve any trickery.

809
01:04:20,606 --> 01:04:23,693
I've seen more people get stomped on
while trying to play fair.

810
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:28,322
You cannot put a price tag
on what I do with these hands.

811
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,783
That pride kept me going.

812
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:34,078
That's true, and now that this is out,
if we don't do anything about it,

813
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,830
the president will look down on us.

814
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,374
Dear respected staff
of Sangkook University Hospital,

815
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,210
we will be undergoing modification
as proposed

816
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,421
by the Restructure Team
from the headquarters.

817
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:44,672
"A medical practitioner shall not consent

818
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,549
to unauthorized personnel
accessing medical records."

819
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:49,760
Punks who know nothing about medical law
are running amok,

820
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:50,720
and you just watch?

821
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:53,306
Why aren't you doing anything?
Why are you just watching?

822
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,894
If they really are being kicked out
for not making money, we're next.

823
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,520
We've never been in the black either.

824
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,939
You must have offers from hospitals
lining up for you.

825
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,734
I won't complain even if you fire me.

826
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,236
You keep beating me to the punch.

827
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,655
The dismissal of Ye Jin-woo…

828
01:05:10,615 --> 01:05:11,949
If there are two rebels,

829
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,951
I should get rid of them both.
Don't you think?

830
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,915
