ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,224
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,813
EPISODE 8

4
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,238
PUREUN CHILD WELFARE SERVICE

5
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,495
Excuse me.

6
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,460
Take good care of him.

7
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:26,920
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,103
QL ELECTRONICS

9
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,440
Mr. Hong left Incheon
for his office in Yangjae.

10
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,275
His ETA is three minutes to five o'clock.

11
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,445
Hwajeong Life Insurance sent us an offer.

12
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,031
They want to sell their insurance plans
through our hospital.

13
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,076
They must have heard that we entered
an alliance with Hwajeong Chemical.

14
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,372
I'll defer the response.

15
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,084
It's Black Ivory.

16
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,673
You must still be tired from the travel.

17
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,550
Thank you for making time for me.

18
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,677
It was just a short trip to Hong Kong.

19
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,388
It's made from elephant poop.

20
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,520
It does taste different from kopi luwak.

21
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,606
Kopi luwak?

22
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,734
Only some snobs make a big deal out of
something like that.

23
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,031
Nam-hyeong told me…

24
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,365
Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,161
Mr. Cho told me the gist.

26
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,414
So, you'd like to develop an app with us?

27
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,750
Yes, a health app.

28
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,878
We would like to develop
a built-in app for QL phones that monitors

29
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,047
the users' health measurements,
such as heart rate,

30
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,716
blood pressure, and BMI.

31
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,844
The app will send the data directly to us
at Sangkook University Hospital.

32
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,387
"Exclusively"

33
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,931
is a better-fitting word.

34
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,101
Through this, Sangkook
gets to keep our users under their thumb.

35
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,438
They'll become our potential clients.

36
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,986
Why must I offer up my customers
to Mr. Cho's hospital?

37
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,658
Sir, if not with Sangkook University
Hospital, with whom will you work?

38
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,452
It's hard to share profits
with national university hospitals,

39
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,288
and other large hospitals
already have partners.

40
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm sorry, but both QL and Sangkook
are behind in the game.

41
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,210
Why do you think that is?

42
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,212
Because I didn't know?

43
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,215
"Your heart rate is unusual lately."

44
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,635
The app will send such push notifications
to the user and make them nervous,

45
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,013
leading them to make
an appointment for a checkup.

46
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,431
At Sangkook Hospital, of course.

47
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,434
Then you have that user under your thumb.

48
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,854
Healthy Life Clinic, right?

49
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,107
You recently announced your plan for that,
didn't you?

50
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,110
-I did.
-"Your heart rate

51
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,863
is irregular because of your smoking.

52
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,784
Okay, then. Go over
to Sangkook Smoking Cessation Clinic."

53
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,619
That's what you want to do.

54
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,289
Why should I help you?

55
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,250
I can explain
how we will distribute profits

56
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,419
generated through this app right now,
if you'd like.

57
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,006
But rather than that…

58
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,759
I know Chairman Hong Seong-chan
of QL Electronics

59
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,512
won't miss out on a great opportunity

60
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,016
just because it would benefit
someone else as well.

61
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,935
The health app is just the beginning.

62
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,896
You know, telemedicine is now poised
to become the new normal.

63
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,190
Soon, someone from a remote island

64
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:20,778
will be able to get examined by doctors
in Seoul via video conferencing.

65
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,613
You wouldn't let QL's phones

66
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,616
become useless
because you don't have a partner hospital.

67
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,912
By that time, we won't need
an alliance with a hospital.

68
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,582
The problem is,
everyone has made alliances.

69
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,252
If you think about hospitals
on par with QL Electronics' status,

70
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,921
there is no better partner
than Sangkook University Hospital

71
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,715
among the Big Five.

72
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,801
That's true. QL and Hwajeong.

73
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,638
Although Hwajeong
is not in the cell phone business,

74
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,391
we're fighting tooth and nail

75
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,435
in other business areas
in the global market.

76
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,605
You are right. Hwajeong
is not in the cell phone business,

77
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,900
and QL Electronics
does not own a hospital.

78
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,573
It got cold.

79
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,920
We can just buy a hospital

80
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,713
as Hwajeong did.

81
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:25,676
When we do, which of the Big Five

82
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,137
would we push out?

83
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,186
Thank you for the coffee, sir.

84
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,864
Sir.

85
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,418
Mr. Cho. Are you busy lately?

86
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,629
You must be really busy.

87
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:03,714
Why did you send a pip-squeak over?

88
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,134
I guess you aren't desperate enough.

89
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,269
It's the chairman's assistant.
He wants you to come in.

90
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,032
You should've stormed out
as soon as he started talking bullshit.

91
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,745
Why did you make it sound like
I was begging that prick for it?

92
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,457
I'm sorry, sir.

93
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,958
That annoying prick.

94
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,711
He sucked in school, too.

95
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,216
I know what kind of loser he used to be.
How dare he call and act cocky to me?

96
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,599
I should've pushed forward
to enter the cell phone business.

97
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,518
I should've fought my father.

98
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,482
Should I just enter it now?

99
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,945
-The cell phone market--
-It is completely saturated.

100
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,074
You can always buy, build,
or expand a hospital.

101
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,410
That's why he's being cocky.
I know that, but still…

102
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:16,787
it's annoying as hell.

103
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,082
I'll get Mr. Hong to change his mind.

104
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,334
How?

105
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,002
He has pretty much everything,

106
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,755
so giving him bait won't work.
I'll have to break him down.

107
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,508
I'll keep meeting with him
until he agrees,

108
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,134
so you won't have to worry.

109
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,722
You're working super hard

110
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,350
to make sure not to worry me.

111
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:46,609
You canceled the relocation

112
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,530
against your will
because you didn't want me

113
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,406
to be criticized, right?

114
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,203
It was also because of
non-medical revenue.

115
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,040
Non-medical revenue…

116
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,335
Before joining the hospital,
I heard that superior general hospitals

117
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,171
always operate in the red.

118
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,966
That's what all the other
large hospitals' public records said,

119
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,592
so I thought it was true.

120
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:12,677
But?

121
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,554
Through the recent efficiency evaluation,

122
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,847
we've put together
a consolidated financial statement,

123
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,642
and I found an item that I had never seen
in that of corporations.

124
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,186
It's called "reserve fund
for essential business."

125
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,148
To put it simply, it's an expense

126
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,818
reserved for purchasing buildings
or medical equipment.

127
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,114
The previous foundation had counted it
as an expense without spending it,

128
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,283
but we counted it as revenue,

129
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,660
and it made the ordinary profit
go from in the red to black.

130
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,787
How much was it?

131
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,707
Including the fund reserved
for the branch hospital,

132
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,375
it's 203.7 billion won, sir.

133
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,091
Now I get it.
They were whining to get their way.

134
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,136
Hospitals don't need to worry
about the stock price anyway.

135
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,472
But if we eliminate essential departments
like Emergency Medicine or Pediatrics,

136
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,182
we'll receive
significantly fewer benefits,

137
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,351
including tax exemption and deductions.

138
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,853
It would be better for us

139
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,981
to keep the three departments
and increase the size of the reserve fund.

140
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,901
I was planning to prepare a report for you
by tomorrow.

141
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,989
I'm sorry for making you hear this
from the Restructure Team first.

142
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,784
That was your specialty…

143
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,121
when you were an assistant.

144
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,999
You'd watch to see what I was doing

145
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,792
and rush to tell my father on me.

146
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,129
Don't blame Mr. Lee.

147
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,590
I don't blame him. And…

148
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,343
I've never…

149
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,304
told the previous chairman
about what you did.

150
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,982
It would've been nice if you were
one of my people from the start.

151
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,362
Keep working on QL.

152
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,783
Cell phones are the best way to reach
all the people in the country.

153
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,202
We need this deal.

154
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,663
I understand, sir.

155
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:25,976
Are you okay?

156
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,646
I told you to go home.

157
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,481
Well…

158
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,068
Are you okay?

159
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,199
Let's go.

160
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,620
Let's just go home.

161
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,760
Over here.

162
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,432
What are we, spies?

163
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,852
Why did you want to meet here at night?

164
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,939
Mr. Assessment Man.
Do you still think I'm No-eul?

165
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,859
Why are your eyes all swollen?

166
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,320
I'm still pretty though, right?

167
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,157
This is too much to bear alone.

168
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,491
Why don't you come out now?

169
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,161
You punk.

170
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,122
How's work going?

171
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,374
I'm on government duty. It's confidential.

172
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,709
Sure, whatever.

173
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,211
-You need to go back?
-Yes.

174
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,131
-What about dinner?
-Why don't you ever ask me that?

175
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,676
Don't fight and go home, punks.

176
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,477
Bye. We'll go now.

177
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,644
After you leave.

178
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,188
Go on.

179
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,109
Okay.

180
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,277
See you tomorrow.

181
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,411
What do you think will happen
to the deputy director?

182
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,996
Who knows?

183
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,747
I don't know yet.

184
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,751
Is there an alternative?

185
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,674
You said he is not fit to be the director.

186
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,842
Then who's the alternative?

187
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,136
I don't know either.

188
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,016
I don't think there's anyone
who could challenge Mr. Gu.

189
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,185
Well, I only met him today though.

190
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,147
You met him?

191
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,732
He seemed nice.

192
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,693
No way. Try working with him.

193
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,863
Never mind.
Why should you put up with him?

194
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,157
But is there really no good candidate
for the director?

195
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,553
GENERAL USE

196
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,077
Hold the elevator.

197
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,497
Thank…

198
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,582
Thank you.

199
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,089
Thanks.

200
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,062
In a town in Switzerland,

201
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,775
they took a vote on whether to build
a nuclear waste repository.

202
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:26,986
The result?

203
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,446
Over 60% approved of the decision.

204
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,243
But then, the government
offered compensation.

205
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,912
"If you let us build the repository
in your town,

206
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,455
we will pay you."

207
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,000
So, they took another vote.

208
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,253
What for?

209
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,505
They should've just built it
since over 60% agreed to it.

210
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,844
How many do you think voted "yes"
this time?

211
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,269
Do you think they were able to
build it or not?

212
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,441
Dr. Lee?

213
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,404
Yes?

214
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,114
So?

215
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,243
I heard you will open a veterinary center.

216
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,328
Where will you open the center?

217
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,957
What was the result of the vote?

218
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,127
We'll need a space for it.

219
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,546
But our hospital is packed.

220
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,757
Would you like to see?

221
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,509
Where should I show you around this time?

222
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,678
The robotic operating room?

223
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,805
The anatomy lab?

224
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,735
This is the Negative Pressure
Isolation Zone.

225
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,738
It's utilized in the occurrence
of an infectious disease outbreak.

226
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:57,117
The maintenance
costs about 30 million won a year,

227
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,952
but it's hardly ever used.

228
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,918
Until a few years ago,

229
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,003
there was no awareness
of the need for the facility,

230
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,129
let alone any regulations.

231
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,549
It was MERS which changed that.

232
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,260
When MERS spread,

233
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,638
our country's hospitals suffered so much.

234
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,473
They weren't prepared for it.

235
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,393
Only after going through that difficulty

236
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,812
did they come up with a system.

237
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:32,694
Why don't you think of it as an investment
in crisis management?

238
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,467
Chief Oh is giving a lecture.

239
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,470
Are they med students?

240
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,139
I think they are residents.

241
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,808
Residents have classes like this?

242
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,519
Only if they're lucky enough
to have a professor

243
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,521
who will make time to teach them.

244
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,816
Okay. What are your thoughts?

245
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,152
It's a large aneurysm measuring over 25mm.

246
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,278
How would you treat it?

247
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,905
Intracranial aneurysms can be treated
with clipping or coiling.

248
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,366
For this patient, given the size
and location of the aneurysm,

249
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,659
I'd opt for coiling.

250
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,829
-Anyone else?
-The aneurysm is located in the MCA,

251
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,372
but the size is too large.

252
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:27,541
Since surgical treatment
would be too risky,

253
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,917
I'd also go with coiling.

254
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,132
-I'd also--
-Why?

255
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,426
Well…

256
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,888
-Get out.
-Dr. Oh.

257
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,098
I won't wait for those who fall behind.

258
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,267
Don't waste my time, and get out.

259
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,685
I'm sorry. Please…

260
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,688
Both of you overlooked
the patient's underlying disease.

261
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,148
You only looked at the aneurysm.

262
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,234
In fact, this patient

263
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,362
has kidney disease,
so the lab results aren't good.

264
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,072
He also has edema,

265
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,533
and his aortic arch and ICA
are in bad condition.

266
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,077
It'd be hard to reach the aneurysm,
so coiling wouldn't work.

267
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,290
That must be a habit.

268
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,044
Doing this when you're focused.

269
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,964
I don't do that.

270
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,216
Yes, you do.

271
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,478
Who would dare criticize me?

272
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,086
WIFEY

273
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,757
That's right.
She must be at school right now.

274
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,261
I should have called her another time.

275
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,479
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

276
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,251
To you…

277
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,674
I must seem like the grim reaper.

278
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,180
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,726
Curse me all you want.

280
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:33,810
But sir,

281
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,979
through my job,

282
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,317
I saw blind people see for the first time,

283
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,070
and people on the brink of death…

284
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,282
walk out of here alive.

285
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,746
That's why I can't give up…

286
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,207
that easily.

287
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,087
I'm sure…

288
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,133
you understand how I feel
better than anyone.

289
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,638
I'm sorry.

290
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,319
So, in Pediatrics, we inject only 20ml
of a 100ml ampoule,

291
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,654
and throw out the rest.

292
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,199
The kids are small, so we must
adjust the dosage accordingly.

293
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,119
But the HIRA

294
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:36,331
will reimburse us only for the 20ml
that was actually administered.

295
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,795
Then do hospitals need to pay
for the discarded 80ml?

296
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,882
That's why some hospitals
recycle the leftovers,

297
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,885
knowing that they shouldn't.

298
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,014
If you recycle them
and combine the leftovers,

299
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,516
the risk of contamination increases.

300
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,691
It's late. Good night.

301
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,693
Good night.

302
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,117
So, what happened with the nuclear waste…

303
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,615
Why did you come back?

304
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,992
Do you know your way out?

305
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,120
I realized it's your first time
in this part of the hospital.

306
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,208
Every path connects to the front door.

307
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,001
Okay, then.

308
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:05,837
That child…

309
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,548
That child from before.

310
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,344
He was taken to a welfare center.

311
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,431
Yes, they took him.

312
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:19,809
Is that why

313
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,270
you're all puffy? From crying?

314
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,190
No.

315
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,862
There are quite a lot of kids who end up
being taken to welfare centers.

316
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,428
How many times did I ask you? You idiot!

317
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,388
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,682
Pull yourself together!

319
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,642
Hasn't it been decided already?

320
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,478
The question is, who will it be?

321
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,563
If the deputy director
loses his candidacy,

322
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:08,775
who will jump into the race for director?

323
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,448
Dr. Lee Sang-yeop of the Cancer Center.

324
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,494
He was a deputy director in the past.

325
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,747
We did not cover it up. We reported it.

326
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,125
I reported it to Director Lee.

327
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,379
He spent a lot of time in the US,
so he's not that authoritative.

328
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,007
Before he got screwed over
because of that incident,

329
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,009
he fought back against Mr. Gu the most.

330
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,264
Excessively recommends clinical trials,
approved the pay-for-performance program,

331
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,599
and he thinks only about
the Cancer Center.

332
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,270
Then, who else?

333
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,983
Dr. Seo of Ophthalmology.

334
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,694
They generate the most revenue.
He is ambitious.

335
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,864
Come on. The nurses hate him so much.

336
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,198
He sexually harasses them.

337
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,328
The nurses
can't take part in the election.

338
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,122
Among the doctors who can vote…

339
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,391
Do you own the hospital?

340
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,227
The real owner doesn't even care.
Why do this to yourself?

341
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,562
What would you get out of this?

342
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,865
Dr. Oh Se-hwa.

343
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,993
You alone can't change anything.

344
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:46,498
Seon-woo was dragged into it
because of me.

345
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:53,171
I dragged him in,
so I must take full responsibility.

346
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,718
Dr. Oh…

347
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,683
Leave it.

348
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,437
I'm off tomorrow.
That's why I left them there.

349
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,606
It's not a lot.

350
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,943
I'll do it.

351
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,612
I'm turning you.

352
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,239
Gosh.

353
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,036
Go in and rest.

354
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,957
Were you on the phone with No-eul?

355
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,583
What?

356
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,378
Weren't you just talking to her?

357
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,923
No.

358
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,551
Why did you think that?

359
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,387
I thought you said something about me.

360
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,515
Whom else would you talk to about me?

361
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,725
That's why.

362
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,603
You heard me?

363
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,732
I couldn't really hear
what you were saying though.

364
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,447
I wasn't eavesdropping. Don't worry.

365
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,707
Good night.

366
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,708
You too.

367
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:34,606
Does anyone else know other than your mom

368
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:35,982
and me?

369
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,612
So…

370
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,825
no one else knows that you can see

371
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:49,788
and talk to the other Seon-woo
who can walk?

372
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:54,250
I don't talk to him in other places
like at school, even if I see him.

373
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,503
Other kids may hear me.

374
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,588
Good.

375
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:03,301
You were very upset
because your brother got hurt.

376
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,931
You wanted to run around
and play with him like before.

377
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,307
Your heart created him

378
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,977
because you missed
how your brother used to be.

379
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:13,978
So it's okay.

380
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,731
Everything is okay.

381
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,818
But Jin-woo,

382
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,987
you know well yourself, right?

383
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,200
That you're the only person
who can see the Seon-woo who can walk.

384
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,994
That he only lives inside your heart.

385
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,668
All right.

386
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,379
Then why don't we try practicing?

387
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,965
Practicing?

388
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,594
The Seon-woo that you see

389
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,473
is your friend. An imaginary friend.

390
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:54,853
So, even if you talk to him in your mind
without speaking out loud,

391
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,981
your friend can still hear you.

392
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,694
So, I'm not crazy, right? I'm not, right?

393
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,948
You simply have a very special friend

394
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,701
different from your other friends.

395
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,539
However, that special friend
will disappear someday.

396
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,377
Let's slowly prepare
to let your friend go.

397
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:24,382
Practice talking to him
only inside of your head.

398
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,095
Even if you say it in your head,
that Seon-woo can still hear you

399
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,391
because that Seon-woo is you.

400
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,865
It's nice running again.

401
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,286
You're tired, aren't you?

402
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,539
It gets harder every day, doesn't it?

403
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:01,252
Calm down. He just happened
to hear you last night.

404
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,463
Were we careless?

405
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,676
Stop sulking.

406
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,179
That won't stop me from showing up!

407
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:05,984
Should we go?

408
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,829
Call me if the deputy director
tries to screw you over.

409
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,457
Let me use you as an excuse
to kick him in the tibia, too.

410
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,960
He wouldn't. I'm a government…

411
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,550
Did he hit you before?

412
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,305
Why the tibia of all places?

413
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,560
Did that bastard kick you in the shin?

414
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,605
Is he a gangster?

415
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,235
If I find even the slightest dirt on him,

416
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,654
I'll destroy him.

417
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,533
What great mentality as an orthopedist.

418
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,328
Should we grab breakfast?

419
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,123
Gross.

420
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,849
All right.

421
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,897
All done.

422

CHOI SEO-HYEON

423
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,505
Okay, bye.

424
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,133
Hello? Ms. Choi?

425
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,719
Hello, Dr. Ye.

426
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,471
Are you free to talk?

427
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,806
Yes.

428
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,812
Yes. What's the occasion?

429
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,522
We received some documents,

430
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,941
but they're medical records,
so we can't make sense of them.

431
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,734
I can help you.

432
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:13,611
Thank you.

433
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,614
I'll send them to you now.
Can you please look them over?

434
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,325
I'll call you in about an hour.
Is that okay?

435
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,411
Right… Right now?

436
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,622
I'm at the hospital.

437
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,791
I'm sorry. If you're busy--

438
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,211
No. It's not that I'm busy per se.

439
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:35,383
I just can't download the files right now.

440
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,844
Well… if you have time,

441
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,471
I'd prefer to explain things to you
in person.

442
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,557
I'll come to the hospital now, then.

443
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,061
I'm a bit busy right now.

444
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,567
If you'd give me some time…
Well, it'll get less busy soon.

445
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,985
How about an hour from now?

446
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,444
Okay, then.

447
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,741
It's 12:40 p.m. right now,
so I'll be at the hospital by 2 p.m.

448
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,868
By 2 p.m.?

449
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,955
Yes. Okay. See you then.

450
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,332
-Dr. Ye.
-Yes?

451
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,334
The same café on the first floor?

452
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,670
Yes, that's right.
The one on the first floor.

453
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,423
Thank you for making time for me.
See you soon.

454
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,885
Am I bothering him when he's busy?

455
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,029
GENERAL USE

456
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,455
Excuse me.

457
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,925
Excuse me.

458
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,555
Thank you.

459
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,316
Did you stop by your office?

460
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,734
Yes.

461
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,986
How's the pain?

462
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,113
It's fine. I still have my painkillers.

463
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,824
The hospital people won't like it

464
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,952
if they see you talking to me.

465
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,705
If you're not coming
in case your brother finds out,

466
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,749
I'll refer you to another hospital.

467
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,751
You shouldn't skip your checkups.

468
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,336
Thank you.

469
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,463
But please don't tell--

470
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,423
Don't worry. I won't tell him.

471
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,300
Take care.

472
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,594
Thank you.

473
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,947
Hello.

474
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,615
Hello.

475
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,595
Did he hit you before?

476
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,188
SURGEON: KIM TAE-SANG

477
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,119
Hello, Dr. Lee.

478
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,664
Min-seo's parents signed the consent form.

479
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,668
Did the father change his mind?
They'll donate her organs?

480
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,588
I'll be right there.

481
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,410
I heard the news.

482
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:36,999
Then… are you taking our daughter
right now?

483
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,001
No. There's a process.

484
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,961
First, we need to conduct an EEG--

485
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,338
Why do you want to know that?

486
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:43,881
Let's go.

487
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,301
She has to go through
a tiresome process until the end.

488
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,678
I need to know what they're going to do.

489
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,971
What difference does that make?

490
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,515
I don't want to know.

491
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,308
Sir.

492
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,686
We'll do our best

493
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:02,149
not to make the difficult decision
you made go to waste.

494
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,756
This is Sunwoo Chang.
When will she be pronounced brain-dead?

495
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,878
I need a security video.

496
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,047
Of what?

497
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,924
He requested the video
of Operating Room Three

498
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,343
of Rosette E in the main building
recorded on February 14.

499
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,636
Why?

500
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,431
He says he can only tell us
after he checks the video.

501
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,932
He wouldn't say more.

502
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:18,517
What should we do?

503
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,102
Get the video.

504
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,441
Can't you turn on the sound?

505
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:29,612
No. The cameras in the operating rooms
do not record sound.

506
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,659
Well, so the doctors…

507
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,163
There are many of them.

508
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,753
I'm sorry,

509
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,006
but we lack the know-how in this field.

510
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,509
What in the world is going on?

511
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,304
If you lack the know-how,
you will get nowhere.

512
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,520
Hey. It's me. I'm going to send you
an operation note

513
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,231
and a video of an operation.
See what they are about.

514
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,525
Yes, it's urgent.

INCOMING CALL: SEON-WOO

517
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,713
Hey.

518
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,215
-I can't really talk--
-I found it.

519
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,011
Where are you?

520
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,189
Aren't you off today?
I thought you were home.

521
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,483
-What did you find?
-Have you heard of Han Min-gyo?

522
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,610
Does he work here?

523
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,237
No, but…

524
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,206
Did it get caught on the security camera?

525
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,462
Han Min-gyo works for BioCal.

526
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,508
BioCal sells medical devices
and equipment.

527
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,344
The hospital recently purchased MediHap,
a surgical robot

528
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,846
used for arthroplasty, through them.

529
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,932
The latest version, of which
there are only three in the nation,

530
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,101
is here, in Operating Room Three
of Rosette E.

531
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,909
What kind of idiot got these documents?

532
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,329
Are you a moron?

533
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,914
They're all about ceramics!
What can I do with these?

534
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,584
Where are Nam-jun and Ji-yeong?

535
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,294
Get them now!

536
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,296
They were both paged and went downstairs.

537
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,089
You stupid moron.

538
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,967
Did you even graduate from grade school?

539
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,552
Who cares if they were paged or not?

540
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,347
Just shut your mouth
and bring them to me now!

541
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,641
-I'm sorry.
-You moron.

542
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,645
SON JI-YEONG

543
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,355
What?

544
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,816
You're asking for me
when I'm so busy. Fine!

545
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,531
CONFERENCE ROOM

546
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,614
A surgical robot

547
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,742
for removing joints that are damaged
either by arthritis or trauma

548
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,412
and implanting a prosthesis
more precisely.

549
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,914
If you needed a lecture on basics,
you should've asked me.

550
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,167
I could've explained it to you
better than this amateur.

551
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:18,006
MediHap utilizes a 3-D CT scan
to minimize unnecessary bone removal

552
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,758
and to improve accuracy

553
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,886
so that the original structure can be
retained and side effects can be reduced.

554
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,930
Are you here to sell the machine?

555
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,682
Are you in sales now?

556
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,642
I don't need to.

557
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:30,727
You already have a salesperson
you are close to.

558
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,521
Han Min-gyo from BioCal.

559
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,197
What? Is this about that?

560
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,658
Are you making this fuss about that?

561
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,371
Han Min-gyo is under police investigation

562
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,123
for practicing medicine without a license.

563
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:56,253
On March 15 this year,
at a general hospital in Busan,

564
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,589
he was caught operating on a patient

565
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:01,842
in place of the doctor
using the MediHap he had sold.

566
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,428
He's going to be arrested soon.

567
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,306
Did Han Min-gyo not tell you that?

568
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,397
On February 14, at 3:40 p.m.,

569
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,650
you, Dr. Kim Tae-sang,
the chief of Orthopedics,

570
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,528
conducted two surgeries simultaneously,

571
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,323
one in Operating Room Three
and another in the OR across the hall.

572
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,035
Who was operating the MediHap…

573
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,455
in Operating Room Three that day?

574
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,554
Will we have to cut through the ribs?

575
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,765
We'll see whether we need to
when we go in.

576
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,559
-Do you think--
-The person

577
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,770
who knows best about the machine did it!

578
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,941
We got that machine
less than a week before the surgery.

579
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:03,070
The person who sells it
knows it best. That's why!

580
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,864
Why do we perform robotic surgeries?

581
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,450
Because we can operate
with more precision!

582
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:11,662
It could've gone wrong if I did it myself
using the machine I'm not familiar with.

583
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,957
It was the best option for the patient.

584
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,792
You abandoned the patient!

585
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,385
You entrusted the patient to someone
without a medical license and left.

586
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,803
He was unqualified!

587
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,182
At least the doctor in Busan
stayed and watched to learn.

588
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,726
He watched as the salesperson
performed the procedure.

589
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,062
At least he made an effort!

590
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,730
What?

591
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,567
What did you just say?

592
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
"Effort"?

593
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:51,660
I've been working my ass off
at this hospital for 30 years.

594
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:55,289
You've burdened so many people
so that you can be where you are now.

595
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,792
How dare you judge and criticize me?

596
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,803
To whom have I been a burden?

597
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,889
Insisting on going into orthopedics
in itself…

598
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:17,352
Do you know how physically demanding
being an orthopedist is?

599
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,979
If you ever thought about

600
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,106
how much of a burden you are

601
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,817
to your colleagues and seniors,

602
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,153
you could not dare
insist on going into orthopedics!

603
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,363
Someone useless like you could not!

604
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,781
Deputy Director Kim.

605
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,492
We were the ones
who had to bear the burden!

606
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,704
While one punk
pretended to be some noble guy

607
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,874
with determination
and the rest acted like philanthropists,

608
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,084
we had to work our asses off
to pick up the slack!

609
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,297
You made all that fuss back then, too.

610
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:49,760
You don't have a single day of experience
in the OR. Who are you to judge me?

611
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,054
What? "Effort"?

612
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,310
I heard

613
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:00,854
that there was…

614
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,859
one professor

615
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,862
who refused to let me intern here
at my own alma mater.

616
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,786
I found out after ten years

617
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,998
who refused me when another school

618
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,041
accepted me…

619
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,670
without a problem.

620
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,203
It doesn't matter.

621
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,585
Ye Seon-woo
worked harder than anyone else.

622
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,422
You worked
until you popped a vein in your foot…

623
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,092
from sitting for too long.

624
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,346
Your foot got swollen
from working so much,

625
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,433
so I drained blood from your foot.

626
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,351
Numerous times.

627
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,730
I know that.

628
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,316
It doesn't matter
what others say about you.

629
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,574
On February 14…

630
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,118
at 3:40 p.m.,

631
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,789
you two assisted the deputy director
in his surgery, correct?

632
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:28,418
Is what Dr. Ye Seon-woo said

633
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,713
about an unlicensed person
performing surgery true?

634
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,926
Did Deputy Director Kim Tae-sang
overlook it and encourage it?

635
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,093
Did he?

636
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,267
Thank you for your answer.

637
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,227
The patient's waiting.

638
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,069
How dare they…

639
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,739
Shit. Assholes.

640
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,033
Shit.

641
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,118
Assholes.

642
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:03,889
What…

643
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,308
You asshole.

644
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,351
Say that again.

645
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,064
Try being an asshole to me
like you just did to my brother.

646
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,320
I'll follow you around
for the rest of your life.

647
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,156
I'll show up at your door

648
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,492
and in front of your children.

649
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,788
I may not be able to save you,
but I can kill you.

650
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,459
Don't you ever be rude
to my brother again.

651
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,339
Or I'll kill you.

652
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,769
That crazy jerk.

653
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,165
Those damn doctors.

654
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,794
I barely fixed one problem,
and those bastards…

655
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,096
Yes, sir.

656
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:29,391
Let's find out who filed the complaint
against the deputy director.

657
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,073
You're good at yelling.

658
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,785
It must've been hard.

659
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,874
I'll get in trouble
when I go back to the office.

660
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,462
We're supposed to investigate quietly

661
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,923
without causing problems on-site.

662
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,012
Why didn't you tell me?

663
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,597
That you went to another school
because a professor refused you.

664
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:15,061
Why did you tell me it was your choice?
You said you felt uncomfortable here.

665
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,524
You were serving as a public health doctor
in Gwangyang then.

666
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,985
I was going to come back.

667
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,319
Exactly.

668
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:26,364
You were going to come back here.

669
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:29,659
You'd have to see that professor

670
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,370
all the time while working here.

671
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,001
I'm fine.

672
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,295
I didn't have to complete
my training here.

673
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,424
So don't look at me like that.

674
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,387
How did I look at you?

675
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,515
You're being gross.

676
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,017
Gosh.

677
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,647
I'm really fine.

678
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:03,985
Fine.

679
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,792
Why did you come here on your day off?
Was it because of me?

680
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,877
What?

681
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,939
Damn it.

682
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,651
CHOI SEO-HYEON

683
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:04,045
At first, they argued back and forth

684
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,256
since the deputy director
wanted to argue his case.

685
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:09,551
But still, it's true that he messed up.

686
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:12,929
Mr. Gu was there and heard everything?

687
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,267
Is he trying to bring them down
one by one?

688
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,353
I don't get it.

689
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,814
No matter what his intention was,

690
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,358
Mr. Gu was the one who exposed
the Cancer Center incident,

691
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,111
but how did he dig up the dirt
on the deputy director?

692
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,573
How would he know
about what happened in the OR?

693
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,116
But in the end…

694
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,868
He pulled them out of the game.

695
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,953
The fourth and fifth batters specifically.

696
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,833
I'm sure everyone thought the same thing

697
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,877
after Director Lee passed away.

698
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:46,838
That one of those two
would be the next hospital director.

699
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,298
Right.

700
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,425
The chief of the Cancer Center
and the deputy director

701
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,551
were the lead candidates.

702
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:56,014
But think about it, Dr. Oh.

703
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,350
Why must it be one of those two?

704
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:04,481
You're the first female chief
of the Neurosurgery Center.

705
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,984
Now, it makes me wonder.

706
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,820
Why must that be the highest position
you hold?

707
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:13,948
Right?

708
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,873
DR. LEE SANG-YEOP

709
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,054
You can relax now.

710
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:39,516
The focus shifted from you
to the deputy director.

711
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,477
You should make an aggressive move
at a time like this.

712
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,854
You should think of a way.

713
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,039
I can take him home.

714
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,250
Where are you, though?

715
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,210
I just have somewhere to be.

716
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:08,878
Where exactly?

717
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,297
Is something wrong?

718
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,340
No.

719
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,842
But don't ask Seon-woo

720
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,303
if he's okay or things like that.

721
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,557
Don't ask him
about what happened earlier today.

722
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:23,935
I won't unless he brings it up.
I'm not the nosy type.

723
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:24,894
Right.

724
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,479
Thanks.

725
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,701
SAEGEUL21

726
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,103
There's nothing wrong with coming by.

727
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:10,398
I flaked on her twice.

728
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,110
It's okay to come and apologize.

729
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,119
Just a minute.

730
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,500
-Are you ready?
-Yes. Give me one minute.

731
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,090
So, this is what your office looks like.
This is where you work.

732
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,510
-Never been to a pediatrician's office?
-I've never been to yours until today.

733
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,596
They're all the same.

734
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:43,514
Should we grab dinner?

735
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,059
Let's get some takeout and eat at home.

736
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:47,560
Okay.

737
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,983
That's right.
Do you know Dr. Joo Kyung-moon?

738
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:01,824
Why?

739
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:03,993
You don't?

740
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:07,955
Why do you ask?

741
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,959
Earlier today,

742
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:16,172
I thought he was referring to Jin-woo,
but…

743
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,257
While one punk pretended to be
some noble guy

744
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,302
with determination
and the rest acted like philanthropists,

745
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,222
we had to work our asses off
to pick up the slack!

746
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,139
This is…

747
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,726
Dr. Ye's fight. Stay out of it.

748
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,895
I heard that there was one professor

749
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,815
who refused to let me intern here
at my own alma mater.

750
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:40,029
At first, I thought the Dr. Ye
he mentioned was Jin-woo.

751
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,156
But it isn't Jin-woo's fight.

752
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,370
I wondered before too,
whether he knew you.

753
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,287
Does he?

754
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,376
Does he?

755
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:55,670
How?

756
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:03,761
Seon-woo.

757
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,430
What is it?

758
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,902
No-eul.

759
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:21,821
Yes?

760
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:24,782
I…

761
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:30,830
like you.

762
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,753
Me, too.

763
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,671
Let me say it.

764
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,221
Let me be a man

765
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,641
who can tell the woman he likes
how he feels about her.

766
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:55,480
Let me be an ordinary man

767
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,482
and confess my feelings.

768
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,499
It was from the start.

769
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:18,836
From the very first moment…

770
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:22,465
I met you, No-eul.

771
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:09,178
You think the world is your oyster now,
don't you?

772
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,139
How did you hold it in all this time?

773
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,434
How could you guys…

774
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,894
You should've done better, then.

775
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:21,315
Right, you should've done better.

776
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:24,777
I'd never have anyone tell me to shut up
in the first place

777
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,070
since I never cause trouble!

778
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:29,448
You reported me, didn't you?

779
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,325
We can't silence the press.

780
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:32,994
We can handle it quietly, though.

781
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,912
Why won't you play your hand?

782
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,040
What is it?

783
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,751
This won't do.

784
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,462
Please be our director.

785
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,341
Don't just say you're worried.

786
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,010
Please step in before our hospital…

787
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,804
gets any worse.

788
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:54,265
Deputy Director Kim

789
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,475
did not withdraw his candidacy.

790
01:04:57,518 --> 01:04:59,353
He just can't seem to back down.

791
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:03,149
The chief of the Cancer Center
won't budge, either.

792
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,067
They're all impressive.

793
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:08,404
But there is a new option now.

794
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,699
Mr. Gu, the election results are out.

795
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,034
Really? Who…

796
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:14,452
Who won more votes?

797
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,169
I have high expectations for you.

798
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:27,131
I look forward to continue working
with you, Dr. Joo.

799
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:34,722
