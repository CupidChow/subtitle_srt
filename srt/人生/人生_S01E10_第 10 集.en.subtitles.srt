00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,724
EPISODE 10

6
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,731
MS. KANG

7
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,734
Hello?

8
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,533
Relay my congratulations.

9
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,619
Thank you.

10
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,703
It was a tight race.

11
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,288
It's finally over.

12
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,337
Congratulations,

13
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,964
Director Oh Se-hwa.

14
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,594
Thank you, Dr. Joo.

15
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,720
Congratulations.

16
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,819
OH SE-HWA: 22 VOTES
JOO KYUNG MOON: 13 VOTES

17
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,531
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

18
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,368
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

19
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,292
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

20
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,002
Congratulations, Director Oh Se-hwa.

21
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,837
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

22
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,839
Word sure spreads quickly. Thanks.

23
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,068
Oh Se-hwa of Neurosurgery speaking.

24
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:16,821
Yes?

25
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,701
Sure.

26
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,870
Okay.

27
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,549
Mr. Gu wanted me
to relay his congratulations.

28
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,181
He said to send him the paperwork
so that he can approve it once he returns.

29
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,349
Yes!

30
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,709
I'm ready to see my patients.

31
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:16,297
She doesn't even sound happy.
Why did she even run for the election?

32
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,638
Oh, no.

33
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,851
Please, come in.

34
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,277
Sorry, but Mr. Gu is out.

35
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,154
Should I call him?

36
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,532
I don't need a drink.

37
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,869
I just came to say goodbye.
Please relay my message for me.

38
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,830
I'm so sad.

39
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,624
Things will settle down soon
since the election's over.

40
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,003
-Is it over?
-Yes. Dr. Oh Se-hwa won.

41
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,421
Do you know who she is?

42
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,881
Yes. So, she won.

43
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,509
Yes. When will you be back?

44
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,512
Hopefully never.
We only come if there's a problem.

45
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,556
You can come when something good happens.

46
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,183
Maintain these until then.

47
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,186
Okay. Thank you for everything.

48
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,940
I'll relay the message.

49
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,996
What is it? Is there something else?

50
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,378
I'm sorry, but may I ask you for a favor?

51
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,005
Yes, of course.

52
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,967
We've been getting many inquiries
regarding the source

53
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,220
of the complaint
about Deputy Director Kim.

54
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,765
They keep asking for
the person's identity and IP address.

55
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,517
I hear the deputy director
is particularly hounding us.

56
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,645
He's the subject of the complaint,
so he can't ever find out,

57
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,231
but the higher-ups keep asking.

58
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,233
So it's been tough
on the person in charge.

59
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,903
Well… We didn't really…

60
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,738
I asked for it twice.

61
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,575
Hwajeong Group
is very powerful in our country.

62
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,329
If you keep inquiring,
you will probably find out eventually.

63
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,288
However,

64
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,707
I feel like

65
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,336
you, of all people, would know
how this should end.

66
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,879
That's why I'm telling you this.

67
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,802
Goodbye, then.

68
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,618
It must be his brother
who filed the complaint.

69
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,630
So, Dr. Oh won.

70
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,803
That means Mr. Gu called you in
to make a deal.

71
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,139
It wasn't just a deal.

72
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,017
He told me
that he really wants to work with me.

73
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,061
I'm done.

74
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,272
Good for you.

75
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,159
One, two…

76
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,703
All right.

77
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,665
-Here we go.
-Okay.

78
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,805
Do that again,
and you are no longer my brother.

79
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,477
What did I do?

80
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,936
About the deputy director.

81
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,316
You should've told me if you were
going to investigate him yourself.

82
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,444
You made me the jerk.

83
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,283
Do you need this?

84
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:17,455
I've been through much worse.

85
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,165
It went well thanks to me.

86
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,958
Dr. Joo's running for the director, too.

87
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,878
Thank you very much.

88
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,727
He's running because I pushed him into it.

89
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,313
What if it goes badly?

90
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,899
He's not a child. He's a grown man.

91
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,984
You should run yourself.

92
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,113
What? You're quite old, too.

93
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,825
You should get promoted
and do whatever you want.

94
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,952
Don't just support others.

95
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,792
I'm sure Director Lee had a reason
for bringing Dr. Joo.

96
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:08,089
I'm sure he knew that it'd be impossible
for him to serve five consecutive terms.

97
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,049
That's why…

98
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,635
Let him go.

99
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,639
Let Director Lee go.

100
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,145
Don't hold onto him like you did with Dad.

101
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,440
How long will you hold onto dead people?

102
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,816
He threw up the toy,

103
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,902
but he's only three.
His larynx must be damaged.

104
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,571
I'll run tests and send him up if needed.

105
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,615
I doubt he'll have to stay overnight.

106
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,783
I don't think so either. Let me know.

107
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,873
You didn't fail to protect him.

108
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,249
Protect him?

109
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,501
It wasn't your responsibility
to begin with.

110
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,669
Don't worry too much.

111
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,047
What would I be worried about?

112
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,548
About Dr. Oh.

113
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:34,967
She'll do well.

114
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,756
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, DR. JOO KYUNG-MOON

115
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,260
Hey, Seon-woo. Where are you right now?

116
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,013
Me? Where else? I'm at work.

117
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,603
Do you know Dr. Joo Kyung-moon?

118
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,065
Do you? How?

119
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,987
He didn't…

120
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,448
answer.

121
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,135

DATE OF APPOINTMENT: MAY 8, 2018

133
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,967
I heard you won quite a lot of votes

134
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,219
and became the finalist.

135
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,263
Thank you for your hard work.
It was tough, right?

136
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:47,516
I thought you wouldn't stand a chance.

137
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,395
You and your brother's attitudes
are making me all confused.

138
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,648
I think you have a good chance
in the next election,

139
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,066
so I came to kiss up to you now.

140
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,151
You're too late.

141
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,987
Are you going back?

142
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,323
Yes. I'm back at the office
starting tomorrow.

143
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,869
You are almost out of warfarin, right?

144
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,413
Yes.

145
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,627
PATIENT NAME: YE SEON-WOO
DIAGNOSIS

146
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,588
"Post-thrombotic syndrome."

147
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,800
MAY NEED LOWER LIMB AMPUTATION

148
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,178
"Chronic…"

149
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,895
Taking blood thinners is not enough.

150
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,775
A stent would only serve
as a temporary measure.

151
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,278
It'll get blocked again.

152
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,030
Thank you.

153
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,200
PRESCRIPTION
WARFARIN, NEURONTIN

154
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,410
Your company has a great benefits program.

155
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,372
Why don't you take some time off and rest?

156
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,583
For how long?

157
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,128
It will only delay the progression.

158
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,047
No matter what,
the result would be the same.

159
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,173
Everyone does the same.

160
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,218
Everyone tries to push it off
as much as they can.

161
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,057
You've worked so hard to get this far.
It's too much of a waste.

162
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,978
I don't mean to intrude,

163
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,730
but you should think about
what your mother went through.

164
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,359
She did go through a lot.

165
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,695
More than enough.

166
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,327
How's the pain? And your breathing?

167
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,872
There's no pain, and my breathing's fine.

168
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,833
I wish that were true.
I wish I didn't know about this disease

169
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,253
and was able to believe you.

170
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,980
DR. JOO KYUNG-MOON
OUT OF THE OFFICE

171
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,576
Dr. Joo just started his rounds.

172
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,297
Sir, we'll raise your bed a little, okay?

173
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,466
Hold on.

174
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,717
Sir.

175
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,220
You need to start moving little by little.
Why aren't you moving around?

176
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,806
You need to move around
if you want to go home.

177
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,308
Stick out your tongue.

178
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,018
Okay. Good.

179
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,811
More. Okay.

180
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,230
Thank you.

181
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,315
We're good.

182
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,068
Why is he still on this?

183
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,694
His kidneys are still in bad condition.

184
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,905
Are you eating well?

185
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,031
Yes.

186
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,658
Is he on antibiotics?

187
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,035
-No.
-Then remove it.

188
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,669
At least I wasn't in last place.

189
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,672
Excuse me?

190
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,674
I didn't embarrass our department, did I?

191
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,511
Why do you say that?

192
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,642
We make rounds every day,
but it's not the same for the patients.

193
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,644
Stand straight,

194
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,187
and focus.

195
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,438
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

196
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,200
ORTHOPEDICS LONG-STAY PATIENTS
DOCTOR IN CHARGE

197
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,122
Shoot.

198
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,249
KIM TAE-SANG

199
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,628
CONSULTATION STATUS
KIM TAE-SANG, NAM HO-SEOK

200
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,089
KIM TAE-SANG, NAM HO-SEOK

201
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:50,968
Is the assistant away?

202
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,929
No. We eliminated that position
during the cutbacks.

203
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,098
I haven't been
in the director's office for so long.

204
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,371
He was always sitting there
whenever I walked in.

205
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,460
It feels so real,
now that we're here, doesn't it?

206
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,380
The nameplate isn't ready yet?

207
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,133
I'm not sure. I'll check.

208
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,427
I'll get it when it's ready.

209
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,930
I look forward to working with you,
Director Oh Se-hwa.

210
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,308
Same here.

211
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,894
Please fight against Mr. Gu for us

212
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:45,981
so that he can never mention
losses and expulsions again.

213
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:52,946
What about your other items?

214
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,991
Leave them. I'll have to go back and forth
to see patients anyway.

215
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,701
-Thanks.
-Yes, ma'am.

216
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,832
Enjoy your new office, Director Oh.

217
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,497
It's me.

218
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,707
I need to know what my duties are.

219
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,169
Since the former director isn't here,
you need to fill me in.

220
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,588
Please come in right now.

221
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,627
3RD QUARTER INSURANCE CLAIMS

222
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,884
You know you have to review
insurance claims every quarter.

223
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,053
This is the list of facilities
being upgraded or expanded

224
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,680
in the second half of the year.

225
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,599
This is the budget sheet.

226
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,478
Here are some documents
on our pharmaceutical distributor.

227
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,149
It's our newly founded subsidiary.

228
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,778
They have exclusivity,

229
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,572
so we spend 7% more on medicines

230
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,241
compared to when we had multiple vendors.

231
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,577
Of course, we're making up
for the differences

232
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,454
through patients and insurance services.

233
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,042
Patients don't compare drug prices
when they buy them.

234
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,710
Although the 7% difference

235
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,921
wouldn't significantly increase
the revenue per patient,

236
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,381
but it would add up to a huge amount.

237
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:21,303
Thanks to that, our subsidiary's
net profit rate is over 10%.

238
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,641
Other distributors' is 1% on average,

239
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,020
so we can say that Mr. Gu has created
the goose that lays the golden eggs.

240
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,983
The problem is,

241
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,737
where does all that profit go?

242
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,117
If they claimed it as a donation,
they wouldn't need to pay taxes for that.

243
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,956
If it was distributed as a dividend,
the dividend rate

244
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,375
would be about 3,000% to 4,000%.

245
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,880
To whom is it being donated?

246
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,800
Who is receiving the dividend?

247
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,058
Why do you ask me
when you already know the answer?

248
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,143
Because--

249
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,563
Because you want to hear the name
of the person way up there from me

250
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,607
so that when it becomes a problem,

251
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,609
you can say that you didn't say anything

252
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,945
and that the one who accused
the owner and the foundation

253
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,780
was Oh Se-hwa, not you.

254
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,532
You're trying to shift the blame onto me.

255
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,247
Let me ask you something.

256
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:35,794
If you knew the situation so well,
why did you play along with it?

257
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,170
What were you doing until now?

258
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,673
I waited for the election to end.

259
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,925
What does that have
anything to do with it?

260
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,136
If you felt it was improper,

261
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,472
you should've stopped
the subsidiary from being formed.

262
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,392
Does my memory fail me?

263
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,562
Didn't the person sitting in front of me
hand out a list of drugs

264
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,564
supplied by the hospital's subsidiary,

265
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,607
saying we should only prescribe drugs
on the list?

266
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,655
You are trying to get back at him
for suspending you,

267
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,242
but you don't want to do it yourself
because of the consequences you may face.

268
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,869
So you're handing it off to me, right?

269
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,414
Are you trying to make me go against

270
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,874
not just Mr. Gu,

271
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,501
but Hwajeong Group's chairman?

272
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,838
I'm sorry.

273
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,468
What did you think of me all this time

274
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,846
that you thought
I'd take this ridiculous bait?

275
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:32,225
Have I gone too easy on you?

276
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,063
Or did you think I was a pushover
who you can just keep under your thumb?

277
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,690
I won't call a committee meeting

278
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,651
for your reinstatement.

279
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,572
We'll proceed with the punishment
Mr. Gu decided,

280
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,241
meaning you should apologize
to the patients in person.

281
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,541
I'll look over the files.

282
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,834
Thanks.

283
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,672
Oh, and one more thing.

284
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,675
Please have some manners.

285
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:09,012
Knock before entering.
Isn't that basic etiquette?

286
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,100
I represent this hospital!

287
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,686
Is there anyone at this hospital
more famous than I am?

288
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,523
Who chooses a hospital
based on a doctor's fame?

289
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,900
They come for the name of the university.

290
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,902
Just ask anyone on the street.

291
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,196
No one would have heard of your name.

292
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,282
Even if you and I leave this hospital,

293
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,118
the hospital would do just fine.

294
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,370
We'd be lucky if the junior doctors

295
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,705
don't thank us
for getting out of their way.

296
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,807
PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTOR

297
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,731
This is the director.

298
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,525
When will Mr. Gu be back?

299
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,681
I'm not here to fight you.

300
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,564
As someone who got to know you enough,
I know fighting you

301
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,524
would only stress me out.

302
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,277
Your attitude says differently.

303
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,363
I wonder what you would be like
when you do fight me.

304
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,074
I wish that day would never come.

305
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,914
This is how I usually am.
I'm sorry if you have a problem with that.

306
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,209
I have many things to discuss with you.

307
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,335
Such as?

308
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,129
When the Cancer Center matter got out,

309
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,341
everywhere I went, people asked,

310
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:11,843
"I heard someone died at your hospital,

311
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,261
but your hospital covered it up."

312
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,015
I got so sick of hearing it
that I almost punched my aunt-in-law

313
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,850
in the mouth when she brought it up.

314
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,145
The illegal subsidiary…

315
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,688
It isn't illegal.

316
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,482
That's what people claim.

317
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,525
It's a violation
of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act,

318
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,985
but people are turning a blind eye.

319
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:33,490
It is also true that every few years,
it becomes a huge issue.

320
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:38,161
"Superior general hospitals
are non-profit organizations,

321
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,373
but I hear they set up
moneymaking subsidiaries."

322
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,584
It's something that the National
Assembly loves to investigate on.

323
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,086
It quiets down soon, though.

324
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,511
I hate being humiliated
more than anything.

325
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,597
"Sangkook did something bad again."

326
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,474
I don't want to hear something like that.

327
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,270
That really hurts my pride.

328
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,981
Do you feel humiliated

329
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,816
when people badmouth the hospital?

330
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,779
Mr. Gu.

331
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,448
You must not consider yourself
one of us yet.

332
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,867
One of you?

333
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,287
One of you…

334
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,123
Are you saying
that I should consider myself one of you

335
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,041
and take sides with you at all times?

336
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,669
I'm not saying we should run a charity.

337
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,673
Please make sure we don't become
the target of the investigation.

338
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,135
Also, how would you feel
if I refer to you as…

339
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:39,097
What was the name of the company
you were with?

340
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,391
Logis.

341
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:42,642
Yes. Logis.

342
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,147
How would you feel if I refer to you
as Hwajeong Logis President?

343
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,481
Pardon?

344
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,941
You called her "Dr. Oh."

345
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,199
Sorry, Director Oh.
I understand your concern.

346
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,744
I'll take care of that.

347
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,746
Would you like an inauguration gift?

348
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,958
Hwajeong Life Insurance.

349
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,544
We'll sell their policies here.

350
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,004
Are you kidding me?

351
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:15,508
Drugs weren't enough? You want us
to sell insurance, too?

352
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,137
Or you can bring us another project
that pays us 30% commission.

353
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:25,643
I will never tell my patients to get
private insurance plans.

354
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,230
We'll bring in a consultant
specializing in insurance.

355
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,815
Inside the hospital?

356
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,941
If not, where? Outside?

357
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,582
The 3-D Biosimulator.

358
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,380
It scans the patient's brain
or other organs

359
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,216
and creates accurate 3-D replicas of them.

360
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,469
Think about it. We don't get rehearsals.

361
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,054
People's lives are at stake,

362
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,098
but we have to do it without practice.

363
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,475
How could we practice?
There's nothing to do it on.

364
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,354
But this device creates a 3-D model
of the patient's brain

365
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,774
so that you can see it all
before the surgery.

366
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,360
"So, this is what this patient's
organs look like.

367
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,070
So, this is what the problem is."

368
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,324
That sounds very good,

369
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,244
but it sounds very expensive.

370
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:26,996
It is. It is very expensive.

371
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,956
Buy it for us.

372
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,006
Otherwise, I'll tell everyone
at the hospital

373
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,759
not to even mention insurance to anyone.

374
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,764
Let me check out that device.

375
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,866
He has met his match.

376
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,459
She's tough.

377
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,379
Mr. Ye Seon-woo asked me
to relay his regards.

378
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,214
He returned to his office.

379
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,132
Okay.

380
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,802
Do we know who reported
the deputy director?

381
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,054
They don't know, either.

382
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,688
Reschedule a meeting
with Chairman Hong Seong-chan.

383
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,815
He refused again today?

384
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:38,026
He won't let us use their cell phones?

385
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,486
I couldn't see him.

386
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,071
What? He flaked on you?

387
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,532
Were you stood up?

388
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,076
My goodness…

389
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,412
That punk.

390
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,540
So what if he makes cell phones?

391
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,750
I'll teach him a lesson.

392
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,755
That, we shall.

393
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,971
-Thank you.
-Have a good night.

394
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,515
-Hello.
-Come in.

395
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,474
It's been a while.

396
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,365
Do you have patients waiting?

397
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,034
No. I do need to go back, though.

398
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,036
Me, too.

399
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,164
Then why did you want to eat outside?

400
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,625
It doesn't matter where we eat…

401
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:37,877
Is there a problem?

402
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,591
Let's have a consolation drink later on
when we're not on call.

403
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,717
It'll be my treat.

404
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,804
I'm the one who should console you.

405
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,639
I should treat you.

406
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,810
Don't. I'm trying so hard
to act like it doesn't bother me.

407
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,357
It may have ended differently
if Mr. Gu hadn't intervened.

408
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,026
It's all over. Just forget it.

409
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,823
I didn't know
you wanted to leave the hospital.

410
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,785
Did you want to go to your hometown?

411
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:14,414
Did you really tell Mr. Gu
that you would quit?

412
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,542
I do want to go back.

413
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,335
Of course, I do.

414
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,297
Why did you come here in the first place?

415
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,008
You even thought about
becoming a director there.

416
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,760
Because you couldn't refuse Director Lee?

417
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,263
Because I couldn't operate.

418
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,848
Sorry?

419
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,267
I had to do a coronary artery
bypass graft, but couldn't.

420
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,229
We needed at least
one more specialist to do it.

421
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,525
I know we were in the rural area,
but we couldn't find anyone.

422
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,403
I sent the patient elsewhere

423
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,572
and left.

424
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,952
You get to operate
to your heart's content now.

425
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,544
It won't be held against you.
Don't worry about it.

426
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,963
-What?
-You said Mr. Gu

427
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,757
wouldn't approve you
to serve as the director

428
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,467
even if you won the election.

429
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,428
You're not the only person
who said they'd quit.

430
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,973
He wouldn't have rejected you
just because you were going to resign.

431
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,018
That's nothing.

432
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,066
What is it?

433
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,571
You should've ordered something
more expensive. I told you it's on me.

434
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,074
We have to pay up front here.

435
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,242
Oh.

436
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,828
And you called and told me to order first.

437
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,997
Right.

438
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,625
It's not your first time here.

439
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,751
No.

440
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,588
I didn't have time.

441
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,000
JIN-WOO

442
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,836
I'm with a patient. Please eat first.

443
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,295
I'm sorry.

444
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:30,133
-Excuse me. One bowl of noodles, please.
-Okay.

445
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,686
Why didn't I realize then?

446
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,149
I knew death can come to anyone, anytime,

447
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:50,486
but why didn't I know
that I'd come to regret putting you off?

448
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,615
Tomorrow. Next time.

449
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,744
Anytime other than today.

450
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,664
You taught me everything.

451
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,754
But why did you leave
before I realized that?

452
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,267
When you think about it,
time is an amazing thing.

453
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,522
There must have been people

454
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,191
who came up with the idea

455
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,611
of building a hospital here.

456
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:35,615
They set up barracks during the war

457
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,993
and laid down the injured here.

458
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,208
For 60 years,

459
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,419
people like us came and left.

460
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,633
It's amazing, when you think about it.

461
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,304
How do you think they felt?

462
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,558
Are we a lot different from the people

463
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,478
who first started this hospital?

464
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,607
Should we just accept
that we're different from them

465
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,026
since the times have changed?

466
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,702
I wonder what will happen.

467
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,794
Dr. Ye.

468
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,092
Yes? What is it?

469
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,351
Are you off?

470
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:47,520
Yes.

471
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,025
I'll go in first.

472
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,242
About Seon-woo…

473
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,205
Is his post-thrombotic syndrome serious?

474
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,375
You can't access patient records
as you wish.

475
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:10,751
How is he?

476
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,005
Are his valves damaged?

477
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,676
He's suffering from

478
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,970
recurrent pain and edema.

479
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,847
Soon,

480
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,057
we won't be able to control it.

481
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,730
-If we operate--
-Conservative treatment is the only way.

482
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:31,939
Surgery won't help.

483
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,152
He must walk. That's the only way.

484
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,696
Otherwise, it can only get worse.

485
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,407
That's ridiculous.

486
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,701
His blood flow
has slowed down significantly.

487
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,329
If a blood clot blocks a blood vessel,

488
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,788
we'll have to amputate his leg.

489
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,252
How long will it take
until there's complete blockage?

490
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,462
Ten years?

491
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,255
Fifteen years

492
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,216
at most.

493
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,805
If a serious blockage occurs before then,

494
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,600
that will be it.

495
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,810
What's wrong?

496
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,858
What is it?

497
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,737
What do we do?

498
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,489
About what?

499
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:51,162
It's okay. Tell me. What is it?

500
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,898
There's nothing you can't tell me.

501
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,943
You can tell me anything. Come on.

502
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,365
Did Dr. Joo say something?

503
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,033
Is it about a patient?

504
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,625
Yes.

505
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,543
Yes, what?

506
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,878
It's about a patient.

507
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,049
-No-eul.
-It's about a patient.

508
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,967
We have a joint case.

509
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,097
Wait here. I'll drive you home.

510
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,681
Let me check on a patient…

511
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,727
I want to go to Seon-woo.

512
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,772
I want to eat with him.

513
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,150
I can't see him at the hospital anymore.

514
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,740
Okay. He'll like that.

515
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,118
Go ahead.

516
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,989
Ye Jin-woo's close to Dr. Lee No-eul.

517
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,324
I think there's something going on
between them,

518
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,617
but they act like there isn't.

519
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,331
So?

520
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:44,585
So, what happened?

521
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,937
A patient is sick.

522
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,564
Sure.

523
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,441
They're usually sick and in pain.

524
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,652
That's right.

525
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,779
Well…

526
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,532
getting rejected is also painful.

527
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,618
Sorry?

528
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,703
I saw.

529
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,667
Were you unable to confess your feelings
to Dr. Ye Jin-woo?

530
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,504
Are you saying
that I got rejected by Jin-woo?

531
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,048
Isn't that why…

532
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,638
What are you talking about?

533
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,598
What do you want to know?

534
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,060
You should finish what you started.

535
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,021
So? What was the result of the vote?

536
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,898
Did they build it or not?

537
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:50,943
Oh, that.

538
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,153
"Oh, that"?

539
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,323
A town in Switzerland voted to build
a nuclear waste repository.

540
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,616
At first, 60% agreed.

541
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,161
They took another vote after
the government offered compensation…

542
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,413
It dropped to 25%.

543
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,039
To 25%?

544
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,250
It's true.

545
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,460
So they couldn't build it?

546
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,878
Is that important?

547
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,464
Of course, it is. It's the most important.
It's the conclusion.

548
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:17,303
I don't know whether they built it
or not. I only read about it online.

549
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,847
Are you kidding me?

550
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,309
Don't you want to know
why fewer people agreed to it

551
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,643
when they were offered money?

552
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,936
You'll tell me anyway.

553
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,522
That's why you brought it up
in the first place.

554
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,108
Then you'll know the answer, too.

555
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,156
You don't want me to implement
the pay-for-performance program.

556
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,871
So, you do know.

557
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,498
And yet,

558
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,251
you slashed the nurses' starting salaries.

559
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,383
The pay-for-performance program
is addictive, like a drug.

560
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:00,471
For certain occupations,
incentives are good motivators.

561
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,264
However, for some,

562
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,224
it destroys people's morale.

563
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,772
Some jobs require people to step up
and have a sense of responsibility

564
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,441
as well as a strong sense of self-worth.

565
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:14,818
Our job is one of them.

566
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,906
That's what the people of the town
thought about.

567
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,325
"Yes, it has to be built somewhere.

568
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:23,619
Let's take responsibility.
That's the right thing to do."

569
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,413
But once money entered the picture,

570
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,416
their entire line of thought changed.

571
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,545
From "What is the right thing to do?"

572
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,215
to "What will benefit me the most?"

573
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,384
That's what happened.

574
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,596
The question then becomes,

575
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,433
"Why build that dangerous thing
in my front yard?"

576
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,311
Mr. Gu.

577
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,314
I saw many people

578
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:54,775
who can't return to how they were before.

579
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,697
They got so addicted
to being paid incentives

580
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,534
that they completely lost
their sense of responsibility

581
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,287
and the desire to do what is right.

582
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:16,380
I want you to work with people
who are healthy physically and morally

583
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,298
and be happy doing your job.

584
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,976
I wasn't rejected.

585
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,186
I'd never ask him out, either.

586
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:35,441
Then why were you crying?

587
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,115
Did you name the dog?

588
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:44,867
It is…

589
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,493
Well…

590
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,744
You still haven't named him?

591
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,081
Did you really send him back
to the shelter?

592
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,344
He got bigger.

593
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,638
Did he gain weight?

594
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,729
Stop crying and go home.

595
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,691
Have a good night.

596
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,394
If I look forward to

597
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:58,315
where you're going to exert your efforts,

598
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,651
will I be disappointed?

599
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:15,082
Companies spent decades instilling
the idea that medical care is a service.

600
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,043
Do you think we built private hospitals,
added more beds,

601
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,128
and invested for nothing?

602
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,631
The market is finally ready.

603
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,175
Now is the time we grow our business.

604
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,636
What was the first thing you did
as soon as you came here?

605
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,556
Your first idea was to fire people
for causing losses.

606
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,739
Are you sleeping?

607
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,535
Hey.

608
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,622
Did she leave already?

609
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,304
What was he watching?

610
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,772
The Speaker
of the National Assembly denied it,

611
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:24,151
but the receipts detailing the expenses
submitted as evidence

612
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,153
would stir up a backlash
against his claim.

613
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,947
The Speaker has accused
Reporter Kwon Hui-sang,

614
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,949
the first one to report the allegation,

615
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,160
of fabricating the evidence,

616
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,954
but he has denied the accusation.

617
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,332
If he keeps saying
the receipts were fabricated…

618
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,033
Did you drink?

619
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,999
No-eul stopped by, right?

620
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,047
Did you two fight?

621
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,176
Why? You're grown-ups, you know.

622
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,014
We didn't fight.

623
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,351
I told her.

624
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,688
You told her what?

625
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,315
That I liked her…

626
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,360
and that I still like her.

627
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,706
Out of the blue? Why?

628
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,169
I told her
so that I wouldn't regret not telling her,

629
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,757
but later on, I may regret telling her.

630
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,265
I wanted to put it out there…

631
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,435
before there comes a day

632
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,521
when I can't tell her.

633
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,818
Why would that day ever come?

634
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,698
Why don't you ask

635
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,493
what her response was?

636
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,165
It's between the two of you.

637
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,793
Would she feel awkward around you
because of me?

638
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,467
Sorry.

639
00:50:58,013 --> 00:50:59,514
Why are you sorry?

640
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,685
What's wrong with telling her? Idiot.

641
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,605
Hey. We don't need her.

642
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,274
Go to sleep.

643
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,507
Let's just live like this.

644
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:35,717
You and I…

645
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,511
Just the two of us.

646
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,014
Like this. For the rest of our lives.

647
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,401
I'm proud of you.

648
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,028
Go to sleep.

649
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,216
Damn it.

650
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,736
-Did they begin?
-Yes.

651
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:18,820
Let's go inside.

652
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,872
Sorry. There was an accident.

653
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:29,789
Please hurry.

654
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,518
DONOR: KANG MIN-SEO
HEART PROCUREMENT: COMPLETED

655
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,542
LIVER PROCUREMENT: COMPLETED

656
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,555
They're almost done.

657
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,849
I'll let you know…

658
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,893
once they're done.

659
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,568
Thank you for making…

660
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,572
such a difficult decision.

661
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,522
SURGERY STATUS

662
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,400
FEMALE, AGE 13,
GENERAL SURGERY, IN PROGRESS

663
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,401
Don't worry.

664
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,741
-Doctor.
-Yes.

665
00:56:09,824 --> 00:56:11,367
Yes, ma'am.

666
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,744
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

667
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,955
-Thank you, doctor. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

668
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,499
Sure.

669
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,167
-Did they start?
-Yes.

670
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,836
Thank you for arranging things
for her so quickly.

671
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,962
Sure.

672
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,423
Everyone said that it would take a while.

673
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,674
It's all thanks to you.

674
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:27,967
My gosh.

675
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,971
The top surgeon at our hospital
is operating on her,

676
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,056
so I'm sure it'll go well.

677
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,141
Don't wait here.

678
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,977
Why don't you wait in the room?

679
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,229
-Escort them.
-Yes, sir.

680
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,482
-All right.
-Thank you so much.

681
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,484
Of course.

682
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,362
Thank you so much
for saving my grandchild.

683
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,906
-You don't need to thank us.
-Thank you.

684
00:56:50,448 --> 00:56:51,407
This way, please.

685
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:31,948
TO MS. KIM,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE LUNCH WITH ME?

686
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,491
I said to check the patient's I&O
until midnight.

687
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,075
Didn't you hear me?

688
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,620
We stop measuring I&O at 5 p.m.

689
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:21,164
Is that what I asked?
Who said you could skip it?

690
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,916
Who gave you the authority?

691
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,001
I'm sorry. Next time--

692
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,420
When? After the patient dies?

693
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,215
You go home often, right?

694
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,759
Who cares what happens here
as long as you can see your mom?

695
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,177
Why bother?

696
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,596
Just remember her after she dies
like you do with patients.

697
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,557
I'm sorry.

698
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,059
You and your…

699
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,396
I'm so sick of hearing your apologies.

700
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:48,024
Don't even think about going home today.

701
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,213
MS. KIM

702
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,341
I don't think I'll have time
during lunch. Sorry.

703
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,181
Sorry.

704
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:22,058
I sent that by mistake.

705
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:39,409
SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
MEDICAL CENTER GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY

706
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:43,538
We will now begin the ceremony.

707
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:46,207

708
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,501

710
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:01,848
Congratulations.

711
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,683
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

712
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,697
This is the Cancer Center.

713
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,950
It's the largest research-focused
cancer center in the nation.

714
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,786
Behind that
are the Health Examination Center,

715
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,372
the Healthy Life Clinic,

716
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,790
and the Veterinary Care Center.

717
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,710
And toward the mountain
will be the Meditel,

718
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,463
a hotel-style medical facility
for patients from overseas.

719
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,423
The farthest in is the funeral parlor.

720
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,220
What's that?

721
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,515
That's the custodians' housing.

722
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,101
Why would we--

723
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,569
Hey.

724
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,696
Yes.

725
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:26,224
Why did we have to do this in the middle
of a field during a heat wave?

726
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,810
Oh, thank you.

727
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,728
Is this ice water?

728
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:31,688
Yes.

729
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,400
I could've used this earlier.

730
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,496
That's much better.

731
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,670
Is it really the custodians' housing?

732
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,548
Why is it in a secluded area?

733
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,137
It's too far from other buildings.

734
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,139
It should be close by
to have them on call.

735
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:10,810
And I've never seen a hospital campus
with a housing facility.

736
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,942
Is it really the custodians' housing?

737
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:20,987
You'll find out soon enough.

738
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,743
Right.

739
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,915
The 3-D simulator
will go through customs soon.

740
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:36,878
I can't wait to see it.

741
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,349
CHAIRMAN HONG SEONG-CHAN

742
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,656
LEADER OF HEALTH CARE INNOVATION,
REALIZING THE VALUE OF HUMANITY

743
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:12,079
…the most renowned hospital in Korea.

744
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,540
Enjoy Seoul. Get pretty
while sightseeing all at once…

745
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:19,504
Sangkook University Hospital became one
of the most renowned hospitals in Korea

746
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:21,297
because we do not focus
only on the present.

747
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:26,302
We have broadened our scope
in treatments, education, and research.

748
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,595
We also strive to strengthen…

749
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:28,763
That's the director.

750
01:03:28,846 --> 01:03:30,389
She's the one in this video.

751
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,141
In alliance with Hwajeong Group…

752
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,269
CANCER INSURANCE PLAN
LIFETIME COVERAGE AND FIXED PREMIUM

753
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,896
…will strive for change.

754
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:41,275
As the leader in healthcare innovation,

755
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,320
Sangkook University Hospital
will do its best

756
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,823
to provide quality medical care
to each and every one of you.

757
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,415
Okay.

758
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,628
It's an altered LOC patient transfer.
They're almost here.

759
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,922
How could they tell us
at the last minute like this?

760
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,842
Right? I asked why they didn't call
when they were leaving…

761
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,176
Shoot.

762
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,398
Laceration.

763
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,358
Where's her file?

764
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,985
We weren't given anything.

765
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,821
What do you mean? Get a CT scan.

766
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,447
-Jae-hyeok!
-Coming!

767
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,130
What happened?

768
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,256
I don't know, either.

769
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:48,301
They said she already had altered LOC
at the initial hospital.

770
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,721
They said they couldn't treat her there,
so they requested to transfer her here--

771
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,556
-Which hospital?
-Eulji Kang Hospital.

772
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,141
Okay.

773
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,184
The altered LOC patient's CT.
I'm coming now.

774
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:07,737
Dr. Ye.

775
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,363
Yes?

776
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:20,458
This is insane.

777
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,376
I told you to prescribe

778
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:25,296
Recormon prefilled injections
to anemic patients.

779
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:28,424
The price difference
is less than 10,000 won.

780
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:30,217
We're not burdening the patients.

781
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,178
Chief, I have an altered LOC patient--

782
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:36,057
It's not like everyone
who comes to the ER is poor.

783
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,100
Don't hesitate to prescribe
expensive medicine

784
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,894
to patients
who seem to be able to afford it.

785
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:41,687
We can increase our revenue,

786
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,649
and they get premium meds.
It's a win-win deal.

787
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,443
If you see patients coughing up phlegm,
especially bloody phlegm

788
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,362
like earlier today,

789
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,989
you should suggest they get a TST.

790
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,158
Just throw it out there.

791
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,166
Hey.

792
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,379
At least we don't have to sell
insurance plans and supplements.

793
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,050
Do you know how I feel,
being yelled at every morning

794
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,845
in front of other chiefs
because of our losses?

795
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,936
You and I worked here too long
to get a job elsewhere.

796
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,522
We can't work for other people.

797
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:29,151
But it's not like we can say, "Screw it,"
and open a private practice.

798
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:37,076
Let's just meet our quota.

799
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:39,412
Okay.

800
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:45,668
I'm going home.

801
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,295
Good night, Chief.

802
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:04,895
Shit.

803
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:08,065
Is she trying to turn me into roadkill
or what?

804
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:11,235
Shit.

805
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,529
EULJI KANG HOSPITAL

806
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:17,616
CPR!

807
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:25,249
We need an Ambu bag.

808
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,377
Right after the CT…

809
01:07:28,461 --> 01:07:29,712
IV Line. Epinephrine, hurry.

810
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:34,175
No pulse.

811
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:36,260
Intubation.

812
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,057
Tube going in.

813
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,477
Okay. Secure it at 23cm.

814
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,395
-Securing the tube.
-Okay.

815
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,396
No pulse.

816
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:57,531
No pulse.

817
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:09,794
I'll switch with you.

818
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:37,780
-More epinephrine.
-Okay.

819
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:29,623
Where is she?

820
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,375
Who?

821
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,751
The patient who just died.

822
01:09:33,335 --> 01:09:35,379
What? Didn't you send her?

823
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:36,714
To where?

824
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,757
The transfer team came and took her.

825
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,342
I thought you had them take her.

826
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,760
Maybe there was a mistake.

827
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,971
You idiots. How could you lose a body?

828
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,556
-Go find her now!
-Okay.

829
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,191
MORGUE

830
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,952
She isn't in the morgue.

831
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:21,342
Did you take our body?

832
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,302
Sorry?

833
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,347
ORGAN TRANSPLANT CENTER

834
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:29,141
Hey.

835
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,142
We found her.

836
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,648
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

837
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:47,993
What's going on?

838
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:49,828
We don't know, either.

839
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,163
What happened?

840
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:00,589
Who said you could come in?

841
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,550
Director. There must've been a mistake…

842
01:11:05,177 --> 01:11:06,011
Everyone out.

843
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,347
Pardon?

844
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:11,475
Get out!

845
01:11:43,757 --> 01:11:45,467
Why didn't you tell me?

846
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,803
You always share everything
about him with me.

847
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,430
You really didn't know

848
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,807
that he smiled only at you?

849
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,560
Was that so hard to see?

850
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,523
Is she really dead?

851
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:01,442
Do you know her?

852
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,777
You know her too,

853
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,071
although not directly.

854
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,365
We cannot possibly do that!

855
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,285
You need to be really unlucky
to die like this.

856
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:12,745
What do you want me to do?

857
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,455
What about me?

858
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:15,998
What if I refuse?

859
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:18,584
What if I do as I wish?

860
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,753
What happens then?

861
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:24,340
Would they leave you alone?

862
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,759
They made that reporter a murderer
without a problem.

863
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:30,429
Who do you think
their next target will be?

864
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:33,849
What matters is,
who gave Mr. Gu the order.

865
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:35,517
This is a double-edged sword.

866
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:37,394
You'll still go after him, right?

867
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:42,191
Let's just say that I'm naive
and have no fear.

868
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:51,492
