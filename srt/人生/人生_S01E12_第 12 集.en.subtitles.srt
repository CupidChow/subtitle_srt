00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,306
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,224
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,519
EPISODE 12

4
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,277
Coming through. No photos.

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,361
Step aside.

6
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,572
Move aside. No photos.

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,240
Please let them through.

8
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,284
Step aside. No photos, please.

9
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,453
-Sir.
-Excuse us. Please, step aside.

10
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,122
No photos, please. Stop.

11
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,356
Please come in, sir.

12
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,278
Are you done giving your condolences?

13
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,451
That I liked her…

14
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,369
and that I still like her.

15
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,456
Later on, I may regret telling her.

16
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,418
…before there comes a day

17
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,296
when I can't tell her.

18
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,911
Did you give it to the mother?

19
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,372
I did.

20
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,627
Are you out of your mind?

21
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,505
What do you think will happen
if we publish this now?

22
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,550
We'll be stoned to death.

23
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,678
It's not like we exposed the informant
from the beginning.

24
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,139
Your article is basically claiming

25
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,558
that we intentionally exposed
the informant just to prove

26
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,351
that we are not lying.

27
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,479
We knew the informant
could be put in danger,

28
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,232
but we didn't do anything about it.

29
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,736
We should admit that we are responsible
as well and apologize.

30
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,613
Then we should explain why we,
who are responsible for her death,

31
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,991
are insisting on an autopsy.

32
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,285
It's late, but that's what we must do.

33
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,662
Being rational and going by theories
won't help right now.

34
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,998
Lee Jeong-seon isn't the only person
we've done wrong.

35
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,877
We claim that we're progressive media,
but we instigated distrust.

36
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,297
"Look at them. They're garbage, too."

37
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,717
We have disappointed those
who expected something different from us.

38
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,845
If we start putting the safety
of our sources above anything else,

39
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:50,016
we will end up creating
a climate of self-censorship.

40
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,643
Did you forget
how much we loathed censorship?

41
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,814
Do you consider yourself
a talented reporter?

42
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,233
Are you trying to say

43
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,444
that I'd better not consider myself one?

44
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,280
No. I believe you are talented.

45
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,825
I believe you can properly discern
between prioritizing what's important

46
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,328
and censoring what we report.

47
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,790
We can't publish this.

48
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,001
What's our job?

49
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,505
Is making the public become disillusioned
with politics our only job?

50
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,215
Is that our objective?

51
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,382
I said, we can't.

52
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,975
AUTOPSY PENDING IN THE QUESTIONABLE DEATH

53
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,590
Please answer me this time.

54
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,054
Remember when I asked you
about the Cancer Center incident before?

55
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,476
I asked you if you exposed it
to use it against us later on

56
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,020
or if it just ended up that way
when you only did it

57
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,605
for the deceased's family.

58
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,482
Why do you…

59
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,193
want to know that again?

60
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,570
Did you try to expel Pediatrics
and Emergency Medicine

61
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,405
to make us go on strike over it

62
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,033
so that we couldn't fight back
about something else?

63
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,368
Is that why you suddenly canceled it?

64
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,622
Nothing just ends up happening.

65
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,916
I don't do business based on coincidences.

66
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,751
Then you really planned…

67
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,379
Don't you ever do that during surgery?

68
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,509
Aren't there times
when things are different

69
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,011
from your expectation,
and you have to think of an alternative?

70
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,890
We can't do that.

71
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,935
We can't do that with surgeries.

72
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,020
How nice.

73
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,606
Running a business is all about
dealing with unexpected variables.

74
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,484
We have to constantly respond to changes,

75
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,486
take action quickly,

76
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,905
have plan B in place at all times,

77
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,199
and foresee what's coming next
and get ready for it.

78
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,786
Someone who says,
"It just ended up that way,"

79
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,663
can't survive.

80
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,374
So, it was a variable.

81
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,376
The anonymous financial statement posting.

82
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,337
It was.

83
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,840
In other words,

84
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,470
you're not that kind of person.

85
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,058
What about now?

86
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,562
What about Lee Jeong-seon's death?

87
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,403
Was it you who gave the order?

88
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,261
Let's go, Dr. Lee.

89
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,513
Let's go.

90
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,903
What did they do?

91
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,240
What time will they leave
for the crematorium?

92
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,703
Does Mr. Gu know?

93
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,458
Okay. Keep monitoring.

94
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,171
YE JIN-WOO
EMERGENCY MEDICINE

95
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,133
I'm sitting here with a pen and paper,

96
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,012
contemplating what to write
for quite a while.

97
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,016
I'm trying hard
to think of what I should say

98
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,728
in order to convince the two of you.

99
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,858
Should I say I can relate to your pain

100
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,944
because I, too, have lost a family member?

101
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,780
However, how could I possibly know

102
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,200
how it feels to lose a child?

103
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,873
Sir and ma'am,

104
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,084
this is all I can say.

105
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,171
You need to request an autopsy.

106
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,423
Please.

107
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,678
I'm sorry
that I couldn't be more considerate.

108
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,514
I know there are countless voices

109
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,434
asking you to do this or that.

110
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,020
I sincerely apologize

111
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,022
for adding to it.

112
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,401
I'm sorry.

113
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,654
Please request an autopsy.

114
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,876
All the hostages
held at the Strait of Malacca

115
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,212
were released
as a result of the recent negotiation.

116
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,796
Next on the news.

117
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,884
The family of the late Lee Jeong-seon,
the informant who exposed

118
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,011
Speaker Jung Chae-yong's
misuse of government funds,

119
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:27,056
made an official request for an autopsy
early this morning.

120
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,558
As the family made the request

121
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,810
-to find out the exact cause of her death,
-Jin-woo!

122
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,062
-the previous…
-Jin-woo!

123
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,157
Ma'am.

124
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,952
The bus is here already.

125
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,662
The relatives are waiting.

126
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,580
I can't believe you people!

127
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,876
They want an autopsy for their child.
What is wrong with you people?

128
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,005
The crematorium is all booked up,

129
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,174
so if you get there late,
you can't get it done today.

130
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,219
What do you plan to do in this heat?

131
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,638
Look. We'll take care of it,

132
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,765
so just leave us alone! Okay?

133
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,602
NFS said it'd be difficult to obtain
precise results in the current state.

134
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,939
What do you mean?

135
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,401
They froze the corpse
because it was so hot out.

136
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:24,572
They said it would be difficult
to conduct an autopsy on a defrosted body.

137
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,366
Did you just say

138
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,828
you froze and defrosted
my daughter's body?

139
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,914
If you had said you'd do an autopsy
from the start,

140
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,374
they wouldn't have done that.

141
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,251
That's an utter lie.

142
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,843
She was not a miscarried fetus.

143
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,721
We do not let a body become damaged,
especially not an adult's.

144
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,097
Never.

145
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,809
Forget you all.

146
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,853
It isn't because of you, either.

147
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,938
I don't want to hear any of it.

148
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,773
We'll get…

149
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,651
an autopsy.

150
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,459
Ma'am.

151
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,229
MR. LEE

152
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,290
I didn't unlock the door. Who is…

153
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,069
I'm sorry, Mr. Cho.

154
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,501
Are you done?

155
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,503
How should I end this?

156
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,051
Do you think they will be able to
have an autopsy done?

157
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:54,013
Mr. Gu's people are trying to
convince them not to do it,

158
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,307
but I doubt the family,
especially the mom, will back down.

159
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,145
Even if a conglomerate is involved,

160
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,398
if the parents insist on
having an autopsy done on their child,

161
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,774
wouldn't they get what they want?

162
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,322
Hey. I said not to use words like that.

163
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,658
Delete "denounce." We're not denouncing.

164
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:17,828
You shouldn't say stuff like
"right" or "wrong."

165
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,538
We're not discerning right from wrong.

166
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,874
Revise it to, "As doctors,

167
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,502
we have a duty to uncover the truth
behind a person's death."

168
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,631
"Feel deep remorse."

169
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,925
That sounds good.

170
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,553
WE FEEL DEEP REMORSE
ABOUT THE CURRENT SITUATION…

171
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,846
No.

172
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:39,308
The autopsy is not confirmed.
Please take down the article.

173
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:44,063
Yes. Everything, including personal data.

174
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,483
Send them to me right away.

175
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,664
I told you to sit.

176
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,422
What do you think will happen

177
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,550
if we do an autopsy?

178
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,763
Through the inspection, I discovered--

179
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:18,806
Hey.

180
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,433
I know that already.

181
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,897
I'm asking you if the ruling on the cause
of death can be overturned or not.

182
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,154
You can't answer that?

183
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,741
Aren't you the director?

184
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,331
There's a fifty-fifty chance.

185
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,209
I can't guarantee
how the result will turn out.

186
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,086
Shit.

187
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,508
If the death was caused by a disease
or cardiovascular problems,

188
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,343
-an inspection--
-Forget it.

189
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,856
I understand.

190
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,239
Send in the Director
of the Restructure Team.

191
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,334
Yes, sir.

192
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,549
Sit.

193
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,898
The family initially consented
to the cremation

194
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,108
and showed no signs
of changing their minds.

195
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,111
I think those two doctors I reported about
said something to them.

196
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,237
What did they say?

197
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,906
I don't know what,

198
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,451
but based on how he acted
toward the mother at the funeral parlor,

199
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,412
he definitely played a part
in their decision.

200
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,462
Who was it?

201
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,297
Ye Jin-woo of Emergency Medicine.

202
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,301
His father passed away. His mother
remarried and lives separately.

203
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,928
There's nothing special in his career.

204
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,847
His younger brother works at the HIRA,
and is a paraplegic.

205
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:27,309
There is a rumor
that he is dating a colleague.

206
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,063
I guess having a paraplegic brother
is not a big deal for him.

207
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,442
Should I make sure both brothers
are confined to bed for life?

208
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,611
Who's the other one?

209
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,696
Chief Joo Kyung-moon
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

210
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,114
He ran for director

211
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,533
and lost to Director Oh.

212
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,411
There is nothing else special about him.

213
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,412
Any family?

214
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,831
He has a stay-at-home wife
and a daughter in high school.

215
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,833
Don't touch the kid.

216
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,127
There's nothing to do to a housewife.

217
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,964
If he's a chief, he must've done
quite a few surgeries.

218
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,800
We'll check
if he had made any medical errors.

219
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,803
The one who went to the funeral parlor
is dating someone here?

220
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,973
Yes. A female doctor in Pediatrics.

221
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,310
That poor woman.
Just because of her poor choice in men…

222
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,812
Understood, sir.

223
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,663
It'll pass.

224
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,377
I guess having a paraplegic brother
is not a big deal for him.

225
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,881
Should I make sure both brothers
are confined to bed for life?

226
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,801
Let them do the autopsy.

227
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,096
If we stop them now,

228
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,807
we'll only be giving them proof
that we're hiding something.

229
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,519
She said it could be overturned.

230
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,813
I won't let that happen.

231
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,775
I'll make sure the cause of death ruling
doesn't get overturned.

232
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,902
Even the director can't guarantee it.

233
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,361
I guarantee it.

234
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,489
I'll take care of it.

235
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:19,856
Mr. Lee.

236
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,484
Yes, sir.

237
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,615
Hire a medical examiner from outside.

238
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:33,078
Ban all Sangkook employees
from the autopsy room entirely.

239
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,581
Including the ones demanding an autopsy
and Director Oh, who did the inspection,

240
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:39,751
no one is allowed to participate in
or observe the autopsy.

241
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,212
Mr. Gu, what should I do?

242
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:48,385
Don't outsource it.
Do it all inside this hospital.

243
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,054
Have the medical examiner
give the briefing.

244
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,181
We'll do the autopsy
as the family requests,

245
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,724
but the conclusion will be the same.

246
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,102
Death resulting from blunt force trauma.

247
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,062
That is all.

248
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,696
The deputy director is circulating
a petition demanding an autopsy.

249
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,865
This is the petition he wants you to sign.

250
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,499
He said to get your…

251
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,459
Mr. Bang!

252
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,544
Yes?

253
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,342
PETITION DEMANDING AN AUTOPSY

254
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,769
CHIEF OF PLASTIC SURGERY

255
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,150
Chief.

256
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,111
Goodness. It's really late.

257
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,535
He's doing that
because he has nowhere left to fall.

258
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,846
Why did he go there? What did he say?

259
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,723
Forget you all.

260
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,975
It isn't because of you, either.

261
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,941
"It isn't because of you, either."

262
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,569
I'll chase you around
for the rest of your life.

263
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,614
I may not be able to save you,
but I can kill you.

264
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,367
I'll kill you.

265
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,330
You reported me, right?

266
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,290
No, I didn't.

267
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,584
It is you.

268
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,919
It is not.

269
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,174
I was right. It was you.

270
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,316
MR. GU SEUNG-HYO

271
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:20,161
It's the hospital president.

272
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,084
Hello?

273
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,129
DEATH CERTIFICATE

274
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,131
That's correct.

275
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,679
NAME: LEE JEONG-SEON

276
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,472
It's right here.

277
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,225
CARDIAC ARREST FROM ACUTE CEREBRAL EDEMA
CAUSED BY BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA

278
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,828
Sir, this way, please.

279
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:40,033
Mr. Gu wouldn't have ordered the autopsy
to find out the real cause.

280
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,034
So?

281
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,452
Can we go in?

282
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,870
No, we can't.

283
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,498
He blocked off the autopsy room,
using impartiality as an excuse.

284
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,167
Chief.

285
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,838
Dr. Ye, I'm…

286
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,508
My apologies. I'll hang up now.

287
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,429
I don't know either. Okay.

288
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,979
It's not that you don't know.
There's just no way.

289
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,732
I don't know.

290
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,403
It's not like you can plant a camera
like in spy movies.

291
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,447
Is this my limit?

292
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,245
You at least made them do the autopsy.

293
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,832
Two inspectors,

294
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,709
a medical examiner, a prosecutor,

295
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,461
and a professional photographer.

296
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,506
Only outsiders are permitted
to take part in the autopsy.

297
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,383
Why?

298
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,053
To confirm that it was a cardioembolic
stroke, Dr. Joo should check it,

299
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,556
but he can't even go near the room,
let alone see the body.

300
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,144
Outsiders…

301
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,149
Outsiders.

302
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,777
That's too cruel. Don't do it.

303
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,074
Jin-woo!

304
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,048
When you go in, you'll see a prosecutor,
who will oversee the procedure,

305
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,425
two legal inspectors,

306
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:21,843
a medical examiner,

307
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,555
and a photographer
specializing in autopsy photographs.

308
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,105
They will examine the exterior, and then
the internal examination will follow.

309
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:38,276
From the back, the abdomen, then the head.

310
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,114
When they cut the abdomen open, you
need to be prepared for something worse.

311
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,909
They don't simply look inside.

312
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,038
They remove the organs.

313
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:21,194
Family members are permitted
to observe autopsies.

314
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,033
It'll be hard, but you must go in.

315
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,118
Go in, and…

316
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,538
-We'll begin the autopsy.
-Just a minute.

317
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,018
I'm sorry, Jeong-seon.

318
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,898
My baby girl, I'm so sorry.

319
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,372
Do you even…

320
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,750
consider our daughter human?

321
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,986
PATIENT NAME: LEE JEONG-SEON

322
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,457
Cardiac arrest
due to acute cerebral edema.

323
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,042
This was caused by…

324
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,419
blunt force trauma to the head.

325
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,529
SEARCH AND SEIZURE AT SAEGEUL21

326
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,994
Is the woman you're seeing
a reporter at Saegeul21?

327
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,584
What do you mean, the woman I'm seeing?

328
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,962
Sorry. I saw you.

329
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,130
Is it a secret?

330
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,013
Dr. Lee.
The seizure patient is stable now.

331
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,223
Then get a CT scan.

332
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,140
Okay.

333
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,020
I saw you two together.
So, she's a reporter there.

334
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,022
How did you see us?

335
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,818
In the parking lot.
Seon-woo was with me, too.

336
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,284
Seon-woo saw us?

337
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,955
We weren't trying to.
You were right there.

338
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,083
Why? Is there a problem?

339
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,626
The parking lot?

340
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,713
-Was that two days ago?
-Yes.

341
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,844
Did you go to the funeral parlor
because of that reporter?

342
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,721
Did you go to the funeral parlor

343
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:36,973
because of someone?

344
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,768
-Well…
-I'm partly responsible

345
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,103
for Lee Jeong-seon's death.

346
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:43,855
You are? How?

347
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,648
I helped them with the receipts

348
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,151
that are on the news.

349
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,739
I didn't know where they came from
or from whom.

350
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,325
But that person was brought to me.

351
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,828
She died while I was holding her.

352
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,042
I saw her eyes losing life.

353
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,045
It happens all the time.

354
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,507
Yes, it does.

355
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,735
-Good night.
-Bye.

356
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,654
-Bye.
-Bye.

357
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,124
KR BANK PERSONAL LOAN
WITH SPECIAL INTEREST RATE

358
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,848
What are you up to, Mom?

359
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,602
Nothing's up.

360
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,938
I'm just wondering if you're free later.

361
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,151
Do you want to get dinner then?

362
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,306
Are you done?

363
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:47,562
We're almost done,
but I need to write up the report.

364
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,730
It takes some time.

365
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,816
I need at least ten days--

366
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,193
Make the announcement first.
Everyone is waiting.

367
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,654
Okay.

368
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,463
The photographer made them promise
not to say where they got the photographs.

369
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,840
We can't put the person
who helped us in a tough spot.

370
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,967
If we announce the result
without evidence,

371
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,427
who would believe us?

372
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,846
This is the only way to prove
the actual cause of death.

373
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:08,184
Did you forget
why this tragedy began in the first place?

374
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,394
It was because the informant's identity
was disclosed.

375
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,524
We can make the announcement
and stay out of it.

376
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,694
Everyone will demand evidence anyway,

377
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,321
and the only ones who can provide it

378
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,407
are the people
who were in the autopsy room.

379
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,534
They'll have to provide

380
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,995
what they have,
be it photos or the autopsy record.

381
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,044
You can voice your concerns to me.

382
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,173
If we make the announcement,

383
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,550
what will happen to the director?

384
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:47,098
If we overturn her ruling
on the cause of death…

385
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,140
There's no time.

386
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,018
She'll become someone who hid the cause
of death, latched onto authority,

387
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,937
and used a person's death
for her personal gain.

388
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,439
She did. She got involved from the start.

389
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,776
Exactly. Let's give her a chance
to correct it herself.

390
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,572
How do you know if that's what she wants?

391
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,914
If she refuses to do it,

392
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,624
I will.

393
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,344
Go to the auditorium. I'll be right there.

394
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,370
I'll be right back. Hold my seat.

395
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,722
When did you come?
You must have waited a while.

396
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,016
Waiting is part of our job.

397
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,351
Is the result out?

398
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,937
They'll announce it soon.

399
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,692
I probably won't have a chance
to talk to you afterward.

400
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,702
Aren't you busy?

401
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,913
Chief told me to attend.

402
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,124
-You too?
-What?

403
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,220
He's here, too.

404
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,834
They're just photographs,

405
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,752
but since you specialize in neurology,

406
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,587
you should be able to tell.

407
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,882
What should I do?

408
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,677
Why are you asking me?

409
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,097
Didn't you bring that here

410
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,349
because you've already made a decision?

411
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,567
The decision is for you to make.

412
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,904
I'm simply here to report
the result of the autopsy.

413
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,323
Why don't you announce it yourself?

414
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,995
If I do it, I'd be refuting
your statement,

415
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,247
but if you do it, you'd be correcting
your own statement.

416
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,708
Since an inspection and an autopsy
are like night and day,

417
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,711
your previous statement
would not be considered a lie.

418
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,175
You are saying you will give me a chance.

419
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,011
Should I be moved to tears?

420
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,728
Should I report the result
to you, Director?

421
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,778
There isn't much time
until the medical examiner's briefing.

422
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,478
We have a car ready for you,
so you may leave immediately afterward.

423
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,021
-Okay.
-This way.

424
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,570
GLUTTON

425
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,200
Hey.

426
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,326
Seung-hyo.

427
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,161
I repeat.

428
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,123
I hereby refute the conclusion
of the initial inspection.

429
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,458
During the autopsy,

430
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,335
a blood clot in the left atrium

431
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,589
and a clogged basilar artery
were discovered.

432
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,174
This indicates that she had

433
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,636
an ischemic stroke
induced by atrial fibrillation. Hence,

434
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,141
I'd like to correct my previous statement

435
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,101
and conclude
that Lee Jeong-seon's cause of death

436
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,812
was an ischemic stroke. Thus, an illness.

437
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,523
You may direct your questions
to the medical examiner.

438
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,152
-Where's the medical examiner?
-Why did the result change?

439
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,030
-Was the inspection done incorrectly?
-Did you conduct the autopsy?

440
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,824
Why are you correcting it now?

441
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:41,452
Are you saying that blunt-force trauma
was not the cause?

442
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,207
Who? He left already.

443
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,186
Yes. Just now.

444
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,689
I'm not sure
whether Mr. Gu was involved or not.

445
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,608
My apologies.

446
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,568
There's a good chance she acted alone…

447
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,900
HONG SEONG-CHAN OF QL

448
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:48,162
Thank you very much for what you did.

449
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,456
It must have been hard for you.

450
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,420
Thank you both.

451
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,547
I'm sorry.

452
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,853
We threw it out there,
but I wonder what will happen next.

453
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,897
Something will be initiated.

454
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,733
What will you do now?

455
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,278
Work.

456
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,740
My shift is about to start.

457
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,795
He got injured at the construction site.

458
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:39,755
Okay.

459
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,717
This will sting a bit.

460
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,307
It isn't too serious.

461
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:55,145
Most construction workers we get
as patients are severely injured,

462
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,231
but you don't need to worry too much.

463
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,941
-Thank you.
-Sure.

464
00:46:59,024 --> 00:46:59,942
Hi.

465
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,318
Hello.

466
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,738
-Hello.
-Hey.

467
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:07,658
Dr. Park, bandage the wound
and send him for an X-ray.

468
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,700
-Hello.
-Yes, sir.

469
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,660
Hello.

470
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,087
Reporters are everywhere,
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,

471
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,047
sticking cameras in our faces.

472
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:26,301
If you keep going around
and sticking your nose in everything…

473
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,387
Sorry, sir.

474
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:29,846
I know.

475
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,559
I know how you feel and why
you keep getting yourself involved.

476
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,518
I do, but…

477
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,565
I'm just worried because you remind me
of when I was young.

478
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:41,733
Sorry?

479
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,152
Can't you just

480
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,446
turn a blind eye
and focus only on patients?

481
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:53,245
That's what I thought I was doing.

482
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:03,130
The nail that sticks out
is bound to get hammered down.

483
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,094
Chief.

484
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,599
Thank you.

485
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,767
You idiot.

486
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,270
Come out. We're short-staffed.

487
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,981
-Over here.
-Nurse!

488
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,236
I'm sure all of your students
are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,

489
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,780
Director Lee.

490
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,741
-This way, please.
-Dr. Ye.

491
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,409
-Yes?
-Could you help this patient?

492
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,577
Did you do this at home?

493
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,995
-Yes.
-You did a good job.

494
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,580
Please lie down.

495
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,007
Director Oh,
may I ask you a few questions?

496
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,469
I thought you didn't conduct the autopsy.
Why did you give the briefing yourself?

497
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,597
Will you write up the report yourself?

498
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,766
When will it be made public?

499
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,068
Please comment on how you came to overturn
the cause of death ruling.

500
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,539
After it was announced
that the cause of death was an illness,

501
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,958
the investigation
into Speaker Jung's suspected misuse

502
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:25,712
of government funds is likely to begin
again after being put on hold.

503
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,383
Sangkook University Hospital,
which overturned their ruling

504
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,677
on the cause of death,
will likely be investigated.

505
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:33,970
CHAIRMAN CHO NAM-HYEONG

506
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,583
I'm sorry, sir.

507
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,876
Is it out of order?

508
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,504
No. I'm sorry, Mr. Gu.

509
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,967
Well… You're not allowed to enter…

510
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,153
Why? Are you against it?

511
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,491
Are you afraid that if I live alone,
I'll get drunk all the time

512
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,994
and make the place a pig sty?

513
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,878
Did you have a fight with Jin-woo?

514
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,797
We're not little kids.
It's just what I want.

515
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,050
Why, all of a sudden…

516
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,970
I want to live on my own, too.
Why wouldn't I?

517
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,017
What did Jin-woo say?

518
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,688
All he does is sleep when he gets home.

519
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,064
I haven't told him yet.

520
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,442
Exactly.

521
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,612
All he does is sleep.

522
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,282
You don't even see each other that often.

523
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,160
It's almost like you live alone.

524
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,622
Why do you want to move out on your own?

525
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,665
Because I want to.

526
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,296
I should have…

527
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,923
Mom.

528
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,640
I should have lived with you.

529
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,602
What was I thinking, leaving you…

530
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,231
I'm glad you did.

531
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,987
I'm thankful that you pursued

532
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,156
your own happiness.

533
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,204
I feel bad that I couldn't let you do so…

534
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:06,915
sooner.

535
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,459
So…

536
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,302
You did nothing wrong.

537
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:24,975
How could I bear seeing you live alone?

538
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,954
It isn't because of you

539
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,164
or Jin-woo.

540
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,357
Mom, there's something I must tell you.

541
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,903
There were times I wished

542
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,655
Uncle Bo-hun would've told you for me,

543
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,617
but he can't anymore, so…

544
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:28,830
Mom.

545
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,002
THE TRUTH IS…

546
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,616
-This way!
-Hurry!

547
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,083
NATIONAL OLYMPICS TEAM WARM-UP MATCH

548
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,169
Dad! Over here!

549
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,422
I got you a ball.

550
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,257
Come here.

551
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,678
Seon-woo, can you see Cramer?

552
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,804
Over there!

553
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,722
-Where?
-Over there!

554
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,729
Stop it, Seon-woo.

555
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,772
Okay.

556
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,400
Shoot. Goal!

557
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,734
Dad, pass me the ball.

558
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,155
I told you not to do that in the car.
It's dangerous.

559
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,615
Okay.

560
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:48,535
Goal!

561
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,747
Seon-woo!

562
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,937
I'm the director. That's why I did it.

563
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,232
It's not a big deal.

564
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,986
Yes. I guess you'll be late.

565
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,992
Okay. Pick up Su-bin on your way home.

566
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,368
Okay.

567
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,258
Nothing will happen…

568
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,407
Why did you do it?

569
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,041
He's not there. He left.

570
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:06,673
Why do you think I did that?

571
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,718
What consequences

572
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,472
do you think you will face
because of what you did today?

573
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,270
How did you find out the cause of death?

574
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,069
I guess you made a promise
not to say anything.

575
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,739
To whom?

576
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,325
Will something

577
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,829
really happen?
Will they do something to me?

578
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,540
I know that they're a conglomerate,
but still…

579
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:46,671
I've known…

580
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,550
that family for over ten years.

581
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,179
What did you do during those ten years?

582
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,014
Did you just turn a blind eye?

583
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,117
Why do you think
I didn't cut a deal with the family?

584
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,368
I can--

585
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,538
Forget it. We'll do it.
Don't you need to go back to the hospital?

586
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,374
Director Oh is taking the day off today.

587
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:29,959
What?

588
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,754
Has Director Oh ever called to say

589
01:00:32,837 --> 01:00:34,964
she can't come to work that very day?

590
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,135
What is up with him?

591
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,930
Director Oh Se-hwa, Dr. Joo Kyung-moon,

592
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,891
Dr. Lee No-eul, and Dr. Ye Jin-woo.

593
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,893
Dismiss them all.

594
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,270
Effective immediately.

595
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:52,023
Dr. Ye, you can't just let this happen.

596
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,149
Don't take it lying down.

597
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,484
If I take it lying down,

598
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,819
that would be rude to Mr. Gu.

599
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,280
What do you plan to do?

600
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,575
He wants to fight, so I'll fight.

601
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,827
As we must not tolerate
the management's abuse of power,

602
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,454
I am proposing…

603
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:13,002
the dismissal of the president,
Gu Seung-hyo, here today.

604
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:18,341
