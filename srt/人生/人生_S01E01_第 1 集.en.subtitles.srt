Dr. Joo Kyung-moon
and Dr. Oh Se-hwa of Neurosurgery.

00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,193
They are here.

12
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,625
Deputy Director Kim.

13
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,086
What time is it?

14
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,588
It's 11:48 p.m.

00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,091

I'm sorry to disturb you at home, but…

22
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,307
the hospital director passed away. Yes.

23
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,228
Just now. In an accident. Yes.

24
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,606
Everyone else is coming in now.

25
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,150
I think you should come too, Dr. Seo.

26
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,985
Yes.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION
OF ORGAN PROCUREMENT PRIOR TO AUTOPSY

28
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,482
I have to go now

29
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,819
to get consent from the prosecutor
for the organ procurement.

30
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,619
Which one of you is in charge?

31
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,291
-What about his family?
-They consented.

32
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,754
-I'll sign it after the autopsy.
-It won't affect the autopsy. As you know,

33
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,174
-we will just recover his corneas.
-No ophthalmologist is available now.

34
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,343
Dr. Seo is on his way.

35
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,388
I believe…

36
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,309
this is what Director Lee wants.

37
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,735
If we wait too long,
we'll lose the corneas.

38
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,947
REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION
OF ORGAN PROCUREMENT PRIOR TO AUTOPSY

39
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,166
Thank you. I'll come back in a moment.

40
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,385
-Bye.
-Okay.

41
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,720
-Hey, hold on.
-What?

42
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,888
-Just a moment.
-What is it?

43
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,681
What?

44
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,226
I'll gladly take it.

45
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,769
Hold up, punk.

46
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,729
Here.

47
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,316
That's what… You really did it.

48
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,442
DONOR

49
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,195
I'd like you to do it for me
when the time comes.

50
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,280
Don't ask me.
Ask the organ transplant team.

51
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,865
When the time comes.

52
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,992
I don't want anyone else to see my belly.

53
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,745
What will you do for me if I do it?

54
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,040
Come on. I'll be dead already.
What can I possibly do for you?

55
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,668
Then why would a dead man care
about someone else seeing his belly?

56
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,211
-Why you…
-Seriously.

57
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,337
Hey. Wait up.

58
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,631
No. I don't want to.
Stop asking me to do it.

59
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,800
-How about for 2,000 won?
-Don't be ridiculous.

60
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,717
You punk.

61
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,861
Father, please give my brother,
who has returned to Heaven,

62
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,324
eternal light and peace.

63
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,454
And to those left behind,

64
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,708
please provide…

65
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,253
comfort and strength.

66
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,206
He fell.

67
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,835
All the bones were crushed,
even his hip bone.

68
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:32,673
When I moved him,

69
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,636
his back folded like a piece of paper.

70
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,638
Jin-woo.

71
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,265
That's enough.

72
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:44,935
Sorry.

73
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,605
Did you talk to the director about that?

74
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,027
Did he know that you knew…

75
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,615
when he passed away?

76
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:02,870
Yes.

77
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,164
Please keep it…

78
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,551
from getting out.

79
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,136
It has already been reported.

80
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,431
Everyone will find out about it soon.

81
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,767
Still, do something.

82
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,726
I'll try.

83
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,603
After what happened to him,

84
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,774
I doubt we'll make a big deal out of it.

85
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,777
Okay.

86
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,407
Are you okay?

87
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:42,993
I don't know.

88
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,364
MEDICAL CERTIFICATE OF DEATH

HOMICIDE, SUICIDE

95
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:46,116
They're almost here. A six-year-old girl
was stabbed about five times.

96
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,494
Who would do that to a child?
What happened? Is she alert?

97
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,829
I don't know, and they say she's alert.

98
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,123
-Control her bleeding and take her to CT.
-Okay.

99
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,585
DIRECT CAUSE OF DEATH: FALL

100
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,006
Did you hear

101
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,759
where that happened to the director?

102
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,344
Yes.

103
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,387
DATE OF DEATH

104
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,098
Why did it happen
at the deputy director's house?

105
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,600
I don't know.

106
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,436
-Don't you find it strange?
-Yes.

107
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,440
What?

108
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:23,946
What's wrong?

109
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,159
Pediatric CPR needed. She's the stab
victim we called in about earlier.

110
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,411
-This way.
-Okay.

111
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,747
-I thought she was alert.
-She just went into cardiac arrest.

112
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,624
On my count. One, two, three.

113
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,460
-Check her pulse.
-She has none.

114
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,462
Compression.

115
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,173
Let me check the rhythm.

116
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,719
Asystole. Compression.

117
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,806
Prepare for intubation.
Administer epinephrine. Continue CPR.

118
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,392
She was stabbed in the side,
abdomen, arm, and leg.

119
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,394
-Twice in the abdomen.
-Where's her guardian?

120
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,645
Over there.

121
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,149
-This way.
-Here's another patient.

122
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,150
Okay.

123
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,445
Sir, please stay alert.

124
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,783
-We'll move him. Two, three.
-Okay. Two, three.

125
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,078
Sir, do you hear me?

126
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,081
Sir, do you know where you are?

127
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,834
-Where does it hurt the most?
-Administer oxygen and take him to CT.

128
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,252
Okay. Two liters of oxygen please.

129
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,087
-Okay.
-Any other wounds?

130
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,048
No. Just this. The dad has one stab wound.

131
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:26,550
Defibrillator. Charge to 40 joules.

132
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,302
Clear.

133
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,721
One, two, three!

134
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:36,602
-Doctor, please!
-How long do we have to wait?

135
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,937
Please help my baby.

136
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,106
-He is in so much pain.
-Please help my baby first.

137
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:44,234
Sir, I'll stitch you up
after we check your CT scan.

138
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,703
Excuse me.

139
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,498
Which way is the ER?

140
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,253
Go down to the first floor
and exit the building.

141
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,838
You'll see it.

142
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,590
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

143
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,335
The police…

144
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,880
came all the way here.

145
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,009
Since it was an accidental death.

146
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,135
That's not the only reason.

147
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,847
They probably came to talk to you
because the ambulance came…

148
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,307
from your house.

149
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,310
Because it happened at my house.

150
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,150
What happened?

151
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,277
What do you think?

152
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,573
You're answering a question
with a question.

153
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,872
By the time…

154
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,753
Director Lee got to my place,
he was already drunk.

155
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,548
He still couldn't quit smoking.

156
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,301
He took out his cigarettes,

157
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,804
so I asked him if he must smoke
in front of someone who already quit

158
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,849
and told him to go smoke on the roof.

159
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,772
Then I heard a thud,

160
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,232
so I went up…

161
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,824
I couldn't even get myself to think
that he fell.

162
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,243
The heart attack…

163
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,790
finally got the director this time.

164
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,209
That's right.

165
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,229
Hello, Mr. Gu.

166
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,065
I'll be right over.

167
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,657
I guess Mr. Gu came back.
I thought I saw him leave earlier.

168
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,452
Of course, he should come back.
He only recently became the president.

169
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,914
The head of the hospital died.

170
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,167
You should be mindful
of how you look to others.

171
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,129
People are talking already.

172
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,588
About what?

173
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,134
Regardless of what really happened,
you're the only person who witnessed

174
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,679
Director Lee's last moment.

175
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,575
THE CHILD PATIENT WITH STAB WOUNDS

176
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,744
WENT INTO CARDIAC ARREST
AT 12:40 A.M. IN THE AMBULANCE

177
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,344
Excuse me.

178
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,387
We're with Hanseong Police Station.

179
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,306
A child was brought in with her dad…

180
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,813
The dad is over there.

181
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,612
The young thing died already.
We should've come here first.

182
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,283
What happened?

183
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,578
Was it an armed robbery?
Was the child stabbed in front of the dad?

184
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,497
He attempted suicide.

185
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,083
It was a murder-suicide.

186
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,546
He did that to his own daughter?

187
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,383
He stabbed his child five times,

188
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,426
but he…

189
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,138
Admit him.

190
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,977
Doctor.

191
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,396
How is he?

192
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,106
He won't end up like his daughter.

193
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,580
Did you visit somewhere else first?

194
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,249
The deputy director's office.

195
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,042
Why?

196
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,043
I see.

197
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:36,878
Excuse me.

198
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:42,968
Why didn't he answer my question?

199
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,279
They're just running some tests,
so don't get too excited yet.

200
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,697
Okay.

201
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,911
Jin-woo.

202
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,114
It could be true.

203
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,117
They could've had drinks together.

204
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,914
-What?
-The director and the deputy director…

205
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,292
They both reeked of alcohol.

206
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:01,129
Since when were they drinking buddies
who pay visits to each other's houses?

207
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,216
Then what?

208
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,468
Why do you think he went over?

209
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,554
I don't know.

210
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,560
I see. You don't know about that.

211
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,313
SHORTAGE OF PEDIATRIC CARE
LED TO TRAGIC DEATH

212
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,397
Then what do you know?

213
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,566
What do you find strange about it?

214
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,740
You're right.

215
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,993
Everyone knows that they didn't get along.

216
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,205
But no one will say anything.

217
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:40,377
Because that would mean they're suspecting
the deputy director of a person's death.

218
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,964
Am I putting you in a bad spot?

219
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,390
They had an argument.

220
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,977
Someone overheard them arguing.

221
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,353
When?

222
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,105
Who heard them?

223
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,274
Tonight. Around 7 p.m.

224
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,901
It doesn't matter who heard them.

225
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,372
What bullshit are you trying to pull?
Are you trying to ruin my life?

226
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,457
I'll get you for this!

227
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,793
The person tried to avoid the scene
because it sounded like

228
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,503
the deputy director
was ranting at someone.

229
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,380
"Bullshit…"

230
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,717
Given how he was cursing,
the person assumed

231
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,261
that he was ranting at a fellow
or somebody in a lower position,

232
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,930
but he was with Director Lee.

233
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,019
He was talking to the director.

234
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,314
And then, the accident happened
that very night.

235
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,816
At the house of the man
who said he'd get him,

236
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,152
and that man is the only witness.

237
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,533
That doesn't happen in real life.

238
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,911
You don't kill a colleague
because of an argument.

239
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,456
No one does that.
Such a thing only happens in movies.

240
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,500
Right, Jin-woo?

241
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,134
Should I…

242
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,844
tell the police?

243
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,190
What?

244
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,942
Dr. Ye.

245
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,694
The Department of Surgery won't accept

246
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,529
that attempted suicide patient.

247
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,282
They won't admit him
because it was a suicide.

248
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,752
Dr. Joo wouldn't have refused
to admit the patient,

249
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,088
but he's in the organ recovery surgery…

250
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,090
What do you mean?

251
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,675
For Director Lee's cornea donation.

252
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,052
He's watching over that, so he's out.

253
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,262
I'm sorry.

254
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,599
Admit him under my name. I'm coming.

255
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:00,558
Okay.

256
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,794
April 5, 2018.

257
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,462
DOA.

258
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,422
DOA: BROUGHT IN DEAD

259
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,799
There were two so far tonight.

260
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,637
One died after getting stabbed
by her trusted father.

261
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:42,058
One was stabbed by the words
of a trusted junior

262
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,768
and died.

263
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,567
Dr. Ye, here are the test results
for the traffic accident patient.

264
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,484
Thank you.

265
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,612
One lived only six brief years…

266
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,991
in this world.

267
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,079
To me, even the life of someone
who lived ten times that

268
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,290
feels so short.

269
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,136
Sir, is it hurting anywhere?

270
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,387
I'm fine.

271
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,681
You can feel where I am touching, right?

272
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,392
You may go home.

273
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,606
Good night.

274
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,069
It must've been an exhausting night

275
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,612
for them both.

276
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,658
April 5, 2018.

277
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,079
The day I said hurtful things to you.

278
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,832
The very last day of your life.

279
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,770
-Hello.
-Hi.

280
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:51,896
You're here early.

281
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,124
I'm Ye Jin-woo.

282
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,626
We met last night.

283
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,506
You must've been very curious,
seeing how you came straight from work.

284
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,761
I need to fill out the death certificate,
but I don't know anything.

285
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,304
What happened?

286
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,849
You should ask the deputy director.
He knows the most since he witnessed it.

287
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,101
Don't you feel uncomfortable

288
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,146
taking questions
directly to the Chief of Police?

289
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,233
When did you last see Director Lee?

290
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,028
Yesterday afternoon.

291
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,863
Afternoon…

292
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,326
We paid in a lump sum at the time,
so we didn't notice,

293
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:47,702
but it just got uncovered.

294
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,538
The quality improvement incentive
was deposited into…

295
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:53,792
Director Lee's personal account.

296
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,922
Was there anything unusual
the last time you saw him?

297
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,007
He funneled 360 million won
paid out to the hospital

298
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,759
into his personal account.

299
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,054
I think we tried to retrieve it quietly
in case it became a problem,

300
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,807
but it seemed like
he had already moved it.

301
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,350
Stop the bullshit.

302
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,020
Where did you hear that nonsense?

303
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,774
No one from your hospital knew?

304
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,901
Who said that?

305
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,071
If you have nothing better to do,
reimburse our fees!

306
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,284
How dare he…

307
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,579
Was there anything strange?

308
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,580
No, there wasn't.

309
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,376
During your last conversation with him,
what did you two talk about?

310
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,712
The usual. About work.

311
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,132
What were you thinking?

312
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,095
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?

313
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,974
Who… Who said that?

314
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,434
What was he like?

315
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,061
He was a good person.

316
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,898
We all respected him.

317
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:02,652
We haven't found anything suspicious,
and everything is consistent

318
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:04,404
with the witness' statement.

319
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,407
Was there a witness?

320
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,117
The next-door neighbor.

321
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:13,121
Did the witness see the director
come out to the roof alone?

322
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,747
Was he really alone?

323
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,417
What if he wasn't?

324
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,047
The witness is certain
that there was only one man.

325
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,803
-I see.
-I heard he had a heart condition.

326
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,764
And he drank and smoked.

327
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,768
I think he fell like this.

328
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,273
-I guess.
-Don't you just need

329
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:42,942
the cause and time of death
for the death certificate?

330
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,448
Why are you really here?

331
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,202
Because his friend died.

332
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,753
He was like a father to him.

333
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,504
Right?

334
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,050
Give me a break.

335
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,470
Don't get all worked up.

336
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,723
What really happened?

337
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,601
What really happened?

338
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,146
He said Director Lee
had drunk elsewhere first

339
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,940
and showed up at his door already drunk.

340
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,572
You're drunk already.

341
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,825
-I want some soup.
-I asked him why

342
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,744
there was no one else
at home so late at night,

343
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,080
and he asked how many moms and kids
actually stay in this country.

344
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,081
Good.

345
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,543
-I wondered what he meant at first,
-Cheers!

346
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,296
but I figured that he was saying
that his child was studying abroad.

347
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,466
This is so good.

348
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,762
Smoke on the roof, will you?
Go up to the roof.

349
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:16,929
You know I quit smoking.

350
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,475
Fine. You're such a nag. Gosh.

351
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,061
When will you quit?

352
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,192
He said that was the usual between them.

353
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,029
Then, he heard something.

354
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,461
Director Lee.

355
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,841
Someone fell!

356
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,890
Bo-hun!

357
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:10,983
A witness…

358
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,157
The next-door neighbor
was on his roof around the same time,

359
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,536
and he saw a man come out
to the roof alone.

360
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,456
Then he heard a thud shortly after.

361
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,000
If doctors start to see patients
as profit centers,

362
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,793
they can no longer be considered doctors.

363
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,839
How can one call oneself a teacher
when all they think about

364
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,257
is how to rip off their students?

365
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,720
A student at least knows
if the teacher's answer is wrong.

366
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,432
But what about the surgeries we perform
and the prescriptions we write?

367
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,642
Regular people
can never fully understand them.

368
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,187
That's why we need to take them seriously.

369
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,648
That's why we must be more alert.

370
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,068
But how could they tell us
to follow these guidelines?

371
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,364
Even if the university's foundation
was acquired by a private company,

372
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,159
this isn't right. This is wrong!

373
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,288
I think the management believes

374
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,833
that the pay-for-performance program
is directly related to productivity.

375
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,834
Productivity?

376
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,754
They will reward doctors

377
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,590
who will administer costly medications
and treatments to patients.

378
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:00,092
What does that have anything
to do with productivity?

379
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:03,679
If a patient's life is ever in danger,
everyone should rush over.

380
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,806
If you won't treat a patient

381
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,851
in case something might happen to yours
and your performance goes down,

382
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,394
how do we evaluate that performance?

383
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:16,108
The first ones who rush over to patients
when something happens are the nurses.

384
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,860
How would you quantify their performance?

385
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,695
What will you do?

386
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,449
This is the first thing the president did
as soon as he got appointed.

387
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,910
He won't back down.

388
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,787
We'll see who backs down.

389
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,803
Are you going to the president's office?

390
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,720
Yes.

391
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,225
The new president looked like
he'd be a real hard ass.

392
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,186
-I only saw him once, but…
-You saw him right.

393
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:56,148
Why are you trying to face him alone?

394
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,025
You have hundreds of soldiers behind you.

395
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,152
If I get them involved, it will be a war.

396
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,238
It's quicker for the generals to duel.

397
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,157
If the general falls, it's over.

398
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,786
No one is for the program he suggested.

399
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,080
Don't make it a battle
between you and him.

400
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,249
Make it a battle
between the medical staff and him.

401
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,836
A large corporation appointed that guy.

402
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,171
There must be a reason for that.

403
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,882
But the deputy director--

404
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,302
Director Lee, let me join you.

405
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,221
I will go with you
and let him know of our opinion.

406
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,348
This isn't our opinion.
This is our ultimatum.

407
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,641
Yes, of course.

408
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,195
Chief.

409
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:27,698
Weren't you on call last night?
Why are you back?

410
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,700
One of my patients was admitted.

411
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,994
I was going to go alone,
but since you are here…

412
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,456
Aren't you going
to the department meeting?

413
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:36,749
This first.

414
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,501
What is it?

415
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,711
What do you think?

416
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,172
A person died.

417
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,780
Only one of them is gone.

418
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,324
There's no need to leave both seats empty.

419
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,418
So? Who received Director Lee's eyes?

420
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,794
The surgery is in progress.

421
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,881
-It should be over by now.
-Who was that punk who called me

422
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,592
from the Organ Transplant Center
last night?

423
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,345
I thought he called me to come
to the wake, but as soon as I came,

424
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,098
he told me to recover the director's
corneas, of all people's.

425
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,266
What was that about?

426
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,184
What were your doctors doing?

427
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,644
He did?

428
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,438
Did you all stop by the funeral hall?

429
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,942
He was just brought back
after his autopsy this morning,

430
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,735
so the funeral will be arranged soon.

431
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,531
-What did the autopsy show?
-We don't have the report yet.

432
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,202
But he did die from a heart attack.

433
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,249
He should have cut down on alcohol.

434
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,419
Did his youngest son get married?

435
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,712
I don't think so.

436
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,756
-Will you go to the funeral?
-Of course. It's tomorrow, right?

437
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,219
I visited the Ministry
of Health and Welfare

438
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,681
before coming in this morning
because they called me in.

439
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,309
They say in rural and remote areas,

440
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,144
many people are having a hard time

441
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:22,897
because their local hospitals
cannot cater to their medical needs.

442
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,109
There's nowhere for women to give birth,
and there aren't enough pediatricians.

443
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,195
The Ministry called you in
first thing in the morning

444
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,615
to talk about something so meaningful.

445
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:35,075
Did they play a rerun just in case

446
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,328
we forgot what they say all the time?

447
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,789
They want to create a network
among hospitals in rural and remote areas

448
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,334
and public healthcare providers.

449
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,169
Our hospital has been chosen
to be part of it.

450
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,299
Do they want us to enter
into a partnership with a rural hospital?

451
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,219
They would like us to send some
of our doctors to a rural hospital.

452
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,971
What do you mean? To where?

453
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,556
Naksan Medical Center.

454
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,935
Which departments?

455
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,604
Obstetrics and Gynecology.

456
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,731
Pediatrics.

457
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:11,904
How many doctors--

458
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,197
Emergency Medical Center.

459
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,824
Those three departments.

460
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,827
All three departments? Until when?

461
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,996
Who will remain here? How many?

462
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,457
How can you get rid of
the essential departments?

463
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,627
We're not getting rid of them.
It's only temporary.

464
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,421
Are we setting up a branch hospital?
Or are we merging with them?

465
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,382
They'll subsidize the labor cost, so…

466
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,675
So, are they telling us

467
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,219
to take the money and leave
the minimum number of doctors here?

468
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,514
Isn't this what national universities
are supposed to do?

469
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,266
They can't pass the duty onto us,
can they?

470
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:43,852
We're one of the regional hospitals.
They're sending us because we excel.

471
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,022
I didn't know excelling
is something to be punished for.

472
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,899
Do we really have to go?

473
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,192
What about here?

474
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,987
It's not like we don't have
any patients here.

475
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,364
There are plenty of other hospitals.

476
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,617
In rural areas, they shut down ERs
because they lack staff.

477
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,994
You've already agreed

478
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,203
to accommodate their request,

479
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,205
haven't you?

480
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,623
What was I supposed to do?

481
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,167
How could I refuse?

482
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:10,504
If you have a problem, go and complain
yourselves. See if they would listen.

483
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,548
Why couldn't you?

484
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:18,887
If it were Director Lee, he would've
put his foot down and refused.

485
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,647
Did you say you went to the Ministry
of Health and Welfare on your way in?

486
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:34,737
Weren't you listening?

487
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,451
You can't just leave like this!

488
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,411
Then what? What do you want me to do?

489
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,959
We need to let the staff know of this.
Please go make an announcement about it.

490
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,504
Why don't we gather opinions
from each department?

491
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,428
We need a course of action.
Let's set a time and hold a mass meeting.

492
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,726
Whatever they call it,

493
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,187
they are basically expelling us.

494
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,400
How could they do this

495
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:55,984
without consulting us?

496
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,674
Winner tells the doctors,
the loser tells the nurses.

497
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,759
Chief, that's not…

498
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,945
What's up?

499
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,328
What are you talking about?

500
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,416
This is unacceptable.

501
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,086
I treat over 100 patients a day.

502
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:59,006
Even when I got hit by drunk patients

503
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,218
and molested, I hung in there.

504
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,224
Working in the ER was the toughest.

505
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,310
My legs felt like they'd break,

506
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,937
and patients screamed
about having to wait.

507
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,107
And this is what we get?

508
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,235
-Is it, doctor?
-Please say something.

509
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:23,780
I've heard of public universities
sending department chiefs to rural areas,

510
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,240
but how is this…

511
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,533
To be honest,

512
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:30,746
I feel like they just slapped me across
the face and knocked some sense into me.

513
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,625
We're part of the hospital staff anyway,
so we can just switch departments

514
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,959
or quit.

515
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,128
We can get a job elsewhere, but still--

516
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,422
Taking the patient to the ER.

517
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,223
He came in on Monday
as an outpatient for HCC.

518
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,599
-Okay.
-He also has hepatitis C.

519
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:53,227
He's in and out of consciousness,
but he responds to pain stimuli.

520
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,562
-Okay. Let me see his file.
-Okay.

521
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,232
This way.

522
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,237
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

523
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,199
BP is 100/60. HR is 100. Saturation is 95.

524
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:09,368
-Administer two liters of oxygen.
-Okay.

525
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,078
Sir, could you open your eyes?

526
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,288
Tell me if you feel pain.

527
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,457
Okay.

528
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,339
-Let's drain the abdominal fluid first.
-Okay.

529
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:33,892
-Did it go in?
-Yes.

530
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,460
You can get a job somewhere else, right?

531
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,297
Can he?

532
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:08,760
What about them?

533
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,596
Hundreds come in every night.

534
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:12,431
Where will they go?

535
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,727
Another hospital will take them in.
They won't end up on the street, right?

536
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,400
Then what will happen to us?

537
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,110
Should all of us go to another school

538
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:26,486
to finish our training?

539
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,323
Don't you know why patients prefer
university hospitals?

540
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,742
I get that we should improve access
to care in those areas,

541
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,536
but how could a university hospital
not have an ER?

542
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,206
Listen. They're not getting rid of it.

543
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,211
Why do you think we decided to train here?

544
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,672
Why would anyone apply
for an Emergency Medicine internship here?

545
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,174
Maybe we should go on strike.

546
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,384
It's not a maybe. We definitely should.

547
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,470
We should do much worse!

548
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,182
Are the higher-ups out of their minds?
How could they do this?

549
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,595
You haven't been home for days.

550
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,389
You're right.

551
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,386
One, two.

552
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,140
He can take care of himself.
He doesn't need me.

553
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,812
I know he can.

554
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,274
But that doesn't mean
he can be completely alone.

555
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,195
What if you really have to go
to Gangwon-do and leave Seon-woo alone?

556
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,114
What else?

557
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:18,617
We'll just live our own lives.

558
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,163
Seon-woo.

559
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,959
Did you go
to the director's funeral today?

560
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,211
I did.

561
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,964
You came to the hospital today?

562
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,509
You should've told me.

563
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,718
Why bother?

564
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,179
Why not?

565
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,098
Forget it.

566
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,184
You punk.

567
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,770
I saw No-eul.

568
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,772
She came down to the funeral hall.

569
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:51,358
I see. That's why she talked about you.

570
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,193
She did? What about me?

571
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,200
Forget it.

572
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,744
What did she say?

573
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,080
Hey!

574
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,726
Was I mistaken?

575
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,565
Director Lee would never do such a thing.

576
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,067
He's not someone
who would embezzle public funds.

577
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:35,694
There's no way.

578
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,990
Do you think
if I had not said anything to you,

579
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,199
Director Lee…

580
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:44,995
would not have…

581
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,790
died like that?

582
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,753
-What did we do?
-Not you. Me.

583
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,342
Why did he have a heart attack that night?

584
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,094
You were not mistaken.

585
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,804
He asked me how I found out

586
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,098
and who told me.

587
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,146
That was his first response
when I asked him about it.

588
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:12,731
What did you ask him?

589
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,151
I asked him how long he thought
he could hide it.

590
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,862
I asked him if he thought
no one would find out.

591
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,493
He should've asked me
what I was talking about.

592
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,705
He should've scolded me

593
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:33,209
for barging into his office
and being rude to him.

594
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,463
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?

595
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:38,673
How… How did you…

596
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,800
Who told you?

597
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,889
Hey. Jin-woo. That's not it.

598
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,642
It wasn't just me who tried to hide…

599
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:49,809
Jin-woo!

600
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:54,564
I've trusted you all my life.

601
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,572
And then?

602
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,699
What do you think?

603
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,453
I just yelled at him and left
before he could disappoint me more.

604
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:17,379
Did you say that to him?

605
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,547
That he disappointed you?

606
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,806
I need to look into it.

607
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,017
He would never do such a thing.

608
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,063
He admitted to it.
What is there to look into?

609
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,649
Don't waste your time on nonsense
and do your job.

610
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,486
I do my job just fine. Don't worry.

611
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,536
Should I close the door?

612
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,496
I'll do it myself!

613
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,858
Are there a lot of people?

614
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,859
Not yet.

615
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,695
Regarding Naksan Medical Center…

616
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,073
How are things there?

617
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,574
What do you mean?

618
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,743
Do they have any financial
or operational issues?

619
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,703
What nonsense is that? How would I know?

620
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,872
Why is that nonsense?

621
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,792
They wouldn't have sent
three of our departments there

622
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,252
without telling you about those things.

623
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,046
Then why did they call in
the acting director

624
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,506
first thing in the morning?

625
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,718
Yesterday morning,

626
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,347
you came straight to work from your home.

627
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,559
You did not stop by anywhere

628
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:38,645
on the way.

629
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,691
Why did you lie?

630
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,778
What bullshit is that?

631
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,489
How dare you suspect me?

632
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,787
If you keep this up,
I'll have to talk to the police.

633
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,330
What did you say?

634
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,083
If I keep what up?

635
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:03,545
You'll tell the police
that I came straight to work?

636
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,421
Then what would they say?

637
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,215
Do you think they'd even care?

638
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,264
A person died in your house.

639
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,725
You two had an argument.

640
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,645
But you told the police
that Director Lee went to your house

641
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,314
to have a drink with you that night.

642
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,442
If the police hear this,

643
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:27,360
would they really not care at all?

644
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,448
-We didn't have an argument.
-There was a witness.

645
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,782
I said we didn't.

646
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,534
It wasn't an argument. I just…

647
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,413
gave him a lesson.

648
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:43,668
Ye Jin-woo. Listen carefully.

649
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,003
The police?

650
00:57:45,753 --> 00:57:46,796
Go ahead.

651
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,424
But if you do,

652
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,385
you'll have to expose
what the director was up to as well.

653
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:55,722
I've got nothing to lose.

654
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,602
But I bet what you are trying to do
will shatter the reputation

655
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,938
of Director Lee,
who was a well-respected man.

656
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,232
Just know that.

657
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:09,402
I'm trying hard to keep quiet

658
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,864
in honor of the deceased.

659
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,953
Ignorance is bliss.

660
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,414
If you care so much about his honor,

661
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,417
how could you destroy the hospital
he worked hard to protect

662
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,377
as soon as he passed away?

663
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,255
You asshole. Look who's talking.

664
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:31,633
You are not the one to blame me for that.

665
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,470
Your department is always in the red.
Don't you know who made it up for you?

666
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:39,098
The ER can accept any patient.
It ends there for you,

667
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,894
but other departments suffer so much loss
because of the patients you send up.

668
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,187
You count that…

669
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,272
as losses?

670
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,234
Why must I operate all day long
and hurt my back

671
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,985
to make up for your deficits?

672
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:54,572
Your department would've been long gone
if it weren't an essential department.

673
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,408
I know that you perform
a lot of surgeries.

674
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,410
And that you're popular.

675
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:01,204
What do you mean?

676
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,123
Why? Is there a problem with my saying
that the Chief of Orthopedics

677
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,291
performs a lot of surgeries?

678
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,877
You punk.

679
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,097
CHIEF OH

680
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,766
Hey. What's up?

681
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:23,851
Okay.

682
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,319
What?

683
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:38,009
Thank you all for coming
amidst your busy schedule.

684
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:41,220
I'm sure you know why we're here,
so I'll pass on that.

685
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,556
First, we need to discuss

686
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,643
how to resolve the situation nicely.

687
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,395
You can't look for something nice.

688
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,439
We should be raging a war.

689
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,399
This happened

690
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:57,320
because the school foundation
was sold to a corporation.

691
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,238
What's the point in bringing that up now?

692
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:02,158
You should've protested back then.

693
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,869
It's the Ministry's order. What can we do?

694
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,914
Public officials don't know
how to do anything

695
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:11,501
other than sit at their desks
and squeeze doctors dry.

696
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:13,753
Public officials aren't the problem.

697
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,213
Our management is the problem.

698
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,507
I knew it ever since they got rid of
the foundation chair

699
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,133
and appointed a president.

700
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,719
I heard he used to be the president
of a logistics company.

701
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,013
He may be an experienced businessman,

702
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:25,932
but he knows nothing
about how things work here.

703
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,184
He doesn't have a say
in the higher-ups' decisions.

704
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:31,437
He doesn't know this business or have
any connections in relevant offices.

705
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,564
I'm sure the Ministry of Health
and Welfare knew that.

706
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,818
"Hey. Sangkook University Hospital
got a clueless president.

707
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,320
Let's send them to the rural areas.
They're an easy target."

708
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,738
What does Naksan say?

709
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,241
They should be kissing our feet.

710
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,201
That's not what I heard.

711
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:50,748
Naksan only heard that we were going.

712
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:53,459
Other than that, they know nothing
about it.

713
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,545
As expected, Dr. Joo knows

714
01:01:56,629 --> 01:01:58,005
a lot about rural hospitals.

715
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:01,676
That's irrelevant. Chief Lee is correct.

716
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:03,928
He didn't even go to medical school.

717
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,765
We should've fought back when they said
they'd send some expert CEO.

718
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,183
They appointed a CEO

719
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,311
because they consider us a department
within their corporation.

720
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,981
I ask you all.
Are we running a business here?

721
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,984
This is all because of
the current reimbursement standard.

722
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,278
Why are you bringing that up here?

723
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,029
If they paid more,

724
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,115
OB-GYN and Pediatrics

725
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:27,368
would've done fine there too.
They wouldn't have gotten rid of them.

726
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,413
Listen. No matter what we do,

727
01:02:30,496 --> 01:02:32,832
the president won't even bat an eye.

728
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,711
Let me ask you this. Do you really think
a for-profit corporation

729
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:39,088
was so enthusiastic about education

730
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,673
that it had to acquire a university?

731
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:44,677
That's right. This is…

732
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,888
just the beginning.

733
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:49,223
Do you want one?

734
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:51,142
No, thank you.

735
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,772
I got this from abroad.

736
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,191
We all agree that there's a problem
with the standard,

737
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,109
but that problem
lies in the national policy.

738
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:01,986
What we--

739
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,162
Gosh. So many of you came.

740
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,082
Then who's tending to the patients?

741
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,501
We left enough on the floor.

742
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,586
I see.

743
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,713
Go on.

744
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,098
Aren't you here to discuss the surgery?

745
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,605
What surgery do you mean?

746
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,734
The surgery to heal Korea
from its illness.

747
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,404
I heard that our doctors,
who swore to set aside

748
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:11,324
race, religion, and social status

749
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:13,910
and to abide by
their duties toward patients,

750
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:17,038
had gathered to discuss their willingness
to go to the remote areas

751
01:05:17,121 --> 01:05:18,539
of our country to help patients.

752
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:21,459
Why don't you begin?

753
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,640
How did they get this?

754
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,058
Could it be

755
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:21,727
that the late hospital director
gave the documents to someone here?

756
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,479
I'll do whatever it takes,
even if it means

757
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,147
that I have to appeal to the board

758
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,149
or get the media
and other organizations involved,

759
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:30,444
to let the world know that you see
this hospital only as a profit center.

760
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,739
If the structure affects profitability
negatively, we should change it.

761
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,574
"That's how it is"? That is not an answer.

762
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:37,743
Where do you get the authority
to send away 15,000 people

763
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,704
and disperse them...

764
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,081
to distant hospitals?

765
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,083
If the ER is gone,
there will be no patients.

766
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:46,460
You won't have to take in

767
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,088
the homeless patients
and non-paying patients anymore.

768
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,214
What did the hospital do

769
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:52,299
that made them volunteer
to relocate their doctors?

770
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,260
Do you know how things are
in other departments?

771
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,137
They're all calculating already.

772
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:58,931
Some say they should band together
and oppose the decision,

773
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,351
and others suggest giving in as it'd be
impossible to overturn the decision.

774
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,229
He wasn't here to listen.
He came to make an announcement.

775
01:07:05,312 --> 01:07:07,273
What if we really end up going?

776
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,025
Let's do the best we can.

777
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:11,861
The young president is overly ambitious.

778
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:13,738
You are sure that you and I

779
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:15,781
are the only ones here
who know about it, right?

780
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:19,285
Yes. You and I are the only ones who know.

781
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:25,458
