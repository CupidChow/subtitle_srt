1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,306
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,266
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,438
EPISODE 9

4
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,711
You're Jin-woo's brother, right?

5
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,672
Sorry?

6
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,382
Yes.

7
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,265
Here.

8
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,228
See you around.

9
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:49,943
Let's go.

10
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,703
CHOCOLATE MILK

11
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:03,706
Hi, Seon-woo.

12
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,250
You're here early.

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,460
Are you going to the concert?

14
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,461
Of course.

15
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,255
Me, too. Let's go together.

16
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,113
I wanted to tell you.

17
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,784
I hoped one day,
you'd understand how I feel,

18
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,663
at least once.

19
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,974
I thought it would pass, but it didn't.

20
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,854
I told myself it was fine
even if nothing came of it,

21
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,320
but I was wrong.

22
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,116
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,752
Seon-woo.

24
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,497
Do something for me.

25
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,583
Let me go first.

26
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,752
Please come out after I've gone.

27
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:14,754
Don't be like that.

28
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,673
You can do that much for me.

29
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,634
Let me go first.

30
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,698
Are you going home?

31
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,628
This needs to be collapsed.

32
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,338
I know. I have lots of experience,

33
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,924
although it didn't look like this one.

34
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,092
There.

35
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,514
Okay.

36
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,270
There we go.

37
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,615
My father, in his final years…

38
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,408
I'll stop there.

39
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,083
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

40
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,293
Okay, then. We're off.

41
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,899
It must be a hassle
getting to and from work every day.

42
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,067
How do you commute?

43
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,027
Well…

44
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,822
I'm getting a car modified for me.

45
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,241
Oh, so you drive.

46
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,534
That's good.

47
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,618
Yes.

48
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,831
Thank you for the ride.

49
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,001
The pleasure is mine. I get to have
a handsome man next to me.

50
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,838
Hold on. Is it considered rude
to say such things nowadays?

51
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,152
Why is this station so boring?

52
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,140
SAEGEUL21

53
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,361
Something urgent…

54
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,613
came up earlier--

55
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,697
Hello.

56
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,410
Were you in the area?

57
00:08:58,412 --> 00:08:59,664
Yes.

58
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,542
I see.

59
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,170
Something urgent came up…

60
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,756
I'm sorry.

61
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,425
Have you eaten yet?

62
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,303
Well…

63
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,118
This is for DNA research?

64
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,828
That's what the Speaker reported

65
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,580
and requested compensation for.

66
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,794
Thioctic acid and Fursultamin injection.

67
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,880
"Once a week for two months without fail."

68
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,967
This isn't for DNA research.
This is for dermatology.

69
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,554
Was it for his wife or family member?

70
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,849
We looked into it,

71
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,518
and he was at public events
during those times.

72
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,353
What happens now?

73
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:08,649
We have to find out where his wife was
at the time of the treatments.

74
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,693
If the timeline matches,
I'll write about it.

75
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,781
Do you not care about the consequences?

76
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,950
He's the Speaker. Aren't you scared?

77
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,453
Are you scared when you enter the OR?

78
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,583
I work in the ER, so there's no time
to be afraid.

79
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,502
Same here. It's too hectic.

80
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,016
But your news agency covers
more sensitive topics.

81
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,437
Only Saegeul21 reported on how the heirs
of our foundation evaded military duty.

82
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,147
You mean Hwajeong Group?

83
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,567
That's why we were formed.

84
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,864
Though I can't really tell
if we're a thorn

85
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,616
in the upper class' side.

86
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,955
You can't ignore a thorn in your side.

87
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,124
It may cause an infection.

88
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,586
I mean it. It can get serious.

89
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,963
The infection can spread--

90
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,689
You came to the hospital earlier, right?

91
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,528
Aren't you angry?

92
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,613
How can I get angry at a source?

93
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,036
A source…

94
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,500
Did you wait long?

95
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,089
I figured something happened,
like last time.

96
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,259
You must've waited long.

97
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,554
No. I didn't stay that long.

98
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,435
When I first started,
I had to cancel on my boyfriend

99
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,395
whenever there was breaking news.

100
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,650
Boyfriend, I see.

101
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,945
So, you should be good
to your girlfriend when you can.

102
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,780
Otherwise, you'll get dumped like I was.

103
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,494
I don't have a girlfriend.

104
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,081
You're saying that so proudly,
as if it's a good thing.

105
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,250
I know.

106
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,503
You keep smiling today.

107
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,755
Did you have a good day?

108
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,801
Come to think of it, it was good.

109
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,513
It's been a while

110
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,142
since I ate with someone else
outside of the hospital.

111
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,104
We should've gone somewhere nicer.

112
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:55,316
This is nice. It's nice here.
And delicious.

113
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,696
Next time--

114
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,888
You must be tired. We're almost done.

115
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,100
Okay. Next patient, Jung Ye-seul.

116
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,728
She has varicose veins.

117
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,024
I'll do it, Dr. Joo.

118
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,944
I can't avoid
varicose vein surgeries forever.

119
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:44,990
Okay.

120
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,329
-Dr. Joo.
-Next is…

121
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,331
Did you talk to Anesthesiology about

122
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,167
-the chronic aortic dissection?
-For now, we've scheduled it for 11 a.m.

123
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,086
We'll check again tomorrow morning.

124
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,630
We'll do a briefing an hour before.
Notify the staff.

125
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,923
-Okay.
-Okay.

126
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,177
-Dr. Joo.
-Yes? What?

127
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,474
Why is he giving him false hope?

128
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,352
I know. It's not like just anyone
can take that position.

129
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,772
Why is he egging the chief on
when he's not even interested in running?

130
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,942
But to be honest,
if only he had graduated from our school--

131
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,486
It's not just an "if only" matter.
That's the biggest factor.

132
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,574
I'm overwhelmed as it is. I'm exhausted.

133
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,160
Plus, I'm not the kind of person
who's fit to take on that role.

134
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,538
If you become the director,
you can hire more doctors.

135
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,374
Then you'll have more free time.

136
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,920
I'm not asking you to run
in order to back our department.

137
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,090
I wouldn't have mentioned this
if you didn't stand a chance.

138
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:49,305
I don't mean to offend you, but
the other chiefs aren't threatened by you.

139
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,973
A person like the deputy director?

140
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,059
Plenty hate people like him who are
affiliated with this place. You never know

141
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,728
what will happen if you run.

142
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:59,899
You know very well
why they aren't threatened by me.

143
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,317
And that's my critical weakness.

144
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,612
Dr. Joo, there's something
I really want to ask you.

145
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,531
Do you really not want it?

146
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,912
Don't you want

147
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,789
to become the director
and lead this hospital

148
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,667
in the slightest?

149
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,722
I'll work on hiring more doctors
after the election.

150
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,225
Yes, sir.

151
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,066
I'm sorry that I'm not powerful enough
to be of much help to you all.

152
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,360
You don't become powerful
by doing nothing.

153
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,113
You need to abuse the people below you.

154
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,866
We're too comfortable right now.

155
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,743
You have really muscular arms.

156
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,120
That's so cool. You're awesome.

157
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,458
Thank you for the ride, Ms. Kang.

158
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,001
Sure. You should head inside.

159
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,712
Sleep well.

160
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,381
Get home safely.

161
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,526
SUPREME COURT RULINGS
ON MEDICAL MALPRACTICE

162
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,342
What are you doing?

163
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,012
Hi, Nighty.

164
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,890
Are you hot?

165
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,170
-Good morning.
-Hi.

166
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,176
We have toast.

167
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,934
Your mom got those.

168
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,853
On her way back from
the hospital yesterday.

169
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,946
Tell the housekeeper to make
some side dishes today.

170
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,907
We have a stack of side dishes
in the fridge.

171
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,117
I kept telling you to eat them.

172
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:48,121
Must I prepare everything
and serve them to you at this age?

173
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,753
He must be all better now.

174
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,256
I should take him back.

175
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,133
Do whatever you want.

176
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,761
You heartless punk.

177
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,514
What kind of a name is Nighty?

178
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,308
It sounds so gloomy.
Morning would've been better.

179
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,894
The vet was
singing your praises yesterday.

180
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,401
It's not like he knows me.

181
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,862
It's probably because I said
I'll open a veterinary center.

182
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,073
At first, I was worried about you
working at a hospital.

183
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,157
It's not that bad, right?

184
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:34,084
It's 100 times better than
dealing with the everyday hassles

185
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,753
that happen because of the cargo trucks.

186
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,173
Plus, we can get free checkups.

187
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,300
Sure.

188
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:45,053
Of course. It's much better than dealing
with transportation business companies.

189
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,556
And I bet the people you work with now
are more well-mannered.

190
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,890
That looks good.

191
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:50,726
It's delicious.

192
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,528
It's hard to chew.

193
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,992
I realized the HIRA is quite flexible.

194
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,703
I heard you gave insurance companies

195
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,456
patients' medical history data for a fee,

196
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,583
even if it isn't for educational
research purposes.

197
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,670
What type of flexibility do you hope for
when you say that?

198
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,759
Let's keep the deputy director's matter
out of the news.

199
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,469
We can't silence the press.

200
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,429
We can handle it quietly, though.

201
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,931
I'm asking you to be discreet,
not to cover it up.

202
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,308
I need to report it, though.

203
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,353
Go ahead then.
I can't stop you from doing that, can I?

204
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,688
However,

205
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,651
you said so yourself, that only the person
casting the stone will change,

206
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,028
and that it'll soon be forgotten.

207
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,238
I also said I must do it nonetheless.

208
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,742
Let's say the details of the Orthopedics
Center are revealed to the public.

209
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,161
What is the benefit of announcing that?

210
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,080
The patients will be given a choice.

211
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,208
The right to avoid a hospital
with a doctor

212
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,503
that entrusted a patient's knee
to someone unauthorized

213
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:00,462
to be in the OR.

214
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,757
What if that doctor is no longer
with this hospital?

215
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,888
These types of surgeries still occur

216
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,015
because the penalty isn't severe enough.

217
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,976
At most, their license is suspended
for a few months. But, you're saying…

218
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,729
you'll fire someone
who is a deputy director?

219
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,899
Well, does his title matter?

220
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,609
Based on my experience, always.

221
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,028
Then he'll have to leave voluntarily.

222
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,404
What about taking legal action?

223
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,782
That comes after
he has left Sangkook Hospital.

224
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,117
I'm concerned about

225
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,663
whether this hospital's name
is dragged through the mud again

226
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,705
or not.

227
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,582
Let's go with the latter.

228
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,505
I thought this happened in Busan, too.

229
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,257
You should deal with them first.

230
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,677
The surgery was done in this hospital's
operating room. It's the evidence.

231
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,179
Regardless of when it is reported
or when the press gets to it,

232
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,390
you can't avoid
Sangkook being associated with it.

233
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:54,933
That will be

234
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,519
after we've taken
internal disciplinary action

235
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,688
and removed the problematic doctor.

236
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,774
I'm not asking you to turn a blind eye.
We just need to take some measures.

237
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,609
Please give us some time.

238
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,071
Why won't you play your hand?

239
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,034
I'm sure you know that
we can request an exemption

240
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,369
from certain assignments.

241
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,749
It's to avoid the investigator
from not thoroughly fulfilling their duty

242
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:22,252
because their family works at
the hospital being investigated.

243
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,422
And also, just in case the investigator
gets threatened

244
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,341
that their family members
will be harassed.

245
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,887
But you're asking me nicely.

246
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,140
Yes. It's a sincere request.

247
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,354
I also have a favor to ask.

248
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,359
When we found out that our organization
sold patient data,

249
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,321
it came as a shock to the employees.

250
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,906
That's when I realized,

251
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,368
that the attitude of the higher-ups
is very important.

252
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,706
By now, I'm sure you know from experience
that doctors will never

253
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,333
step up or get involved in such matters.

254
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,294
The deputy director can easily
threaten his subordinates for speaking up.

255
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,754
If you overlook this,

256
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,590
no one will ever say anything
about anything going forward.

257
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,467
Please create an environment

258
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,053
where it isn't squealing,

259
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,681
or betraying colleagues, but rather,
where it's a given to point out a wrong.

260
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,268
Don't you think by establishing
that kind of environment,

261
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,103
there will be fewer accidents
in the future?

262
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,361
Change the hospital culture.
That's what you're saying I should do?

263
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,822
I think you are
very much capable of doing so.

264
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,911
You don't seem to know me very well.

265
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,915
Sangkook is the subject
of our investigation,

266
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,334
and I can't ignore the fact that
it's my brother's workplace.

267
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:48,588
When I heard that the hospital was getting
a nondoctor president for the first time,

268
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,342
I looked you up online
like others probably did.

269
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:56,263
Youngest person to become the president
who isn't part of the owner's family.

270
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,265
That's all I saw at first,

271
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,809
so, at the time, I thought

272
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,561
you must be a genius.

273
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,771
"At the time"?

274
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,192
When you saw me,
you realized I was no genius?

275
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,405
I realized that you put in…

276
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,199
a lot of effort.

277
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,618
I could see that.

278
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,999
The reason I smiled when we talked about
compartment syndrome last time

279
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,251
wasn't because you acted like you knew,

280
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,962
but because I could tell
you were knowledgeable.

281
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,214
You already knew
what our organization does,

282
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,717
when the general public
doesn't even know exists.

283
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,846
If I look forward to where

284
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,558
you're going to exert your efforts,

285
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,102
will I be disappointed?

286
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,821
About buying more time…

287
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,286
I'll give you as much time as I can.

288
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,497
Okay. I'll deal with the higher-ups.

289
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,208
I'll notify you as soon as I get rid of
Deputy Director Kim Tae-sang.

290
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,753
Does that mean

291
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:13,006
your on-site investigation

292
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,883
is now over? Yes, right?

293
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,051
No.

294
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,180
I'm still gathering data on
unnecessary surgeries.

295
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,059
Goodness. Deputy Director Kim
is in trouble.

296
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,021
Mr. Ye.

297
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,022
Yes?

298
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,941
Do you want to join our Restructure Team?

299
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,486
We desperately need someone
knowledgeable about what doctors do.

300
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,656
Will this be okay?

301
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,284
What about it?

302
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,874
Thank you for your time.

303
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,729
Are you leaving now?

304
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,980
Hello.

305
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,192
By the way,
Mr. Lee told me that you eat alone.

306
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,693
Why do you do that?

307
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,695
We always do that during investigations.

308
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,948
The hospital people hate us.

309
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,074
Those damn people.

310
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,161
Want to eat with me? It'll be my treat.

311
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,040
I can't let someone from the hospital
buy me food.

312
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,042
I'm not with the hospital.

313
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,128
I'll go to your office later.

314
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:34,546
Okay.

315
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,808
He's smiling today.

316
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,485
-Hey, Ms. Kang.
-Yes?

317
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,321
Let's announce the cutback on
the probationary nurses' starting salary.

318
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,573
Already?

319
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,200
Let's do it while things are chaotic here,

320
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,369
and the higher-ups are distracted.

321
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,706
What's the starting salary
at other hospitals?

322
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,292
Most nurses undergo four weeks of training

323
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,169
and a three-month probationary period.

324
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,879
The four weeks are unpaid.

325
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,006
During the probationary period,
they get minimum wage.

326
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,176
Then we won't have
a separate probationary period.

327
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,344
Increase training to three months,

328
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,889
at 420,000 won per month.

329
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,309
The same for MRI technicians
and other engineers.

330
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,727
Yes, sir.

331
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,104
This just came from
the administration office.

332
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,489
They're nasty, too.

333
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,199
They're no different from
corporate people.

334
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,617
The deputy director

335
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,078
wasn't the sole candidate because
people respected him so much.

336
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,789
They were all waiting for an opportunity.

337
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:55,084
They're rising up
as soon as they see an opening.

338
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,713
Let's make an announcement.

339
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,714
Okay.

340
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,301
First. Deputy Director Kim Tae-sang
is suspended indefinitely.

341
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:06,471
He shall be excluded from surgeries,
consultations, and all hospital affairs.

342
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:09,307
He must go to each patient
and apologize in person,

343
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,017
and refund the medical fees.

344
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,353
Do you think he'll do it? With his temper?

345
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,896
Apologize in person?

346
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,483
I don't want him to.
He needs to refuse and break.

347
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,026
Next.

348
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,362
Damn it.

349
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,949
With the entrance of Dr. Oh Se-hwa
and Dr. Lee Sang-yeop

350
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,494
into the hospital director election,
it is no longer uncontested.

351
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,831
NOTICE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

352
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,123
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

353
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,209
This way.

354
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,047
One, two, three.

355
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,930
Apparently, he didn't respond
way past checkout.

356
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,099
He checked in at dawn,
so six hours must have passed.

357
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,519
Alcohol.

358
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,646
This too.

359
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,524
-Where's the pharmacy receipt?
-We couldn't find one.

360
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,403
His pulse is dropping.

361
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,904
Administer 1L of saline solution.

362
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,905
Okay.

363
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,669
Lorazepam.

364
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,059
What do you think?

365
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,812
Well…

366
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,570
Your classmates are all moving forward.
What are you doing?

367
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,491
I don't have many classmates left.

368
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,492
What do you mean?

369
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,077
The Cancer Center.

370
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:56,039
My classmate and the chief resident
became the scapegoat

371
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,916
and are packing their things.

372
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,170
Even the chief resident?
They fired Seung-hun too?

373
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,130
Chief Lee told him to leave,

374
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,299
while he didn't take any of the blame.

375
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,012
I taught Seung-hun when he was an intern.

376
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,932
He was a hard worker.

377
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,935
We finished pumping his stomach.

378
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,650
Zolpidem?

379
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,236
Continue.

380
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,947
Where are you going?

381
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,864
Dr. Ye.

382
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,171
What do you think?

383
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,393
Seung-hun.

384
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,398
Dr. Ye.

385
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,984
Let's go.

386
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,652
I'll go this way.

387
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,487
Go through the front door.

388
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,657
You devoted five years of your youth here.

389
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,494
I'll walk you.

390
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,297
You'll soon be treating patients again,

391
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,718
and people will forget about
what happened.

392
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,265
But you must remember it
for the rest of your life.

393
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,393
Yes, sir.

394
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,647
Even if the hospital director
covered it up and said to keep quiet,

395
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:48,192
it doesn't mean you're not responsible
for neglecting your supervising duties.

396
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,157
It also doesn't mean
you can't be a good doctor.

397
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,284
Don't give up on that, either.

398
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,627
What?

399
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,505
Are the attorneys there?

400
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,966
Yes. The entire Brain Death Committee
is present.

401
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,678
I can't go in since she's my patient,
so I'll introduce you and leave.

402
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,639
How long must we do this?
It's so cumbersome.

403
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:22,518
It's determining if someone is brain-dead,
but I guess it's cumbersome to some.

404
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,563
You said it was a bother as well.

405
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,857
We already ran multiple brainwave scans.

406
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,484
What will this change?

407
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,486
It's not like we're examining the patient.

408
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,613
We're deciding based on the test results.

409
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,697
It's just a formality!

410
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,200
And if we wait too long,
the organs get damaged.

411
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,451
Exactly.

412
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,245
If everything is so cumbersome,
how will you do anything else?

413
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,153
You think the world is your oyster now,
don't you?

414
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,948
How did you hold it in all this time?

415
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,743
How could you guys…

416
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,704
We should band together and fight,
but instead--

417
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,872
What's the problem?

418
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,375
You should've done better, then.

419
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,839
Right, you should've done better.

420
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,758
What right do you have?
What were you thinking?

421
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,844
You dragged the police in here,

422
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,847
and turned the hospital upside down
not long ago.

423
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,474
I'd be too ashamed to even face
the other doctors.

424
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,018
How are you so audacious?

425
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,312
Was that my fault? Did I give the shot?

426
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,689
You think I have a thousand eyes?

427
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,732
I have only one body.

428
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,152
How can I monitor every little thing
and chase them around?

429
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,737
They made the mess and came to me.
What was I to do?

430
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,031
How can you handle being a director, then?

431
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,950
Why didn't you know?
You're the deputy director.

432
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,370
If I should know everything happening
in my department, you should know

433
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,998
-everything that happens at the hospital.
-You're both the same!

434
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,666
You should both be thinking of resigning.

435
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,419
Why should I resign?
My patient is alive and well.

436
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,171
How dare you compare me to him?

437
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,464
I'm the one who's offended.

438
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,633
Mine was an accident,
but yours was intentional.

439
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm saying this out of experience.

440
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,431
Do you think I slept peacefully at night?

441
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,224
Do you think I don't pity my guys?

442
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:28,269
It's because I know why this happened.
I've been through it.

443
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,562
I did it to make things better.

444
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,398
I'm not trying to be director
because I'm brazen,

445
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,233
but because I'm so frustrated.

446
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,776
So I can bring change.

447
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,486
Because I feel the need for it.

448
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,114
If you were so frustrated,
you should've spoken up

449
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,241
when the director said to bury it.

450
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,995
What if people find out that a candidate
for director hid an accidental death?

451
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,455
They'd mock us.

452
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,456
What could I have done?

453
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,459
Would you have told the truth even
if the director said to shut up about it?

454
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,668
Would you have defied him?

455
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,255
Dr. Lee. You're evading the subject.

456
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,133
The point is what happened
at the Cancer Center,

457
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,136
and what your role was in it!

458
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,014
Not what the director said!

459
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,850
If you want to hear my answer nonetheless,

460
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,229
I'd never have anyone tell me to shut up
in the first place

461
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,147
since I never cause trouble!

462
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,740
It was you.

463
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,534
You reported me, didn't you?

464
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,579
You ratted me out to the HIRA, didn't you?

465
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,373
What? What was that?

466
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,418
I'm the one who made you chief
of your department.

467
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,421
But you betrayed me.

468
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,258
Se-hwa. It was you!

469
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,843
Of all the…

470
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,137
You're just randomly picking on people,
aren't you?

471
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,597
This is ridiculous.

472
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,724
How could you do that, Dr. Oh?

473
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,811
Did you really report it?

474
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,366
Dr. Lee Sang-yeop.

475
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,910
The Cancer Center medication error.

476
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,247
Did you really tell
Director Lee Bo-hun about it?

477
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,793
What the… Why are you butting in
all of a sudden?

478
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,046
Did you?

479
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,384
Dr. Lee told us himself.

480
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,719
To keep our mouths shut.

481
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,054
He said

482
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,016
no one outside of
the Cancer Center must find out.

483
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,520
After saying that himself,
would he have really told the director?

484
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,817
What is this piece of shit babbling?

485
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,569
When the director fell to his death…

486
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,161
Did he know…

487
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,291
that Choi Do-hyeong died because
the Cancer Center administered

488
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,337
an intravenous injection into the spine?

489
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,966
And did Director Lee pass away

490
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,635
knowing all of that?

491
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,691
I did report it. Are you satisfied now?

492
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,419
Dr. Joo. Dr. Ye is here.

493
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,799
It's done. Finish up.

494
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,019
Are you here to see me?

495
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,319
What?

496
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,196
What is it, Dr. Ye?

497
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,544
Hi, Jin-woo. What is it?

498
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,214
Director Lee.

499
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:14,263
What is it? You can tell me anything.

500
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,933
This won't do.

501
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,153
Please be our director.

502
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,573
You can't avoid it.

503
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,075
Don't just say you're worried.

504
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,911
Please step in before our hospital…

505
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,830
gets any worse.

506
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,123
Please show us your courage.

507
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,292
Dr. Ye.

508
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,919
You can do it.

509
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,922
If you feel any sense of responsibility,
you can't ignore it.

510
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,840
You are

511
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,718
our only alternative.

512
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,429
Many people will oppose.

513
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,390
Was there no opposition
when you first came here as a chief?

514
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,060
The director was here back then.

515
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,937
Why do you think
he shunned all of his alumni,

516
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,272
went against all the opposition,

517
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,192
and selected you from that remote
medical center,

518
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,736
and insisted on making you
the chief of your department?

519
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,782
Even if I win the election,

520
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,327
Mr. Gu won't approve of me.

521
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,997
Why are you worrying about that already?

522
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,043
Dr. Ye. The vote is in two days.

523
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,337
-It isn't too late.
-It isn't too late.

524
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,634
I'll prepare the presentation for you.

525
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,052
I will as well.

526
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,474
Are you done?

527
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,352
Yes. I thought you'd want to see
before we close it up.

528
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,693
Will you flee again?

529
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:53,821
Like you ran away from the medical center?

530
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,036
Where will you hide this time?

531
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,408
Let's not wear each other out.

532
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,911
Right. We shouldn't do that to each other.

533
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,706
It's affecting us both.

534
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,751
Where should I begin?

535
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,298
The use of the subsidiary's donations?

536
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,177
It's a subsidiary in name only.

537
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,929
We made them our supplier
without taking bids.

538
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:04,141
They charge an inflated price,
and disguise the profits

539
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:07,144
they make from us as donations.

540
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,022
But do you think they donated that money
to our hospital?

541
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,151
Or did it go into the chairman's pocket?

542
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,492
Let's do this if this is what you want.

543
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,370
Should I make your job easier

544
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,664
and walk out of here on my own?

545
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,626
Or should I take you down with me?

546
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,338
Shit.

547
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,257
You've got to be joking.

548
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,387
You make it sound like I sucked you dry
and threw you out.

549
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,432
What about what you did?

550
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,561
Have you ever heard of the word "repent"?

551
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,981
What if it went to the chairman?

552
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,861
You'll challenge the chairman
of Hwajeong Group? You'll do that?

553
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,572
I have nothing to lose.

554
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,242
You do have something to lose.

555
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:07,246
Everyone has something
they will cry over after they lose it.

556
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,834
Tae-sang. I'm saying this for you.

557
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:14,253
Conglomerate chairmen

558
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,089
aren't people you want to mess with.

559
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,551
I'm speaking from personal experience.

560
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,852
Furthermore,

561
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,065
you should be worrying about
your own people, not outsiders.

562
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:39,736
You know your trusted confidants
are trying to stab you in the back, right?

563
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,997
Let's see…

564
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,418
to what extent
a conglomerate chairman protects

565
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,170
a salaried president.

566
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,530
I'll revise the subsidiary's donation.

567
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,000
NOTICE REGARDING DISCIPLINARY ACTION

568
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:37,836
"Exclusion from surgeries and
outpatient examinations.

569
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,463
Indefinite suspension."

570
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:43,467
On top of that, he has to
personally apologize to the patients?

571
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,305
This jerk is done for.

572
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,026
The same goes for that jerk.

573
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,869
RESTRICTED AREA

574
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,874
Ours only show drug names
and prescriptions,

575
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,669
but doctors have access to data on
the number of patients for that day,

576
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,712
appointments,
and how many beds are occupied.

577
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,133
This is just a way to pressure them
to take in more patients.

578
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,178
If they enter a drug to prescribe,

579
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,347
they get a pop-up saying
not to use that drug

580
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,558
because it is not covered by insurance.

581
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,351
Then do they change the prescription?

582
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,229
If the pop-up appears, they can't enter
that drug as a prescription,

583
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,814
even if it's the best for the patient.

584
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,942
This happened after
the new president came.

585
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,652
Today, he even announced

586
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,154
that they'll slash the starting salary
of probationary nurses.

587
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,786
I understand what you're getting at,

588
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,580
but there's nothing I can do.

589
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,959
My duty is to assess. Our rule is
not to get involved in operations.

590
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,212
I know you have no authorization
over administration.

591
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,382
But still, you need to know.

592
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:10,178
I don't think this is a problem
limited to Sangkook.

593
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,600
Who would come up here?

594
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,356
You should go first. Let's talk later.

595
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,441
Okay.

596
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,708
Why would you be here with someone
from the HIRA

597
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,793
and talk about things?

598
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,086
Talk about what?

599
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,797
Why did you tell him about
hospital matters? It wouldn't help.

600
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,258
Whom should I tell that would be of help?

601
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,760
Whom did you tell?

602
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,181
You're an executive member of the union.
Did you forget?

603
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,100
We should tell everyone we can.

604
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,437
We need to get everyone on our side.

605
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,857
What's gotten into you lately?

606
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,780
What do you mean?

607
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,233
May I smoke up here?

608
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,863
No, sir. Not anymore.

609
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,699
I see.

610
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,841
Hey.

611
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,595
That's the nurse from
the Emergency Medical Center.

612
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,432
I don't think so.

613
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,310
You could see her face from here?

614
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,645
Why did you want to talk?

615
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,191
Your text.

616
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,109
Oh, that.

617
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,779
They didn't throw fists,
but it was like a dogfight.

618
00:51:13,862 --> 00:51:15,781
They bickered like children,

619
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,033
pointing fingers at each other.

620
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,868
The Cancer Center chief
got hit the hardest.

621
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,661
That's meaningless.

622
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,747
Whether or not he reported it,

623
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,374
the patient died, and he covered it up.

624
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,045
It's humiliating, yes,
but does it change anything?

625
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,129
Still.

626
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,674
Yes, the dead can't talk,
but how can you use them as an excuse?

627
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,677
He shouldn't have blamed someone
who passed away.

628
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,596
Then the only one who is still clean

629
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,182
is Oh Se-hwa.

630
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:44,100
Is that the end of the race for director?

631
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,685
Since two of the three have collapsed.

632
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,145
Is it?

633
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,652
FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION:
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY

634
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,406
Since Dr. Oh is the only one standing,
someone else may jump in, don't you think?

635
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,909
"It's doable. I just have to beat her."

636
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,452
I'd know by now, then.

637
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:03,995
How?

638
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,581
They have to give
a presentation and propose

639
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,250
a development plan to the doctors.

640
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,378
Word would get out
if anyone is preparing that.

641
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,129
People here have big mouths.

642
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:15,632
Anyway,

643
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,676
is smoking really banned here?

644
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,178
Yes.

645
00:52:21,012 --> 00:52:23,056
Because too many people left
cigarette butts behind.

646
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,815
He's a good person. He really is,

647
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:35,610
but we don't pick the director
based on character.

648
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,572
Then what? Is it based on looks?
That works too.

649
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,574
If it were based on looks, I'd win.

650
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,870
He has to act as the focal point
for the hospital.

651
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,288
You think Dr. Joo can do that?

652
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,541
He can, if you say so, Dr. Jang.

653
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,126
If you help him,

654
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,461
Dr. Joo wouldn't ignore that.

655
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,464
In my opinion,

656
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,675
he's just way too docile.

657
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,018
They'll take nominations at the meeting.

658
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:09,769
You can lead the way,

659
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,938
and nominate Dr. Joo.

660
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,774
Did he personally say he'd do it?

661
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,485
You know.

662
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,612
Know what?

663
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,823
It's hard enough even if
he's aggressive about it.

664
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,034
One needs to cover their own ass.

665
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,660
You too.

666
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,581
Everyone's leaning toward Dr. Oh.
Don't get on her bad side.

667
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,708
Let's not become outcasts.

668
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:34,502
Making outcasts, nagging, and bullying…

669
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,047
Don't you think he'd actually
be able to get rid of all of that?

670
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:40,550
I've never seen anyone who didn't graduate
from our school become the director.

671
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:45,931
Chief. To be honest, which director
do you want to work with?

672
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,603
Well… if he really says he'll do it…

673
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,564
-Exactly. That's why--
-You punk.

674
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,108
We have a group of food poisoning patients
pouring in,

675
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,276
and you're here chatting?

676
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,362
A group? What about the lab results?

677
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,073
That's what you need to do now. Get going.

678
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,824
What do you think about
Chief Joo running--

679
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,660
Shut up, you punk.

680
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,287
Hold on. Hey, my arm!

681
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,255
Hey, can you talk?

682
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,134
Are we nominating anyone at the meeting?

683
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:25,762
Dr. Oh Se-hwa?

684
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,639
Are you for her too?

685
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:30,850
Me?

686
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,269
I'm…

687
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,399
Why must it be Dr. Joo?

688
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,777
Why are you for him? What about Dr. Oh?

689
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,447
Are you for Dr. Oh?

690
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:45,448
Yes.

691
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,119
She has the skills, abilities, experience,

692
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,538
trains junior doctors well…
She has it all.

693
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:54,290
She does.

694
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,005
She must be like that to you.

695
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:03,174
She isn't lacking in any way.

696
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,011
I'm sure people
in other departments agree.

697
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:09,055
Does your view on people depend
on their department?

698
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,184
To me, Oh Se-hwa

699
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:16,855
is a person who never once accepted
a single homeless person

700
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,648
or an attempted suicide case
that we sent up.

701
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,152
Ever since she became chief,

702
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,447
we haven't been able to admit
anyone without a guardian.

703
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,199
They sent every single one back.

704
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:34,205
If everyone in the world had social status
and have a killer resume like Dr. Oh,

705
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,959
I'd be all for her
becoming our next director.

706
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,169
No one else compares.

707
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,172
However,

708
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,841
it made me think…

709
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,096
"She considers herself the standard.

710
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,891
If you're slightly inferior,
she'll kick you out."

711
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:58,188
She trains junior doctors well because
she takes just the top few.

712
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,485
I'd prefer our director to be someone
who is respected by everyone.

713
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,454
I don't even know why I'm doing this.

714
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,749
I can't vote anyway,

715
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,542
so why am I talking about it?

716
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,212
Even if you could vote,
it would only be one.

717
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,963
The chiefs get a vote each,

718
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,132
and we get nothing.

719
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,509
Just eat.

720
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,554
I even had a dream about it last night.

721
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:34,182
We had a new director,
so I looked at the person's face,

722
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:36,017
and it was Mr. Gu.

723
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:39,687
But the real Mr. Gu was there, too.
Isn't that funny?

724
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,111
Did you talk to Seon-woo?

725
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:47,946
About what?

726
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:49,906
Just. Everything.

727
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,199
We always talk.

728
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,746
Will that be enough?

729
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,583
You should get Dr. Joo plastered,

730
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,378
and get his thumbprint
on the candidate application.

731
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,213
Want to try talking him into it?

732
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,132
I'm still for Dr. Oh.

733
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,718
But I will think about what you said.

734
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,767
Why you…

735
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,562
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

736
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,658
You can't avoid it.

737
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,661
Don't just say you're worried.

738
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,496
Please step in before our hospital…

739
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,834
gets any worse.
Please show us your courage.

740
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,590
I'm just here to tell you

741
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,260
that I posted the financial statement.

742
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,053
If there are two rebels,

743
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:56,890
I should get rid of them both.
Don't you think?

744
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,517
Go right ahead.

745
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,398
Come in.

746
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,199
Turn on the light.

747
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:23,208
Are you greasing my palm?

748
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,919
-Pardon?
-Do people not say that anymore?

749
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,337
Is that a bribe?

750
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,510
Dr. Joo, would you like to get a drink?

751
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,015
Do you really not want it?

752
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,226
Don't you want

753
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,728
to become the director
and lead this hospital

754
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:46,981
in the slightest?

755
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,611
I thought, not this time.

756
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,863
Not this time? Then…

757
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,406
After Director Lee

758
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,825
suddenly left us like that,

759
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,870
I didn't want to fill his vacancy.

760
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,500
It even bothered me that someone wanted
that title for ten years.

761
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,627
There will always be

762
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,464
things that bother you.
That will not stop.

763
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:13,675
Probably.

764
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,136
And I'll take a step back each time,

765
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,055
and eventually,

766
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:21,766
get pushed out.

767
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,814
I wanted to change everything.

768
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:31,067
It's all such a mess, that I wanted
to give it

769
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,362
a brand-new start at one point.

770
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,700
What about now?

771
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,159
Now?

772
00:59:57,385 --> 01:00:00,555
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN

773
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:03,433
When did you…

774
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,987
Did you run for director
at your alma mater?

775
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,990
I don't need to prepare
a new presentation.

776
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,998
Does that mean you'll run?

777
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,465
It's a different region,
and time has passed,

778
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,593
but the problems are the same.

779
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,179
Nothing has improved.

780
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,098
I just have to change
the name of the university.

781
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,433
Thank you.

782
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,941
I'll just change the style
to a presentation.

783
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,653
And change this…

784
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,535
I don't want to use this.

785
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,371
Why not? Is there a problem?

786
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,666
You used this and lost the election
in Gimhae.

787
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,417
I didn't use it.

788
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,337
I made it, but never got to use it.

789
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,091
That was around the time
Gimhae Medical Center shut down.

790
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,301
Come to think of it,

791
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,137
it was also around the time
he asked me to work with him.

792
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,391
Director Lee?

793
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,490
Is Dr. Yang in surgery?

794
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,534
Maybe he's sleeping. Let him be.

795
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,413
How could you sleep?
You said you'd prepare the material.

796
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,582
Yes, he decided to do it.

797
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,459
Run at the speed of light.

798
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,128
Okay.

799
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,095
Is this a Big Burger?

800
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:05,179
Yes.

801
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,390
It's from Dr. Lee No-eul.

802
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,558
Okay.

803
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,146
I'll be home late. Don't wait up.

804
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,702
Deputy Director Kim
did not withdraw his candidacy.

805
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,662
He just can't seem to back down.

806
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:33,332
The chief of the Cancer Center
won't budge, either.

807
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,418
They're all impressive.

808
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,129
But there is a new option now.

809
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:48,806
As planned, our hospital will perform
one of the kidney transplants.

810
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:52,018
The Organ Transplantation Organization
is coordinating with the other recipient.

811
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,312
Is Dr. Han leading our team?

812
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:55,688
Yes.

813
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,107
We should start heading over.

814
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,778
I thought it was a done deal,
but things have gotten interesting.

815
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,780
Who knew Chief Joo would do that?

816
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:11,996
Who would've known Chief Joo Kyung-moon
would do that in the eleventh hour?

817
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,847
Why is he sleeping here?

818
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,024
Joo Kyung-moon.

819
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:45,613
Sir, the Ministry of Health and Welfare
asked to pull up the meeting.

820
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,448
They have a meeting scheduled
for this afternoon.

821
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,908
Those punks.

822
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:50,910
Tell them okay.

823
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:55,957
What?

824
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,291
Do your best.

825
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,960
You do your best.

826
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:02,046
Don't stick your head in there, you hear?

827
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:03,840
I'll guard the Emergency Room.

828
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,174
Bullshit.

829
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:10,596
Hey. So, I should do this?

830
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,230
Dr. Joo…

831
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,899
Does he have a chance?

832
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,584
SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
DIRECTOR ELECTION

833
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,772
JOO KYUNG-MOON

834
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,864
SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
DEVELOPMENT PLAN

835
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:14,368
Okay, let's get started.

836
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,667
At the local hospital, they said it was
pneumonia, but I find it odd.

837
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:23,419
What is your opinion?

838
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,882
There was no fever or URI symptom,
so I doubt it was pneumonia.

839
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:30,551
The heart rate is 40
and the potassium level is 7.

840
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,011
Was the blood collected properly?

841
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,597
I resampled just in case,
but the numbers were the same.

842
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:37,350
That's odd.

843
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:50,529
Mr. Gu, the election results are out.

844
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,864
Really? Who…

845
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:52,865
Dr. Joo Kyung-moon.

846
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,575
-Dr. Joo Kyung-moon.
-And…

847
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,869
-And?
-Dr. Oh Se-hwa.

848
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,750
The votes were split,

849
01:06:02,833 --> 01:06:04,710
so no one received
the minimum votes required.

850
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,881
They're dropping the bottom two,

851
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:10,591
and taking another vote.

852
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,218
Who are the finalists?

853
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:15,179
The chief of the Cancer Center
and the deputy director…

854
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,516
were eliminated.

855
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,895
Who won more votes in the first round

856
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,563
between Dr. Oh and Dr. Joo?

857
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,958
They received a similar amount
of votes in round one.

858
01:06:44,041 --> 01:06:47,461
Do you think the votes for
the Cancer Center chief and

859
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:50,756
the deputy director will go to Dr. Oh,
since they're in similar fields?

860
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:54,301
Or could they go to Dr. Joo,
who's completely different?

861
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:55,428
I don't know.

862
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,389
Sure. You don't know.

863
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,267
Coffee break's over.

864
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,810
Let's go back in.

865
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,315
Hey.

866
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:09,692
We're not busy right now.

867
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:13,112
I told you not to say that.

868
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:15,322
You drive me nuts.

869
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,118
Hey.

870
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:24,040
Why do I bother being nice to you?
My affection is wasted on you.

871
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:25,499
Goodness.

872
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,795
You're even running for director.

873
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:15,549
I guess you've decided to remain
at our hospital.

874
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,888
When you said you wanted to quit
and return to Gimhae,

875
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,766
I was afraid we were losing

876
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:26,227
a great talent.

877
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:32,274
You must have been frustrated
because of all the power struggles.

878
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,700
I have high expectations for you.

879
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,163
I look forward to continue working
with you, Dr. Joo.

880
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,698
You wanted to quit?

881
01:09:22,074 --> 01:09:23,325
You planned to jump ship?

882
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:49,453
Did you name the dog?

883
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:52,039
-Well…
-You still haven't named him?

884
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:55,334
Did you really send him back
to the shelter?

885
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,924
When you think about it,
time is an amazing thing.

886
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,634
For 60 years,

887
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:07,096
people like us came and left.

888
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,847
It's amazing, when you think about it.

889
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,726
How do you think they felt?

890
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,020
Are we a lot different from the people

891
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,814
who first started this hospital?

892
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:20,526
Should we just accept that we're different
from them since the times have changed?

893
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,824
Do you know Dr. Joo Kyung-moon?

894
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:31,954
He didn't answer.

895
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,751
Why don't you ask what her response was?

896
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,755
Let's just live like this. You and I.
Just the two of us.

897
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,050
