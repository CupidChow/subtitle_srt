1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,389
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,349
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,352
FINALE

4
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,563
If you want to die,
jump in front of someone else's car!

5
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,608
With whom will you fight?

6
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,068
What are you trying to do?

7
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,360
You know a way, don't you?

8
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,578
What are you doing? Move your car!

9
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,497
That jerk.

10
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,916
Move it!

11
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,848
You said you'd fight as well.

12
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:43,019
Against whom will you fight?

13
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,022
What bullshit are you talking about?

14
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,106
Is it going to be us?

15
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,900
Or Chairman Cho Nam-hyeong?

16
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,946
Are you blind?

17
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,740
Did you forget who I was?

18
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,367
"A way"? For what?

19
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,913
And why do I have to be answering
your question?

20
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,915
I'm asking you to be human for once.

21
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,668
I want to know how you think of all this

22
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,503
as an ordinary person,
not as a businessman.

23
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,215
Do you really not care about
what's happening in there?

24
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,716
Do you feel no compunction at all?

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,926
About what?

26
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,053
All you doctors love money.

27
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,847
Once you open your own practice,

28
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,266
you do whatever it takes to make
more money, so why not here?

29
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:22,976
Because it's too big?

30
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,313
You punks are opposing

31
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,274
because it's bothersome to you.

32
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,818
Because you find change bothersome!

33
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,820
All you care about is money.

34
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,490
That's why you can't see what result
Chairman Cho's decision will bring us.

35
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,783
What result will it bring?

36
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,580
Have you ever been
to amusement parks abroad?

37
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,625
I'm getting sick of this.

38
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,212
Apparently, they sell VIP tickets.

39
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,924
If you have that,
it doesn't matter how long the line is.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,759
Even if others have to wait in line
for hours,

41
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,636
as long as you have the VIP tickets

42
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,930
that you paid some extra money for,

43
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,934
you can skip the line
and get on the ride first.

44
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,771
Schools, hospitals, and streets…

45
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,317
Everyone should be
allowed access to those.

46
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,279
Even if people are born
with different backgrounds,

47
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,032
there must be places
where they can mingle.

48
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,491
That's how you coexist!

49
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,120
Hospitals aren't the equivalent of
expensive sports cars.

50
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,456
They aren't palaces
regular people can't dream of entering.

51
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,335
Chairman Cho is saying
that he'll open the doors of this hospital

52
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,630
only to people holding VIP tickets.

53
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,759
Is that the world
you truly want to live in?

54
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,972
Is that…

55
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,893
the kind of world
you want your future child

56
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,521
to live in?

57
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,113
Tell them

58
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,699
to coexist elsewhere.

59
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,041
You have less freedom
than my brother, Mr. Gu.

60
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,713
To whom does your soul belong?

61
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,925
Does it belong to the chairman as well?

62
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,815
Are you that worried?

63
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,027
It's not the hospital I'm worried about.
I'm saying this

64
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,321
for the company and for you, sir.

65
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,701
People are saying we retracted
the business plan

66
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,203
only to divert public attention
from our profit motive.

67
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,247
If we make a rash move
to amend the medical law,

68
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,957
we could face negative consequences.

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,001
If it's too difficult to amend the law,

70
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,211
we should make the hospital
lose its status.

71
00:04:56,337 --> 00:05:00,717
I constantly see hospitals getting
stripped of their status on the news.

72
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,846
That's because those hospitals
committed serious medical errors

73
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,681
and failed to pass the evaluation.

74
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,601
"Medical errors"? That's it.

75
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,688
That's how we can bring Sangkook down.

76
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,774
If it loses its designation
as a general hospital,

77
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,609
I can freely change its entity type.

78
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,819
Mr. Cho.

79
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,031
We can't lose the designation that easily.

80
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,532
That isn't possible.

81
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,659
-Mr. Gu.
-Yes, sir.

82
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,747
Who is this "we"

83
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,790
you keep mentioning?

84
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,378
You and I?

85
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,672
Or you and Sangkook?

86
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,217
-Of course--
-You've changed.

87
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,345
-That's not true.
-You're telling me indirectly

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,307
that I should keep my hands off
the matter.

89
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,517
You're only pretending to worry about me.

90
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:56,355
I'm simply saying there's no need
for you to be the scapegoat.

91
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,941
All the corporations that own hospitals

92
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,944
will try to use the same strategy as us,
using you as an excuse.

93
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,945
Don't let them do that.

94
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,240
Just like you're using me
as an excuse right now

95
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,576
in order to defy me, right?

96
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,210
Forget it.

97
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,797
I'll make the decision.

98
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,674
Wait for my orders.

99
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,905
INTRANET
1 NEW ANNOUNCEMENT

100
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,054
Where are you off to so early?

101
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,567
ANNOUNCEMENT OF PERSONNEL CHANGE

102
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,861
AFFILIATION: SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
TITLE: PRESIDENT

103
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,862
NAME: GU SEUNG-HYO

104
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,613
REVOCATION OF APPOINTMENT
DUE TO TERMINATION

105
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,949
GROUNDS:
BROUGHT THE ORGANIZATION INTO DISREPUTE

106
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,326
ISSUED BY SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
RESTRUCTURE TEAM

107
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,291
REVOCATION OF APPOINTMENT
DUE TO TERMINATION

108
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,710
GROUNDS:
BROUGHT THE ORGANIZATION INTO DISREPUTE

109
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,266
Post it on the hospital intranet.

110
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,518
Mr. Gu.

111
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,565
I think it was decided ever since

112
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,734
the chairman decided
you'd make the announcement

113
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,612
and he'd fix it.

114
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,376
GROUNDS:
BROUGHT THE ORGANIZATION INTO DISREPUTE

115
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,690
THE POST HAS BEEN UPLOADED SUCCESSFULLY

116
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,322
The president was fired?

117
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,283
He has been eager to lay people off.
Serves him right.

118
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,368
You're right.

119
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,136
People say the heart is a fickle thing.

120
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,098
When he was attacking us left and right
using his authority,

121
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:19,141
I hated him so much, but…

122
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,560
Are you sad that he's leaving?

123
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,479
I'm just saying that
because even the president is dispensable.

124
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,441
What did he do to piss off the higher-ups?

125
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,071
You punks are opposing

126
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,864
because it's bothersome to you.

127
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,325
Because you find change bothersome!

128
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,787
Something doesn't feel right.

129
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,917
ANNOUNCEMENT OF PERSONNEL CHANGE

130
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,587
Deputy Director, are you in?

131
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,256
-Yes.
-Come to the director's office.

132
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:52,883
Yes?

133
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,679
Regarding medical errors…

134
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,389
Let's perform an inspection.

135
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,184
They stayed on their toes
only in the beginning.

136
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,020
The number of medication errors
is increasing.

137
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,023
Prescription and preparation errors
should be prevented too,

138
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,025
so you two should oversee the process

139
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,985
before we impose disciplinary actions
on them.

140
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,029
Monitor and manage them closely.

141
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,448
Okay. I got that, but…

142
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,116
What?

143
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,327
I saw the announcement.

144
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,747
It just happened that way.

145
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,415
Without a reason?

146
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,834
In privately owned corporations,
the chairman owns

147
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,003
even the air
that you breathe in the office.

148
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,338
It's what the owner wants.

149
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,174
Anyway, the inspection is unrelated
to my termination,

150
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,383
so get it ready.

151
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,976
If that wasn't a poker face,

152
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,188
he's got to have a deal in place
with Chairman Cho.

153
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,816
I guess…

154
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,819
we're next.

155
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,239
The entire hospital
will be the next target.

156
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,456
Yes, Ms. Kang.

157
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,291
What is it?

158
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,794
Did something happen last night?

159
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:10,795
Why?

160
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,256
Mr. Gu was removed from office.

161
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,175
Where is he going this time?

162
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,344
He was fired, not transferred.

163
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:20,971
Why?

164
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,890
Act like you don't know for now.

165
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,393
Did he go straight home last night?

166
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:30,272
Actually, he went to the headquarters
on his way home.

167
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,858
That late at night?
Did the chairman call for him?

168
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,944
No. It didn't seem like it.

169
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,906
It looked like the talks didn't go well
with the chairman.

170
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,159
-Why do you say that?
-He came out pretty much right away.

171
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,167
I'd like to continue working for Mr. Gu.

172
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,962
He must like it here too.

173
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:56,340
I'm sure he doesn't care much
about where he works at, but…

174
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:02,304
Still, this is where he met someone
he was interested in for the first time.

175
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,182
He did?

176
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,479
Are you talking about the pretty
pediatrician with the round face and eyes?

177
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,231
He didn't say anything himself.

178
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,817
Of course, he didn't.

179
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,319
But why? Why did you think that?

180
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,530
Remember when things got messy?

181
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,115
After the whole autopsy thing.

182
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,366
Yes.

183
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,535
He said to make sure
nothing happened to her,

184
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,745
-so I followed her after work--
-Hold on.

185
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,623
Mr. Gu told you to do that?

186
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,375
To protect Dr. Lee No-eul?

187
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,626
Yes, that was her name.

188
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,551
Oh, gosh.

189
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,399
Why are you in someone else's
empty office?

190
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,155
Well, why weren't you at your desk?

191
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,992
You're not at your desk either.

192
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,579
Well, I…

193
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,352
The chairman has sent
several instructions for me to relay.

194
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:36,440
He says you should take the blame
for the announcement and step down.

195
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,860
He says he can't entrust a business
to you anymore.

196
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,200
He says to refuse to give interviews
and an exit speech

197
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,743
and to leave as soon as possible.

198
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,331
When can you leave?

199
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,809
I'll let him know
that you will follow his instructions.

200
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,535
GLUTTON: CAN WE TALK?

201
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,455
Mr. Lee!

202
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,880
Why did Restructure team
issue the president's dismissal notice?

203
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,257
I didn't write it.

204
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,134
I did what the HR department
told me to do.

205
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,971
Hey, Ms. Kang.

206
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,431
"Hey, Ms. Kang"?

207
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,641
I'm sad to see you go.

208
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,977
It's hard to find an employee like you.

209
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,521
Why would you need an employee like me?

210
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,275
You never know what will happen.

211
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,861
What nonsense--

212
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,070
Ms. Kang.

213
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,301
Director Lee Hyeon-gyun
of Restructure Team.

214
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:30,846
Yes?

215
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,098
You started out as an assistant,
worked your way up

216
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,142
to Business Team,
and ended up in Restructure Team.

217
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,814
Your career history within the company
is identical to mine.

218
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,526
Whether the future will be the same
depends on your abilities,

219
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,487
but here's the thing.

220
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:51,575
If you act like you're holding something
you don't even have yet, your arrogance…

221
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,496
will cost you opportunities
that are in front of you.

222
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,102
I told you, this is a no smoking zone.

223
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,562
Says who? I changed the rule.

224
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,733
Take care of your health.

225
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,154
If you end up here from smoking that,
the doctors will fight over

226
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,907
who gets to cut you open.

227
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,497
When are you leaving?

228
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,582
Once I finish some stuff.

229
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,295
Looks like you have a lot to take care of.

230
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,635
What do you think it'll be like
after you're gone?

231
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,804
Patients will come and go,

232
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,973
get their treatment,

233
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,809
but not all will be saved.
The usual, I guess.

234
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,062
Things could change
for the better or worse.

235
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,857
But it'll never be like what it used to be
before you took over.

236
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,917
It's hard to know how Mr. Gu's leaving
will affect us later on.

237
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,297
I don't know what more we'll be made
to face during our time here.

238
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,300
If Chairman Cho starts to interfere
with the hospital,

239
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,927
I know that will mean trouble, but…

240
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,097
Is there any way to stop him?

241
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,808
I wish we had
"One Country, Two Systems" agreement

242
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,518
in place like China and Hong Kong do.

243
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,229
With that in place, Sangkook
will remain a part of Hwajeong Group,

244
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,274
but its independence will be guaranteed.

245
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,442
We need something like that.

246
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:51,236
There's no way they'd guarantee that.

247
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,198
The biggest problem is
that they want to privatize the hospital.

248
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,657
What should we do?

249
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,744
It's not like they'll listen to us.

250
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,331
Should we just use Mr. Gu?

251
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,169
It's not like he's going somewhere better.

252
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,213
Let's oppose his dismissal.

253
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,256
He must be pissed off too.

254
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,383
We all know he worked hard.

255
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,722
"Chairman apologizing on TV
was all an act."

256
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,767
If Mr. Gu says that himself,
it'll be super effective.

257
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,521
We voted for his dismissal.
It would make us look stupid.

258
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,314
Be that as it may,

259
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,192
there's no way he'll do such a thing.

260
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,860
Don't you know him?

261
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,530
How could we know what he's like?

262
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,991
All we did was fight
and glare at each other the whole time.

263
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,327
Seriously…

264
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,412
That's literally all we did.

265
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,751
Should we hold a press conference?

266
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,963
The public will feel for us, right?

267
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,422
At least some NGO will.

268
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,050
Would that really help us though?

269
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,846
We have been whining about
how we always operate in the red.

270
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,808
You can't call it "whining."
We were stating the truth.

271
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,019
Exactly. If Hwajeong says they'll get
a foreign investment worth billions of won

272
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,105
for a hospital that's always in the red,

273
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,400
they'll make it look like
they're bringing in foreign capital.

274
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,570
If they keep bringing in foreign funds,
the government will eventually approve

275
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,029
privatization of the hospital.

276
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,323
It's not like we can prevent them
from designating

277
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,200
the area as a special economic zone,
can we?

278
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,953
Once they submit
a new medical business plan to MOTIE

279
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,621
and reappraise the Songtan region…

280
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,499
What? Is it that simple
in local governments?

281
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:31,003
What local government would say no
to such an opportunity?

282
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,630
We have nothing to lose.

283
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,215
Why don't we at least ask Mr. Gu?

284
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,138
Since when have we

285
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,349
discussed something like this
during our meetings?

286
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,314
We haven't talked about
patients' health even for a second.

287
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,449
Our chief is still in the meeting, too.

288
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,784
Those damned meetings.

289
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,329
I wouldn't complain if those meetings
have ever been productive.

290
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,375
What?

291
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,293
Ms. Kim.

292
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,587
Wait for us.

293
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,888
Eun-ha, did you drive?

294
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,223
No.

295
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,390
Do you want a ride?

296
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,267
They're still there.

297
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,778
I can't believe the president is
just leaving after making all the mess.

298
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,948
He never should've come here
in the first place.

299
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,913
I know, right?

300
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,374
He never should've come here.

301
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,214
He's leaving, as you wish.

302
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,020
I'll see you tomorrow.

303
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,897
Ms. Kang!

304
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,825
See you tomorrow.

305
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,710
Are you okay?

306
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:37,796
You don't look…

307
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,258
I'm fine.

308
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,678
You'll stay on with us, right?

309
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,763
I don't know.

310
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,851
If you're not sure either,

311
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,477
I guess he's really leaving.

312
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,610
Do you really think it'd have been better
if Mr. Gu had never come here

313
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,778
to begin with?

314
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:03,822
Sorry?

315
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,455
It's not about me.
He got nothing good out of it.

316
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm sure his time here
has been a nightmare for him.

317
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,752
But you know…

318
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:25,427
I should go.

319
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,448
What is it?

320
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,451
That's what I want to ask you.
What's wrong with you?

321
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,660
What do you mean?

322
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,871
The two of you on the roof that day…

323
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,874
You and Mr. Gu just ran into each other,

324
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,542
right?

325
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,086
I don't even recall that.

326
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,545
You don't know him, right?

327
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,381
You couldn't possibly know Mr. Gu, right?

328
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,303
Why must I not know him?

329
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,098
Because he's the president?

330
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,141
Mr. Sunwoo…

331
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,609
I do know him.
In fact, I know Mr. Gu very well.

332
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,904
We both got college degrees
thanks to Hwajeong's scholarships.

333
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,489
Is that a problem?

334
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,033
Don't tell me…

335
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,328
Did you tell him

336
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,748
about us and about the hospital?

337
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,083
Like what?

338
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,169
That all the doctors are douchebags,

339
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:44,047
and that the nurses
are constantly berating each other?

340
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,592
He knew without my telling him.

341
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,636
What's wrong with you?

342
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,805
Are we the only ones at fault?

343
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:52,973
What?

344
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,017
It's not like anyone forced you
to berate one another, is it?

345
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,895
That's because we're all burned out.

346
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,439
Each nurse is responsible for
dozens of patients.

347
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,859
They won't hire more nurses,
and our shifts keep coming.

348
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,361
That's the root cause
of all the problems here.

349
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,531
If work wasn't so hectic,
why would we be at each other's throats?

350
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:10,907
Let's get one thing straight.

351
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,661
In the army, the tougher the training,

352
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,912
the stronger the camaraderie.

353
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,958
They know well enough how much shit
everyone's going through, which is why

354
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,543
they don't get on each other's nerves.

355
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,130
So? Did you latch onto Mr. Gu
because you hated us?

356
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,924
No. Because my life sucked.

357
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,136
Because it was crap.

358
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,141
Having to come in every single day
to a place I detested…

359
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,728
made me sick to my stomach.

360
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:12,594
Still, this is where he met someone
he was interested in for the first time.

361
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,640
I'm sure his time here
has been a nightmare for him.

362
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,643
He said to make sure
nothing happened to her…

363
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,603
He never should've come here.

364
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,690
He says he can't entrust a business
to you anymore.

365
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:29,027
He says to refuse to give interviews
and an exit speech.

366
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,885
There are no records or documents.

367
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:58,098
It's not that she won't give it to us.
The headquarters handled it,

368
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,308
so Ms. Kang doesn't have anything either.

369
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,105
But she said it was true
that Songtan was chosen

370
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,482
because of the environmental fine
imposed on Hwajeong Steel.

371
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,818
How can we get back at Hwajeong

372
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,654
with just circumstantial evidence?

373
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:18,243
What has ever caused damage
to a chairman of a corporation?

374
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,288
There's no such thing.

375
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,126
Nothing can damage them.

376
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,504
We need to crush them with one swift blow.

377
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,642
Why don't we bring it to someone
who can overpower Chairman Cho?

378
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,936
Who would be capable of that?

379
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,539
-Hello, sir.
-Call the director

380
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,874
and the asshole deputy director.

381
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,464
What is it, sir?

382
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,798
I'll kill them.

383
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,470
Neither of them is in the hospital.
They're out…

384
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:22,557
I'll go find them, sir.

385
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,532
Was it you? Did you do it?

386
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,451
No, sir.

387
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,287
Do you know what I'm talking about?

388
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,706
Does this mean you knew?

389
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,125
I don't know what you are referring to,

390
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,419
but I didn't do anything
that could harm you.

391
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,049
Kim Seok-hyeon called me, all worked up,

392
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,218
saying someone from the hospital
came to see him.

393
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,845
They said they'd go public about
how we purchased the land from him

394
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,763
at a higher price.

395
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,766
They had the exact figures, methods,
dates, and everything.

396
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,019
The hospital director and deputy director

397
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,855
went to see the Minister of Environment?

398
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,609
If they had come to me
or blabbed it to the media,

399
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,319
I would have taken care of it quietly.

400
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,696
But that stupid Minister is freaking out

401
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,782
in case something happens to him!

402
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,617
Why did they go to him?

403
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,162
They wouldn't have gone to him
if what they wanted was to expose it.

404
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,289
The director must have demanded something.

405
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,042
They want me to take my hands off
the hospital management.

406
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,046
They asked for the impossible.

407
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,885
Is that all you have to say?

408
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,430
Who could've leaked it?

409
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,056
How did they find out?

410
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,142
Who else knows the exact amount
other than you…

411
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,692
How do you think the Minister will respond

412
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,945
if you don't grant their request?

413
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:02,031
You call that a question?
Obviously, he'll bring up the fine again.

414
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,200
Mind you, it's 160 billion won!

415
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,245
What is your plan, sir?

416
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,790
Shit.

417
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:19,174
It's not like I can rat him out
by saying I bribed him.

418
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,260
You should give the hospital

419
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,679
what they want, sir.

420
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,517
It's impossible to make the owner
stay out of the management duties.

421
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,227
You can agree to do as they wish,

422
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,313
but nothing will change for you.

423
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,899
I'm not the real owner here yet.

424
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,276
Those doctor punks are challenging me

425
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,613
because they know that even though
I'm the owner, I can't control them.

426
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,823
Bring me everyone involved. Now.

427
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,033
Mr. Cho.

428
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:49,370
Please let me resolve the matter
between the hospital and the Ministry.

429
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,499
Let me do that
as my last item of business. Please, sir.

430
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,250
So that you can disappoint me
one last time?

431
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,628
What you did so far wasn't enough?

432
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,357
LEASE AGREEMENT

433
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,818
LESSEE: HWAPYEONG-RI COOPERATIVE
REPRESENTATIVE: KIM BYEONG-SU

434
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,530
You can announce that Hwajeong Group
provided a place to live

435
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,115
for people who got kicked out
of state-owned land.

436
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,868
Even if the land deal becomes a problem,

437
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:32,580
you can make it look like we're exercising
corporate social responsibility.

438
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:33,832
This isn't enough.

439
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,502
It can stop the land scandal,
but not the Minister.

440
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,714
He's already pissed off
that the Songtan matter got out.

441
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,758
He'll try to control us.

442
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,095
The Minister doesn't want people
to find out why his parents

443
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,514
ended up living in the state-owned land
more than anything.

444
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,267
As long as you have this,

445
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,602
he won't be able to act rashly.

446
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,691
What do you want for it?

447
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,320
The director wants me out of her hair.

448
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,950
What do you want in exchange for this?

449
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,080
Mr. Cho.

450
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,003
Please don't tear the hospital apart.

451
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,838
Please…

452
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,507
don't make it fall apart, sir.

453
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,719
Do you think that would change anything?

454
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,349
I've never seen anyone
give up on an opportunity for more money.

455
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,228
I've never once seen them
overcome their greed for money.

456
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,356
All hospitals will end up becoming
one of the two.

457
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,985
A place for people who have money
to burn on health care

458
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,864
and a place where people
who can't afford to do the same go.

459
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,546
Wait for just ten, no, five years

460
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,132
to see what Sangkook University Hospital
will be like.

461
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,010
See which it turns into.

462
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,019
I heard Chairman Cho was here.

463
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,815
We thought you shouldn't know

464
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,901
that we were going to
the Ministry of Environment.

465
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,447
We did want to tell you
in advance regardless,

466
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,908
but that's all meaningless now, isn't it?

467
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,787
It worked.

468
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,627
Did Chairman Cho agree
to give up on privatizing the hospital?

469
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,471
That Minister denied it to our faces,

470
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,307
but he was in collusion with Chairman Cho.

471
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:42,770
He overpaid for the land to avoid
the environmental fine, didn't he?

472
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,730
Director Oh.

473
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,149
The hospital and Hwajeong

474
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,527
are holding each other's detonator.

475
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,572
The one Sangkook is holding

476
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:55,366
is only effective
while the Minister is in office.

477
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,328
Once he steps down, there isn't much
a former politician can do

478
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,289
to Hwajeong.

479
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,249
You have to act cautiously.

480
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,418
That sounded like a request.

481
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,962
Does this not concern you anymore?

482
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,005
Are you really leaving?

483
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,424
You have your duties as a director,

484
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,843
and I have mine.

485
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,011
Don't tell me

486
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,556
you agreed to take the fall for it all.

487
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,603
Why would I?

488
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,736
Remember the custodians' housing
on the Songtan campus?

489
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,323
The one you're giving
to Seosan Village Cooperative?

490
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,700
It'll be where the parents
of the man you met today

491
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,827
will be living in.

492
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,579
The Minister of Environment?

493
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,707
Why would his parents live
in our hospital's building?

494
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:48,336
Ms. Kang will give you a copy
of the lease.

495
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,670
You can read the details there.

496
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,758
The townspeople as well as
his parents will be moving in.

497
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,594
Please make sure it goes as planned.

498
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,640
They did hard labor all their lives.
You can give them

499
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,183
easy custodial duties.

500
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,688
That's why you called it
custodians' housing.

501
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,607
To have them really do custodial work?

502
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,568
If that's what they want.

503
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,406
Sure. I'll do that.

504
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,326
What else?

505
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,662
Is there anything else I should do?

506
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,561
What's wrong with me?

507
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,383
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

508
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,303
What is this?

509
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,139
It's my resignation letter.

510
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,641
I know that.

511
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,436
Use your vacation days.
Take some time off.

512
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,115
SUMMARY OF RESPONSIBILITIES

513
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:48,159
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

514
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,452
Thank you for everything.

515
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,083
I think…

516
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,211
I think I'm having a heart attack.

517
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,089
My chest feels tight, and I can't breathe.

518
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,966
How are you breathing now?

519
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,344
Here. Through my mouth.

520
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,595
When did the symptom start?

521
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:11,682
Let's run an EKG.

522
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,641
Okay.

523
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,564
Do you have rhinitis?

524
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,526
You took this
and used a nasal spray, didn't you?

525
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:24,612
Allergy…

526
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,408
Mr. Bang. Put it back.

527
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,162
If you use a nasal spray with this,
it'll stuff up your nose.

528
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:35,706
-Prescribe him something else.
-Okay.

529
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,626
It's okay to breathe through your mouth.

530
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,086
You get thirsty, that's all.

531
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,587
Try breathing through your mouth.

532
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,884
-You can breathe, right?
-Chief.

533
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,553
They said to gather
in the conference room.

534
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,057
Is she enjoying this or what?
She keeps calling meetings.

535
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,976
Please send at least one person
from each department

536
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,978
for the photoshoot
at the certification ceremony.

537
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,858
Couldn't you have just e-mailed these
to us?

538
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,319
This is a busy time of the day.

539
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,847
Mr. Gu!

540
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,603
Also…

541
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,857
The new consultation hours on Saturdays…

542
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,615
What do you need to talk…

543
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,394
Hello.

544
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,815
We heard today was your last day.

545
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:28,694
Sir, I understand that
we haven't been on the best of terms,

546
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,989
but you weren't going to leave us
without saying goodbye, were you?

547
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,458
Take care of yourselves.

548
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,764
So, this is where you have meetings.

549
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,492
Instead of saying goodbye,

550
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,078
I'll share with you
something I heard recently.

551
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,872
Someone told me

552
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,917
to look at Sangkook five years from now,
no need to wait for ten years.

553
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,003
I was told
that future medical institutions

554
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,547
won't be where illnesses are treated,

555
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:34,343
but where the health of the wealthy
will be maintained.

556
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:39,265
To be honest, I don't think
that's completely incorrect.

557
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,602
How long can you resist the change?

558
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,567
Until when can you prevent the core values

559
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,068
of medicine

560
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,821
from being compromised?

561
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,536
It's up to all of you now.

562
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,247
Some will give in,

563
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,250
some will persevere,

564
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,252
and some…

565
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,755
will go against the flow.

566
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,427
Some of you may be imperfect,

567
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,305
not particularly superior to others,

568
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,474
and even appear to be lost and confused,

569
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,268
but will achieve your goals

570
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,687
in the end.

571
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,985
I'll keep a close eye on
Sangkook University Hospital,

572
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,613
which I was a part of, albeit briefly.

573
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,365
I look forward to seeing
how you will turn out to be

574
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,784
in the next ten to twenty years.

575
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,537
I wish you all good luck.

576
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,184
Meeting adjourned.

577
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,656
Go.

578
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,172
Sorry, my little brother.

579
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,681
How long has this been on?

580
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:51,188
You told them it was my last day,
didn't you?

581
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,649
Pardon? Me?

582
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,779
I guess this will be my last time to walk
across this hospital lobby with you.

583
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,281
Thank you for everything.

584
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,880
I don't work for Hwajeong anymore,
so I don't need the company car.

585
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:18,757
Thank you for everything.

586
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,889
Please let me drive you up to today.

587
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,062
Your car is in the usual spot

588
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,147
in the parking lot, right?

589
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,531
I'll be right out.

590
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,103
Why did you try to fire me?

591
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,564
What?

592
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,858
You wanted to ask that now…

593
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,526
I wanted to ask

594
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,361
why you did that to me.

595
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,491
But I couldn't.

596
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,869
Why not?

597
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,747
I didn't know why I couldn't ask either.

598
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,751
But I know now.

599
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,089
I was afraid you'd say that you hated me.

600
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,762
That you'd say
it was annoying to have me around.

601
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,099
I was afraid that's what you'd say to me.

602
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,842
Take care,

603
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,844
Dr. Lee No-eul.

604
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,924
Is this too much?

605
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,347
What if it's crowded and rowdy?
That would be a bit…

606
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:40,519
Well, I didn't make the reservation,
so I don't know what it'll be like.

607
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,776
You look great.

608
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:49,611
I know.

609
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,196
Let's go.

610
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,424
Jin-woo.

611
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:25,564
You saw No-eul once,
but you remember her well.

612
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,607
She's pretty,

613
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,194
and they looked really close.

614
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:32,863
That's…

615
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,781
They fight all the time.

616
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,284
He may look like this,
but he has a temper.

617
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,494
What about my looks?

618
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,746
Let's ask.

619
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,414
How does my brother look?

620
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:49,004
There's your answer. You've been rejected.
I'm so sorry for you.

621
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,923
It's okay. She has low standards.

622
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:55,844
She said you were cute.
That says it all. It's over.

623
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,892
Look at this punk. Don't get all shy.

624
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:03,477
Stop overreacting.

625
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,105
I meant it. And you two look alike.

626
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,690
-What?
-What?

627
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,275
You do.

628
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,527
The more I look at you,
the more alike you two look.

629
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,196
You should be honored.

630
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,740
I'm insulted.

631
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,327
I need to use the restroom.

632
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,997
Please don't talk about me.

633
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,293
What else would we talk about?

634
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,171
Talk about the weather.

635
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,475
Isn't it great?

636
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,647
They seem to like each other.

637
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,276
What about me?

638
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,654
Are you sick of me now?

639
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,448
I'm thankful to you.

640
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:43,410
Then keep being thankful to me.
Problem solved.

641
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:45,370
Thank you.

642
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,958
I held on thanks to you.

643
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,919
I relied on you a lot.

644
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,009
You listened to me
even if I didn't say anything,

645
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,470
and you cried for me.

646
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,347
For 25 years.

647
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,853
You were by my side for 25 years.

648
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,316
What are you trying to say?

649
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,612
I'm your brother too, you know.

650
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,157
No.

651
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,783
I'm also Seon-woo, your brother.

652
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,369
No, you're not Seon-woo.

653
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,040
You're me.

654
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,837
I created you.

655
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,134
I hated the fact

656
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,554
that Dad died
and Seon-woo became paralyzed.

657
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,269
I couldn't bring Dad back to life,

658
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,609
but I saved you…

659
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,532
in my mind…

660
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:08,119
and in my heart.

661
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,001
However,

662
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,466
I no longer hate the fact

663
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,220
that Seon-woo can't walk.

664
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,474
I can carry him on my back
for the rest of my life.

665
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,398
I don't mind that.

666
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,820
I wish…

667
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,452
my little brother would live a long life.

668
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,459
I wish he wouldn't leave…

669
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,882
much sooner than I do.

670
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:36,958
Isn't it great?

671
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,545
They seem to like each other.

672
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,438
He did? Really?

673
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:02,984
What did I do now?

674
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:05,195
What did you tell her?

675
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,489
About how you ran away from home.

676
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,285
Hey!

677
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,037
What?

678
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,508
Reporter Kwon was released,

679
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,551
but we can no longer write anything
about Hwajeong.

680
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,888
As expected, there was a deal made.

681
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,808
I'm going to try to become
a TV reporter again.

682
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,644
You'll quit Saegeul21 and return to TV?

683
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,188
Yes. I'll give it another try.

684
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,815
Good luck.

685
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:44,901
Where's Seon-woo?

686
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,665
I never knew there was a place like this.

687
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,918
It feels like we're at some place
out of town.

688
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,212
Here?

689
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:18,351
I didn't make it to the beach once
this summer.

690
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,937
Things had been too hectic.

691
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:24,190
Aren't you two going on vacation?

692
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,113
If I go, I'd only be a nuisance.

693
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,617
That applies to me as well
since all eyes will be on me.

694
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,120
I guess I shouldn't go either.

695
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,372
You should. That's not a reason
for you not to go.

696
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,418
You think so? Then I guess none of us
would be a nuisance to anyone.

697
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,962
What matters is what we want, right?

698
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,132
You're right.

699
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,862
It's nice being out at this hour.

700
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,878
I see you requested time off.

701
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,838
Is it to spend time with her?

702
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,632
What do you mean?

703
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,468
You always denied it,

704
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,553
but now that she's quitting, I guess

705
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,930
you've decided to make it public.

706
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:38,890
Who's quitting?

707
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:42,519
Didn't you request time off so you can
spend time with the pediatrician?

708
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:44,729
Why would I go away with…

709
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,690
No-eul resigned?

710
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,905
You shouldn't run in the hospital,
little boy.

711
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:54,948
What's going on?

712
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,325
You fought hard to stay here
when they fired you.

713
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:59,077
I wanted to leave on my own accord.

714
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:01,329
Seoul isn't the best.

715
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,206
You're going to a rural area?

716
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,959
What's gotten into you?

717
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,670
I've been thinking about it for a while.

718
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,755
I'm still confused though.

719
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:13,758
So, don't try to convince me not to go.

720
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,678
Let's go eat.

721
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,722
Don't cry because you miss me.

722
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,308
Dr. Lee No-eul.

723
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,520
Coming.

724
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,357
Why do they want me there?
It'll be so awkward to eat with them.

725
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:32,110
Hey. You're coming with me.

726
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,410
Are you not feeling well?

727
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:44,247
Mr. Gu is finally gone. What's wrong?

728
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,541
You should have a better appetite.

729
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,378
You know the chairman of Hwajeong
has a younger brother, right?

730
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:52,922
His name is Cho Nam-chung.

731
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,841
Chairman Cho's younger brother…

732
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,051
Hold on.

733
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,429
Isn't he a doctor too?

734
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:02,348
He's young, but he's one of the best
pancreatic cancer doctors in the US.

735
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,143
So, they have someone specializing
in cancer in their family.

736
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:07,061
They sent a CEO at first,

737
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,771
but given how clannish they are,

738
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,983
he'll probably send his brother here
this time.

739
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,693
Having a cancer specialist
as the president

740
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,320
would benefit you in a way.

741
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,281
The Cancer Center will have his support.

742
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,450
What if he says he'll run it
and see patients himself?

743
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,910
What if he doesn't want
an office job at his age

744
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:26,414
and wants to be both the president
and the chief? What happens to me then?

745
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:27,915
You're screwed…

746
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,544
It won't be that bad, but…

747
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,963
The chairman's brother, you said?

748
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:38,259
Have a seat.

749
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,098
Chairman Cho's brother
will be the new president?

750
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,517
What if he's worse than Mr. Gu?

751
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,853
I thought he was in the US.

752
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,396
He was,

753
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,441
but his name was removed
from the hospital website a few days ago.

754
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:55,068
What timing.

755
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,528
Did he really quit to come here?

756
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,953
I hear you're going to a rural hospital.

757
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,247
Yes.

758
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:12,251
It's a grand gesture,
but be prepared to be eaten alive.

759
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,129
You'll probably be
the only pediatrician there,

760
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,839
so they'll make you do
all sorts of things.

761
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,093
They tend to distance themselves
from outsiders

762
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,512
since most of them don't stay for long.

763
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,056
But they'll come to realize
that you are good-hearted.

764
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,893
That's why it's more unfair.
She'll work her fingers to the bone,

765
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,645
but they'll claim
she's there for the money.

766
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:32,438
I see.

767
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,357
We always get scolded.

768
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,151
Who scolded you?

769
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:41,698
Will Chairman's Cho's brother
be the new president?

770
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,576
Who knows? It's his own hospital anyway.

771
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,995
It must be nice to have his own hospital.

772
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,665
We can have our own hospital, too.

773
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,668
What?

774
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:58,131
I thought about how we could
free ourselves from Chairman Cho,

775
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,551
and I realized that we need
an independent foundation.

776
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,262
That may sound easy,

777
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,514
but they own not only the hospital
but the university.

778
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,058
We need to buy the foundation
to become independent.

779
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,893
It'll cost hundreds of billions of won.

780
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:13,104
Hwajeong won't sell it, either.

781
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,648
Isn't the process what matters?

782
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,652
We can ask our alumni for donations,
one by one if necessary,

783
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,572
and let them know why we're doing it.

784
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,158
If it takes decades to gather the funds,

785
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,577
that means we will fight for our cause
for decades.

786
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:31,581
Then we'd be advertising
our problems ourselves.

787
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:36,753
We'd damage our own reputation while
trying to expose Hwajeong's corruption.

788
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:38,921
It will be hard to attract talent.

789
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,174
The medical school won't empty out,

790
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,176
but we won't get the competent ones.

791
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:46,137
"The doctors at Sangkook
are saying themselves

792
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,764
that they're having problems."

793
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,433
That's what they'll say,
and convince them not to come here.

794
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,228
We'll lose every one of
the talented candidates.

795
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,399
Then where can we get the power
to resist and stop them?

796
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:07,992
An independent foundation…

797
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,421
How did you come up with that idea?

798
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,132
Buying the entire foundation…

799
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:25,802
You're so bold.

800
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,428
What's the point?

801
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,889
The chiefs were…

802
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,725
There will be new chiefs eventually.

803
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:35,311
The next ones can do it.

804
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:40,525
The next ones?

805
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,485
That would be you.

806
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,570
Since I'll be gone.

807
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,365
But Jin-woo,

808
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,117
stop at chief.

809
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,870
Like anyone would make me one.

810
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,374
Why can't I aim higher?

811
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,879
It's not that you can't.
She's just hoping you wouldn't.

812
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,132
In case you end up like Director Lee.

813
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:07,718
What do you mean by that?

814
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,095
That would be you…

815
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:13,266
trying to protect the hospital
against someone like Mr. Gu.

816
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,725
All on your own.

817
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:18,312
Protect it, my foot.

818
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,651
A lot of people suffered because of him.
Of course, I had to do something.

819
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,445
Don't you think
that's how Director Lee felt too?

820
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,406
He fought the battle alone, only to…

821
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:38,165
I heard he fired them in advance
to stop more disasters from happening.

822
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,169
He laid his employees off

823
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,507
to prevent them from committing suicide
or getting into an accident.

824
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:54,891
So that at least,
his employees wouldn't die.

825
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,102
That's what Mr. Gu did?

826
01:04:58,686 --> 01:04:59,687
Did he say that himself?

827
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,565
Someone told me.

828
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:21,417
No matter how nice Director Lee was,

829
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,544
he wasn't our dad.

830
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,465
Are you drunk?

831
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:30,092
And Mr. Gu isn't a big, bad man.

832
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:36,098
He's drunk.

833
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,643
That was always our fear
when we were little.

834
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:43,272
That a big, bad man would take over
our family and replace Dad.

835
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,276
That when we'd wake up in the morning,
Mom would be gone too.

836
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:50,029
I remember everything.

837
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:53,616
You said you'd protect Mom and me.

838
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,994
You didn't get to enjoy your teens.

839
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:59,497
When you got older,

840
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:02,500
you were busy making money and studying.

841
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,046
Ye Jin-woo worked so hard all his life.

842
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:12,551
You should give yourself a break.

843
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:19,433
You punk.

844
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:07,440
Move over.

845
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:09,066
Yes, ma'am.

846
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,824
We don't have that many days left
to hang out like this.

847
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:28,836
Are you crying?

848
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,047
Why you…

849
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,341
You punk.

850
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,178
Hey. That's dusty.

851
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,971
Just throw punches.

852
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,061
Stop that.

853
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:48,856
It looks like that.

854
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,067
The thing with the face of Jesus.

855
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,693
This is a masterpiece.

856
01:07:53,277 --> 01:07:54,528
It's not half bad.

857
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:57,865
Right? Don't you agree?

858
01:07:58,824 --> 01:08:00,576
-I feel blessed.
-Right?

859
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,121
Grow up, will you? Grow up.

860
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:05,664
You brats.

861
01:08:39,073 --> 01:08:40,741
How is it that
there's nothing I want to do?

862
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:06,267
-Come before the meeting.
-Yes, sir.

863
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:08,936
What is it?

864
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:11,105
Mr. Gu Seung-hyo's e-mail just came in.

865
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:12,690
Should I leave it on your desk?

866
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:15,943
Gu Seung-hyo?

867
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,995
HEALTH-MONITORING APPAREL DESIGN OPTIONS

868
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:42,678
HEART RATE MONITORING

869
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:47,016
Tell the president of Apparel to call me.

870
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:48,058
Yes, sir.

871
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:52,563
Mr. Gu asked us to put
biomedical chips in all of our shoes

872
01:09:52,646 --> 01:09:54,523
and clothing.

873
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:59,153
Those chips would analyze the wearers'
pulse and the components of their sweat,

874
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:02,072
and send the data to Sangkook Hospital
via an app he was developing.

875
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,617
He said we must dominate the market

876
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,494
with wearable devices more sophisticated
than those linked to phones.

877
01:10:08,495 --> 01:10:09,455
Okay.

878
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,678
Where's the meeting being held?

879
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:28,682
Okay.

880
01:10:29,433 --> 01:10:31,101
SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM

881
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,188
There are too many
sabbatical leave requests,

882
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:37,399
so we'll have to process them
in the order received.

883
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,944
Please review them again,

884
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,654
and resubmit your requests…

885
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:50,079
He really is here.

886
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:03,509
You can't fire me.

887
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,095
The chairman
will just assign me here again.

888
01:11:06,178 --> 01:11:07,179
Let him.

889
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:09,723
I'll just fire you again.

890
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:13,018
Hey, you.

891
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:18,899
"Hey, you"?

892
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:20,943
Your ID.

893
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:51,557
That's the only bank account
that I would've shared

894
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,267
with the late director.

895
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:57,646
The hiking club members
took turns using it 20 years ago.

896
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,024
We were the youngest members then,

897
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:03,110
so I think Director Lee
was the first secretary of the club.

898
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,866
That shithead.

899
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:13,162
The director opened that bank account

900
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:14,621
for the membership dues

901
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,125
to pay for expenses.
It was in his own name, I believe.

902
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:22,796
Even though the secretary changed,

903
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,591
we kept using the same bank account.

904
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,219
The secretary probably received
the dues and managed the account.

905
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,138
Did Dr. Kim serve as the secretary too?

906
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,932
That's right.
Right after Director Lee, I believe.

907
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:37,936
But that hiking club
was dissolved soon after.

908
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:41,357
You know…

909
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:47,821
Even if Dr. Kim messed with that account,

910
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,950
he wouldn't have known the director
would end up like that, don't you think?

911
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:54,411
That would be too inhumane.

912
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,499
He may not have known that,

913
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:01,960
but he must have known he wouldn't
be punished even if he were caught.

914
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:03,712
Really?

915
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,340
No. It isn't a crime.

916
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:08,008
He didn't embezzle the money.

917
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,011
Even if Dr. Kim received the money
through that account,

918
01:13:11,678 --> 01:13:13,013
there's no way to prove it.

919
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,265
What about the director, then?

920
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,061
Is this how it ends for him?

921
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,479
We haven't uncovered the truth.

922
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:24,942
How terrible.

923
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,072
Excuse me.

924
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,203
Hello?

925
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,123
Yes.

926
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:46,630
You were the last person
who managed that bank account.

927
01:13:46,713 --> 01:13:47,923
You're the only one

928
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,175
who could've received money
in my name using the account.

929
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,178
What bullshit are you trying to pull?
Are you trying to ruin my life?

930
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:57,933
Why are you trying to frame me?

931
01:13:58,976 --> 01:13:59,935
To become the director?

932
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:01,687
Don't you dare blame it on me.

933
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,647
I'll get you for this!

934
01:14:21,999 --> 01:14:22,875
Yes.

935
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,418
What about the director?

936
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:26,587
She'll be there soon?

937
01:14:32,926 --> 01:14:34,011
I'll head down right now.

938
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:36,305
Okay.

939
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,768
He's really coming.

940
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:43,937
The new president is here now?

941
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:46,231
-Yes. Would you--
-I should get going.

942
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,998
I'm sure the director
will say we did enough.

943
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,418
You did all you could.

944
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,964
I needed an answer.

945
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,761
That what only the director knew,

946
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,640
what he asked how I knew,

947
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:25,062
was not about the money,
but a misunderstanding.

948
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:31,318
I was fine being a bastard
for doubting Director Lee, so I wanted…

949
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,405
to know that I was wrong.

950
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,908
He asked how you knew?

951
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,080
Why did he say that?

952
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:51,880
Was it around the time when Mr. Gu
was trying to get us and OB-GYN

953
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:54,258
transferred elsewhere?

954
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,011
Could that have been what he meant?

955
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:04,017
He probably tried to take care of it
on his own and fight against Mr. Gu.

956
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:05,727
That's how he was.

957
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:12,150
Even for me, if I were trying my best
to resolve things myself

958
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,403
without getting you guys all worked up,

959
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,780
but you or So-jeong
happened to come yelling at me,

960
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:19,992
asking why I kept it from you
and things like that,

961
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,786
I would be flustered too.

962
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:28,792
A dead man can't defend himself.

963
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,837
It's why you need to stay alive,
no matter what.

964
01:16:33,380 --> 01:16:35,257
We'll have to save lives, no matter what.

965
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:38,969
That's right. Even if the higher-ups
give us crap,

966
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:41,513
all we have to do is save people's lives.

967
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,768
Let it all go, and get some rest.

968
01:16:47,352 --> 01:16:48,520
Don't carry it with you.

969
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,106
You can save lives when you return.

970
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:05,829
I'll be back, Director.

971
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,915
I'll save more lives when I get back.

972
01:18:20,445 --> 01:18:21,571
Dr. Ye.

973
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,324
Are you leaving now?

974
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:25,992
Yes.

975
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:27,536
See you next week.

976
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,579
-See you when I get back.
-Okay.

977
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,131
See you again.

978
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:46,430
The sun is so nice.

979
01:18:48,098 --> 01:18:49,099
It's so sunny.

980
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,772
-Jin-woo.
-Yes?

981
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,984
FROM SURGERY TO REHAB, WE TAKE CARE OF YOU

982
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,319
FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR
OF SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

983
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:15,083
You know, joints could be healed
on their own.

984
01:19:16,334 --> 01:19:18,503
I can't even sit because it hurts so much.

985
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:24,092
You should get surgery
since you're in so much pain.

986
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:29,055
Come at 9:30 a.m. on Monday.

987
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,515
Thank you.

988
01:19:36,938 --> 01:19:38,482
This won't be easy.

989
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,859
-What's wrong?
-My back.

990
01:19:40,942 --> 01:19:43,111
Hold on. Does it hurt here?

991
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,238
Gosh.

992
01:19:46,573 --> 01:19:48,658
Should I get surgery?

993
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,535
You know surgery is not the only option.

994
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:52,954
-What about here?
-Right there. There.

995
01:19:53,038 --> 01:19:54,164
How long was it like this?

996
01:19:54,247 --> 01:19:55,332
Just all of a sudden.

997
01:19:55,415 --> 01:19:57,584
You should get it imaged.

998
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:06,176
You have more important operations
to perform with these.

999
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:08,553
These are such valuable hands.

1000
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:10,388
My gosh. Seriously…

1001
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:15,060
Use these great hands sparingly, Dr. Kim.

1002
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,812
So we can be work partners
for a long time.

1003
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:24,528
Sure, let's do that.

1004
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:30,659
Let's go.

1005
01:20:40,126 --> 01:20:41,628
You may go in now.

1006
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:43,213
Okay.

1007
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:05,193
For Hwajeong Life Insurance, whose
profits plunged last year, Kim Ki-beom,

1008
01:21:05,277 --> 01:21:07,070
the former undersecretary of MOTIE,

1009
01:21:07,153 --> 01:21:09,489
has become the president.

1010
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,783
Sangkook University Hospital's
new president

1011
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,327
is Cho Nam-chung, MD,
an alumnus of Boston University.

1012
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,788
Global Plant Engineering's new president

1013
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:19,666
is Gu Seung-hyo, Sangkook University
Hospital's former president.

1014
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:22,002
Hwajeong Chemical's new vice president

1015
01:21:22,085 --> 01:21:23,837
-is Park Jong-sang.
-Global Plant Engineering?

1016
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,130
Hwajeong has announced

1017
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:27,507
a total of four
executive personnel changes.

1018
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:31,511
After undergoing executive personnel
changes for its major affiliates,

1019
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,389
Hwajeong will balance innovation
and stability…

1020
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,899
Seon-woo! Jin-woo!

1021
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,956
My mom brought over
tons of food last week,

1022
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,625
so my fridge is about to explode.

1023
01:22:03,043 --> 01:22:04,753
It seems she's not angry with you anymore.

1024
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:07,339
Is she okay with you
being here on your own now?

1025
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:11,593
"Being angry with you is one thing
and bringing you food is another.

1026
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,887
I'm still hurt." That's what she said.

1027
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:17,766
Your mom is so different from you.

1028
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:18,934
She's still like a girl.

1029
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,729
If she's different from me and she's
like a girl, what am I then?

1030
01:22:30,153 --> 01:22:32,697
Did you empty out the store?
What took you so long?

1031
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,867
I was looking around. It's nice here.

1032
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:38,203
Aren't you supposed to ask me
how I'm doing?

1033
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,331
Didn't he ask you that?

1034
01:22:41,998 --> 01:22:44,793
Dr. Ye. You're going to live
a very long life.

1035
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:47,045
How are you so consistent
through and through?

1036
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:49,798
Are you done yapping?

1037
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:51,591
We have a boat to catch.

1038
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:56,304
-I'll see you guys on your way back.
-Okay.

1039
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:00,517
Put on some more weight.
You look like a toothpick.

1040
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:03,687
We'll come back soon.

1041
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,106
Go and have fun to your heart's content.

1042
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,115
All done.

1043
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,033
Okay.

1044
01:23:58,950 --> 01:23:59,993
The neck.

1045
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:10,462
Want flippers?

1046
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:12,005
Stop being such an amateur.

1047
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:16,384
Here.

1048
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:21,931
-Done.
-Okay?

1049
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:22,932
Okay.

1050
01:24:23,725 --> 01:24:24,559
Let's go.

1051
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:29,689
Slowly.

1052
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:31,816
Okay.

1053
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,152
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

1054
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:35,904
Hold the buoy.

1055
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:37,489
Hold that.

1056
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:45,997
-How's the water?
-It's cool.

1057
01:24:53,213 --> 01:24:54,589
-We'll go a little farther.
-Okay.

1058
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,637
You can jump in when you're ready.

1059
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,097
We'll go in first.

1060
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,723
Sir, here… All right.

1061
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,788
Wasn't that awesome?

1062
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:38,831
It really was!

1063
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:43,419
-Did you drink seawater?
-Yes.

1064
01:29:43,503 --> 01:29:44,754
It's so salty.

1065
01:29:45,254 --> 01:29:46,506
I'll take a picture for you.

1066
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:50,718
Take off your snorkel masks. Good.

1067
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:32,176
No-eul.

1068
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:53,197
How have you been?

1069
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:01,956
I see that you haven't left yet.

1070
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:05,626
For where?

1071
01:31:27,106 --> 01:31:28,608
I have a question.

1072
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,319
You know that I just got here, right?

1073
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:33,696
What is it?

1074
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:23,115
