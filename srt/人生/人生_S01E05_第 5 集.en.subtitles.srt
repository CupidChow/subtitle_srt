00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,764
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,224
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,311
EPISODE 5

4
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,231
How long do you expect the strike to last?

5
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,609
We'll have to see
how the foundation responds.

6
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,278
We'll end it
as soon as they withdraw the order.

7
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:13,406
Is there a special reason
for taking such an extreme measure?

8
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,744
As you know, there are factors
specific to the field of medicine.

9
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,748
But if you completely disregard those,
it would cause harm…

10
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,421
It would cause harm
to the people, obviously.

11
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,466
Our strike is a means for us

12
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,177
to ask the public for understanding

13
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,847
of the harsh reality we are facing
and for help.

14
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,848
Thank you.

15
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,523
Where's Dr. Ye?

16
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,318
He must have gone to Pediatrics already.

17
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,946
To see Dr. Lee No-eul.

18
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,157
Our on-call doctor's gone.
Of course he should go there.

19
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,493
I don't think that's why
he went to see her.

20
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,663
Forget it.

21
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,333
What would you know about dating?

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,460
Which doctor?

23
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,920
Who's dating?

24
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,589
Why would I bother explaining it to you?

25
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,847
There should be articles about our strike.

26
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:26,896
Well… there is, but…
Is this really about us?

27
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,149
-What? When did he…
-Hold on.

28
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,111
"The medical staff's assertion
about the expulsion

29
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,029
of the unprofitable departments
is not true.

30
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,365
-It stems from the difference…"
-…in understanding

31
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,742
the reason
behind the relocation to a rural hospital.

32
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,955
I take responsibility for not achieving
a mutual understanding sooner.

33
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,125
This is not due to the hostility

34
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,086
between the medical staff
and a non-medically trained leader,

35
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,505
but due to the lack of transparency

36
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,924
deeply entrenched
in the field of medicine.

37
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,844
Nonetheless, despite the opposition
from the medical staff,

38
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,263
the management has assessed
the operational efficiency

39
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:04,142
of all the departments for the first time
since the hospital's establishment.

40
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,226
Through the assessment,

41
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,063
we uncovered a medication error
that had resulted in a patient's death.

42
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,108
We consider it a small success
amidst misfortune.

43
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,943
Strike that.

44
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,863
"Amidst heartbreaking misfortune."

45
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,993
"We consider it a small success
amidst heartbreaking misfortune."

46
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,077
Done.

47
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,372
The foundation immediately
notified the victim's family

48
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,750
of the result of the investigation.

49
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,002
Likewise,

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,340
we promise you all that we will do our all
to come to an agreement

51
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:40,720
with the medical staff
to prevent the strike before it starts.

52
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,388
That's all.

53
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:00,990
"Announcement of strike.

No. Keep administering Clamoxin.

65
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,906
We are only changing the dosage
from QID to TID.

66
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,992
Okay.

67
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,536
What--

68
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,290
Sorry.

69
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,961
Yes. Who?

70
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,505
Kim Ye-jin?

76
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,309
Okay.

77
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,313
Everything is a mess.

78
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,273
Isn't this what residents
are supposed to do?

79
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,316
What is up with this?

80
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,650
I have no clue.

81
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,194
What's going on? Almost all the patients
are assigned to you.

82
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,404
What about the other fellows?

83
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,489
They must be preparing for the relocation.

84
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,992
What does giving you all the work
have anything to do with it?

85
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,537
We'll have much less manpower there
than we have here.

86
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,913
But why must you…

87
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,919
Did you even eat breakfast?

88
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,380
If I eat now, it'll just make me sick.

89
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,634
Let's go.

90
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,472
Our end must be near,

91
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,808
seeing what Mr. Gu is doing
even with our threat of striking.

92
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,101
Is this all his doing?

93
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,020
Who is he to change the schedules?

94
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,563
That jerk is out of his mind.

95
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,441
It's just my guess.
Don't be so negative about him.

96
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:02,361
He isn't wrong. It's all true.

97
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,239
Everything is way too concentrated
in Seoul.

98
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,535
It's not just some imbalance.
It'll topple over soon at this rate.

99
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,996
If he were really trying to fix that,
I wouldn't complain.

100
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,249
I've been thinking a lot about it,

101
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,960
whether it's right to stay in Seoul.

102
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,881
It's different from going voluntarily.

103
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,801
But I didn't go. I only thought about it.

104
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,928
Who would go if they're not forced?

105
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,096
No-eul.

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,808
Everyone in this hospital can go, but you…

107
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,477
Me? What about me?

108
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,603
You…

109
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,691
You can't. Not today.

110
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,568
You're on call for us today.

111
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,445
I don't care how busy you are.
Brace yourself.

112
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,531
Jin-woo.

113
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,451
Hi. I'm coming.

114
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,537
It got much better.

115
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,621
Hey, No-eul…

116
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,383
Skin tags are for Plastic Surgery.

117
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,218
Why do you keep including them
in the charts?

118
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,638
You can explain those
to the guardians directly.

119
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,182
That's hot.

120
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,893
Why are you breathing down my neck?

121
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,228
I almost got the wrong idea.

122
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,648
I heard about a chief
getting revenge on a fellow

123
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,942
by dumping patients on her.

124
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,944
Are you saying I did that?

125
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,904
Of course not, Chief.

126
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,782
But seriously,
who messed with the schedule?

127
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,076
I don't know, either.

128
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,954
It seems like the Restructure Team
will meddle with things like this too.

129
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,583
Restructure Team?
That means this is Mr. Gu's doing.

130
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:43,171
Do you think he's teaching us a lesson?
For not leaving when he told us to?

131
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,090
Then why would he dump all the work
on one person?

132
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:51,846
I've never heard of any fellow
questioning a chief incessantly

133
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,974
for dumping work on his friend.

134
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,269
Whom should we call today
instead of Dr. Lee?

135
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,189
-You?
-Shoot. Wait.

136
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,357
We're short-staffed already.

137
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,152
PEDIATRICS DEPARTMENT SCHEDULE

138
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,987
He was on call last night, so not him.

139
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,127
The foundation immediately
notified the victim's family

140
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,379
of the result of the investigation.

141
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,590
Likewise,

142
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,177
we promise you all that we will do our all
to come to an agreement

143
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,890
with the medical staff
to prevent the strike before it starts.

144
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,938
If we go on strike,
Mr. Gu won't sit still.

145
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,023
He has something huge on us.

146
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,954
Even if we push Mr. Gu out,
the foundation will just send another one.

147
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,623
It's not like
we'll replace the foundation.

148
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,084
Getting rid of him
would not make much difference.

149
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,462
If all the doctors go against him
and get him kicked out,

150
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,048
they will appoint more a docile one
to the position.

151
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,217
What if they send someone worse than him

152
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,177
to avoid a repeat of the predecessor?

153
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,856
Let's push Mr. Gu out first

154
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,359
and get involved in the appointment
of the successor.

155
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,153
It's all up to the chairman.
How could we get involved in that?

156
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,532
Is there anyone here
who hasn't treated politicians,

157
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,034
people in law, and wives of chairmen

158
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,078
of huge corporations at some point?

159
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,040
We have a massive network.
How dare they disrespect us?

160
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,214
How dare they disrespect us?

161
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,156
He says to submit a plan

162
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,283
before his inauguration.

163
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,909
That's in less than ten days.

164
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,661
What will you do?

165
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,753
You need to take action.

166
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,131
You need to put an end to it
before he starts officially.

167
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,924
I told you,

168
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,052
my brother-in-law says
Gu Seung-hyo is no joke.

169
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,139
The cargo union is super tough,
but he destroyed them.

170
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,641
That young kid did.

171
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,190
Director Lee.

172
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,943
This is the fourth time already.

173
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,987
This is your fourth term as director.

174
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,324
If we had not voted for you,
it would have been impossible.

175
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,912
In other words,
everyone is looking at you.

176
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,498
You need to do something.

177
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,881
Dr. Kim. I'm sorry.

178
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,300
You said to let you know
if interview requests came in.

179
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:18,677
Sorry? What did you say?

180
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,222
They're called Saegeul21.
Should I tell them you'll do it?

181
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,849
"Saegeul21"?

182
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,976
Yes. I think it's a new media company.

183
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,105
Where have I heard that name before?
Saegeul…

184
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:32,942
We're done.

185
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,195
SAEGEUL21

186
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,655
Why don't you do it yourself?

187
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,033
You like giving interviews.

188
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,701
Chief.

189
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,872
I'm not making anything up here.

190
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,625
SAEGEUL21 REVEALS HWAJEONG GROUP HEIRS'
EVASION OF MILITARY DUTY

191
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,924
Okay. I understand.

192
00:11:58,968 --> 00:11:59,885
It's that company.

193
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,513
The one that exposed Hwajeong heirs
for not going to the army.

194
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,307
That's why he…

195
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:07,810
Gosh.

196
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:11,981
EMERGENCY MEDICINE CHIEF LEE DONG-SU

197
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,900
We measured it, and it was 130 over 80.

198
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,860
Yes.

199
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,155
There was no problem. Okay. Got it.

200
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,285
VARICOSE VEIN SURGERY DEATH

201
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,121
Why did they send their mortality
conference schedule to us?

202
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,302
SAEGEUL21

203
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,554
What's this?

204
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:47,266
If I had half your looks,
I would've done it myself.

205
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,144
What do your looks keep you from doing?

206
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,730
Must you ask me that question?

207
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,148
My mother will be hurt.

208
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,234
Give an interview later at 7 p.m.

209
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,277
What?

210
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,197
Mr. Gu put up a powerful defense.

211
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,948
We need to fight back.

212
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,451
Make them understand why we must go so far

213
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,162
as to go on strike.

214
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,080
Since you…

215
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,458
know well.

216
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,054
Don't be too… you know…

217
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,806
Try not to drag Hwajeong Group into it.

218
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:32,436
I heard Saegeul21
is full of anti-authority reporters.

219
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,479
Just give them enough.

220
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,857
"Saegeul21."

221
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:41,278
Also, I heard you sent up
that varicose vein patient.

222
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,697
The one who died during the surgery?

223
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,368
They're holding a conference soon.

224
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,662
I think you should attend.

225
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,374
Why did they call us
about an anesthesia-related death?

226
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,709
To avoid ending up like the Cancer Center?

227
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,586
They were told to, that's why.

228
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,838
-By who?
-Who else?

229
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,094
You should be fine.
Dr. Yang is the one I'm worried about.

230
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,264
Anyway, you take care of
the mortality conference

231
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,598
and the interview later.

232
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,933
Chief…

233
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,440
Since you…

234
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,859
know well.

235
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,326
SAEGEUL21

236
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,010
In our university,

237
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,388
we hold mortality conferences
only to learn from different cases.

238
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:51,807
"Our university?"

239
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,309
Yes.

240
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,145
But he wants us to criticize ourselves
in front of other departments.

241
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,565
This is a warning that the management
will interfere with everything.

242
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,235
We didn't get anyone new
since early last year.

243
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,696
We're all stretched too thin,
and we're barely hanging on.

244
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,991
If they truly want to evaluate efficiency,
they should consider that

245
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,201
rather than publicly shame someone
who did his best.

246
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,336
Chief.

247
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,005
How long are you going to keep quiet?

248
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,362
RESULT OF THE VOTE ON THE STRIKE

249
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,363
RESULT: 81.3% AGREE

250
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,365
DEMANDS: GRANT REGULAR STATUS
TO TEMPORARY WORKERS

251
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,283
OPEN TRAUMA AND BURN CENTER,
HIRE MORE PERSONNEL

252
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,414
He opened a can of worms.

253
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,209
It's not his fault.
Everyone is set to go on strike.

254
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,921
That's because someone blabbed about
the reason behind the relocation decision.

255
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,839
They're all selfish,
so they would've been fine

256
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,257
as long as it didn't concern them.

257
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,433
Following two private hospitals

258
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,977
and one public university hospital,

259
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,729
Sangkook University Hospital
is fourth in revenue.

260
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,439
So, we don't dominate the market,

261
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,233
and the profits are barely there.

262
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,569
But it's impressive that they've been
maintaining their Big Five status.

263
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,655
The other hospitals

264
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,491
strive to make it into the Big Five.

265
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,035
It means that it can lose its place
in a second.

266
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,788
Everyone makes money the same way.

267
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,876
There are two very basic methods.

268
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,005
Charge the consumers more

269
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,673
or cut labor costs.

270
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:49,800
Which of the two should we go with?

271
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,719
A hospital's consumers are patients.

272
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,721
We can't just raise
the price of treatments.

273
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,014
If those departments are gone,

274
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,349
there will be a considerable reduction
in labor costs.

275
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,394
-And the OR utilization rate?
-Even if we designate three ORs

276
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:03,605
only for emergency operations,

277
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,983
we can raise the utilization rate by 12%.

278
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,444
We have 35 ORs in our hospital,

279
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,571
but setting aside three does that? How?

280
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,656
The chiefs don't like to wait,

281
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,616
so they book a few in advance,

282
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,285
but no one can complain.

283
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:20,164
Then the surgeries keep getting delayed,
and the utilization rate drops.

284
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,876
If a hospital is particularly good
at certain types of surgeries,

285
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,961
ORs can be specialized
for those specific surgeries.

286
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,298
However, Sangkook's evaluation
was that although it is good overall,

287
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,924
there is nothing that it is the best at

288
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,801
in particular.

289
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,846
Let's say we maximized the utilization
rate. Are there any surgeries

290
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,639
that lead to more losses
if we perform more?

291
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,141
There are surprisingly many.

292
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,351
Since patients don't pay
for the surgeries in full,

293
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:45,189
the hospital must collect fees
from the health insurance service.

294
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,149
But they don't even pay enough
to cover the cost.

295
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:52,780
It's our first time evaluating a hospital,
so we only just found out.

296
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,574
It's like when production
creates losses in factories.

297
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:59,411
So, if you want to convert those losses
into profits…

298
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,247
We can't do anything about how much
the health insurance service pays.

299
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,042
The quickest way
is to provide more non-covered treatments

300
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,377
that require patients to pay 100%.

301
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,255
Those treatments don't really
have a fixed price.

302
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,218
-Okay, then we can set aside three ORs.
-Okay.

303
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,428
Let's start with the areas
that are not covered

304
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,681
such as obesity, smoking cessation,
hair loss, and anti-aging.

305
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,975
Cosmetic procedures are specialties
of midsized

306
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,936
and small hospitals, so we could do harm…

307
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,565
Yes, sir.

308
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:35,072
Ms. Kang, where do you want to hold
your parents' funeral when they pass away?

309
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:35,989
Pardon?

310
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,075
Why is he mentioning…

311
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,411
What about you, Mr. Gu?

312
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,459
Funeral parlors in this country
aren't just for funerals.

313
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,212
It's a means to display

314
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,673
the child's social status and filial love.

315
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,969
Even people who don't care
where their own ashes are spread

316
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,097
won't send their parents off
to some hick town hospital.

317
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,390
Why not?

318
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,475
Because they'll look bad.

319
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,522
Let's expand the funeral parlor,
which people will not skimp on cost,

320
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:12,192
and the Health Examination Center,
which guarantees a high return.

321
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,028
Expand the pay-for-performance program.

322
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:15,946
Yes, sir.

323
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,158
Schedule a meeting
with Chairman Hong Seong-chan of QL.

324
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,244
With QL's chairman? Okay.

325
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,663
And let's start a subsidiary.

326
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:25,873
What needs to be done?

327
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,583
I'll look into it.

328
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,253
What else is there

329
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,881
that patients will pay
regardless of what we charge?

330
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,424
There is something.

331
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,802
When my baby got sick recently,
the cost of surgery was insane.

332
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,429
Your child was sick?

333
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:44,433
Oh, my. No, not my child. My dog.

334
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,769
There's no insurance for pets.

335
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,731
How much was it? They charged me
millions of won.

336
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,579
Mr. Gu. Everyone wants to interview you

337
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,457
about uncovering the medication error.
Do you want to do it?

338
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,342
Since we don't know anything,
we have no choice

339
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,637
but to believe what the doctors say.

340
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,015
They said it was meningitis.

341
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,602
They said there was nothing they could do.

342
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,312
But they…

343
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,773
killed my husband.

344
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,317
How is this different from murder?

345
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,654
If it weren't for the president,
we would have…

346
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,657
The president of Sangkook
University Hospital told you first?

347
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,616
Yes.

348
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,576
Thanks to him,

349
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,120
at least we know the truth now.

350
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,790
At least he apologized

351
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,918
for the doctors covering it up, but…

352
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,671
My husband is dead.

353
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,215
He died because he was given
the wrong medication,

354
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,092
but the doctors didn't notify you,

355
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,427
and the management uncovered it?

356
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,513
I had no idea…

357
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,603
It's been the most trending article
all day.

358
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,606
They already found out about the resident
who gave the wrong medication.

359
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,234
I think he's a first year.

360
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,027
Isn't the timing a bit suspicious?

361
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,446
It diverted attention from the strike.

362
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,907
We just need to do our jobs.

363
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,993
We don't get involved
in hospital management.

364
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,245
What's going on in there?

365
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,374
JIN-WOO

366
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:50,017
JIN-WOO…

367
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,402
SANGKOOK HOSPITAL STRIKE

368
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,780
MANAGEMENT REVEALED PAST MEDICATION ERROR

369
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,490
MEDICATION ERROR IN SANGKOOK HOSPITAL

370
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:12,164
MOM

371
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,508
Mom.

372
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,260
Seon-woo.

373
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,346
My gosh. My son.

374
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,099
My gosh.

375
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,187
Why are you dressed so lightly?

376
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,939
Although it is spring, it is still cold.

377
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,692
You should've at least worn a scarf.

378
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,528
Spring is over. It's summer now.

379
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,988
Listen to me.

380
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,532
I can never stop worrying about you.

381
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,535
Aren't you old enough to know better?

382
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,462
Don't forget to take this home later.

383
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,049
I made your favorites including
scallion kimchi and braised lotus root.

384
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,842
I made these all day long.

385
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,428
You come back from Europe
and bring us side dishes?

386
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,680
There's nothing to buy in Europe.

387
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,432
We have all the pretty stuff here.

388
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,185
Jin-woo likes scallion kimchi, not me.

389
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,020
I don't even eat that.

390
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,397
How old are you?
You shouldn't be so picky.

391
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,233
You need to eat better.

392
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,069
I've gained weight from eating so well.

393
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,780
Don't be ridiculous. You're so scrawny.

394
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,490
Am I?

395
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,410
Yes. You're all skin and bone. Goodness.

396
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,835
Hello.

397
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,003
This way, please.

398
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,810
Hold on. Let me get the chairs.

399
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,617
May I take your order?

400
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,164
Two dried corvina sets, please.

401
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,291
All right. It will be right up.

402
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,756
Where did you like the best? France?

403
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,551
Spain.

404
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,636
The food was a bit salty,

405
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,434
but the men were so good-looking.

406
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,562
All the men I ran into
were as handsome as James Bond.

407
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:44,107
Put sunglasses on them,
and they'd all look like actors.

408
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,568
It must not have been fun
for your husband.

409
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,903
The women were…

410
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,073
-Mom.
-Yes?

411
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,413
He says he'll go back by himself
next year.

412
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,750
He saw young people… Was it Santiago?

413
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,544
He saw them walking the pilgrimage route,
and he wants to do it too.

414
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,885
He said to make sure
to thank Jin-woo for him.

415
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,637
-He did?
-Yes.

416
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,596
For what?

417
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,098
His brother was at Jin-woo's hospital

418
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,267
for colitis before.

419
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,478
I didn't know, but I guess

420
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:25,065
he asked the doctor
to take extra good care of him.

421
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,903
He said he was treated like a VIP
thanks to him and was super happy.

422
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,366
Having a doctor son paid off.
You got to look good to your in-laws.

423
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,742
Of course.

424
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,704
And I don't have just one, but two.

425
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,540
At my age, bragging about your children

426
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,709
brings more joy
than bragging about wealth.

427
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,796
Everybody calls me a doctor's mom,
you know.

428
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,560
What did your brother say?

429
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,813
About what?

430
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,775
I heard that his hospital
is going on strike.

431
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,072
I only read articles about it.

432
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,616
He wasn't answering his phone.

433
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:21,788
It's nearly impossible to speak
with him on the phone.

434
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,547
Seon-woo.

435
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,218
It's really cold out today.

436
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,303
Let's hurry home.

437
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,680
Put this on.

438
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,601
How was class today?

439
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:45,770
Let's just go home.

440
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,609
I don't think things are the same anymore
after Director Lee passed away.

441
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,655
Gosh. Every time I think about it…

442
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,414
Had I known he'd pass away like that,

443
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,875
I would've called him…

444
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,086
and asked him how he was doing
at least one more time.

445
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,422
Mom.

446
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,215
Yes?

447
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,010
It's getting cold.

448
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,181
When I saw his picture at the funeral,

449
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,976
I wondered how such a thing…

450
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,729
could happen to him all of a sudden…

451
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,190
You went to the funeral?

452
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,944
Of course, I did.

453
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,572
With your husband?

454
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,700
No. Why would he go?
He doesn't even know Director Lee.

455
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,035
You should've gone with me.

456
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,662
I just ended up going alone.

457
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,705
What about Jin-woo?

458
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,999
You should've stopped by to see him.

459
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,251
I stopped by the ER,

460
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,544
but he seemed busy.

461
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,422
At least I got to see his face.

462
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,597
Should I ask him to come?

463
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:04,724
Do you think he can?

464
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,976
Or should we go to him?

465
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,608
Jin-woo, can you come out?

466
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,319
Tell him we'll go to him if he's busy.

467
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,613
Yes, I'm with Mom. Yes.

468
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:21,991
Okay.

469
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,369
Oh, well.

470
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:26,454
Okay.

471
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,584
Plans? At this hour?

472
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,394
Don't give it to me.

473
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,520
Eat up.

474
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,439
Eat this. I deboned this for you.

475
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,486
My gosh. You're all grown up.

476
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,864
Of course, I am.

477
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,820
TA patient. A truck hit his chest
and ran over his hip.

478
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,241
Get a CT and find out if we can get
a cardiothoracic surgeon right away.

479
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,493
Okay.

480
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,996
Can anyone operate
on a TA patient right away?

481
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,415
In 15 minutes? Okay.

482
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,460
-Contact Orthopedics later. Get GS first.
-Okay.

483
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,721
He has a tension pneumothorax.
Prepare for a CTA.

484
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,681
-Run a blood test for transfusion.
-Take these.

485
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,439
Rosette K is available.
Dr. Joo can operate in an hour.

486
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,524
Okay.

487
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,205
Scissors.

488
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,291
Here's the tube.

489
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,881
Right now? Okay.

490
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,970
Dr. Joo just arrived.
He'll start right away.

491
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,975
Excuse me.

492
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,405
I'm sorry I'm late.

493
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,159
You're with Saegeul21, right?

494
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,203
I'm Choi Seo-hyeon. It's nice to meet you.

495
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,168
I'm Ye Jin-woo.

496
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,921
I've never met anyone
with the last name Ye.

497
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,050
You should say, "I've met many."

498
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,761
You always do.

499
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,139
It isn't a common last name.

500
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,649
I'm sorry I'm late.

501
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,740
Excuse me.
Where can I find Dr. Ye Jin-woo?

502
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,409
He's treating an urgent patient right now.

503
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,594
Why aren't you eating this?

504
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,180
What happened to the patient?

505
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,475
-Pardon?
-He was bleeding a lot.

506
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,106
Did you think I would just sit here
and wait around for someone

507
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,857
who was an hour late without even calling?

508
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,609
I'm sorry.

509
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,153
You apologized three times already.

510
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,532
I thought you'd need this.

511
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,372
Excuse me.

512
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,331
Yes?

513
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,376
-Do you mind if I go get some coffee?
-Go ahead.

514
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,842
One iced Americano, please.

515
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,593
I'll ring that up for you.

516
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:57,363
She's pretty.

517
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,158
Go away.

518
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,161
By the way,

519
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,580
doesn't she seem familiar?

520
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,332
Ask her if you've met before--

521
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,333
Get lost.

522
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,968
That malicious jerk is making life hell
for all of us.

523
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,138
Do I really have to look through
all these old records?

524
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,974
Cardiothoracic Surgery
is freaking out too.

525
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,728
Even we, doctors, don't interfere
in other departments' business.

526
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,979
Who is he to talk?

527
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,065
He knows nothing. Who gives him the right
to judge and evaluate us?

528
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,442
Shit. He's not even a doctor.

529
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,236
Someone has to make a fuss
about things like this.

530
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,113
We, doctors, couldn't do it,

531
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,324
and that is why
the Cancer Center incident occurred.

532
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,034
Was it you?

533
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,537
-What?
-Only one person in our department

534
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,538
voted against striking.

535
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,584
Gosh. You must feel so wronged.

536
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,544
You're the only one
who took Mr. Gu's side,

537
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,296
but he dumped all the work on you.

538
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,840
-I didn't take his side--
-Gosh.

539
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,197
JIN-WOO

540
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,302
"Malicious jerk."

541
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,429
Is he really one?

542
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,022
NO-EUL

543
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,608
Sorry.

544
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,528
You were talking about
the pay-for-performance program.

545
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,281
We are not opposed to it

546
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,117
because we don't like competition
or being ranked.

547
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,786
It's fundamentally different from seeing

548
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,205
who sells more of the same product
manufactured in a factory.

549
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,958
It's about who orders more tests

550
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,043
and performs
more costly surgical procedures.

551
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,962
For example, a doctor can order

552
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,423
a million-won test for a patient
when a more inexpensive one

553
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,300
is enough to diagnose the disease.

554
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,635
It would be worse for surgeries.

555
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,305
So it must vary drastically
based on the doctor's judgment.

556
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,266
This was the first thing the new president
initiated as soon as he started.

557
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,477
I can only say that he made it clear

558
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,604
what his objectives were.

559
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,607
Was the report
about the death at the Cancer Center

560
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:41,027
fabricated by the management as well?

561
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,613
No.

562
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,367
You can't criticize the management
entirely, then.

563
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,829
Does that happen often?

564
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,711
Medical errors are prevalent
in the hospital, right?

565
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,679
At times,

566
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,808
when I ask something difficult to answer,
an awkward silence persists.

567
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,978
It becomes obvious that the person
is trying to protect him or herself.

568
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,483
I don't think cornering an interviewee
for an answer

569
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,234
necessarily makes a good interview.

570
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,029
But not answering is an answer in itself.

571
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,866
I've decided to ask
the difficult questions myself,

572
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:29,950
so…

573
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,290
There are different levels
of medical errors.

574
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,501
What levels?

575
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:42,505
Near miss, adverse, and sentinel errors.

576
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:45,758
Those are the three levels of errors
categorized by the level of danger.

577
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:49,387
Based on how fatal the error was?

578
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,014
Yes. It also varies by who made the error.

579
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,766
If it was a doctor,
it was a prescription error.

580
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,267
A nurse, an administration error.

581
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,436
If it was a pharmacist,
we call it a preparation error.

582
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,314
Sometimes it's the patient's fault.

583
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,982
The names are so detailed.

584
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,736
The fact that they've been
categorized like that

585
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,572
means errors occur that often,
whether they be mistakes or accidents.

586
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,157
We're human too.

587
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,247
How bad must it be for you people
to announce it publicly?

588
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,125
You never do, do you?

589
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,503
You'd never announce it
before it somehow gets out, right?

590
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,422
Like anyone would know.

591
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,550
You assholes.

592
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,429
I repeat. Like anyone would know.

593
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,393
What's your problem?

594
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,186
I'm not like that.

595
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:43,983
You only care about profit.
Why do you care about such a thing?

596
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,735
They're not mutually exclusive.
I'll accomplish both.

597
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,654
Quality and profit.

598
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,157
You'll see once you've been through it.

599
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,968
If you'd like, I'll send you the draft
before it gets published

600
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,052
so that you can review it.

601
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,221
Okay. Thank you.

602
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,139
By the way…

603
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,849
Yes?

604
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,350
Well…

605
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,520
By any chance, have we met before?

606
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,940
I think it's a bit clichéd line…

607
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:28,360
No. It's not like that.

608
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,237
I really feel like we've met before.

609
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,990
Thank you for your time today.

610
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,263
Are you expecting someone?

611
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,562
Who…

612
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,356
You know. The one I told you about.

613
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,442
-Who?
-Dr. Lee No-eul.

614
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,196
Why is she here?

615
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,573
So, that's her.

616
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:15,991
Yes.

617
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,440
I'm Lee No-eul from Pediatrics.

618
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,110
Okay.

619
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,447
Mr. Gu.

620
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,952
You haven't been to all
of our wards yet, have you?

621
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,456
I thought it'd be easier for you
to do your job

622
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,749
if you saw things for yourself.

623
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,586
Do you have some time?

624
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,340
Shall I show you around?

625
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,932
Sure.

626
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,665
You're still up?

627
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,625
When is my mommy coming?

628
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,253
It's too dark for her to come right now.

629
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,797
Go to sleep
and let's wait for her tomorrow.

630
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,259
Go to bed.

631
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,886
Or you'll get sick and need to get a shot.

632
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:25,722
Go on.

633
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:26,765
Good night.

634
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,148
This is the general ward.

635
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,233
That's the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

636
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,280
When is my mommy coming?

637
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,658
She'll be here soon,
so go inside and get some sleep.

638
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,496
What is his condition?

639
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,457
He had pneumonia.

640
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:53,625
Where's his guardian?

641
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,211
We can't reach her.

642
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,965
The child is sick,
but the parent can't be reached?

643
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,135
His mom had him admitted.

644
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,221
She came with him at first, but…

645
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,812
He doesn't require treatment,

646
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,939
so it doesn't cost us much.

647
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,316
He won't be here forever, either.

648
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,234
He'll be moved soon.

649
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:25,908
This way.

650
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,999
You need to put this over your shoes
and sterilize your hands here.

651
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,890
KIM TAE-MIN

652
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,408
MOTHER'S NAME: CHOI SEONG-JU

653
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,547
How's the cyanosis?

654
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,216
The baby didn't show cyanosis today,

655
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,094
but the heart isn't beating normally yet.

656
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,596
Keep checking the blood pressure.

657
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,206
The mother had preeclampsia.

658
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,628
The baby suffered hypoxia,
so we almost lost him.

659
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,682
We adopted kangaroo care a few years ago.

660
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,185
We prohibited all contact in the past.

661
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,148
It's the first time in 74 days

662
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,360
that the mother nestles her son
in her arms.

663
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:58,662
This unit is for premature babies
born weighing 2.5kg or less.

664
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,040
This is the area
that requires the most care.

665
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,251
Well, it is the same everywhere.

666
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,298
Dr. Lee.

667
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,259
Excuse me.

668
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,182
Yes?

669
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,185
What time?

670
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:24,938
There's a risk of a hernia…

671
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,189
Thank you.

672
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,191
Mr. Gu.

673
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,862
No. Please prepare for ultrasonography.

674
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,243
I'll be right there.

675
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,036
Okay.

676
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,178
Should I not have done that?

677
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,847
Is he really a malicious jerk?

678
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,913
Why aren't you asking me about your mommy?

679
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,041
Mommy?

680
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,293
My mommy?

681
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,139
Oh, no.

682
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,602
My goodness.

683
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,527
Why are you out here? Don't cry.

684
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,404
Go to sleep. That way Mommy will come.

685
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,074
She'll be here tomorrow. Come on.

686
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,951
Good boy.

687
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,211
A bug will fly into your mouth.

688
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,172
You're going into where?

689
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,633
It's nothing.

690
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:17,921
You're still up?

691
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,975
It's all stuff you like.
Eat them all this time.

692
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,149
I read articles about your hospital.

693
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:43,947
Mom saw the articles, too. I think
she came because she was worried.

694
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,158
She's always worried.

695
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:50,120
She went to Director Lee's funeral
by herself.

696
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,707
She must've needed to get closure alone.

697
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,167
Closure? Why would she need that?

698
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,837
You know about them.

699
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,965
Too bad it didn't work out between them.

700
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,967
It could've worked out well.

701
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,343
What are you talking about?

702
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:08,680
Don't make it sound like
they had an affair.

703
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,891
From the day we first met him,
Director Lee was a married man.

704
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,935
And if he wasn't?
It would've been okay then?

705
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,271
He isn't Mom's type.

706
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,440
He has no sense of humor.

707
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,987
We should've let her start over
with someone new sooner.

708
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,490
Whether it be Director Lee
or someone else.

709
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,493
Why did we think

710
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,121
that we were protecting her back then?

711
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:43,965
I'll pick it up…

712
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,347
Sorry.

713
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,142
For what?

714
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,064
Turn that on.

715
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,523
I told you to eat the food.

716
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,318
She worked hard to make them.

717
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,053
SAEGEUL21

718
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,503
I'm not sleeping.

719
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,339
Sleep in the bedroom.

720
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:09,425
Your dad's snoring.

721
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,810
Gosh.

722
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,110
Gosh.

723
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:32,073
Go sleep in your bed.
You'll hurt your back.

724
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,410
Mother.

725
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,955
Was I sick often as a child?

726
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:44,252
Children get sick all the time.

727
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,635
Are you sick?

728
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:54,512
No.

729
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,806
You scared me.

730
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,110
Your hospital…

731
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,111
Yes?

732
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,406
It keeps coming out on the news.

733
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,407
I know.

734
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,243
So?

735
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,747
What?

736
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:37,699
MORTALITY CONFERENCE
ON VARICOSE VEIN SURGERY DEATH

737
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,703
It had been 15 months
since the initial diagnosis.

738
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:44,163
It had been 15 months
since the initial diagnosis, and…

739
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,391
Where's Dr. Yang?

740
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,435
He went ahead.

741
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,355
It is unusual.

742
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,110
Nothing is usual
in this hospital these days.

743
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,072
I was referring to the death
during phlebectomy.

744
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,830
Do you enjoy throwing stones at us

745
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,832
along with the others?

746
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:33,713
A long time ago…

747
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:51,230
MORTALITY CONFERENCE
ON VARICOSE VEIN SURGERY DEATH

748
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:09,707
We'll begin with Dr. Ye Jin-woo
from Emergency Medicine.

749
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,546
The patient was admitted
to the ER on April 7.

750
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,008
He had difficulty walking
due to severe pain.

751
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,113
Like he'd understand
what we are talking about.

752
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,240
Does that matter right now?

753
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,242
-He's here to show off his authority.
-"Show off"?

754
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,961
I performed the initial examination.

755
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,797
The sonogram showed varicose veins,
so I transferred him

756
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,173
to Cardiothoracic Surgery.

757
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:03,594
The patient said his previous doctor
had said he had varicose veins

758
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:07,181
and had taken naftazone.

759
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,810
Why did you conduct
a basic examination knowing that?

760
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,645
At the time--

761
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,949
At the time, it had been 15 months
since the initial diagnosis.

762
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,661
He had stopped taking the medication
for four months as well.

763
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,831
Thus, I considered the chance
that his condition had worsened.

764
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,249
Any special conditions?

765
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,711
None. That was all for our department.

766
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,423
Dr. Choi Yeong-jin from Anesthesiology.

767
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,424
Yes.

768
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,551
What was the cause of death?

769
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:48,723
The cause of death was anaphylactic shock.

770
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:51,225
ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK:
SHOCK FROM SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION

771
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:54,562
Around 3:15 p.m. on April 8,

772
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:58,274
I administered Robinul and Midazolam
via intramuscular injection,

773
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,278
then I administered a 2.5% solution
of Pentothal for his anesthesia.

774
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,364
At the onset of the anesthesia,

775
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:08,367
his blood pressure was 110 over 60,
his heart rate was 80 beats per minute,

776
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,411
his breathing rate
was under 20 breaths per minute,

777
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,246
and his body temperature was normal.

778
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,791
About five minutes after the anesthesia,

779
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,960
his blood pressure dropped to 90 over 50,

780
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,754
and about ten minutes later,

781
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:22,340
it dropped drastically to 50 over 30,

782
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,383
and his heart rate
went up to 140 beats per minute.

783
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,636
His vitals showed that he went into shock.

784
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,430
Did his surgery consent form

785
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:32,183
indicate any history of anaphylaxis?

786
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:36,979
No. As Emergency Medicine
mentioned earlier,

787
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,107
there was no history
of receiving surgery or anesthesia,

788
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,109
so I'm sure even the patient did not know.

789
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,654
Any other conditions?

790
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,949
He had minor bronchial spasms,
but according to the order…

791
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:53,204
from Dr. Yang,

792
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,581
I administered dopamine and ephedrine.

793
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,584
What was the patient's state after that?

794
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,296
The low blood pressure persisted
for 15 minutes, and…

795
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:04,799
his heart stopped.

796
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,563
Cardiothoracic Surgery…

797
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,068
Dr. Yang Jun-hui.

798
01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:26,737
Please explain why you deduced

799
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:29,866
that the patient went into shock
and what you did to treat it thereafter.

800
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:37,373
After his blood pressure dropped
and heart rate increased,

801
01:04:38,082 --> 01:04:40,293
he had bronchial spasms,

802
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:44,672
but his arterial blood gas
and electrolyte analysis

803
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:46,924
didn't indicate anything unusual,

804
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,386
so I deduced
that he went into anaphylactic shock.

805
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:54,181
When did you administer epinephrine?

806
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:59,103
I administered it immediately
through continuous IV infusion.

807
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:02,982
Just a minute.

808
01:05:06,193 --> 01:05:07,486
Why was it via IV?

809
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,698
According to the guidelines,
aren't you supposed to

810
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:13,159
administer it intramuscularly
due to potential volume errors

811
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,453
or risk of cardiovascular complications?

812
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,346
Why didn't you administer it
intramuscularly?

813
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,393
Well…

814
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,272
I saw redness on his skin,

815
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,150
so I removed the drape,

816
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:49,487
and he had red spots all over his body.

817
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,740
And his blood pressure dropped… I mean,

818
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,909
his blood pressure had already dropped,

819
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,662
so I didn't think it would be
effective via IM.

820
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,499
That was why I went straight
for an IV injection.

821
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,210
Was that purely your decision?

822
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:09,298
The chart stated Dr. Joo Kyung-moon was
brought in near the end of the operation.

823
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,803
Another reason…
Another reason for ordering the IV

824
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,348
was that there were signs
of circulatory collapse.

825
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,934
The question was not

826
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:23,479
why you ordered the IV,
but who gave the order.

827
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,731
Oh, I see.

828
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,620
I gave the order.

829
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,174
And what happened to the patient?

830
01:06:55,219 --> 01:06:56,220
His heart stopped,

831
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,641
and he died.

832
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:17,491
What's the risk of anaphylactic shock
during general anesthesia?

833
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:18,909
Pardon?

834
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,957
It's 1 in 10,000. It occurs
in 1 in 10,000 anesthesia.

835
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:29,462
I'm Joo Kyung-moon,

836
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,131
the chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

837
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,883
I'm a native of Gimhae.

838
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:37,053
I was born there, grew up there,
and studied there.

839
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,808
I left that place in 2013

840
01:07:43,517 --> 01:07:45,394
because I lost my patients.

841
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,271
I lost 160 patients.

842
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:49,774
I lost them all

843
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:53,069
when the medical center
where I worked was shut down.

844
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,073
I saw

845
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,825
a medical center get shut down.

846
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:02,244
I read countless comments.

847
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,580
"Neglect of duty.

848
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,499
Waste of taxes.

849
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,042
Unfriendly.

850
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:10,377
Huge losses."

851
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,007
There were countless comments
that criticized the medical center

852
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,759
and agreed with the closure.

853
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,848
You, my colleagues,
probably remember it best.

854
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,059
Even if it was old and unfriendly,

855
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:28,062
those welfare recipients, the elderly,
and children

856
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:30,064
had to get treated
at the public medical center.

857
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,776
The primary reason for kicking them out
onto the street

858
01:08:34,735 --> 01:08:35,945
was financial loss.

859
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:40,449
The medical center had been losing
three to four billion won a year.

860
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:42,993
Three to four billion won.

861
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:46,747
That's a lot of money.
And it came from our taxes.

862
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:48,958
However,

863
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,962
do you know what the province's
annual budget for that year was?

864
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,715
It was 12 trillion won.

865
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,970
Only 10% of public medical centers remain

866
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:04,140
because they're getting pushed out
by private hospitals

867
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:06,392
due to financial losses,

868
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,686
but three to four billion won

869
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,605
was only 0.025% of the budget.

870
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,776
I have…

871
01:09:16,694 --> 01:09:18,070
always wanted to ask this.

872
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:22,700
Was that money that precious to you?

873
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:23,742
Did you want

874
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,078
that money that badly?

875
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,624
The real problem
isn't in the center being shut down.

876
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:34,545
The medical center had many problems.
Yes, I admit it.

877
01:09:34,628 --> 01:09:36,672
But discovering a problem

878
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:39,925
is a chance to fix it
and make improvements.

879
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,136
But they just shut it down.

880
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,514
It was our final chance to salvage
the rural medical center,

881
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:46,807
but they got rid of it instead.

882
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,610
Mr. Gu.

883
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:02,489
We, at Cardiothoracic Surgery,
are always short-staffed.

884
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,743
People are quick to explain why.

885
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:09,163
They say young doctors nowadays
flock to fields that are easy

886
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,332
and help them make good money.

887
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:15,085
But not all of the young doctors
are like that.

888
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,128
Then why…

889
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:19,340
are there fewer than 20
new cardiothoracic surgeons

890
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,092
in Korea every year?

891
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:26,764
It's because…

892
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:29,725
hospitals won't invest
in cardiothoracic surgery.

893
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,727
Too many of the surgeries lose money.

894
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,729
It's because

895
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,691
hospitals won't hire them.
There's nowhere for them to work.

896
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:45,324
But we will…

897
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,827
keep walking into the operating room.

898
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,373
Even if we are criticized

899
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,000
and accused of killing a patient…

900
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:58,879
because of a 1 in 10,000 risk.

901
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,763
Did you give Clamoxin
to the patient in Bed 11?

902
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,514
It wasn't checked off.

903
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,434
What if I didn't check
and ended up giving him double doses?

904
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:36,352
I'm sorry.

905
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:40,230
We're no better than the Cancer Center.
We've just been lucky.

906
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:43,067
What do you think
Mr. Gu is planning to do next?

907
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,569
What will he try to get?

908
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,823
What do you see these people as, Mr. Gu?

909
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,535
These people who came here in pain,
asking for our help…

910
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,661
What do you see them as?

911
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,705
What do you think
is the duty of employees?

912
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,999
Isn't it to provide service and get paid?

913
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,127
I can't understand why
you're bringing up your sense of shame.

914
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,839
Mr. Gu will keep doing stuff.
Do you think it'll be his last?

915
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,092
We'll kick him out right away.

916
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:10,928
Will the new director be able to do it?

917
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,264
Please support me.

918
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:17,101
I'll push out Mr. Gu.

919
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:24,483
