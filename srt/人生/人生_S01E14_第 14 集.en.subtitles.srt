1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,306
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,224
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,144
EPISODE 14

4
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:02,812
Dr. Ye, your actions

5
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,356
are not justifiable in any way.

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,318
If you were to prevent unnecessary care,
you should've notified internally.

7
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,363
There were plenty of people you could've
told, including your chief and me.

8
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,116
No doctor blows the whistle
on their colleague

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,659
to a government organization

10
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,661
that tries to stifle us.

11
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,206
You were just trying to make waves.

12
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,211
However, I believe you had a reason.

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,964
Why did you do such a thing?

14
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,885
Of course, he has a reason.

15
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,471
I bet he tried to rat me out
so that you could slander me

16
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,932
and eliminate me
from the election for director.

17
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,144
Are you trying to pretend
that you didn't know

18
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,522
and dump it all on a junior doctor?

19
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,023
Or is this part of the act?

20
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,818
I didn't ask you, Dr. Kim.

21
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,824
I learned from Dr. Kim Tae-sang…

22
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,204
that we should make use of the HIRA.

23
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,463
The hospital quality improvement incentive
from 2017, a total of 360 million won,

24
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,841
was deposited into one
of the staff's personal account.

25
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,099
It was Director Lee Bo-hun's.

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,063
After his death,

27
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,108
someone at the hospital
secretly negotiated with the HIRA

28
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,735
and transferred the money
from Director Lee's account

29
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,863
to the hospital's account.

30
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,701
I don't know how the money was moved
when the account owner was already dead.

31
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,119
The timing was perfect

32
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,871
as if the person was waiting
for him to die!

33
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,958
Whether it was embezzled

34
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,878
or misappropriated, I don't know
how they managed to return the money

35
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,170
that was in a personal account.

36
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,423
Dr. Joo.

37
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:57,719
The deputy director can find out
what happened with that money.

38
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,015
Please be our deputy director.

39
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,100
Please find out what happened.

40
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,855
If Director Lee passed away
due to his illness,

41
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,232
why was he found dead after falling off
someone else's roof?

42
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,193
Please uncover the truth.

43
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,116
Do you think accusing me
would cover up your wrongdoing?

44
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,204
If you make it sound like I was
responsible for the director's death,

45
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,832
do you think you can get away with it?

46
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,926
Do you really think I killed him?

47
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,636
Do you think

48
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,264
I pushed him off of my roof
with these two hands?

49
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,901
You learned it from me?

50
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,987
Are you saying I used the incentive

51
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,073
to frame Bo-hun or something?

52
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,617
How?

53
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,037
You said it was in his personal account,
so how could I have done it?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,170
How did I return it right away
as if I knew about it?

55
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,631
Do you want to know?

56
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,425
Because I knew about it.

57
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,596
Because I knew what Lee Bo-hun was up to.

58
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,270
He's dead anyway,

59
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,023
so I covered up what he did for his sake.

60
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:39,195
This runt must have heard some rumor
and came here to talk nonsense.

61
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,533
You must have heard it from your brother.

62
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,493
My gosh.

63
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,038
How unfair for people who don't have
a family member working at the HIRA.

64
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,833
"What bullshit are you trying to pull?
Are you trying to ruin my life?

65
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,459
-I'll get you for this!"
-You little…

66
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,669
-Stop!
-Hey!

67
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,839
Watch what you say, Dr. Ye.

68
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,259
Calm down. Talk it out.
You don't have to do this.

69
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,346
The two of them…

70
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,432
had an argument…

71
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,475
that day.

72
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,562
The day Director Lee died.

73
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,899
Do you remember now?

74
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,444
It's what you said to the director.

75
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,863
You said he was trying to ruin your life.

76
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,324
What bullshit did he pull?

77
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:28,036
You said you'd get him
for something he did.

78
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,454
Is it really just a coincidence…

79
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,292
that he died that very night?

80
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,682
He's lying!

81
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,769
You didn't have an argument?
Is it all a lie?

82
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,812
It's all a lie.

83
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,522
I heard you.

84
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,906
The day the director died,

85
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,784
I heard you yelling

86
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,952
and having an argument with someone.

87
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,084
The person who walked out of your office
immediately afterward

88
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,087
was our previous director.

89
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,130
I saw it myself.

90
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,057
Lee Bo-hun…

91
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,812
had a myocardial infarction
and fell to death.

92
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,400
Why did you do that to me?

93
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,323
You're the only one
who would touch that bank account.

94
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,784
We've known each other for so long.

95
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,245
You and I have spent more time together

96
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,123
than we have with our family.
How could you do that to me?

97
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,292
Did you hate me that much?

98
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,307
The director and I

99
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,393
had known each other for 30 years.

100
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,436
How could you…

101
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,981
How could you accuse me of such a thing?

102
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,275
Why did you bring Joo Kyung-moon
to our hospital?

103
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,735
I stayed by his side for 30 years

104
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,363
as a friend and as a colleague.

105
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,408
I worked twenty years under you
as your junior doctor

106
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,619
and another ten years
as your deputy director.

107
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:39,542
Who supported you
while you hogged the director position?

108
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,548
While people praised you,
calling you "our benevolent director,"

109
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,758
who took all the hatred?

110
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,387
Do you think I like being the bad guy?

111
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,683
Do you think it doesn't hurt my feelings
when I'm hated?

112
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,937
Do you want to know why Director Lee
died like that in someone else's house?

113
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,564
Do you want to know the truth?

114
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,192
Fine.

115
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,863
Lee Sang-yeop.

116
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,908
Did you say
you reported it to the director?

117
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,910
Did Director Lee really tell you
to cover it up

118
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,578
when you told him that a patient died?

119
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,041
Look me in the eye and say that again.

120
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,877
Did you really report it to him?

121
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,763
Kim Jung-hee.

122
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,599
What did you do when your patient died?

123
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,186
Who went to the family
and got beaten up on your behalf?

124
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,899
How could you not even show up
the entire time?

125
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:49,070
Seo Ji-yong,
do you still grope female patients?

126
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,572
Do you still text the nurses?

127
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,243
Your wife begged and pleaded
with Director Lee not to fire you.

128
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,662
That's the only reason you are still here.
Did you know that?

129
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,458
Hey, Jang Min-gi.

130
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,170
Who said you can allocate organs
to your family first?

131
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,590
Did you think the director
would never find out?

132
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,010
Can any one of you here

133
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,806
say that you didn't suck Lee Bo-hun dry?

134
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,451
Joo Kyung-moon.

135
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,248
You pretended to be aloof
from fame and ambition,

136
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,002
but you gladly took
whatever the director gave you.

137
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,840
Do you really not have any ambition
to become the director?

138
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,761
Why did I do that to you?
Why did you do that to me?

139
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,180
This was my last term.

140
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,891
I wasn't going to run again.

141
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,268
I know.

142
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,146
But it's over for me, too.

143
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,318
Why did you bring Joo Kyung-moon
to our hospital?

144
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,321
Did you think I didn't know?

145
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,450
Why did I do that to you?
Why did you do that to me?

146
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,666
Why do you think

147
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,378
Bo-hun got a myocardial infarction?

148
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,840
Because of you.

149
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,009
You!

150
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,762
Because of all of you!

151
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,973
All of you took bites out of his heart.

152
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,018
For the past ten years,
all of you had done things

153
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,561
that took a toll on his aging heart.

154
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,857
You took a bite out of his heart
whenever you needed to!

155
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,484
So who are you to question me?

156
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,250
Don't you have anything to say
to yourself?

157
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,962
Is that why you had that man

158
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:13,881
do your surgery for you?

159
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,468
To stoop down
to the other people's levels?

160
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,678
To do your part in killing him?

161
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,263
Ye Jin-woo!

162
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,852
Dr. Ye.

163
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,232
In the next ten to twenty years,

164
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,652
this day will come to you for sure.

165
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,406
Patients are pouring in,

166
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:41,242
and the profits keep dropping.

167
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,745
On a day you're running around
like a chicken with its head cut off,

168
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:48,666
taking care of more patients
than you can handle,

169
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,545
a young punk like you
will come and complain to you.

170
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:56,924
"Why aren't you devoting yourself
to each patient?

171
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:02,221
Why can't you be friendly and spend more
time per patient like in other countries?

172
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:07,560
Why are you trapped in the system,
running in a hamster wheel?"

173
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,110
We all live that way.

174
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,739
However, you are the only one

175
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,992
who got suspended.

176
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,328
Good for you.

177
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,170
Sangkook University Hospital

178
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,631
can't dump me.

179
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,217
Not even Mr. Gu
or Director Lee's ghost can't do that!

180
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,427
I'll dump them all!

181
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,681
After accomplishing everything,

182
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,684
I am…

183
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,104
walking out of here on my own.

184
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,900
Goodbye.

185
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,454
Dr. Kim Tae-sang.

186
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:14,126
Even if you leave now, the suspicions
that were raised today remain.

187
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,795
Regarding the incentive

188
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,173
and Director Lee's final moments,

189
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,843
we will investigate thoroughly
and notify you.

190
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,516
CHIEF OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
KIM JUNG-HEE

191
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,486
We've got to do something. Damn it.

192
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,161
Let's resolve the urgent matter first

193
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,413
rather than meet again later.

194
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,915
Are you for

195
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,669
the president's dismissal? We need
two-thirds of the chiefs' agreement.

196
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,630
And the vote for the deputy director.

197
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,569
Mr. Gu is known for destroying
labor unions. He won't be an easy fight.

198
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,458
ECOWORK: INCREASE IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT

199
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,293
DAILY MEDICAL: HEALTH COVERAGE
TO BE INCREASED

200
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,469
Is that possible?

201
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,514
Those punks. How dare they try to dismiss
the person I appointed?

202
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,768
Leave them be.

203
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,480
Let's see if Mr. Gu's still got it.

204
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,274
Yes, sir.

205
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,777
MR. GU WANTS TO SEE YOU

206
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,660
Just say you won't fire them.

207
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,703
You can just cancel it.

208
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,247
Why are you making them resent you?

209
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,543
Why are you going this far?

210
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:03,796
Get back to work.

211
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:05,464
Bye.

212
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,594
Find me some positive laws

213
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,096
regarding drug distribution.

214
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,722
Would you like to review court cases?

215
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,099
Yes.

216
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,935
And find out if a non-profit corporation
can change the ownership

217
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,355
of its real estate to joint ownership
either via trusts or donations.

218
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,899
Not all of its real estate, but a portion.

219
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,067
Yes, sir.

220
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,320
-Go to Director Oh's home right now.
-Pardon?

221
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,448
Yes, sir.

222
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,791
I'll report back as soon as I get there.

223
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,004
Are you heading out?

224
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,131
Yes. Please go in.

225
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,103
Did you hear what happened
in the auditorium?

226
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,648
How did you find out already?

227
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,316
Regardless, you must make preparations.

228
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,403
They may use the fact that you purchased
the land in Songtan

229
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,280
at a price higher
than its fair market value.

230
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,870
You're worrying about something
that will be difficult to prove.

231
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,122
If they demand an explanation,

232
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,917
it will be a nuisance for the headquarters
and the Minister of Environment.

233
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:28,630
They'll try to establish
definitive grounds for my dismissal.

234
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,549
Wouldn't the "they" you referred to

235
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,137
try to contact the people who participated
in the autopsy first?

236
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,597
I'll prevent that.

237
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,223
Of course, you will.

238
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,975
But if they say the hospital president

239
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,436
told them to cover up the cause of death,

240
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,729
it's over.

241
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,857
Let me meet the people

242
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,026
who took part in the autopsy.

243
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,740
You really don't have to worry about them.

244
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,871
Is the headquarters
taking care of the matter?

245
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,583
Yes.

246
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,710
What about Director Oh?

247
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,255
She's quite a handful.
Can they silence her as well?

248
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,134
As you can see.

249
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:21,141
Okay. Fine.

250
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,644
I'm sure you'll do a good job
since this is what you do.

251
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,604
Also,

252
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,233
I heard they appointed
a new deputy director on their own.

253
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,486
I hear he isn't an employee
of the hospital.

254
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:33,612
I'll take care of it.

255
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,700
However, medical institutions really are
different from regular businesses.

256
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,454
It's very difficult to prevent
former employees from entering.

257
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,790
Of course.

258
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,417
There are more outsiders than employees
coming in and out.

259
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,963
We can't stop them at the door
for everyone to see, either.

260
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,560
If they make it another turf war

261
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,771
like they did
when we were planning to go on strike,

262
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,524
Mr. Gu will completely play us again.

263
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,694
Still, we must restore
the trainee nurses' salaries.

264
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,320
Getting 400,000 won is ridiculous.

265
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,324
While we're at it, let's stop them
from forcing us to offer non-covered items

266
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,660
and get rid of
the pay-for-performance program too.

267
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,036
We should take care of them too.

268
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,873
But there are people who benefit
from the pay-for-performance program…

269
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,750
The director and I

270
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,919
had known each other for 30 years.

271
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,131
I stayed by his side for 30 years

272
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,466
as a friend and as a colleague.

273
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,303
What were you thinking?

274
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,763
How long did you think you could hide it?

275
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,141
Who said that?

276
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,434
Can any one of you here

277
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,021
say that you didn't suck Lee Bo-hun dry?

278
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,816
Anyway, should we let the police know

279
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,484
that the director had an argument

280
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,154
with the deputy director the day he died?

281
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,784
I'll see you later.

282
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,827
Okay.

283
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,381
You punk. Who's your department chief?

284
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,550
I'm starting to get really hurt.

285
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,054
Hey, if you wanted to recommend
someone for the position of director

286
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,306
or deputy director, you should've
recommended me,

287
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,892
your chief, not Joo Kyung-moon.

288
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,645
You're helping others and not me.

289
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,815
What? Don't smile, you jerk.

290
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,193
I'll keep my eyes wide open and watch

291
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,487
how much better Kyung-moon is than I am.

292
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,365
You can't open your eyes wide
even if you try.

293
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,533
Let's go, Chief.

294
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,787

Excuse me.

302
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,328
KIM EUN-HA

303
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,296
Dr. Ye…

304
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,718
You wanted to save your ass.

305
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,303
You wondered what you could do

306
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,971
-to remain in Seoul.
-Why was it via IV?

307
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,098
-You're doctors. You're nurses.
-You won't be sent

308
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,308
-to Naksan.
-If you go,

309
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,435
-those people won't die.
-They work hard

310
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,811
-to put…
-You should be ashamed.

311
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,823
Relocation. Termination.

312
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,286
Removing the entire department
or firing one at a time…

313
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,498
That's all you know how to do, right?

314
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,835
I bet you didn't even think
of alternatives.

315
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,213
Is that how you got this far?

316
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,591
Using others' workplace
as your playground?

317
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,843
Everyone has a specialty.

318
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,679
Just as you're good at…

319
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,682
ratting on others.

320
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,394
Either by hiding behind a dead man

321
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,730
or anonymously filing a complaint.

322
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,026
I guess you didn't like that.

323
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,738
I'll show you my other specialty now.

324
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,033
I won't hide or cover things up.

325
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,786
I'll face you head-on.

326
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,248
Sorry, but…

327
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,376
I deal only with my employees.

328
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,130
Stop annoying me.

329
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,973
May I take a look?

330
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,077
Someone wanted to show you this.

331
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,914
She said that if you saw things yourself,

332
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,293
even you would change.

333
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,384
She believed that you'd come to embrace us

334
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,720
once you understood how things work here.

335
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,182
She said you weren't different from us.

336
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,771
However,
you've been seeing this all along.

337
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,569
You saw this every single day,
but you didn't change.

338
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,405
Both the group who tried to change you

339
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:52,657
and the group
who tried to fight you failed.

340
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,659
That's why…

341
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,206
we decided to change the person
who sits there.

342
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,625
You must think you'll succeed in that.

343
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,085
However…

344
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,379
I mean, it's your choice,

345
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:08,965
but do you really have time for this?

346
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:13,303
If I were you, I'd take this opportunity
to take a few months off

347
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,306
and devote my time to your brother.

348
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,351
What does he have to do with this?

349
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,647
We do not need your concern.
We are doing just fine.

350
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,398
Mind your own business.

351
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,653
You're doing just fine?

352
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,321
Attack me, if you want.

353
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,823
You have no right to use him to mock me.

354
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,327
Let's not touch each other's families.

355
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,798
Dr. Ye.

356
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,260
Consider today as your last day here

357
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,346
or you will get dragged out like a dog

358
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,765
in front of patients.

359
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,106
Do you like living like that?

360
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,108
Do you enjoy destroying
every place you go?

361
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,527
If you were going to hurt
everyone you meet,

362
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,281
why did you come here?

363
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,243
This is where we save people.

364
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:19,411
My job is to create,

365
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,121
protect,

366
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,748
and expand.

367
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,458
That's what you think.

368
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,051
Do you want to know
what it truly feels like

369
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,722
to be hurt and destroyed?

370
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:04,831
PRINT

371
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:06,082
Yes?

372
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,590
-Dr. Joo.
-Can you get that for me?

373
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,057
CHUNGYE HOSPITAL'S SUBSIDIARY INVESTMENT

374
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,225
CONFLICT OF INTEREST CASE
OF PHARMACEUTICAL DISTRIBUTOR

375
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,771
NEW PHARMACEUTICAL AFFAIRS ACT

376
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,109
"Pharmaceutical distributors cannot supply
drugs to medical institutions

377
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:35,695
that they have
a special relationship with."

378
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,866
I found everything I could use
against Mr. Gu, but…

379
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,992
What's bothering you?

380
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,414
He was too blatant about calling it
a subsidiary.

381
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,879
I'm sure someone like him
would have looked up the law.

382
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,672
"I formed a subsidiary.

383
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,925
You must purchase drugs only from them."

384
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,510
He was too blatant about it.

385
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,304
A subsidiary is more
than just a special relationship.

386
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,098
It's definitely a violation of the law.

387
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:08,061
Right. However, he pretty much announced
that he broke the law.

388
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,773
But even with what we have,
it's enough to kick him out.

389
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,317
They're all causes for dismissal.

390
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,320
Misconduct, code violations,
and engagement in illegal activities.

391
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,530
That's right.

392
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,907
Let's push forward with this.

393
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,954
Your codes are locked too, right?

394
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,165
I cannot see outpatients
or perform surgeries.

395
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,168
I've been deleted.

396
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,840
I ought to kill that son of a bitch.

397
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,509
You say things like that too?

398
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,302
This is all bullshit.

399
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,887
If I didn't have to restrain myself…

400
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,806
Those bastards…

401
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,436
My gosh.

402
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,979
Anyway,

403
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,774
about Director Lee and the incentive…

404
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,278
Could Mr. Gu be behind that, too?

405
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,074
The incentive was deposited
into Director Lee's account in January.

406
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,368
That was before Mr. Gu came.

407
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,661
It was before he was appointed.

408
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,914
Well, there's no reason for Mr. Gu
to go after Director Lee

409
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,166
even before he got appointed.

410
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,334
He wouldn't have done that
even before he took the job.

411
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,212
Fine.

412
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,715
Let's go with this.

413
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,348
Dr. Joo.

414
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,642
What?

415
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,319
Is Seon-woo sick?

416
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,416
You should

417
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,376
ask your brother.

418
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,658
Mr. Gu…

419
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,830
Mr. Gu wouldn't know, would he?

420
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,334
About what?

421
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,755
About Seon-woo.

422
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,418
You said you were bringing a friend.

423
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,005
I did.

424
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,966
It's nice to meet you. I'm Ye Seon-woo.

425
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,844
I'm Joo Kyung-moon.

426
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,640
Ye Seon-woo? We have someone with
the same last name in Emergency Medicine.

427
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,392
Ye Jin-woo. Ye Seon-woo.

428
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,562
-You're right.
-I am?

429
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,523
That's right. He's Jin-woo's brother.

430
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,443
They look alike.
They both have fair skin, you know.

431
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,824
Dr. Joo,

432
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,328
you're treating the director's friend
of over 30 years.

433
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:56,706
He's the most important patient
of your career. Treat him well.

434
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,584
He's clearly young enough to be your son.
Stop calling him your friend.

435
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,345

MS. KANG

439
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,501
Hello?

440
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,004
Director Oh?

441
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,549
Are you okay?

442
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,890
What happened?

443
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,854
Are you hesitant to tell me
because Ms. Kang is there?

444
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,564
She's used to this kind of matter,

445
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,191
so feel free to tell me what happened.

446
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,072
Okay.

447
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,609
She says she doesn't care about
anything else, but because of her child…

448
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,447
Since they know where she lives,
she's worried

449
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,075
that they might do something to her child.

450
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,743
Director Oh asked

451
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,745
if he ever messed with children.

452
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,583
What did you say to her?

453
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,585
What could I say?

454
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:33,256
I couldn't lie to her, saying the chairman
would never do such a thing.

455
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,843
I told her you were taking care of it

456
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,678
and asked her to trust you and wait.

457
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,890
Okay.

458
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,642
Take care of it quietly.

459
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,565
That sounds good.

460
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:28,769
Are you on the first floor?

461
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,611
Dr. Joo, you'll come in tomorrow, right?

462
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,946
Of course. Not just tomorrow.

463
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,617
That's right.
You're the deputy director now.

464
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,664
By the way, why were you…

465
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,168
I don't know if it's okay for me
to ask you this.

466
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,048
I just don't understand
why you were kicked out.

467
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,052
Who could know what Mr. Gu is thinking?

468
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,179
Should I drop you off at that building?

469
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,556
Yes. Right there.

470
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,643
I keep troubling you.

471
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,728
It's not very far anyway.

472
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,236
Thanks. Get home safely.

473
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,737
-Good night.
-You too.

474
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,170
Since a while ago?

475
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,256
I doubt it…

476
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,472
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

477
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,431
Okay.

478
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,146
CHODANG-DONG, HANSEONG-GU

479
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:31,976
Get out.

480
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,483
Excuse me! Please help me!

481
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,698
What's going on?

482
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,408
This car has been following me
for a while.

483
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,702
I said to get out!

484
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:53,372
You have such a loud voice
for a petite lady.

485
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,207
What does my voice have to do with this?

486
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,836
I dragged him all the way here. How can I
trust the police if you act like this?

487
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,592
Hey, you. Open the door.

488
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,262
Hey. Mister.

489
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,477
You're mistaken…

490
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,563
You look pretty normal.
Show me your license.

491
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,818
Dr. Lee?

492
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,154
Don't you remember me?

493
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,572
How could I…

494
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,033
I'll take you home.

495
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,284
Who are you?

496
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,161
You called for a designated driver.

497
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,664
Do you know him?

498
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,502
Why did you follow someone you know?
That's more suspicious. Get out.

499
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:44,548
I'm sorry, sir.

500
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,719
Okay. Just go home.

501
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,347
But Mr. Gu, I can't…

502
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:53,724
Mr. Gu?

503
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:58,437
We're at a park
near Jeongneung Police Station.

504
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,774
So?

505
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,902
If you want to see your driver again,
come right now.

506
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,862
Otherwise, I'll press charges for real.

507
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,726
I'm sorry, sir.

508
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:45,276
You don't need to--

509
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,626
Why did you do it?

510
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,836
Because it was necessary.

511
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,880
Why did you need to spy on a civilian?

512
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,466
Why must I explain myself?

513
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,428
How low will you go?

514
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,472
How do you always show me
your absolute worst side?

515
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,724
If you don't want to see the worst,
just leave.

516
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,184
You should've left as you were told

517
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,935
instead of coming
to someone else's hospital

518
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,770
and making me put a tail on you.

519
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,439
"Someone else's hospital"?

520
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,775
It was our hospital and our school
way before you showed up.

521
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,986
Stop trying to fool yourselves.

522
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,863
"Our"? Whose?

523
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,948
It belongs to the foundation.

524
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,160
If you can't accept that,
just buy the hospital.

525
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,620
If you can't afford to do so,

526
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,497
do as you're told.

527
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,832
It's not like the foundation
can do whatever it wants.

528
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,710
They received government funding
and tuition from students.

529
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,420
You can't just ignore that

530
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,922
even if you were just a businessman!

531
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,175
What?

532
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,135
"Just a businessman"?

533
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:55,304
"Even if"?

534
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,726
You're the same.

535
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,436
Why must I be different?

536
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,188
Why did you…

537
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,613
Well… I thought you liked Mr. Gu.

538
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,657
I do not.

539
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,688
When you got drunk,

540
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,148
you kept worrying about
how he would've felt.

541
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,110
"He must have hated it

542
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,237
every time I went over and bugged him."

543
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,155
You said things like that.

544
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,787
I meant his feelings about the hospital.

545
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,582
I wanted him to get to know
the hospital, so I'd go…

546
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,209
That's what I meant,

547
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,961
not his feelings about me.

548
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:11,171
I see.

549
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,758
But whether or not
it was for the hospital,

550
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:16,969
don't women stay away from men

551
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,014
who they really can't stand?

552
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,640
I wouldn't even want to hear them speak.

553
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,124
How do you always show me
your absolute worst side?

554
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,689
If I were you, I'd take this opportunity
to take a few months off

555
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,859
and devote my time to your brother.

556
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:15,110
Is Seon-woo sick?

557
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,405
You should

558
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,491
ask your brother.

559
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:37,966
Jin-woo.

560
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,391
You can't go to work either?
Is that why you're here?

561
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,103
Do you know…

562
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,689
Did he tell you?

563
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,900
Is that why you told Mr. Gu…

564
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:56,568
What?

565
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,612
Who is "he"?

566
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,576
Good. Come to the ER.

567
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,371
Let us make use of a competent doctor.

568
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,749
Your code isn't locked?

569
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,002
It's not like we have to use the system
to see patients.

570
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,170
It doesn't matter much.

571
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,339
Then why are you bumming around?

572
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,758
-I am not.
-You are.

573
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,471
Dr. Lee, mind your own business, will you?

574
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,515
Fine.

575
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,726
I just can't get myself
to mind my own business.

576
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,439
I want to get a story out
about our situation.

577
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,276
A story?

578
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:38,902
Through that reporter?

579
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,822
The one that I saw in the parking lot?

580
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,493
Right? Hey.

581
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,830
Hey. You'd better not tell Seon-woo
this time.

582
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,124
I didn't tell him last time, either.

583
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,587
And if you got a girlfriend, you should
introduce her to Seon-woo.

584
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,673
That way, he'd feel more comfortable
opening up to you.

585
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,052
She's not my girlfriend…

586
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,346
yet.

587
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,850
Anyway, you'd better not…

588
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,853
Hi.

589
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,564
Hello.

590
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,656
Hello, I'm Lee No-eul.
I'm Jin-woo's classmate.

591
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,618
I'm Choi Seo-hyeon. It's nice to meet you.

592
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,703
I don't have my card on me.

593
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,374
You're very busy, aren't you?

594
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,502
What? This is about me, too.

595
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,796
I was fired, too.
Why don't you interview me--

596
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,465
No, she will not.

597
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:48,514
I'll introduce myself officially
next time.

598
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,140
-Okay. I'll see you again later.
-Okay.

599
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,775
Sorry for making you come here every time.

600
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,735
Shall we begin?

601
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:08,951
Sure.

602
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,121
It's about the autopsy report.

603
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,002
Is this everyone?

604
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,965
Let's go.

605
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,388
We can't reach the medical examiner.
They just say he's at a training session.

606
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,473
At a time like this?
Without even writing the report?

607
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,475
That makes no sense.

608
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:37,229
If a medical institution has control
over a pharmaceutical distributor,

609
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,856
they may not enter into transactions
with each other.

610
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:43,402
Thus, the pharmaceutical distributor
you set up as our subsidiary

611
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:47,197
violates Article 47, Section 4
of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act.

612
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,493
For having an exclusivity agreement
with the distributor,

613
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,829
the Fair Trade Commission
can impose a penalty.

614
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,543
It's a violation
of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act,

615
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,629
but all the hospitals do it?

616
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,090
The law was made
because many people do it.

617
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,634
But still, what's illegal is illegal.

618
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,804
The president illegally entered
into the exclusivity agreement.

619
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,181
Article 47, Section 4

620
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,559
of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act
does not apply to this.

621
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,479
If the entity does not own
over 50% of the distributor's shares,

622
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,357
Article 47, Section 4 does not apply.

623
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,402
Sangkook University Hospital
owns only 49% of its shares.

624
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,904
It owns 70% of the shares.

625
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,490
We did our homework. Come on, now.

626
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:33,368
We recently sold some shares.
It's 49% right now.

627
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,329
When did you sell them?

628
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,538
Who…

629
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,249
Who prescribed the drugs?

630
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,379
You have all been in the medical field
for over 20 years.

631
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,383
You should've known from the start
that there could be legal issues.

632
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,844
Why did you prescribe them, then?

633
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:55,265
You made it impossible not to
using the system.

634
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,186
You should've spoken up then.

635
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,563
No matter how many shares it owns,

636
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,609
medical personnel cannot receive
economic benefits resulting from that.

637
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,778
They only checked the old numbers

638
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,863
and didn't check the details
of the donations.

639
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,699
Who received economic benefits?

640
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,577
That's right.
You, the chief of Plastic Surgery.

641
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,747
Your department received an incentive

642
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,624
for prescribing the distributor's drugs.

643
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:28,507
Sangkook University Hospital firing
the people involved in the autopsy matter

644
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,593
may be nothing compared to all the things

645
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,178
that Gu Seung-hyo has done.

646
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,515
I looked into Hwajeong Logis
since he used to work there,

647
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,308
and that company

648
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,436
had numerous cases
of accidental death and suicide.

649
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,398
While Mr. Gu was there, too?

650
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,277
There was at least one case every year
up until a few years ago.

651
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,406
Even if he didn't do anything himself,

652
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,825
he probably made
working conditions intolerable.

653
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,869
"Termination without justifiable cause"?

654
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,997
You should know the reason
better than anyone else.

655
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,668
You posted the financial statement.

656
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:07,254
You confessed it to me yourself.

657
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,926
For regular companies, they're required
to disclose financial statements,

658
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,887
so I thought it wasn't that big a deal,

659
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:20,350
but apparently, it's a serious matter
for hospitals.

660
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:24,646
Hospitals refuse even if the National
Assembly demands to see their records.

661
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,190
But the brave man that you are
revealed that.

662
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
Why now?

663
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,863
Are you complaining that I fired you
too late?

664
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,489
Are you angry I didn't fire you sooner?

665
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,116
What about the others?

666
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,035
Ye Jin-woo. He's the whistle-blower.

667
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,079
You must know better than I do.

668
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,291
Director Oh. Due to the error
she made on that inspection,

669
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,794
Sangkook University Hospital's credibility
has been severely damaged.

670
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,129
And Dr. Lee No-eul?

671
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,423
You have too many questions.

672
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,805
What are the grounds
for dismissing the president?

673
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,807
There are three.

674
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,476
Misconduct, code violation,

675
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,937
and improper financial management,
all of which are under the condition

676
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,191
that the president caused losses
to the medical institution.

677
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,651
After Mr. Gu's inauguration,

678
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:14,196
the income increased by 176%
compared to the previous year's.

679
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,615
Net profit increased by 305%.

680
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,118
Including the 70-billion-won investment
in the Songtan Center,

681
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:24,998
the amount of donation and investment
received increased by 4.7 times.

682
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:31,463
"Losses" don't just mean financial loss.

683
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,089
Listen, Dr. Joo.

684
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,175
Remember the financial statement

685
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,638
that you posted?
That is what you call "losses."

686
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,308
In a corporation,
if you cause financial loss,

687
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,018
you'll be held liable for neglect of duty.

688
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,020
Two of you here are liable for that.

689
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,688
And the other one…

690
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:53,693
is in fifth place in income among
the Big Five plastic surgery centers.

691
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,976
It was you
who posted the financial statement.

692
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,439
It's strange. How did he know?

693
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,694
That Ye Jin-woo reported
the deputy director for the surgery.

694
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,904
He said it in the auditorium
in front of everyone.

695
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,865
Only the medical staff were there.

696
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,909
How did he find out?

697
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,913
We need to find another way.
He won't budge.

698
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:48,707
We'll find a way.

699
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,763
We've asked the Korean Medical Association

700
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,308
and the Korean Hospital Association
to release a statement

701
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:08,602
regarding the management's
distrustful acts.

702
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,479
So, to sum up
what to include in the article…

703
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,857
A request for the autopsy report,

704
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,819
the president's distrustful act
of retaliatory terminations,

705
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,615
and statements by the associations…

706
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,660
The president's expulsion
based on a two-thirds vote by the chiefs.

707
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,247
"Expulsion" may be too strong a word.

708
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:31,333
I'll go with "dismissal."

709
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:32,792
Okay.

710
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,053
I feel like we are using you
only when we need you.

711
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,348
I used you first, Jin-woo.

712
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,226
For Lee Jeong-seon's receipts.

713
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,021
Did you forget already?

714
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,066
You didn't…

715
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,944
use me.

716
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,205
I'll call you.

717
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,873
Are you busy?

718
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:14,334
Yes.

719
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,508
Why am I being so childish?

720
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,458
I have a pile of underwear in my locker.

721
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,252
What if the nurses see them?

722
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,257
You went to see the president.

723
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,051
I did.

724
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,260
And?

725
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:49,596
We only fed Mr. Gu's ego.

726
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,684
The law--

727
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,853
We're the ones who benefited from it,

728
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,438
so we'll be the ones to get punished.

729
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,606
The improper terminations?

730
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,108
About the financial statement
that you posted before…

731
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,819
Word will spread that I did it.

732
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:08,907
If you're upset that I took credit for it,
you can tell people that you posted it.

733
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,911
What about the autopsy result?

734
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,579
We have no proof.

735
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,165
We failed even with proof
for other things.

736
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:24,506
After going home on time
for the first time ever yesterday,

737
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,383
I was afraid my wife would be shocked
if I went home,

738
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,345
so I went to a random burger joint.

739
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,765
There was a man alone in the corner.

740
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,893
Maybe it was because he was in a suit

741
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,520
or because of how I felt,

742
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,730
but my heart ached, looking at him.

743
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,776
He looked about my age.

744
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,780
I couldn't tell

745
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:51,991
if he was eating a burger or dirt.

746
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,535
That's how…

747
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,286
he looked.

748
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,956
You are not like him.

749
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,958
We can get a job elsewhere.

750
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,877
But if I were an office worker,

751
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:04,629
especially at this age,

752
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,757
I'd probably feel hopeless…

753
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,678
not knowing where to go.

754
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,016
Let's go to Director Oh.

755
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,435
Why?

756
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,353
She's the only one we have left.

757
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,106
She must announce
that Mr. Gu had pressured her

758
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,566
for the initial inspection.

759
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,693
No.

760
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,445
Why not?

761
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,863
I didn't think it through.

762
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,282
I shouldn't have asked her
to announce the autopsy result.

763
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,492
I believed I was giving her a chance,

764
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,578
but it just ended badly.

765
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,954
She's the director.

766
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,665
She's responsible for the hospital
and the staff.

767
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,251
She's not in that seat to get bowed to

768
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:45,712
but to bear the burden for others.

769
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,380
You know how strict she is on herself,

770
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,216
but she hasn't been reachable for days.
She must have a reason.

771
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,427
I'm sure Mr. Gu has a reason, too.

772
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,304
We cannot afford to cut others some slack.

773
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,064
Hello, Dr. Lee.

774
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:07,817
Yes.

775
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,694
How?

776
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:14,782
Sanction?
Like a kind of disciplinary action?

777
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:16,993
Such a thing happened?

778
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,549
Connect me to
Hwajeong Apparel's president.

779
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,675
Apparel?

780
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,849
This is the office of Mr. Gu Seung-hyo,
Sangkook Hospital's president.

781
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,018
Is Ms. Jin in?

782
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:43,937
Okay.

783
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,022
She's on the line.

784
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,903
Hello, Ms. Jin. This is Gu Seung-hyo.

785
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,029
It's been a while.

786
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,531
Pardon?

787
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,407
Thank you.

788
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,826
I'm calling

789
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:02,455
because I'd like to ask you something
about your business.

790
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,625
May I come and speak to you in person?

791
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,586
I'll head over there.

792
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,923
Right now?

793
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:15,593
Then I'll be there within an hour.

794
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,887
Yes. I'll see you soon.

795
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,141
Mr. Choi, Mr. Gu is on his way down.

796
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,311
What's the brand that Apparel launched?

797
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,230
-The shoe brand?
-No, the lingerie brand.

798
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:30,441
-They collaborated with some company.
-Lingerie… You mean, Viant?

799
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:31,943
Viant.

800
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,238
At the groundbreaking ceremony,

801
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,282
there were so many people from Hwajeong.

802
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,368
They were all presidents
of subsidiaries, and they said…

803
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,203
The Songtan property for the Cancer Center

804
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,080
belonged to the Minister of Environment.

805
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:47,125
Hwajeong Group bought it from him
in our hospital's name.

806
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,628
There's nothing wrong with
buying a plot of land from a Minister.

807
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,548
Are Dr. Lee Sang-yeop's
in-laws civil servants?

808
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:55,717
Not just regular civil servants.

809
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,719
I heard his wife's family
is super influential.

810
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,304
Really?

811
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,390
I heard this from an elder
in my wife's family.

812
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:06,144
There are a lot of civil servants
in my wife's family.

813
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,647
Anyway, they purchased the land
when things were shaky

814
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,233
between Hwajeong
and the Ministry of Environment.

815
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:13,818
In what way?

816
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,570
Hwajeong Group…

817
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:23,953
Hwajeong Group was being sanctioned
by the Ministry of Environment.

818
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,623
Sanction?
Like a kind of disciplinary action?

819
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:27,999
Such a thing happened?

820
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,793
Really? I've never heard about it.

821
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,170
I'm sure they made sure of that

822
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,005
since they made a monetary deal

823
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,049
with the head of the ministry
they had issues with.

824
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,968
So it's as if I bought a house

825
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,804
from the judge of the trial I was on.

826
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,016
It's as if after the deal was struck…

827
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,684
The judge let him off the hook.

828
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,978
Hwajeong got off without being sanctioned.

829
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:49,896
That's right.

830
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,859
But according to Dr. Lee…

831
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,614
But the land wasn't bad, so it's hard
to say it was purely for improper reasons.

832
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:02,158
It's in a good location,
and the land is good, too.

833
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,078
It could be just a coincidence.

834
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,746
It could've been for both reasons.

835
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:09,248
But that doesn't make it legal.

836
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,668
It's not that simple.

837
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,003
This isn't only about Mr. Gu.

838
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:15,505
Think about it.

839
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,466
A current Minister
and Hwajeong Group are involved.

840
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:21,552
A land that size must have cost
tens of billions of won.

841
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,305
What money would Mr. Gu have to buy that?

842
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,391
The chairman obviously paid for it.

843
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,019
It'll be a headache
if the chairman gets dragged into this.

844
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,399
A way to pressure Mr. Gu
but keep the chairman from jumping in…

845
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:39,404
They bribed the Minister.
Do we really have to turn a blind eye

846
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,698
for our own gain?

847
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,922
Dr. Lee Sang-yeop may find out more
if he digs deeper.

848
01:01:58,005 --> 01:02:00,800
Like exactly what was exchanged
between Hwajeong and the Minister.

849
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,805
Dr. Lee's in-laws include people
very high up in the government.

850
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,473
I bet he mentioned this

851
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:10,893
because he heard something more
and thought we have a chance.

852
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,896
But he can't step in himself, so…

853
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,818
Dr. Lee…

854
01:02:20,611 --> 01:02:22,196
I have an appointment.

855
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,406
Okay.

856
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,284
He already left.

857
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,495
He won't want others to hear.

858
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,205
I'll call you.

859
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,460
Dr. Ye.

860
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,880
Did you talk to your brother?

861
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,437
DR. LEE SANG-YEOP

862
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,902
HEALTH INSURANCE REVIEW
AND ASSESSMENT SERVICE

863
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,703
What's gotten into you? You really came.

864
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:11,954
Did you think I was lying?

865
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,461
Where are we going?

866
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,338
Somewhere.

867
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,007
Why are you being so secretive?

868
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,677
Did you call my office yesterday?

869
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:28,888
What?

870
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,849
My colleague who sits across from me
said you called me at my desk

871
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,018
because I wasn't answering my cell.

872
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:35,645
Yes.

873
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:40,733
So it was you
who took care of me yesterday.

874
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,403
Did you think it was a house fairy?

875
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:50,993
It was you.

876
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,968
Are we here for an exhibition?

877
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,120
Jin-woo. Where are you going?

878
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,457
Jin-woo!

879
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,861
Push me.

880
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,088
There are…

881
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:58,676
people who are…

882
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,303
inspired by you to pursue their dreams.

883
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:06,725
There aren't many people who didn't
give up, finished their education,

884
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,728
and got a job

885
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:12,189
like you did.

886
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:18,654
You are their hope.

887
01:09:23,075 --> 01:09:24,535
Why must I be their hope?

888
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,247
Why must my life

889
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:32,543
be an inspiration for someone else?

890
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:37,590
I just…

891
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:41,927
live my life.

892
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,060
I don't really find my life…

893
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:54,356
joyful or happy.

894
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,403
That's how everyone feels about life.

895
01:10:01,071 --> 01:10:02,364
It isn't just you.

896
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,329
I want it to end when it ends.

897
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:10,873
That's all.

898
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,792
Nothing more.

899
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,674
Jin-woo.

900
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,179
Thank you.

901
01:11:20,025 --> 01:11:23,320
Those bastards. This has been
our stomping ground for years.

902
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,698
How dare they underestimate us?

903
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,917
-Thank you.
-Sure.

904
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,254
I'm sorry for making you do this, Chief.

905
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:42,172
Shut up. Go.

906
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:04,111
We came to talk to you about
the land in Songtan.

907
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,896
You may see us as a disorderly mob,

908
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,731
but the Council of Chiefs
exists for a reason.

909
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,360
If we all request your resignation,
there's a reason for that.

910
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,529
Since your dismissal was decided upon,

911
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:49,656
please accept it.

912
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,747
Are things good
with the Ministry of Environment?

913
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,376
You purchased the land
in lieu of a sanction.

914
01:13:04,296 --> 01:13:07,508
You are quite nosy.
It has nothing to do with you now.

915
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,430
It was used as a bribe.

916
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:17,976
It has nothing to do with you anymore.

917
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:20,854
If you don't step down,

918
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:24,483
we will make sure to let the world know
about the land deal

919
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:28,153
between Hwajeong Group
and the Minister of Environment.

920
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:45,606
Give me our doctors' ID cards. Now.

921
01:14:45,689 --> 01:14:49,818
You get your paychecks from the hospital,
but you don't know who you work for?

922
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,613
Did you forget where you work at?
This is Sangkook University Hospital!

923
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:55,157
You're good at reporting things.

924
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:57,201
You should've told me things like that
right away.

925
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:58,744
Don't you have anything we can use?

926
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,580
Something like that financial statement?
Anyone?

927
01:15:01,663 --> 01:15:04,541
I posted… the financial statement.

928
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,294
"In order to improve competitiveness,

929
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:10,130
Sangkook University Hospital,
a non-profit hospital,

930
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:12,883
will be converted into
a for-profit hospital."

931
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,218
Just make it happen.

932
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,969
What is this?

933
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:18,388
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

934
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,515
What did you say?

935
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:21,975
Why did you suddenly say that?

936
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,228
Why do you want to see this now?

937
01:15:24,311 --> 01:15:26,396
Did I tell him to kill someone
or steal a corpse?

938
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,773
That asshole Gu Seung-hyo, too.

939
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:29,608
Does he think he's a doctor

940
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,443
just because he hangs around doctors?

941
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,529
It's because the chairman
is so out of control.

942
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,197
I've never received this much support.

943
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,408
Let's do everything we can
so that we won't have any regrets.

944
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:45,207
