1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,764
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,475
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,478
EPISODE 6

4
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,952
Don't go to Naksan Medical Center.

5
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,496
I won't send you.

6
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,380
What do you mean?

7
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,761
What don't you understand?

8
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,638
You don't have to go.

9
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,443
Is that a good thing or not?

10
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,778
Is he kidding?

11
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,447
What about the strike?

12
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,461
It's all thanks to you, Dr. Joo.

13
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,755
-What's going on?
-Is he serious?

14
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,927
That's a relief.

15
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,352
This is a bit awkward.

16
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,860
It's all thanks to you.

17
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,996
One thing is for sure.

18
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,123
Our fate

19
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,001
is in Mr. Gu's hands.

20
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,920
He proved that just now.

21
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:00,842
Dr. Lee.

22
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,802
I have big news.

23
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,887
Big news? What now?

24
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,932
We don't have to go.
The relocation has been canceled.

25
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,143
Who said that? How?

26
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,520
Mr. Gu. He just said it himself.

27
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,898
The president said it himself,
so it's for sure, right?

28
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,277
-Really?
-I'm going to spread the word.

29
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,862
I'll go with you.

30
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,286
How do I…

31
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,503
Thanks.

32
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,385
No way.

33
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,319
Let's go get some coffee. My treat.

34
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,361
Yes!

35
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,993
Again?

36
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,120
Are you still taking care of
all those patients?

37
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,580
When will they let you off?

38
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:13,706
My sentiments exactly.

39
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,667
Hello?

40
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,802
How many people will get dragged into it?

41
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,597
Technically, it was the chief
of the Cancer Center who covered it up.

42
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,557
It won't make much of a difference.

43
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,893
Even doctors who kill patients
wherever they go

44
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,020
still go around the rural areas
and perform surgeries.

45
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,107
It's because they rarely revoke
doctors' licenses.

46
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,282
That resident at the Cancer Center
is your classmate, right?

47
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,869
Yes.

48
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,997
Being punished is one thing…

49
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,375
How could he make such a mistake?

50
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,461
We trained like crazy. How could he…

51
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,258
He didn't get dragged into it.

52
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,469
The chief is also at fault.

53
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,476
Jae-hyeok.

54
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:19,480
Yes?

55
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,524
Did you give Clamoxin
to the patient in Bed 11?

56
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,153
Well… I did.

57
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,738
You said to give him Clamoxin
instead of Cefotam.

58
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,286
It wasn't checked off.

59
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,791
What if I didn't check
and ended up giving him double doses?

60
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,170
I'm sorry.

61
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,088
Do you think it is okay
because it doesn't kill?

62
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,840
No, I don't. I'm sorry.

63
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,886
We're no better than the Cancer Center.
We've just been lucky.

64
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,264
You said you trained like crazy,
but you rely on luck?

65
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,308
Did you study for nothing?

66
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,059
I'll be more careful.

67
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,395
Everyone!

68
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,981
Listen up. We're not…

69
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,317
being kicked out.

70
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,498
Chief.

71
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,209
I've been thinking…

72
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,295
Since the strike is off,

73
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,132
the management will no longer consider
meeting our demands, will they?

74
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,177
I don't think they will.

75
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,141
Is it true?

76
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,352
Are we really not going?

77
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,480
That's… right.

78
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,149
That's great…

79
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,069
Wait.

80
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,197
It's that detective.

81
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,262
They could've just summoned him.

82
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,722
Did they have to come to his workplace
and humiliate him?

83
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,392
They have no consideration
since we have no shield.

84
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,727
Including that jerk up there.

85
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,772
How long will we keep
the director position vacant?

86
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,732
That's right. Let's fill it soon.

87
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,360
We need a representative
in order to fight the president.

88
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,037
Well, we made all that noise
about the strike,

89
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,582
but we ended up calling it off
without even making a peep.

90
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,668
So if there's anything you did
that needs cleaning up,

91
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,547
clean it up quickly so that
we don't become a laughing stock.

92
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,012
I'm going back to work.

93
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,695
Neither of them even stood a chance
when Director Lee was here,

94
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,240
but it could've been a tight race
between the chief of the Cancer Center

95
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,117
and the deputy director in this election.

96
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,205
That's right. The deputy director
had it handed to him on a platter.

97
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,707
Look at him just now.

98
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,834
The conference was held
by Cardiothoracic Surgery.

99
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,336
Why was he leading it?

100
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,588
He made a fool out of the chief
of Cardiothoracic Surgery

101
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,714
in front of everyone.

102
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,591
See you later.

103
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,261
If you keep pretending not to care,

104
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,056
all your efforts could go in vain.

105
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,098
What do you mean?

106
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,894
We are going to hold an election anyway.

107
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,981
No one will say anything even if you show
your willingness to become the director.

108
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,403
You know, there's someone
who is eager to get the position.

109
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,864
Who?

110
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,700
Dr. Joo.

111
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,160
See you later.

112
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,287
Dr. Joo?

113
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,081
What the…

114
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,962
Get your act together.

115
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:13,881
You need to become the director

116
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,800
for the deputy director position
to open up.

117
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,228
JANG SEONG-JA SPEECH THERAPY ROOM

118
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,608
THIS ROOM WAS OPENED WITH THE DONATION

119
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,944
OF DR. JANG SEONG-JA,
FORMERLY RADIOLOGIST AT THIS HOSPITAL

120
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,071
DR. JANG SEONG-JA IS THE MOTHER

121
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,365
OF OUR ALUMNI, DR. OH SE-HWA
OF NEUROSURGERY

122
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,457
DR. JANG SEONG-JA

123
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:55,840
Yes.

124
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,927
Because I made a promise to you, Mr. Cho,

125
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,763
that people won't say
the hospital is having problems.

126
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,099
Yes.

127
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,435
Yes.

128
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,065
I should set it straight with the doctors
that Hwajeong Group owns this hospital.

129
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,609
They should know
that we hold their lives in our hands.

130
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,737
The Greek god doctor is staying.

131
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,658
Yes.

132
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,162
The result of the efficiency evaluation
is being put together.

133
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll bring it over once it's done.

134
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,416
I see. Like that. Okay.

135
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,559
SAEGEUL21

136
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,366
Hello, Dr. Ye.

137
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,036
Hello?

138
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:08,954
Hello.

139
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,751
I have some bad news.

140
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,920
What is it?

141
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,672
It looks like
we are calling off the strike.

142
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,550
If you publish my interview,

143
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,136
it will make you look like
you are reporting false information.

144
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,140
You must be the thoughtful type.

145
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,267
Pardon?

146
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,270
I've never had anyone tell me in advance.

147
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,689
I see.

148
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,942
Was the strike just called off

149
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,610
or did the parties come to an agreement?

150
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:43,155
Such swift settlements
often lead to trouble later.

151
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,949
We'll just have to wait and see for now

152
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,493
since the relocation has been canceled.

153
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,123
That's a good thing then,
so let's be happy. Congratulations.

154
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,209
You don't have to feel bad

155
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,087
since many articles
end up unpublished anyway.

156
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,588
Ms. Choi! Let's go.

157
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,048
Just a minute.

158
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,260
May I call you again if I have questions
about the medical field?

159
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,846
Yes,

160
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,682
of course.

161
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,016
Thank you.

162
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,519
I'm sorry, but we're on our way somewhere.

163
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,145
Have a nice day.

164
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,230
You, too.

165
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,153
You must be the thoughtful type.

166
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,784
I'm not.

167
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,663
Such swift settlements
often lead to trouble later.

168
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:02,693
I once read a saying
that life is like a spiral staircase.

169
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,821
You may think you climbed high,

170
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,032
but when you look down,

171
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,868
you can still see the path you walked on.

172
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,919
Director Lee,

173
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,755
why do I feel like it's been so long

174
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,049
since you've been here?

175
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,696
NOTICE OF ELECTION

176
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,955
NOTICE OF ELECTION

177
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,378
NOTICE OF ELECTION

178
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,468
They are now accepting candidates.

179
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,303
It's finally starting.

180
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,391
It's only a competition of their own.
We don't have a say in it anyway.

181
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,689
There has been only one director
during my time here.

182
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,610
NOTICE OF ELECTION

183
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,287
"A competition of their own…"

184
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:43,085
Anyone at a chief level
can be a candidate for the director.

185
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:48,424
There are 44 doctors
who are eligible to vote,

186
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,343
so the person must receive
22 votes or more to become the director.

187
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,930
Previously, the board of directors
approved the appointment of the candidate,

188
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,765
but now… How would you like to…

189
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,935
Does Sangkook University Hospital
still have a board of directors?

190
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,605
Right. We've granted all the authorities
to one person.

191
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,858
That means that the elected candidate
needs your approval

192
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,527
in order to be appointed
as the hospital director.

193
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,654
The previous director
really was impressive,

194
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,364
serving four consecutive terms.

195
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,534
He had many who followed him.

196
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,829
Even for a private institution,
four terms…

197
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,123
-How many years did he--
-Eleven years.

198
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,296
Time really flies.

199
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,465
Do you really think
eleven years was short?

200
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,801
I learned a lot thanks to him.

201
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,890
Well,

202
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,770
I'm glad to know that you are all ready
to become the director.

203
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,688
"All ready"?

204
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,899
The candidate registration
hasn't even been closed yet.

205
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,708
Let me be straightforward.

206
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,254
I want you as the director.

207
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,342
Why?

208
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,761
Because we'll work well together.

209
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,305
Aren't I right?

210
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,979
It will be…

211
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,274
the best decision for you.

212
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:49,545
MS. KANG

213
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,464
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY

214
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,633
I'm going to start a subsidiary.

215
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,594
A pharmaceutical distribution company.

216
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,681
The company will supply medicines
only to us.

217
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,558
Then the pharmacies near the hospital

218
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,396
would have to buy medicines
from the subsidiary

219
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,191
since doctors
at Sangkook University Hospital

220
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,237
will only prescribe
our subsidiary's drugs.

221
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,199
This is unbelievable.
We work so well together already.

222
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,953
But general hospitals
are nonprofit corporations,

223
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,122
so they can't set up subsidiaries.

224
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,958
I'm sure you're aware of that, of course.

225
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,627
Yes, it is technically impossible,

226
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,547
but every organization has subsidiaries.
Even public universities do.

227
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,551
That's right. It's possible
if the subsidiary is also a nonprofit.

228
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:41,722
The profit can be given to the foundation
as donations.

229
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,599
Then it won't be taxed, either.

230
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,024
Let's say we took bids
from pharmaceutical distributors

231
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,611
and made the decision quietly
within the hospital.

232
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,488
And tell every department
to submit a protocol

233
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,074
for the prevention of medication errors.

234
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,660
I will have the chiefs present them to me.

235
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,078
The Cancer Center included.

236
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,874
Yes, sir.

237
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,176
I have a question.

238
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,095
Why does everyone want to be
the hospital director?

239
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,307
It's not like anyone would nag
doctors at that level.

240
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,683
You all cure diseases.

241
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,521
Why do company workers want
to get promoted and become president?

242
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:32,481
For the salary?

243
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,691
If you don't, it means

244
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,236
they want you out.

245
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,987
We lose our jobs.

246
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,990
Did you climb this high up the ladder
because you were afraid of

247
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,325
losing your job?

248
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,661
Good day.

249
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,733
Candidates…

250
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,909
2017 SECOND HALF PROFIT RANKINGS

251
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,370
1. OPHTHALMOLOGY, 2. ORTHOPEDICS,
3. CANCER CENTER

252
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,718
We are going to hold an election anyway.

253
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:46,513
No one will say anything even if you show
your willingness to become the director.

254
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,057
You know, there's someone
who is eager to get the position.

255
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,865
HWAJEONG CHEMICAL

256
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,706
Please take a look at that machine
on the right.

257
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,167
That is an empty bottle inspection machine

258
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,128
that is used to check
the quality of the bottles we use.

259
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,465
Over here, the bottles
are filled with the product.

260
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:24,092
Then they are capped…

261
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,804
You'd like to set up
a pharmaceutical distribution company?

262
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,722
As a subsidiary?

263
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,476
Since supplements have the same
distribution route as medicines,

264
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,353
we will send the person
who will be in charge.

265
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,814
Please educate that person
on the distribution process.

266
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,942
Can a subsidiary be formed
that quickly overnight?

267
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,653
We aren't making the drugs ourselves.

268
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,697
We are only setting up
a single supplier framework.

269
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,700
A pharmaceutical company
that supplies medicines

270
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,952
to the hospital that owns the company.

271
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,455
You'd have exclusivity.

272
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,042
You'd benefit as well
since you'll have no competition.

273
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,045
That's totally up to you.

274
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,838
With an exclusive arrangement,

275
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,633
we take it all if we are your supplier,

276
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,886
but if you cut us loose,
we'd lose it all in an instant.

277
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,429
We'd lose everything.

278
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,686
I guess we'll have to cooperate. Right?

279
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,024
Send the person in charge.

280
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,985
Thank you. And one more thing.

281
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,782
I'd like you to fund equipment purchases
for our hospital.

282
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,333
If I tell the doctors to sell
Hwajeong Chemical's drugs to the patients,

283
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,794
their egos won't let them
agree to do so that easily.

284
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,004
So, I plan to make
a justification for you.

285
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,301
I'll look it over and get back to you.

286
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,596
Thank you.

287
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:02,774
RFID MEDICAL SYSTEM

288
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,404
RFID READER

289
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,033
Goodness.

290
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,372
PARATRANSIT

291
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,586
Hello?

292
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,422
I just checked.

293
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,966
Please keep monitoring
the oxygen saturation.

294
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,552
Thank you.

295
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,308
That was him.

296
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,271
Hi, No-eul.

297
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,982
Hey, Seon-woo. Where are you right now?

298
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,776
Me? Where else? I'm at work.

299
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,112
Why?

300
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,698
-I thought--
-In ten meters,

301
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,616
turn left.

302
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,040
These damn calls.

303
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,666
Don't pick up. Ignore it.

304
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
Should I?

305
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,713
I'll call you back.

306
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,175
Hey, you're the one who called me.
I will get mad at you if you hang up.

307
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,969
Whatever. I'll call you back.

308
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,515
Hello?

309
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,061
The lab results are out?

310
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,022
What did they say?

311
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,281
I don't think he was here for work.

312
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,617
I just asked the insurance claims office

313
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,494
if someone from the HIRA was here.

314
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:38,912
They said no.

315
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,664
Are you sure it was him?

316
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,666
How could I not recognize Seon-woo?

317
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,584
True.

318
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,878
He has no reason to come here.

319
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,797
You don't think he's sick, do you?

320
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,425
If he was,
he wouldn't have come to where I work at.

321
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,385
You know…

322
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,929
Sorry.

323
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,306
Are you still doing all the work?
Did you get any sleep?

324
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,059
I'm going to get some sleep now.
See you tomorrow.

325
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,773
You'll get yourself killed.

326
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,441
What?

327
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,198
Push the seat back.

328
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,660
Why are you so short?

329
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,162
It's so cramped.

330
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,873
I'm of average height.
You're the unusual one.

331
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,126
Push the seat back.

332
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:30,046
Then you'll have to struggle
to pull it forward again tomorrow

333
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,131
with those twiggy arms.

334
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,091
I said we could take your car.

335
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,384
And pick you up in the morning?

336
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,427
I never asked you to.

337
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,394
Hey.

338
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,272
What?

339
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,107
Look at you.

340
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,067
You must be waiting for someone's call.

341
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,240
How dare a runt try to meddle in
an adult's business?

342
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,910
You call me a runt
whenever you're at a disadvantage.

343
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,290
You'll get wrinkles.

344
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:12,922
Jin-woo.

345
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,051
Yes?

346
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,638
Chodang Apartment.

347
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,893
Dr. Joo!

348
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,151
-Get in.
-Hey.

349
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,486
-We'll drop you off.
-Thanks.

350
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,707
It's nice living close by,

351
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,085
but it's hard to get a taxi
for a short ride.

352
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,545
You haven't been home in a while.

353
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,964
You go only a few times a month, right?

354
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,593
Is that right? Could that be why?

355
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,804
What do you mean?

356
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,723
I recently learned
that my daughter is in high school.

357
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,810
I was sure that she was in junior high.

358
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,650
Anyway, am I being the third wheel?

359
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:15,443
No, sir.

360
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,530
We're practically sisters.
Don't worry about it.

361
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,115
We are brothers.

362
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,699
You are too pretty to be a brother.

363
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,993
You aren't that pretty to be a sister.

364
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,539
You're practically sisters.

365
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:30,708
Thank you.

366
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,801
The leaves are so green.

367
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,931
They will probably wither soon.

368
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,309
Are you okay?

369
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,148
What were you going to say…

370
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,945
It's okay. I don't keep anything
from Dr. Lee.

371
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,283
Remember that time
right before the mortality conference?

372
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,785
You were about to say something to me.

373
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,662
Something about the past.

374
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,291
A long time ago,

375
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,836
a family member of mine
was hospitalized for quite a while.

376
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,796
I know.

377
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,300
One time, his condition got worse
all of a sudden.

378
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,887
I thought it was because
he wasn't well in the first place.

379
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,308
When I think about it now,
it was because of a medical error.

380
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,022
I was reminded of that time
when I didn't know anything.

381
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,650
Maybe because of
the Cancer Center incident

382
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,736
or the anaphylactic shock death…

383
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:45,241
I realized that I was both
a victim and a perpetrator.

384
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,286
We all are.

385
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,708
I wasn't trying to throw stones
at your department along with Mr. Gu.

386
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,294
I do not go along with the likes of him.

387
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,506
What do you mean by "the likes of him"?

388
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,009
What do you think?

389
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,344
What is he like?

390
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,223
He puts numbers above people's lives.

391
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,475
Are we any different?

392
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:14,312
We always complain about
how little we get paid from the HIRA.

393
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,733
"Several highly skilled people like us

394
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,652
operated on a patient for hours.

395
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,029
How could they pay

396
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:26,157
only 200 to 300 thousand won
for the surgery?" We always say that.

397
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,243
That's different.

398
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,577
How is it different?

399
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:34,207
Are you saying we can put numbers above
our patients' lives since we are doctors,

400
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,792
but he isn't qualified to do so?

401
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,377
Because he didn't go to medical school?

402
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,631
We talk about those things
because the policy is wrong.

403
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,344
The government failed
to set a reasonable fee schedule,

404
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:50,431
so doctors are suffering.
It's only natural for them to complain.

405
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,599
What about you?

406
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:55,019
Do you agree with Mr. Gu's idea
to kick out unprofitable departments?

407
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,855
Don't twist my words.

408
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,774
That's clearly wrong.

409
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,861
However,

410
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,948
I think even someone like Mr. Gu
has a role in our group.

411
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,452
He is a businessman to the bone.

412
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,705
If you naively go along with him,

413
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,832
you'll be eaten alive in no time.

414
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,126
And what do we learn by ostracizing him?

415
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,171
We know better than anyone how clannish

416
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,840
and self-centered
a group of people we are.

417
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:29,470
I think Mr. Gu is someone
who can cast a stone.

418
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,850
If we don't want to get eaten alive,
we should keep our eyes wide open.

419
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,352
But if we stop him from casting a stone

420
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:41,274
just because we are too busy
and do not want to be bothered,

421
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,902
nothing will change.

422
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,364
We will forever remain
a stagnant body of water.

423
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,037
Hey.

424
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,581
Yes? Go ahead.

425
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:58,917
That's my apartment building.

426
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,960
Okay.

427
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,842
Good night.

428
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:32,075
He'll remember where he lives, right?

429
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,911
What do you mean?

430
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,330
He doesn't even know his daughter's age.

431
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,125
The buildings all look alike.

432
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,835
I'm telling Dr. Joo on you.

433
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,759
Mr. Gu was the first person
who wasn't from the owner's family

434
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,386
to become a CEO in his group

435
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,262
before the age of 40.

436
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,264
He isn't your average guy.

437
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,725
I looked him up, too.

438
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,477
You did?

439
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,313
Why did you look him up?

440
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,024
How could I not look up our new president?

441
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,818
You did it too.

442
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,860
I was…

443
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,825
I showed him around the wards.

444
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,370
Personally? Why?

445
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:21,416
I thought he might feel something
if he saw the kids.

446
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,002
Like he would ever.

447
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,171
So? Did he?

448
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,342
-I'm not sure.
-I am.

449
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:34,262
You should've seen him
during the mortality conference.

450
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,849
-I heard.
-It's different from seeing it.

451
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,852
Exactly. His thoughts
could have changed from before

452
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,312
when he just knew
that there are patients in the hospital

453
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,649
after seeing those sick babies

454
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,067
with his own eyes.

455
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,820
It would be awesome
if everything works out as you expected.

456
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,742
Does Dr. Joo know Seon-woo?

457
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,244
No.

458
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,913
Then how did he know
Seon-woo was hospitalized for a while?

459
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,542
When you say a family member
was sick for a while,

460
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,919
most people ask who it was, don't they?

461
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,504
Even if not,

462
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,506
when you said a family member was sick,

463
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,550
he went, "I know."

464
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,180
Director Lee probably told him.

465
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,640
I think he told Dr. Joo about me.

466
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,225
Everything about your family?

467
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,144
Even about Seon-woo's illness?

468
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,980
Were they that close?

469
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:29,776
Even if they were,
why would he tell Dr. Joo about you?

470
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,696
I don't know.

471
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,670
Hang in there a little longer.

472
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,549
They rarely go after the chiefs.

473
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,927
I regretted becoming a doctor
for the first time in my life.

474
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,305
That detective's questions…
He knew nothing about what we do.

475
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,599
They should at least bring in an expert.

476
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,977
By the way, what do you think will happen
to the resident?

477
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,107
The deceased's family pressed charges.

478
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,276
The president uncovered it,
so he's screwed.

479
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,153
He should feel guilty.

480
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,202
What do you think
Mr. Gu is planning to do next?

481
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:23,913
What will he try to get?

482
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:29,293
I think the expulsion order
and the efficiency evaluation

483
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,212
were all just bait.

484
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,342
Let's make a move.

485
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,471
We've treated the Prime Minister before.

486
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,600
We've also operated
on conglomerates' chairmen.

487
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:48,229
You've been the chair of the National
Ophthalmologists Association twice,

488
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,066
and you are the first female chief
of Neurosurgery.

489
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,777
You've gained recognition
from NCI and MD Anderson,

490
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:58,281
the two most
respected cancer institutes in the US.

491
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:03,744
Please…

492
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,706
support me.

493
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,917
I'll push out Mr. Gu.

494
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,464
Go and tell everyone…

495
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,593
to support me.

496
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,188
-Did you eat?
-Yes.

497
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,568
Do you know Dr. Joo Kyung-moon
at my hospital?

498
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,072
I know people in Orthopedics.

499
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,824
I saw their names while working.

500
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,201
No, he isn't…

501
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,204
Forget it.

502
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,422
I told you not to bring the towel out.

503
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,802
Just use the one in your room.
You're such a nag.

504
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,012
Stop leaving wet towels on the sofa.

505
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,184
Go out and get some fresh air
instead of watching TV--

506
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,811
It's too much of a hassle to go out.

507
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,899
Hey, let's go out.

508
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,693
At this hour? Where?

509
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,070
-The flowers have bloomed.
-I'm sure they have.

510
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,738
I have to watch TV. I'm busy.

511
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,659
Hey. Your brother's trapped
in the hospital all day and wants…

512
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,786
The strike that began last year…

513
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,413
Hey.

514
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,415
Switch back to that channel.

515
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,666
What? Which one?

516
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,753
Both the entertainment department

517
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,797
and the radio station…

518
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,674
Does just hearing the word "strike"
get to you?

519
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:23,676
…in charge of the news and current events…

520
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,014
Hey! Your towel!

521
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:34,312
CHOI SEO-HYEON

522
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,941
ABS ANNOUNCER
FROM MARCH 2013 TO APRIL 2017

523
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,864
That's why…

524
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,661
ABS NEWS CHOI SEO-HYEON

525
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,388
Regarding the embezzlement allegations

526
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,183
made against the clothing manufacturer,
Black & Missus,

527
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:14,560
the prosecution conducted
a search and seizure.

528
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:17,605
The Prosecutors' Office sent investigators
to the head office

529
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,399
as well as to CEO Kim Yo-han's home

530
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,526
and obtained the relevant documents.

531
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,768
Each of the vials
will have different colored labels.

532
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:42,565
As you can see, we'll use
the colors of the traffic lights

533
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,569
so that they are distinguishable
to anyone.

534
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,490
Yes. So… As you can see,

535
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,952
the drugs wouldn't get mixed up.

536
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:59,707
So, that is the protocol
Emergency Medical Center came up with.

537
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:06,547
Okay.

538
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,520
Pediatrics plans to put up these posters

539
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,107
in clearly visible areas…

540
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,781
LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP

541
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,204
Is this really Sangkook
University Hospital?

542
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,372
Not Sangkook Elementary School?

543
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:41,832
I mean…

544
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:49,507
Is this how you've been doing things?
Working like this?

545
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:04,855
This is a barcode reader
that has an RFID chip embedded within it.

546
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,567
From now on, all drugs,
expensive surgical equipment,

547
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,779
and patients' wristbands
will have these barcodes.

548
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,954
All the data will be managed
in a cloud-based system.

549
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,747
It will not only prevent
medication errors,

550
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,250
but also significantly reduce
the time spent in managing

551
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,585
the inventory
of medicines and medical supplies.

552
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,770
We won't have to argue
about why we're short on supplies

553
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,939
and whose fault it is anymore.

554
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:51,235
I thought Mr. Gu would only give us grief,
but he actually gave us something good.

555
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,529
QUANTITY OF MEDICINE: MATCH

556
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,580
PRESCRIBED MEDICINE: MATCH

557
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,334
Hwajeong being our owner
does have a benefit.

558
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,295
Don't rely purely on that.

559
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:10,879
I won't.

560
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,226
I really can't read that guy.

561
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:44,580
HOSPITAL INTERNAL REGULATIONS

562
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,712
"Roles and power to call meetings."

563
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,929
THE ROLES OF THE HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
AND POWER TO CALL MEETINGS

564
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,978
Director Lee. You wore many hats.

565
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:11,398
You reviewed the budget and accounts

566
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,153
and handled matters
regarding the organization.

567
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,113
You did things like that, too.

568
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:22,993
We will only prescribe medications
that are on this list.

569
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,372
This is a subsidiary we recently set up

570
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:29,541
in order to ensure
an adequate supply of medicines.

571
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,883
"Right to propose
the president's dismissal.

572
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,553
If the president commits
any misdeed or illegal act

573
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,889
in the course of managing the hospital,

574
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,974
the director may propose
the president's dismissal."

575
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,437
This was also within your authority.

576
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,941
It's what the new director

577
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,026
must do.

578
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:14,294
He operates on
around 5,600 patients a year.

579
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,963
That's incredible.

580
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,051
Is there anything you'd like to say
to the patients?

581
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:25,097
You know how the mothers
put the rest of the family first

582
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,933
and delay getting treated
even if they are sick.

583
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:30,436
But you need to get treated early on

584
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,772
to go on the trips
that your daughters send you to.

585
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,275
They keep pushing it off

586
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,193
and then end up going to you.

587
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,113
You're one of the top five in the nation

588
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,698
among joint replacement specialists.

589
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,536
Not at all. There are plenty of doctors
who are better than I am,

590
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,747
so don't come to me.
I never get a chance to rest.

591
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,976
DR. KIM TAE-SANG PERFORMS
5,600 JOINT REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ANNUALLY

592
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,402
CAN WALK UNASSISTED IN 7 DAYS

593
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,279
CONTINUOUS REHABILITATION

594
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,657
Who could do it?

595
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:30,829
Who would follow in your footsteps
and walk this path…

596
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,290
without being swayed?

597
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,348
Jeong-hu, let me take a look, okay?

598
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:07,282
Jeong-hu, should we pretend
that we are at a supermarket?

599
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,163
Look at this. I'm going to buy this.

600
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,794
What about you? What do you want to buy?

601
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,964
Why don't you buy it yourself?

602
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:24,424
Here. Press this.

603
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,095
Whose name is that?

604
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,015
That's right. It's your name, Jeong-hu.

605
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,850
That's so cool.
Do you want to try it again?

606
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,143
It says your name.

607
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,520
What is that sound?

608
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:41,358
Having this system puts me at ease.

609
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,443
I don't need to worry about
getting things mixed up.

610
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,905
They must have thought about it a lot,
to have come up with this.

611
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,492
Even if they thought of it, it wouldn't
have happened if it weren't for Mr. Gu.

612
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:51,994
We couldn't afford it.

613
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,203
Right?

614
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,415
We've got a group of fangirls here.

615
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,584
Keep complimenting him.

616
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,836
It'll be his first and last achievement.

617
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,553
Kids are clueless, so they like it.
But what about the parents?

618
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,096
If you walk around with that,

619
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:14,516
they'll criticize doctors for not being
able to remember what they do.

620
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,686
We need to earn patients' trust
in order to make them respect what we say.

621
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:22,524
Shit. How dare that kid
treat us like children?

622
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,695
Mr. Gu will keep doing stuff.
Do you think it'll be his last?

623
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,906
Once we have a director,
we'll kick him out right away.

624
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,576
Will the new director be able to do it?

625
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:35,329
He made a promise. He'd better crush him.

626
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,249
Sure.

627
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,339
Dr. Lee.

628
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:48,383
I heard you have someone
presumed brain-dead.

629
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,472
But the guardian
doesn't want to donate the organs.

630
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,890
Of course. It's their child.

631
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,061
Some people hit me
when I bring up organ donation.

632
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,657
If they start the evaluation tomorrow,
they should finish

633
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,867
with the brain wave scan in two days.

634
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,161
I'll talk to the guardian then.

635
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,039
Be careful. Don't get beat up.

636
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,171
The new president is a pain, isn't he?

637
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,383
-What do you mean?
-The response is a bit…

638
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,343
The chiefs, too…

639
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:35,972
Once we have a director,
we'll kick him out right away.

640
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,307
He made a promise.

641
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,980
What about you?

642
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,023
Me?

643
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,984
How I feel isn't important.

644
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,528
It is important.

645
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,822
It is.

646
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,175
ANIMAL SHELTER VOLUNTEER SIGN-UP

647
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,720
VOLUNTEER DAY WITH PRESIDENT GU SEUNG-HYO

648
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,228
Hold the elevator!

649
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,358
Oh, hello.

650
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,695
Thank you.

651
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,616
Have you had breakfast?

652
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,785
I don't usually eat breakfast.

653
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:42,122
You shouldn't skip breakfast.

654
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,499
Do you want some?

655
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,126
Pardon?

656
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,553
Thank you.

657
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,431
Hello?

658
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,391
Lee No-eul speaking.

659
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,519
What about his fever?

660
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,522
Since last night?

661
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,568
Please schedule an x-ray.

662
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,570
Thank you.

663
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,160
Hello?

664
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,496
Yes, I'm her attending physician.

665
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,539
She's still vomiting?

666
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,291
She just got off NPO.

667
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:27,959
I'll come by.

668
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:32,547
I'm sorry.

669
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,051
Have a nice day.

670
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:37,844
You forgot…

671
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,179
Don't skip breakfast.

672
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,723
It's hot!

673
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:15,465
SURGICAL REHEARSAL ON THE BRAIN MODEL
CONSTRUCTED WITH 3-D BIOSIMULATOR

674
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,188
I wish we had one of these.

675
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:38,363
How much does something like this cost?

676
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:41,992
MEDICAL 3-D SIMULATOR

677
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,786
PRICE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER 100 MILLION WON

678
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,456
Gosh. Everything costs
over 100 million won.

679
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,045
Yes?

680
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,802
You were asked to come to the station.

681
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:09,227
This is effective for boosting cognitive
function and brain health in general.

682
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,355
If you stress this
and recommend this drug,

683
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,358
the people who received brain surgery
here would get intrigued.

684
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,068
Not just the patients.

685
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,613
If students would take a few
every morning and night…

686
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:31,124
I received permission from the president…

687
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,235
Where did he run off to
after pulling this crap?

688
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:00,987
You, too?

689
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,281
These punks shoved this stupid box
in my face,

690
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,951
saying it's made of sharks' livers
or whales' fat or something…

691
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,203
Hey! Chief Oh!

692
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,165
He talked about how it improves vision…

693
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:15,335
How dare he tell us to sell this stuff?
How dare he?

694
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,629
These punks take us for fools!

695
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,013
After my rounds…

696
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,390
I'll just…

697
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,937
I almost got dragged into it.

698
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,151
Mr. Gu just left.

699
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,245
Mr. Gu!

700
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,518
What do you see these people as, Mr. Gu?

701
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:18,481
These people who came here in pain,
asking for our help…

702
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:19,941
What do you see them as?

703
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,739
"Memory enhancement."

704
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,450
"Stress reduction. Deep sleep."

705
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:33,121
How dare you throw these cheap ads
at us and at the patients…

706
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,791
They aren't cheap.

707
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,461
You don't trust their efficacy?

708
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,380
Are we drug peddlers at a market?

709
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:48,136
What do you gain by making your colleagues

710
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,139
feel a deep sense of shame like this?

711
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,099
-How could you--
-Enough!

712
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:56,686
Chief Oh Se-hwa.

713
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,399
When you found out that Hwajeong Group
was acquiring this hospital,

714
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:04,194
you should've refused firmly then.

715
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,653
Why are you whining now?

716
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,532
Chief Oh. Along with all
the employees here,

717
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,702
you became Hwajeong's employees
through the acquisition.

718
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,079
Then you should work.

719
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,414
What do you think
is the duty of employees?

720
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,209
Isn't it to provide service and get paid?

721
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,920
I can't understand why
you're bringing up your sense of shame.

722
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,132
Are you ashamed of doing sales?
What about it? Why?

723
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,635
Do salespeople seem that lowly

724
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,553
to you people?

725
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:35,266
They work hard to put food
on the table for their families, too.

726
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,311
Are doctors so noble
that they're different from other people?

727
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,731
Listen up.

728
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,151
If you don't want to get paid,
you don't have to sell the drugs.

729
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,153
Don't do it if you don't want to.

732
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,585
I heard they supplied this.

733
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,839
I didn't borrow any money,
but I feel like a debtor.

734
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,757
It's not like I can just stop using it.

735
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,887
I can't just take what they offered
and not sell their drugs.

736
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:57,265
What?

737
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:01,269
Your name got removed
from the list of attending physicians.

738
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,063
Were they canceled
since we're not going to Naksan anyway?

739
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,940
Who knows?

740
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,193
Congratulations regardless.

741
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,944
You will get fewer calls now.

742
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,446
That's right.

ANIMAL SHELTER VOLUNTEER SIGN-UP

00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,638
VOLUNTEER DAY WITH PRESIDENT GU SEUNG-HYO

747
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,057
WE URGE YOU TO PARTICIPATE
IN THE VOLUNTEER WORK

748
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,693
THIS PART IS…

749
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,113
-Where's Jae-hyeok?
-He clocked out.

750
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:57,283
That lazy first year.
We couldn't clock out in my day.

751
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,788
Forge his handwriting and pass it on.

752
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,916
Why is he asking others to join?

753
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,335
I don't even bathe my own dog.

754
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,420
The president is going himself, too.

755
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:12,674
You should go, too.

756
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:14,425
Forget it.

757
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,135
The election is coming up.

758
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,929
So?

759
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,140
Chief,
why don't you register as a candidate?

760
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,189
Are you kidding?
The deputy director clearly wants it.

761
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,442
How could we have only one candidate?

762
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,487
Why do you think no one else stepped up?

763
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,657
The director has to work
closely with the president.

764
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,994
It's better for the deputy director
to take the fall.

765
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,203
Let him do it.

766
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:47,625
If Jae-hyeok refuses to go, send someone
who's off over the weekend.

767
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:48,960
They want one per department.

768
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,796
We should send someone.
Otherwise, we'll look bad.

769
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:52,797
Okay.

770
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:59,012

01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,186
What…

773
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:10,231
What is Mr. Gu like?

774
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,901
I showed him around the wards.

775
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:17,113
Personally? Why?

776
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,576
I thought he might feel something
if he saw the kids.

ANIMAL SHELTER VOLUNTEER SIGN-UP

778
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,336
VOLUNTEER DAY WITH PRESIDENT GU SEUNG-HYO

779
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,504
Here we go. Look here.

780
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,590
Let's all make a heart with your fingers.

781
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,884
One, two, three.

782
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,969
Let's take one more.

783
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:44,182
People on the outside,
please gather closer. Okay.

784
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,976
One, two, three.

785
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:50,021
Thank you.

786
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:55,735
I'll tell you the order.

787
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,695
First, clean the cages,

788
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:00,031
feed them, bathe them,
then play with them.

789
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,532
We'll go in that order.

790
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,494
-Please show them the way.
-Please, come with me.

791
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,579
This group, come with me.

792
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:12,293
I didn't know you liked animals as well.

793
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:15,755
You look ten years younger,
dressed like that.

794
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,798
Thank you.

795
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:20,843
Mr. Gu.

796
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,638
May I get a personal interview?

797
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:24,889
Sure. How should we do it?

798
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,975
If you'd tell us
your objective as we walk,

799
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,936
we'll edit it to make it look natural.

800
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,230
Let's keep it short
since I'm not here to play.

801
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,524
We'll include clips of you volunteering
as well.

802
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,025
I apologize for the trouble.

803
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,695
Which way should we go?

804
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,029
Let's go that way.

805
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:47,995
I've always had a soft spot
for abandoned dogs

806
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,164
and abandoned cats.

807
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:53,751
The fact that people from our hospital…

808
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,170
You're leading by example.

809
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,006
I have no choice.
He has my life in his hands.

810
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,719
What about you?
You said you'd push him out.

811
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,558
I need to stick closely to his side
if I'm going to push him out.

812
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,812
How did we get like this?

813
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:13,896
Let's go.

814
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,365
It stinks.

815
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,843
It's been a while.

816
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,262
Come here and eat.

817
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,223
Who gave you your name?

818
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,061
You're so cute.

819
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,064
What's this?

820
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:01,569
What's this?

821
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,989
Good boy. You're so cute.

822
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:14,081
Your cap…

823
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:17,460
-Yes.
-Yes.

824
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,843
We should've fought back about this.

825
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:08,594
Mr. Gu totally got us.

826
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:11,305
How long can we rely on our conscience?

827
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:15,017
For some, it'll probably go up
hundreds of millions of won.

828
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,604
I can't do anything
until the police investigation is over.

829
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:21,566
Are you saying that is how
he built his reputation until now?

830
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,901
-We still have to look into it.
-And if it's true?

831
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,403
To be honest,

832
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:28,281
the water will stay stagnant, and only
the one who casts the stone will change.

833
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,367
Things will soon be forgotten anyway.

834
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,119
Is that what you were after?

835
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,787
Is that important?

836
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:38,708
Because it says a lot about
what kind of person you are.

837
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:41,460
Did you know then? Why you?

838
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,379
Why did you come?

839
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:45,923
There was a chance you'd change your plan.

840
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,091
Why didn't you tell me?

841
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,135
Check what?

842
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:50,970
A government employee is coming here?

843
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,597
He's already here.

844
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,604
