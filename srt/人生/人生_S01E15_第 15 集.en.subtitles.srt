1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,306
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,224
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,608
EPISODE 15

4
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,589
Director.

5
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,636
I wanted to tell you I was back.

6
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,722
My apologies for suddenly taking time off.

7
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,226
What are you two here about?

8
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:44,729
We were notifying Mr. Gu
of the Council of Chiefs' decision.

9
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,441
About Mr. Gu being fired
by all the chiefs?

10
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,611
You make it sound like
it doesn't involve you.

11
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:55,448
Since everyone that was fired is here,
shall we have a farewell party?

12
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,118
Why would I have a farewell party
when I just returned?

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,663
I have a lot of work piled up,
so I'll go now.

14
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,039
-Director Oh.
-Director Oh.

15
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,378
Turn in your ID card
and empty out the director's office.

16
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,506
Did you know that you were used
for money laundering?

17
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,054
No one in this office is quitting.

18
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,682
Not Mr. Gu, not me, and neither of you.

19
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,684
Let's not waste energy on useless things

20
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,686
and get to work.

21
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,813
Come out, you two.

22
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,773
-Director Oh.
-What do you want?

23
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,151
All we will do here

24
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,069
is argue about who needs to leave!

25
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,989
Cardiothoracic Surgery must not have
a lot of patients these days.

26
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,657
Does Emergency Medicine have no work?

27
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,619
Ms. Kang can't do her work
because of you, Mr. Gu!

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,334
What are you waiting for? Get out!

29
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,525
How can I stop her?

30
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:17,989
Director.

31
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,283
What? What is it?

32
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,577
Are you okay?

33
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,456
Were you sick?

34
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,541
I wasn't.

35
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,260
I have to go somewhere,
so don't follow me.

36
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,150
I said I have somewhere to go.
Why are you following me?

37
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,027
That's not it.

38
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,822
Well, it would be nice
if we could go on our own too, but…

39
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,124
Where are they?

40
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,876
The Restructure Team took them away.

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,253
In front of everyone.

42
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,048
Those assholes.

43
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,225
What is it?

44
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,518
Give them to me.

45
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,395
Your severance?

46
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,021
Give me our doctors' ID cards.

47
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,023
Now.

48
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,860
I threw them away.

49
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,634
CHIEF OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
JOO KYUNG-MOON

50
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,927
EMERGENCY MEDICINE
YE JIN-WOO

51
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,277
It was you, right?

52
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,196
You're the one who sent
those women, right?

53
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,576
I know more than 50 ways to kill people

54
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,953
without leaving a trace or evidence.

55
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,750
Should I inject poison into
everything in your home?

56
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,918
Should I make your entire family
crawl on all fours?

57
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,550
So, your son goes to soccer class.

58
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,929
Hey, you.

59
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,349
If you want to threaten someone, you
shouldn't post your kid's photos online.

60
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,977
You do crap like that,

61
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,396
but you still have the nerve
to post photos of your kid?

62
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,443
If you touch my family,

63
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,738
you'll never see yours ever again, got it?

64
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,876
You get your paychecks from the hospital,

65
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,586
but you don't know who you work for?

66
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,755
Did you forget where you work at?

67
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,715
Is this Hwajeong's head office?
Their factory?

68
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,801
This is Sangkook University Hospital!

69
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,012
If you have a desk here,
you're the hospital's employee,

70
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,931
and I'm your director!

71
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,517
If you don't like your boss,
you're free to go!

72
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,812
How dare you overstep your authority?

73
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,423
Our codes were locked, too.

74
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,676
-I hear you're the deputy director now.
-Yes.

75
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,262
Get the IT Department to unlock them.
You're the deputy director.

76
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,347
I've never been
a deputy director before, so…

77
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,308
When you inspected Lee Jeong-seon--

78
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,685
Mr. Gu didn't pressure me.

79
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,270
Don't think of using that against him.

80
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,688
Then how did you know?

81
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,898
When you took the body,

82
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,817
it was before the news got out.

83
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,569
How did you know who the patient was,

84
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,946
and why did you return to the hospital
that night?

85
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,035
Can't I come back?

86
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,370
I said he didn't.

87
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,205
This isn't about just this incident.

88
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,833
If we remain silent now,

89
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,668
we'll have to shut our mouths forever.

90
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,463
"We can use her like that.

91
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,131
She won't resist or talk back."

92
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,674
Do you disagree?

93
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,638
Director, please end it here,

94
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,892
at least for your junior doctors.
I'm begging you.

95
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,024
You can't expose everything directly.

96
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,027
I'm sure the director has a reason
for being unable to speak.

97
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,707
You said you had somewhere to go--

98
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,833
I went there.

99
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,052
Let's discuss this realistically.

100
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,679
How far do you want to go?

101
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,098
Will you fight Cho Nam-hyeong?
The chairman of Hwajeong?

102
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,850
There's another reality,

103
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,602
where we can't pretend it didn't happen.

104
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,862
What did you mean,
I was used for money laundering?

105
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,323
The construction site in Songtan.

106
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,743
Chairman Cho bribed a politician
through the land purchase.

107
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,330
I was gone for only a few days.

108
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,669
The chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology
said something about

109
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,128
Director Lee Bo-hun's bank account.

110
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,297
We received the director's
family's consent

111
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,341
to investigate the transactions.

112
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,472
You're good at reporting things.

113
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,100
You should've told me things like that
right away.

114
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,768
When did you know about the incentive?

115
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,105
The day the director passed away.

116
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,441
Why that day, of all days?

117
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:35,241
We shouldn't be the ones trying to resolve
the autopsy matter.

118
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,993
We must cut it loose.

119
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,452
How?

120
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,916
Let's bury the land issue for now.

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,251
What will you do?

122
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,712
What…

123
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,923
I'll take care of it.

124
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,758
I'll take care of it.

125
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,510
How?

126
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,053
I know many reporters.

127
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,015
"I revised my statement because of
what the autopsy showed,

128
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,434
so you should wait for
the written opinion.

129
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,562
Why are you so impatient?
These opinions usually take

130
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,022
a month or two.

131
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,567
Neither Sangkook nor Hwajeong
had an agenda."

132
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,736
If I announce that,

133
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,697
the medical examiner will have to
write according to what he saw.

134
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,367
So, you persuade

135
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,369
Chairman Cho.

136
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,500
Our chairman is not someone
you can easily persuade.

137
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,127
He must know as well,

138
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,422
that if they flip it again
in Hwajeong's favor,

139
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,174
they'll be stoned to death.

140
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,302
I'm trying to minimize the damage
for Chairman Cho.

141
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,513
What has ever caused damage to a chairman

142
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,598
of a corporation?

143
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,225
There's no such thing.

144
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,227
Nothing can damage them.

145
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,819
You heard about the incentive, right?

146
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,406
-Yes.
-When did you find out?

147
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,824
You knew it already, didn't you?

148
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,661
I found out the day Director Lee Bo-hun
passed away.

149
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,162
From Deputy Director Kim Tae-sang.

150
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,083
He said he thought the director
siphoned hospital funds,

151
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,335
and that he'll get it back somehow.

152
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,963
He asked that we not taint the director's
name, since he passed away anyway.

153
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,259
I wonder how he returned something
someone else took.

154
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,388
We checked the details of the transaction.

155
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,764
Should I send it to you?

156
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,268
Then you suspected

157
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,729
the deputy director then, too.

158
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,689
You can't trust people.

159
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,776
Who would really care about the name
of someone who died?

160
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,820
Still, they worked together for 30 years.

161
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,449
She must have grown up sheltered.

162
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,953
You've never been conned, have you?

163
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,376
I won't avoid it anymore.

164
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,045
I'm already annoyed as hell
that I hid until now.

165
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,716
How long will you avoid things
by just firing people?

166
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,011
What did you do with your child?

167
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,056
Boarding school.

168
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,059
I couldn't send her because
she kept resisting.

169
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,644
It was a good excuse to send her.

170
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,358
Let's hold off on meeting

171
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,485
with reporters.

172
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:18,988
Mr. Gu.

173
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,157
Until after I report it.

174
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,369
So you mean you'll meet with the chairman?

175
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,792
You'll do well.

176
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,715
I have faith in you.

177
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,799
Stop it.

178
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,925
I will not.

179
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,721
What's wrong with her?
She doesn't know anything.

180
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,598
She's unbelievable.

181
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,392
Find out the chairman's schedule.

182
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,835
Tell him to wait until I send a notice.

183
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,848
The system shows that Director Oh

184
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,975
went from the parking lot
to Mr. Gu's office.

185
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,853
After that, she came to
the Restructure Team office.

186
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,230
Considering the factors,

187
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,566
I think Director Oh had been audacious
and ignoring your orders

188
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,278
because she had some sort of
an agreement with Mr. Gu.

189
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,905
Gu Seung-hyo, that asshole.

190
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,117
With all that we pay him…

191
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,912
He thinks he's so great.

192
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,123
Anyone can accomplish that much

193
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,793
if the infrastructure is set up like that.

194
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,838
I didn't give him such a high salary
for no reason.

195
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,883
He should just do as he's told.

196
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,183
This came up on the portal.

197
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,985
This article was just submitted
to the portal,

198
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,737
and they want
to post it as the main story.

199
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,990
They're asking for your permission first.

200
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,032
What is it?

201
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,411
"Regarding Lee Jeong-seon--"

202
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,912
Damn it…

203
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,584
"Sangkook Hospital has requested

204
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,420
the Korean Medical Association
and the Korean Hospital Association

205
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,964
to give their statements regarding
the management's

206
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,716
distrustful acts and Hwajeong's illegal…

207
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,886
SAEGEUL21

208
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,178
It's by Saegeul21?

209
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,600
Get me the CEO

210
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,143
of Saegeul21.

211
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,895
Yes, sir.

212
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,813
Main story? Like hell.

213
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,773
Call him and…

214
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,901
What was his name again?

215
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,945
That reporter who stuck his nose
everywhere and got arrested.

216
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,071
Reporter Kwon Hui-sang.

217
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,073
That shithead is no reporter.

218
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,075
Say I'll have that asshole released,

219
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,245
so they'd better not write about us again.

220
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,538
Otherwise…

221
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,459
Fuck. Can't he do that one thing right?

222
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,005
Did I tell him to kill someone
or steal a corpse?

223
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,090
She died while fighting anyway.

224
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,176
What's so hard about saying
she got beaten to death?

225
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,596
He's the president of the hospital,
and he can't do that simple thing?

226
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,101
Tell the CEO of Saegeul21

227
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,855
that I'll show him what it means
to have your life utterly ruined.

228
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,276
And that I'll forgive Saegeul21 for all
the bullshit they wrote until now

229
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,487
about my family and our group.

230
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,699
I'll forgive them, so…

231
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,955
Do you know how much
Seung-hyo takes from me?

232
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,206
I'm paying him to do as I say,

233
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,541
and do what I tell him to do!

234
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,711
Because I can't be everywhere
at every minute of the day,

235
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,506
so that's why I use the presidents,
to act on my behalf!

236
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,299
Do they think it's because they're good?

237
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,886
They're despicable.

238
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,555
Who cares if they're doctors?

239
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,265
They work at my hospital.

240
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,518
That asshole Gu Seung-hyo, too.

241
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,187
Even if I got rid of him as soon as
my dad passed away,

242
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,357
he should get down on his knees and
thank me.

243
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,695
Does he think he's a doctor

244
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,530
just because he hangs around doctors?

245
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,449
If it weren't for me,

246
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,161
how could he even be a company president?

247
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,083
Shit.

248
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,603
Yes, sir.

249
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,815
Regarding the article, tell PR
to handle it the way they usually do.

250
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,192
Delete that,

251
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:09,528
make an article about celebrity
couples the main story,

252
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,030
and tell them to post comments. Now.

253
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,369
That portal…

254
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,290
Increase our group's online advertisements

255
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,625
on it, just five percent.

256
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,128
Tell them to post articles
only with my permission.

257
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,714
Yes, sir.

258
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,848
Take the guys when you go meet
Saegeul21's CEO.

259
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,809
If he doesn't listen, do as you want.

260
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,020
Yes, sir. I'll report back right away.

261
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,084
Tell Mr. Gu to come at ten…

262
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,629
No, at eleven.

263
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,173
SANGKOOK HOSPITAL ILLEGAL ACTS

264
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,133
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

265
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,387
SANGKOOK HOSPITAL
COUNCIL OF CHIEFS DECISION

266
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,473
THERE ARE NO RESULTS

267
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,485
Please. Give it to me.

268
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,573
Thank you.

269
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,991
Thank the director.

270
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,161
What about the director?

271
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,996
Did anything happen to her?

272
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,582
Like what?

273
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,919
Well, she suddenly took time off,
so I thought maybe

274
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,879
she was followed or something.

275
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,633
"Followed"? This isn't a spy film.

276
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,886
Right?

277
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:00,722
Go on.

278
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,932
-See you later.
-Okay.

279
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,227
What's up with her?

280
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,371
Why only me?

281
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,982
What brings you here?

282
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,111
I kept running a search for the article,
but couldn't find it.

283
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,404
Did something happen?

284
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,907
I think it was killed.

285
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,327
I'll upload it again.

286
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,912
I'll send it until they post it.

287
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,039
Don't.

288
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,792
We found a new way.

289
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,253
Don't do it. I mean it.

290
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,421
What new way?

291
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,173
Well…

292
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,676
Within the hospital,

293
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,261
we'll…

294
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,346
What will you do?

295
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,475
There's a way.

296
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,942
Don't do it. I mean it.

297
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,320
Promise me, okay?

298
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,495
Your brother's name is Seon-woo, right?

299
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,331
-Sorry?
-I guess your brother

300
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,083
caught you every time

301
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,836
you were dating a woman.

302
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,967
I heard what you said.

303
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:47,264
You told Dr. Lee No-eul, I believe,
at the hospital,

304
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,767
"You'd better not tell Seon-woo
this time."

305
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,231
Well…

306
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,985
Seon-woo and No-eul saw us.

307
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,903
Saw us?

308
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,113
Last time.

309
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,490
In the parking lot.

310
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,368
Those punks.
They should've shown themselves.

311
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,454
They were just hiding and watching us.

312
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,123
In the parking lot?

313
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:20,922
That…

314
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,468
Yes. That.

315
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,511
Don't worry about it.

316
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,513
I'll punish them properly. I swear.

317
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,601
Thank goodness we didn't kiss or anything.

318
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,102
That's right.

319
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,831
But…

320
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,465
they're not here now.

321
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,361
What's wrong?

322
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,489
Jin-woo.

323
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,161
It's better not to say anything.

324
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,371
No one will understand.

325
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,377
Just date her.

326
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,129
You know you want to.

327
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,925
Are you okay?

328
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,185
I have a brother.

329
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:39,686
I know.

330
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,772
There are two of them.

331
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,861
There are two.

332
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,533
You have two brothers?

333
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,786
Seon-woo was very good at soccer.

334
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:58,788
They called him a soccer prodigy.

335
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,083
Although he's a doctor now…

336
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,919
So your brother

337
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,215
was smart and athletic.

338
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,883
He can't do sports anymore

339
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,593
because he hurt his legs.

340
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,845
How badly?

341
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,388
He can't walk.

342
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,026
He can't walk.

343
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,111
Ever again.

344
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,344
What about your other brother?

345
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,555
You said you have two brothers.

346
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:05,021
"If only he could walk, it wouldn't be

347
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,190
so hard for Mom.

348
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,486
She wouldn't have to work so hard."

349
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,738
That's all I could think back then.

350
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,701
I hated Seon-woo so much.

351
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,870
So? Since when…

352
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,081
He refused to go to a school picnic.

353
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,083
On the day before,

354
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,586
Mom asked him to go,

355
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,298
and to play with his friends.

356
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,676
She practically begged him.

357
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,096
She packed his lunch early in the morning.

358
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,933
I didn't think about how horrible
it must have been to go to the picnic,

359
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,437
strapped into his wheelchair.

360
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,065
I hated seeing my mom beg him.

361
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,401
She did nothing wrong, so why?

362
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,697
Our family was suffering
so much because of him…

363
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,911
That's why I berated him.

364
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,916
And Mom berated me.

365
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,380
But that day,
as I was returning from school,

366
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,382
Seon-woo was

367
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,760
among the kids

368
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,512
returning from the picnic.

369
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,514
But then,

370
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,310
he started running toward me.

371
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,398
He even talked to me.

372
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,071
I didn't believe it,
since he was so different,

373
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,285
although I wanted to believe it.

374
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,246
Your other brother…

375
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:52,295
How old were you when you started to see

376
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:54,005
that other brother?

377
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,801
I was 11.

378
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,178
From then until now?

379
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,474
Here,

380
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,309
too?

381
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:10,271
Here, too.

382
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,990
MESSAGE FROM SEO-HYEON

383
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,182
What's wrong with you? Get off.

384
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,240
Do you have a death wish?

385
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,951
Who would actually want to die?

386
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,507
SEO-HYEON

387
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,051
May I meet your brother?

388
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,100
Thank you.

389
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,150
You're the only person who knows now.

390
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,746
"Now"?

391
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,164
Yes.

392
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,833
-Now--
-The door.

393
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,252
My bad.

394
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:00,840
Sleep tight.

395
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,886
I was sleeping just fine.

396
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,329
What are you waiting for?

397
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,331
Yes, sir.

398
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,668
"From the perspective of
a businessman for whom

399
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,795
rationality and efficiency are standard,

400
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,173
I am deeply disappointed by the public
criticism Sangkook Hospital has gained.

401
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,426
Although it is a private school,

402
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,930
because the medical staff's
sense of entitlement is too strong,

403
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,725
the management's guidance is not being
relayed properly or executed.

404
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,603
In order to get rid of
this sense of entitlement

405
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,939
and improve competitiveness,

406
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,239
Sangkook University Hospital,
a non-profit hospital,

407
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,158
will be converted into
a for-profit hospital."

408
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,328
Mr. Cho.

409
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,246
What?

410
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,041
Even regular general hospitals
must be non-profit entities,

411
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,752
but we are one of the largest
with over 2,000 beds.

412
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,087
Legally,

413
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,465
it cannot be converted into
a for-profit entity.

414
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,884
Just make it happen.

415
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:31,055
Since when did you and I
not do something because of the law?

416
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,817
"As a leader in

417
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,737
the global medical business,

418
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,030
it will draw in

419
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,616
more foreign funds and hire more
foreigner doctors,

420
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,327
construct a medical cluster
centered around the Songtan campus,

421
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,995
and pursue being designated

422
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,955
a special economic zone.

423
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,582
Sangkook University Hospital,

424
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,959
which will return to the public
as a privatized institution,

425
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:04,213
will be a members-only
medical shopping mall.

426
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:08,801
Befitting of a for-profit hospital,
it will have top-quality facilities,

427
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,219
and become the center of

428
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,306
health tourism, drawing in VIPs
from abroad.

429
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,433
It will create jobs

430
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,101
and become the model

431
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,188
for connecting education and business.

432
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,190
This is our promise to the people."

433
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,443
Nice.

434
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,571
It sounds nice coming from you.

435
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,990
We can keep it as is.

436
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,909
Do you have a plan

437
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,703
for pursuing privatization?

438
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,414
Our country's law

439
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:42,085
prevents big hospitals from making money,

440
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,629
so we'll go with extraterritoriality.

441
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,299
A foreign fund will invest in
Sangkook University.

442
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,302
I guess the fund that will invest
is already decided.

443
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,845
Which company?

444
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,722
Guild Triple.

445
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,311
I'm sorry, but I've never heard of it.

446
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,106
Of course not, since we'll create it now.

447
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,608
Are you starting it yourself?

448
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,737
I don't want to get stabbed in the back
by real foreign investors.

449
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,864
It just has to seem foreign.

450
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,741
That's right.

451
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,161
Announce that the cluster at Songtan
will include

452
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,415
a sports rehab center, a spa,

453
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,500
and a fitness center.

454
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,754
Stress that the moment
you step foot into our center,

455
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,590
every type of healthcare
will be provided comprehensively.

456
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,219
Asshole.

457
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,180
Seong-chan could never do this
no matter how hard he tries.

458
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,016
That's right, sir.

459
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,603
However, aren't you showing
every card you have

460
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,273
a little too soon?

461
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,899
We need to be ahead of everyone.

462
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:54,282
We businessmen have always been
betrayed by politicians.

463
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,664
The previous government promised
privatization.

464
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,584
And the one before promised
to lighten regulations.

465
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
They bullshitted us for years.

466
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:11,174
A medical service business can
increase its added value indefinitely.

467
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,217
If they're concerned about the gap

468
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,054
between the rich and poor,
they should invest in public hospitals.

469
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,598
Why are they
regulating private businesses?

470
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,349
Why are they reducing our competitiveness?

471
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,898
We're late now because
we trusted politicians.

472
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:30,443
Let's change that, you and I.

473
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:36,074
Mr. Cho. But the businesses
referenced here are premised upon

474
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,826
the privatization of the hospital.

475
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,413
It'll be entirely against medical laws.

476
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,290
How do you plan to accomplish this?

477
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,666
We'll take it apart.

478
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,834
Pardon?

479
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,836
If we can't make it for-profit because

480
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,588
the hospital is too big,

481
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,091
we'll break them down by department,

482
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,134
and get a permit for each.

483
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,514
I guess our hospital will be split up
according to the medical treatment.

484
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,516
That way, we can make them compete.

485
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,476
And it's easier to control them.

486
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:13,528
It would've been perfect if we were
able to link things with cell phones.

487
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,404
I'm sorry, sir.

488
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,160
Announce it first thing

489
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,205
tomorrow morning.

490
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,289
Yes, sir.

491
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,724
Mr. Gu?

492
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,519
Go home.

493
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,089
SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL TO BECOME
A COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL SHOPPING MALL

494
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,929
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME

495
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:04,972
DO THEY THINK WE'RE STUPID?

496
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,058
GLOBAL MEDICAL BUSINESS, MY FOOT

497
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,185
THEY'LL GET RID OF REGULATIONS ONE BY ONE

498
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,773
THEY JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY

499
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,109
DROP THE "GLOBAL MEDICAL BUSINESS" CRAP

500
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,278
THEY WANT TO MAKE
A HOSPITAL A DEPARTMENT STORE

501
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,003
He's out of his mind.

502
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,089
I'm carrying a ticking time bomb.

503
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,633
It's like he's asking to be cursed out.

504
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:44,178
These terms about investments and
health tourism

505
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,681
may not be well-known
by the general public,

506
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,517
but a "comprehensive
medical shopping mall"?

507
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,894
How could they flat-out
talk about wanting to make money?

508
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:56,565
Read the comments. The hospital
president is being slaughtered.

509
00:37:56,649 --> 00:38:00,569
Shit. If he wants to create jobs,
he should hire more nurses.

510
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,738
They're not hiring
in order to cut back on salaries.

511
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,908
Why is he ignoring existing jobs
and creating jobs elsewhere?

512
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,452
If one of the Big Five becomes for-profit,

513
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,539
the others will follow immediately.

514
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,999
Everyone will complain

515
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,251
that they should be allowed
to do it as well.

516
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,296
That's ridiculous, too.
They should say it's wrong,

517
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,214
not ask for the same.

518
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,174
Special economic zone? Like hell.

519
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,551
There are eight already.

520
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,678
People love anything "special."

521
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,723
I know, right? Even the massive China

522
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,474
has only two special economic zones.

523
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,981
That big hospital is falling apart
because of one bad hire.

524
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,279
Will it get larger if we add
a composition analysis function?

525
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,032
Sweat.

526
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,909
Can it analyze the composition of sweat?

527
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:50,870
Yes.

528
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,539
When will the tester be out?

529
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,918
Okay. I understand. Thank you.

530
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,341
Hello, Dr. Ye.

531
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,344
Just a minute.

532
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:09,055
It's Dr. Ye Seon-woo from the HIRA.

533
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,186
Hello?

534
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,564
Hello, Mr. Gu.

535
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,650
Hello. It's been a while.
How have you been?

536
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,943
We'll soon announce the results

537
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,029
of the investigation of
Deputy Director Kim Tae-sang.

538
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,947
I thought I should notify you.

539
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,658
I see. Thank you for keeping your word.

540
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,453
Sangkook will be mentioned as well
by name.

541
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,957
He is no longer with us,
and no longer our deputy director.

542
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,126
After we found out about that surgery,

543
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,921
he didn't treat or operate
on a single person. Please mention that.

544
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:45,383
That's something Sangkook should say
in a clarification article.

545
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,677
Is it? Sure, we'll do that then.

546
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,557
Hello?

547
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:56,936
Dr. Ye?

548
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,064
Before,

549
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,441
the last time we met,

550
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,112
you were about to stand up

551
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,157
in front of me, and sat back down.

552
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,867
Did I do that?

553
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,994
But what about it?

554
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,372
That's the type of person you are,

555
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,833
regardless of how you think of yourself.

556
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,546
I don't know if I'll need to
contact you again.

557
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,549
Take care of yourself, Mr. Gu.

558
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:30,803
You too.

559
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,180
Take care of yourself.

560
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,033
DIRECTOR OH SE-HWA

561
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,036
Shit.

562
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,043
Hello?

563
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,923
Hello? What the hell?

564
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,759
Director Oh?

565
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,471
Mr. Gu, would you like to eat with me?

566
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:15,848
Pardon?

567
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,994
Jin-woo.

568
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:37,953
Yes?

569
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:39,872
Have you seen No-eul

570
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,834
drink with just anyone and get drunk

571
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,086
or anything like that?

572
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,255
Did she do that?

573
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:50,966
No.

574
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,846
She should meet people too,
instead of just working.

575
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,517
Look who's talking.

576
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:01,852
No, right?

577
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,732
She doesn't do that with just anyone.

578
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,317
Whom did you see her with?

579
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,860
Nobody.

580
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:11,946
I just mean,

581
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,032
if she finds someone like that,

582
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,744
someone that she likes,

583
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,288
I hope he's a good person.

584
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,593
He has to be a good person.

585
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,191
You were a personal assistant?

586
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,154
You were a personal assistant
at Hwajeong Group?

587
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,575
Yes. That was my first job.

588
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,452
Then… You're not…

589
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,038
No?

590
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,335
I mean, people said you were
the late Hwajeong's chairman's son

591
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,005
that he kept from the world.

592
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,758
Since you're so successful,

593
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,677
people at Hwajeong gossip,

594
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,637
and I heard it through the grapevine.

595
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,598
There's no need to get upset.

596
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:22,683
Look at my mom before you say that.

597
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,476
She's not capable of such a thing.

598
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,520
The chairman's son? My foot.

599
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,189
I thought you were born with
a silver spoon in your mouth.

600
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,317
What was that for?

601
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:35,487
I worked so hard to kill
that stupid rumor.

602
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,283
And it's true, I was born rich.

603
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,327
We lost it all during
the IMF crisis, that's all.

604
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,666
What? Have you never met someone
who went bankrupt during the IMF crisis?

605
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,129
It sounded familiar.
I thought you were talking about my family

606
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,422
and how we went bankrupt.

607
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,054
What's with you people?

608
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,514
You don't know about that time, do you?

609
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,184
Since both of your parents
were doctors and professors.

610
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,895
Come on. Who doesn't know
about the IMF crisis?

611
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,939
Hearing about it and experiencing it
are as different as night and day.

612
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,275
Good for you both.

613
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,903
You got to personally experience
Korea's dark history.

614
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,155
It is a dark history.

615
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,033
But at least we overcame it quickly
by working together.

616
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,870
We should shake off our hospital's
dark history as soon as possible as well.

617
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,129
This may be the last time we eat together,

618
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,299
so let's talk after we finish eating.

619
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,682
But people were so naive back then.

620
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,601
Some were responsible
for bleeding the country dry.

621
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,395
They should've thrown stones at them.

622
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:53,482
Why did people offer up their jewelry
to pay the national debt?

623
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,485
That wasn't the only time.
What was that? That dam.

624
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,446
-The Peace Dam.
-That's right.

625
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,492
Even when I think about it now,
it still makes no sense.

626
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,953
Exactly. Everyone thought all of Seoul
would be flooded

627
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,205
if we didn't build that back then.

628
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,752
Don't you know about it?

629
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,629
Sorry?

630
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,134
Have you never heard of the Peace Dam?

631
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,927
Well…

632
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,559
How old were you back then?

633
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,354
It's rude to ask a man his age.

634
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,106
When was that? The eighties…

635
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,567
-In…
-In 1986? Or was it 1987?

636
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:41,155
-Kindergarten?
-First grade.

637
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,781
First grade.

638
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,783
I was in the sixth grade back then.

639
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,704
I'm working under someone who was
in the first grade back then.

640
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,248
Oh, my gosh, how times have changed.

641
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,667
I was in high school.

642
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,009
It looks like you're done eating,
so why don't you just begin?

643
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,595
You must have a whole lot of things
to say to me.

644
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,056
You went to get rid of a burden,

645
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,892
but got another one
from Chairman Cho, right?

646
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:16,064
I told you, the crap
that was announced today

647
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:19,860
wasn't Mr. Gu's idea.

648
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:21,570
That doesn't change anything.

649
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,113
No, it doesn't.

650
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,533
We're going to fight.

651
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,621
Sure. I'm going to fight as well.

652
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,041
Too bad we're not on the same side.

653
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,004
The other side wouldn't stand a chance
if you two were on the same side.

654
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,300
It's because the chairman
is so out of control,

655
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,885
we're gaining a lot of support.

656
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,597
I've never received so much support
as a doctor before.

657
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,433
He said too much gibberish.

658
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:55,229
I know he doesn't know the medical
industry, and only business, but still.

659
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,983
Thanks to him, the public is
favorable toward us.

660
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,529
I guess it isn't just people in the past
who were naive.

661
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,281
What do you mean?

662
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,325
You'll find out soon.

663
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,000
Let's do everything we can

664
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,670
so that we won't have any regrets.

665
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,356
"It isn't just people in the past
who were naive."

666
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,275
What could he have meant?

667
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:54,454
Mr. Gu. The chairman went to the Ministry
of Health and Welfare quite a while ago.

668
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,373
His secretary only told me now.

669
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:09,386
CHAIRMAN CHO APOLOGIZES

670
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,846
Whose idea was it?

671
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,307
Doesn't it mean
you'll only focus on making a profit?

672
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,434
Please say a few words.

673
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,270
The announcement that was made
this morning

674
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,565
deserved your criticism

675
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:25,027
that we're overly profit-driven,

676
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,029
and I apologize.

677
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,238
Dr. Park.

678
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,033
Is it out already?

679
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:32,284
We haven't heard

680
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:36,204
any reports regarding how the announcement

681
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,540
by the hospital president

682
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,959
got out to the public.

683
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:45,047
We are checking through
the Sangkook University Foundation.

684
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,423
We will follow

685
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,469
the public opinion and
the government's opinion.

686
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,429
The comprehensive medical shopping mall,

687
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,640
the membership system,

688
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,308
the fitness center,

689
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,602
and other businesses

690
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,104
in the hospital

691
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,231
will be canceled.

692
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,484
CRITICISM DESERVED,
FOR-PROFIT BUSINESS TO BE CANCELED

693
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,069
Our apologies for causing concern.

694
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,113
Do you have anything else to say?

695
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,115
Is there another reason
for the cancellation?

696
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,910
Now, we have your weather forecast.

697
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:17,704
What the… Is that it?

698
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,790
It can't end like this.

699
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:22,084
What about the for-profit entity issue?

700
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,711
That's what he should say
they won't do. That's the most important.

701
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,964
Exactly. Everything else
is side business anyway.

702
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,342
They'll do it anyway
if it becomes privatized.

703
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,386
He left out the core.

704
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,971
That's not following the public's opinion.

705
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,264
They're playing cheap tricks.

706
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:37,891
This is what he was after.

707
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:41,478
"You don't like it, so we won't do it."

708
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,271
They pretend to listen
to people's opinions.

709
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,732
but they're getting away
with the biggest issue.

710
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,733
You're right.

711
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:50,028
It was a distraction tactic.

712
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,074
It was obvious people would complain

713
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,243
if they said they'd privatize
the hospital, so…

714
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,953
Mr. Gu drew the attention with nonsense,

715
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,247
and the chairman pretended to fix it.

716
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,835
People who don't realize it will think
the problem is resolved now.

717
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,670
Dr. Park.

718
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,047
Your shift is over soon, right?

719
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,215
Yes. Why?

720
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,021
The nurses union decided to demonstrate.

721
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,690
When?

722
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:30,277
We're notifying the police.
We need to tell them 48 hours in advance,

723
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,820
so as soon as we get the approval.

724
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,406
I guess it'll be here.

725
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,241
That's the only way it'll be meaningful.

726
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:38,994
Everyone who isn't working will come out
and surround

727
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,412
the entire hospital.

728
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,706
We shouldn't have stayed quiet.

729
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,418
Why won't Mr. Gu leave already?

730
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,336
He was told to leave, so he should leave.

731
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,007
Because Mr. Gu isn't the problem.

732
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,635
"It isn't just people in the past
who were naive."

733
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,598
I think Mr. Gu knew
what the chairman was going to do.

734
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:03,143
But even if he knew,
seeing how he's being blamed,

735
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,729
perhaps even he can't control it.

736
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,526
What if the chairman
and Mr. Gu are putting on an act?

737
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,738
If they were working together,

738
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,865
why would he have said that?

739
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,617
What?

740
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,202
"I'm going to fight as well."

741
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,955
He should've played dumb,
not challenged us.

742
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,253
Did Director Oh go somewhere?

743
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:35,008
To the Ministry. We were going
to announce our letters of complaint,

744
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,802
but that one piece of news killed it all.

745
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,930
Remember how

746
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,975
they were planning to build a hospital
in Jeju Island for the wealthy?

747
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,270
It would have been finished by now
if nothing had happened.

748
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:50,315
That's right. Since the Ministry of
Health and Welfare tried to approve it,

749
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:52,692
not knowing the supposed
foreign investors were

750
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,653
unqualified scammers.

751
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,365
If they were about to consent to
unqualified scammers,

752
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,618
Hwajeong Group
will be approved without any trouble.

753
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,882
Who are they? Who are those people?

754
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:39,489
What… What are you doing
in front of our hospital?

755
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,699
What are you doing here?

756
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,493
Say something, will you?

757
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,995
Do you work for the hospital?

758
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,080
Are you going to stay here all day long?

759
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,249
What's going on?

760
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,501
These people just took over this spot.

761
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,170
Look at them. This is our spot.

762
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,840
We requested a permit to demonstrate.

763
00:52:56,923 --> 00:53:00,385
The police said we can't because
there's one already until next week.

764
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,845
Then these people came.

765
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:04,764
So these people are protesting right now?

766
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,269
Excuse me. If you're going to protest,
shouldn't you say something,

767
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,563
or hold up some kind of picket?

768
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:14,524
What are you here to protest about?

769
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,652
They're from Hwajeong.

770
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,406
They're claiming the spot,
so that we can't do anything.

771
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,158
They're squatting.

772
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:32,584
Hey, you.

773
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,964
MS. KANG

774
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,469
What's going on?

775
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,387
They're from Hwajeong.
It's a phantom assembly.

776
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:45,847
"Phantom"?

777
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,557
They predicted what we'd do,

778
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,351
and got a permit to
demonstrate beforehand.

779
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,229
I think they just sent random employees.

780
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,898
Mr. Gu sent them.

781
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,192
If we're not careful, we'll be arrested.

782
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,319
-So what, leave them alone?
-What else?

783
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,537
What should we do?

784
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,081
We have to find another way.

785
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,798
How did it go?

786
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,062
MS. KANG

787
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,735
DOCTOR LEE NO-EUL

788
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:21,693
Ms. Kang.

789
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:28,616
Is the Songtan lease settled?

790
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,993
Yes.

791
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,704
We will proceed with the lease.

792
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:36,291
For the term, I made it perpetual.

793
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,501
What about the possibility of
canceling the contract?

794
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,754
As you asked, for special circumstances,

795
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,922
if there is a unilateral cancellation,

796
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,676
the building may be utilized freely.

797
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,638
Get it notarized.

798
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,351
Let's see the Big Five's incomes
from the first half of the year.

799
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:56,644
Just a minute.

800
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,397
Here.

801
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,817
If you look at the rate of growth,

802
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,945
Sangkook went from fourth
during the second half of last year

803
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,198
to second this year.

804
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,702
The income comparison of
the group's subsidiaries.

805
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,412
Pardon?

806
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:16,664
Okay.

807
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,669
My goodness. Why is that… I'm sorry.

808
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,797
I saved this as an image file.

809
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,923
It got saved here.

810
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,593
Ms. Kang.

811
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,844
I'm sorry, sir.

812
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,349
Six years, right?

813
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:37,060
That's how long you and I worked together.

814
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,356
You never once made a big mistake.

815
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,067
Here it is.

816
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,570
If you look at the comparison
between incomes…

817
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,366
What did you say?

818
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,081
Why did you suddenly say that?

819
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:03,878
Why do you want to see this now?

820
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,346
There's no proof of the bribe.

821
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,807
I only heard it in passing
from a relative.

822
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,102
Why did you hear it in passing?
You should've dug into it.

823
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,230
It's Dr. Ye. Come in.

824
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:29,904
Sit down.

825
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,496
I looked through
all the documents that I could,

826
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,874
and 58 billion won came out of our funds

827
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,208
to purchase the land in Songtan.

828
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,085
From the Reserve Fund
for Essential Business.

829
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:45,837
What use is the purchase price?

830
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,797
Even if it was more than
the fair market value,

831
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,633
you pay what the seller demands.
What can we say about that?

832
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,636
What about the Ministry?

833
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,056
They're in bed with each other already.

834
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,683
They couldn't do this otherwise.

835
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,686
From making a ridiculous move first,

836
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:04,314
to having their head step in

837
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,523
and apologize.

838
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,942
They had us distracted with Mr. Gu,

839
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,945
while they set everything up
behind our backs.

840
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:13,072
Did you look at the latest contract
for the buildings

841
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,532
in Songtan?

842
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,743
Only one of them

843
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,870
was changed to a free perpetual lease.

844
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,832
What was leased, and to whom?

845
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,876
The name of the tenant was odd.

846
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:28,254
Something like Hwapyeong-ri
Village Cooperative in Seosan?

847
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,131
A village cooperative?

848
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,674
What's that?

849
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,553
What? Hwapyeong?
That's near where my family's from.

850
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,139
I looked into it to see
if it really exists,

851
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,974
and it's comprised of about 20 families.

852
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:43,228
The building at the end of the campus
was given to them.

853
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,564
That must be it.
At the groundbreaking ceremony,

854
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:48,566
we saw it in the model illustration.

855
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,653
It looked like an apartment.

856
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,446
It was a separate housing site.

857
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,534
Did Mr. Gu give it to

858
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,702
his relatives or someone?

859
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,332
No. Was it the chairman?

860
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,461
Regardless, that works.
That's a type of embezzlement.

861
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,338
Or it may be nothing.

862
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,339
Why?

863
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,008
Mr. Gu said he'd tell me

864
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,301
what it'll be used for.

865
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:17,387
Are you sure he wasn't just saying that?

866
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:21,099
He has never lied or made things up.

867
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:23,601
It's just that they never helped us.

868
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,814
And seeing how he said I should know,

869
00:59:28,356 --> 00:59:30,984
it may be related to the hospital.

870
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,152
There's no way to stop them.

871
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,822
Don't you have anything we can use?

872
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:39,158
Something like that financial statement?
Anyone?

873
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,579
This is so frustrating.

874
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,624
I posted… the financial statement.

875
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,213
I think Deputy Director Joo
was trying to protect me.

876
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:54,966
You again?

877
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,220
That's not important right now!

878
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:00,972
What now?

879
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,099
What will you do now?

880
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,896
Look. Look at that.
You saw on your way in, right?

881
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,151
Even if I were going to send
Hwajeong's employees,

882
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:16,404
I'd at least have them change clothes
to look like protesters.

883
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:19,866
"Who cares if you know?"
He doesn't care anymore.

884
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,618
If he's working with the Ministry,

885
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,745
there must have been an illegal deal.

886
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,290
I'm sure there was,
but how would we find out?

887
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,168
Both our hands and feet are tied.

888
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:34,547
Excuse me.

889
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,384
Hey.

890
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,055
It's okay.

891
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,265
I'll be right there. Okay.

892
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,353
I have a surgery.

893
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,230
Let's go.

894
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,872
-Deputy Director Joo.
-Yes?

895
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,667
There must be a way.

896
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:12,710
Sure.

897
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,597
That's right. About Director
Lee Bo-hun's bank account.

898
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,224
The one the incentive went into?

899
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:29,644
Yes. I checked the transaction details,

900
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,604
and Dr. Lee, your name was there.

901
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,648
What do you mean?

902
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,692
Me? When?

903
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,151
It was a while ago.

904
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,695
Around 1997.

905
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,739
What transaction did you do
with that account?

906
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,701
If it was in 1997…

907
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,578
That was over 20 years ago.

908
01:01:48,162 --> 01:01:50,415
There were many deposits and withdrawals

909
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,833
by Deputy Director Kim Tae-sang

910
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,210
and many other retired doctors.

911
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:55,920
Can you think of anything?

912
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,718
I'll think about it.

913
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,180
In 1997?

914
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:12,520
This will be hard.
I don't think we can do anything.

915
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:14,564
We can bark all we want.

916
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,274
Once they get the approval, it's over.

917
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,530
Okay. Bye.

918
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,540
You punk.

919
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:35,376
Why did you say you posted it?

920
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,211
Things are already a mess.

921
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:38,880
If you really have to move,

922
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,715
who would take you?

923
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,595
You should've kept your mouth shut
for the person who protected you.

924
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,347
How many times have you seen

925
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,641
the assailant survive
while the victim got kicked out?

926
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,980
If I don't even do that, what can I do?

927
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,401
I really don't know what to do.

928
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,820
Why are you thinking that?

929
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,030
I'm the one…

930
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:12,413
I wonder if the director
can think of something.

931
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,239
K. BOWER, MD,
1ST, 2ND, 3RD, 4TH HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

932
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:05,341
LEE BO-HUN, MD,
12TH, 13TH, 14TH, 15TH HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

933
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,565
What is this?

934
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:39,041
You knew…

935
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,421
this would happen, didn't you?

936
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:47,717
That's why

937
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,847
you asked me to work with you.

938
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:58,019
What you're looking at are
the changes in health services

939
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:01,439
from 2005 to 2013 as provided by
the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

940
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,024
As you can see…

941
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,610
It was all useless and a waste of time.

942
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,403
There was only despair.

943
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,740
Talking about it only tired me out.

944
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:13,826
It was when I was boiling up
with resentment.

945
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,505
If Gimhae Medical Center only had flaws,

946
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:29,383
how could it have been around
for over 100 years?

947
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,428
It was when I was wishing

948
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:36,307
the world would come to an end,

949
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:40,311
and all of humanity, including me,
would be wiped away.

950
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,287
You knew

951
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,081
what I was like,

952
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,876
and why I came to Seoul.

953
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,469
Somewhere bigger.

954
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,680
Somewhere more famous.

955
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,767
A higher position there.
A position in which I am respected.

956
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,813
A place where my voice
would therefore be heard.

957
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:25,690
A place where

958
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:28,067
what I say would be done.

959
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:31,779
But every day,

960
01:06:32,738 --> 01:06:34,156
I just got more and more work.

961
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,459
Should we spit?

962
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,044
Hey.

963
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,091
Why do so many people come here?

964
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,719
Does everyone in Seoul come here?

965
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,847
If you spit, you'll get hit.

966
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,351
There, there, and there. They're all you.

967
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,271
How precious and pitiful are they?

968
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,647
Precious, my foot.

969
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,984
Why are you so cynical?
That's not like you.

970
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:15,364
Why? Because the others exclude you?

971
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,327
Consider it a prelude.

972
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,288
It'll only get worse.

973
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,458
Soon,

974
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:30,046
doctors won't be just treating patients.

975
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,509
That era ended long ago.

976
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,927
That's right.

977
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:39,055
So you need to fight.

978
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:43,059
You protect this place.

979
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,521
Protect it well and pass it on
to your juniors.

980
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,482
Someone who will do just as well as you.

981
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,651
Make sure this hospital has a founder,

982
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,403
but not someone who ends it.

983
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,365
Protect it with me.

984
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,827
My era's over.

985
01:08:02,661 --> 01:08:03,537
It's over.

986
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:10,961
Fine.

987
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,799
Let's fight until the end.

988
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:26,685
Your young junior doctors

989
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:28,854
look to me now.

990
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:31,816
But Director,

991
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,610
Bo-hun,

992
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,489
I don't know what to do.

993
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,576
I didn't know then,

994
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:45,329
but the days I spent with you

995
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:47,957
were the best.

996
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,252
Will those days return?

997
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,381
Perhaps this is better.

998
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,342
I'm glad you left

999
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,594
before you saw too much.

1000
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:02,888
Remember

1001
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,057
Sangkook University Hospital

1002
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:07,893
as one that shines,
which you can be proud of

1003
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,229
forever.

1004
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:46,348
Mr. Gu sent them.

1005
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:50,728
We haven't heard any reports regarding
how the announcement

1006
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,980
by the hospital president

1007
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:55,482
got out to the public.

1008
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,194
If they were working together,

1009
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:00,112
why would he have said that?

1010
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,156
"I'm going to fight as well."

1011
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:07,912
Go to the head office.

1012
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:09,955
But you said…

1013
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:12,166
-The head office.
-Yes, sir.

1014
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:22,593
Why that…

1015
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:27,181
If you want to die,
jump in front of someone else's car!

1016
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:30,267
With whom will you fight?

1017
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,061
What are you trying to do?

1018
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:33,479
You know a way, don't you?

1019
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,343
No-eul resigned?

1020
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,178
What's gotten into you?

1021
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,554
Seoul isn't the best.

1022
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,223
You're telling me indirectly

1023
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,016
that I should keep my hands off
the matter.

1024
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,229
I'm simply saying there's no need
for you to be the scapegoat.

1025
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:17,398
What about the director, then?

1026
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,567
Is this how it ends for him?

1027
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,319
Those doctor punks are challenging me

1028
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:25,114
because they know that even though
I'm the owner, I can't control them.

1029
01:11:25,197 --> 01:11:27,366
Please don't tear the hospital apart.

1030
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,870
I wish my little brother
would live a long life.

1031
01:11:32,496 --> 01:11:33,789
I wish

1032
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:36,834
he wouldn't leave much sooner than I do.

1033
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,836
I think it was decided ever since

1034
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:40,879
the chairman decided
you'd make the announcement

1035
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,798
and he'd fix it.

1036
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:45,634
I'll keep a close eye on
Sangkook University Hospital,

1037
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:47,803
which I was a part of, albeit briefly.

1038
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,807
I look forward to seeing how you will turn
out to be in the next ten to twenty years.

1039
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,642
I wish you all good luck.

1040
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,939
