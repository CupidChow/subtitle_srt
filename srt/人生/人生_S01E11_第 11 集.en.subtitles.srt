ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,603
EPISODE 11

4
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:14,824
Hello?

5
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,497
Yes, I'm outside.

6
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,136
Where is she?

7
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,805
Who?

8
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,097
The patient who just died.

9
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,557
What? Didn't you send her?

10
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,683
To where?

11
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,644
The transfer team came and took her.

12
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,229
I thought you had them take her.

13
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,688
Maybe there was a mistake.

14
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,817
You idiots. How could you lose a body?
Go find her now!

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,943
Okay.

16
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,406
MORGUE

17
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:03,081
Did you take our body?

18
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,666
Sorry?

19
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,087
ORGAN TRANSPLANT CENTER

20
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,255
Hey.

21
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,464
We found her.

22
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,265
Shit.

23
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,768
Is she trying to turn me into roadkill
or what?

24
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,992
Who said you could come in?

25
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,204
-Director. There must've been a mistake…
-Everyone out.

26
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,249
Pardon?

27
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,458
Get out!

28
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,755
Who's that patient?

29
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,382
They said her name was Lee Jeong-seon.
That's all I know.

30
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,134
The police are here already.

31
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,260
You mean the man just now?

32
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,638
He's the one that came
after the car accident

33
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,306
caused by the reckless driver.

34
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,016
Do you think they're doing an inspection?

35
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,851
But why the director?

36
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,729
That happened after the CT, right?

37
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,106
Yes. I'll get it right now!

38
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,071
We're looking into it.

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,033
Just a minute, please. Wait right here.

40
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,620
Did you find Lee Jeong-seon?

41
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,330
Is that her family?

42
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,083
Yes.

43
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,504
Their daughter fainted on the street,
and was brought to the hospital,

44
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:18,466
but the first hospital told them to go to
a bigger hospital for higher-level care.

45
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,467
But

46
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,761
the strange thing is,

47
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,847
the hospital transferred her
without notifying the family.

48
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,727
They had processed her admission
and went home to get some things,

49
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,187
and their daughter was transferred.

50
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,194
Excuse me. We were told
our daughter was here.

51
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,738
Her name is Lee Jeong-seon.

52
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,659
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:52,750
Your daughter came here unconscious.

54
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,130
While we were examining her,
she suddenly stopped breathing,

55
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,466
and her heart stopped.

56
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,262
Where

57
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,639
is our daughter now?

58
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,437
They're determining the cause of death.

59
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,442
Ms. Ahn!

60
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,445
Take us to Jeong-seon.

61
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,281
-I will. First, let's put her on a bed.
-Okay.

62
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,658
Let's tend to her first.

63
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,123
They're doing the inspection now.

64
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,083
Something is off, so I'll go look into it.

65
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,585
Okay.

66
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:44,010
We'll find out when you can see
your daughter.

67
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,615
SEO-HYEON

68
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,003
I'll be right back.

69
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,424
Is Lee Jeong-seon

70
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,801
really dead?

71
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,595
Who is she, that everyone is…

72
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,722
Do you know her?

73
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,475
You know her too,

74
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,352
although not directly.

75
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,490
Do you remember?

76
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,867
The Speaker's receipts.

77
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,912
The ones he claimed were for DNA research,

78
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,165
but they were actually for
cosmetic procedures.

79
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,709
I saw the article about how he used
special activity funds.

80
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,044
The case your company disclosed.

81
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,797
She's the one who brought us the receipts.

82
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,508
Lee Jeong-seon
worked at that beauty clinic.

83
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,971
You said you'd keep my identity a secret,
but you sold me out!

84
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,849
What's your problem?
I didn't sell anyone out!

85
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,644
I heard my coworker's voice…

86
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,188
-Let go. Let go of me!
-Damn it!

87
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,523
Let go of me!

88
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,528
Jeong-seon. Look at me.

89
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,656
We're on Eulji-ro 4-ga 7-gil.

90
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,575
Send an ambulance. Quickly!

91
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,951
How was she?

92
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:33,995
I can't remember.

93
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,372
I was so frantic.

94
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,292
It's okay. Take your time.

95
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,461
Was she unconscious?

96
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,756
She looked like
she couldn't move her body,

97
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,092
and soon lost consciousness.

98
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,890
She looked like
she wanted to say something,

99
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,225
but I couldn't understand her.

100
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,769
She was not responsive by the time
she was put in the ambulance.

101
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,668
Did your coworker

102
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,463
get the receipts from Lee Jeong-seon?

103
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,798
It was an exclusive story
that he had covered.

104
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,468
He had worked on it for a while.

105
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,724
But why were the informant
and the reporter arguing?

106
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,018
He promised to keep
her identity a secret, but…

107
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:42,647
it got out.

108
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,941
Did the Speaker find out?

109
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,984
He's not the one…

110
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,700
Do you know the cause of death?

111
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,078
Seo-hyeon.

112
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,789
You can tell me anything.

113
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,291
I won't tell anyone.

114
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,005
It's not because
I think you'll tell people,

115
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,050
but because you may get hurt.

116
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,345
Those people

117
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,390
are capable of silencing ordinary people
like us in an instant.

118
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:24,188
I'm sure Lee Jeong-seon feared Chairman
Hong Seong-chan more than the Speaker.

119
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,191
Do you mean the chairman
from QL Electronics?

120
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,110
Why?

121
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,195
I only heard this from my coworker,

122
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,031
but he said Hong Seong-chan
was behind him.

123
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,203
The Speaker was supposed to pay
the clinic himself,

124
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,622
and Hong Seong-chan would
reimburse him for it.

125
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,584
Membership alone costs
over ten million won.

126
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,211
It would not only be a bribe,
but potential money laundering.

127
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,966
However, although he'd get it all back,
the Speaker used

128
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,552
government special activity funds
instead of his own money.

129
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,679
If he uses the special activity fund
to pay for it,

130
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,307
and is reimbursed by
Hong Seong-chan later…

131
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,225
He would get double the amount.

132
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,436
That corrupt bastard.

133
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,647
My coworker wanted
to go after him as well.

134
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,649
Hong Seong-chan.

135
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,654
What's the cause of death?

136
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,993
We don't know yet. They're…

137
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,872
There was a laceration
on the back of her head.

138
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,248
It was an open wound.

139
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,251
Even if it happened when she fell…

140
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,086
If she fell because he shoved her…

141
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,172
But she died, so…

142
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:34,842
it's manslaughter.

143
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,761
Murder.

144
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,139
That's right.

145
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,224
What did your coworker say?

146
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,353
The police took him away.

147
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:49,815
That's not true.

148
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,443
She just collapsed in front of me.

149
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,945
I didn't do anything.

150
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,740
Why would a healthy person just collapse?

151
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,036
You hit her, didn't you?

152
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,121
I did not.

153
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,417
You hit her, didn't you?

154
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,545
I never touched her.

155
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,716
What really doesn't make sense is,

156
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,428
they took him away, but didn't
check the accident site at all.

157
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,014
I pointed out where she fell,

158
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,016
and the police just walked right past it.

159
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,895
It was weird how they moved hospitals too.

160
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,232
It was out of nowhere,
and to Sangkook of all hospitals.

161
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,442
What about Sangkook?

162
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,658
They're holding a briefing soon
about her death.

163
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,161
Who's giving the briefing?

164
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,163
I heard it's your hospital director.

165
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,958
If you hear anything internally…

166
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,293
I'll let you know. Call me when it ends.

167
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,983
She got facial fillers
and a facelift treatment.

168
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,609
DNA research? Whatever.

169
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,361
Is she the employee?

170
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,822
Yes. She works at the clinic.

171
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,323
The one who brought me this.

172
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,204
How did you come to learn that the Speaker
of the National Assembly's wife

173
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,414
received cosmetic procedures?

174
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,000
My coworkers told me.

175
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,795
No, Jeong-seon. You can't say that.

176
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,923
You need to say who told you what.

177
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,468
For example, your coworkers

178
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,762
told you that the client was the Speaker
of the National Assembly's wife. Right?

179
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,681
Not exactly.

180
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,641
But every time she spoke,

181
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,769
she would say things like,
"Do you know who my husband is?"

182
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,647
and ordered us to go buy her stockings
and fetch things for her.

183
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:57,401
But my coworkers said to do
whatever she told me to do,

184
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,945
because her husband is someone
very powerful.

185
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,157
And that very powerful person
is the Speaker of the National Assembly.

186
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:11,373
Yes. Based on the picture
that you showed me…

187
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,419
She didn't expose what she found out.

188
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,879
You planted the idea in her head.

189
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,216
How could a worker at a place like this
know who the Speaker is?

190
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,344
I showed her a photo of him with his wife,

191
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,221
and confirmed that was her.

192
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,849
Why are you cutting that out?

193
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,601
It'll just dilute the issue.

194
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,604
The point is the origin of the money
and its use,

195
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:36,065
but it sounds like she's reporting
her abuse of power over her

196
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,150
out of revenge.

197
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,945
But it was her abuse of power
that motivated her to report it.

198
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,531
Abuse of power among the privileged
is a common topic.

199
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,658
People are sick of it now.

200
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:50,454
"A brave citizen discovered corruption
and reported it."

201
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,331
That's better for her.

202
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,874
For you as well, I believe?

203
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,587
Hey. Go work on your own stories

204
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,589
instead of butting into mine.

205
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,008
Don't tell me you expect credit
for this because

206
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,760
you found out what the receipts were for.

207
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,346
I don't intend to,
and I don't want to, either.

208
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,517
You'll blur her out, right?

209
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,644
Yes. I'm doing it now.

210
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,027
Anyway,

211
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,989
you'll keep this anonymous, right?

212
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,287
Whereas the Speaker asserts
that the evidence against him

213
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,040
for misusing government funds
was fabricated,

214
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,251
the media company
that first reported the suspicion

215
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,963
disclosed new evidence supporting their
assertion that they were not fabricated.

216
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,925
The reason I remember
is because the treatment

217
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,635
that she received…

218
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,096
What is that?
Anyone who knows her will recognize her.

219
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,807
…was the most expensive procedure.

220
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:57,438
Hey.

221
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,158
INTERVIEW WITH THE INFORMANT

222
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,978
Yes.

223
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,025
Yes.

224
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,154
I understand.

225
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,908
I'll report right away. Yes.

226
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,317
Who gave the order?

227
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,404
Do you know the cause of death?

228
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,863
Who ordered it?

229
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,785
Forget it. Don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

230
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,955
Let me make this one thing clear.

231
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,961
This is where I bow out.
I won't do anything more.

232
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,047
Do you know the cause of death?

233
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,636
A laceration in the occipital region

234
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,222
approximately 3cm wide.

235
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,392
Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage

236
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,269
and epidural hemorrhage--

237
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,562
In layman's terms.

238
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,941
Death caused by blunt force trauma…

239
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,280
is possible.

240
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,323
Good. Let's go with that.

241
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,159
We cannot possibly do that!

242
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,120
You need to be really unlucky
to die like this.

243
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,372
Who dies because they're lucky?

244
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:24,418
People get unlucky and get hit by cars
while crossing the street and die.

245
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,671
Sure. You must already have
the scenario all written up.

246
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,881
You people take care of it.

247
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,259
I'm not interested anyway. I'm out.

248
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,719
What do you want me to do?

249
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,471
What about me?

250
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,265
Why did you drag me into this?
Why did you tell them about me?

251
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,392
I did not. I never even mentioned you!

252
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,650
What if I refuse?

253
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,821
What if I do as I wish?

254
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,698
What happens then?

255
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,672
Director Oh.

256
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,325
Fucking assholes.

257
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,072
I just got a call

258
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,866
from some strange man.

259
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,451
He asked if I was Sangkook
University Hospital's Oh Se-hwa's mom.

260
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,705
When I said I was,
he told me to relay a message for him,

261
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,206
that they're relying on you.

262
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,708
And then, he just hung up.

263
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,962
What's going on? Is something wrong?

264
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,301
Mom. Hold on for a minute.

265
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,262
PRESIDENT GU SEUNG-HYO

266
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,642
Hello?

267
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,355
The likelihood she died from being hit.

268
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,482
The likelihood she had
a preexisting condition.

269
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,988
Was it caused by the blunt force trauma
from the fight,

270
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,073
or did she die from an illness?

271
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,763
I'm the hospital director, Oh Se-hwa.
I'll begin the briefing.

272
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,020
Lee Jeong-seon was transferred
to this hospital tonight

273
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:34,107
around 8:33 p.m.
from another hospital in Seoul.

274
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,110
She was unconscious at the time

275
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,238
due to a head injury and loss of blood.

276
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,951
The difference in pupil size
was greater than 1.5mm,

277
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,119
indicating a possibility

278
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,413
of damage to the cranial nerves.

279
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:51,959
She was in a semicoma
and was unable to breathe on her own.

280
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,669
Laceration in the left occipital region.

281
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,587
"Laceration in the left occipital region."

282
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,215
CPR was administered continuously
for 30 minutes

283
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,050
in accordance with the rules,

284
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,220
but at 9:19 p.m., she passed away.

285
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,554
NAME OF DECEASED: LEE JEONG-SEON

286
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:09,559
There were no other external injuries
observed other than the laceration

287
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,604
in her left occipital region measuring
approximately 3cm wide.

288
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,417
Her heart stopped due to

289
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,753
subarachnoid hemorrhage
and acute cerebral edema.

290
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,464
This was caused by…

291
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,970
blunt force trauma to the head.

292
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,115
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

293
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,993
Hey.

294
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,328
They made the announcement.

295
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,371
They say she died because of the fight.

296
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,083
It was homicide?

297
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,543
-Yes.
-Okay.

298
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,382
Why aren't they doing an autopsy?

299
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,801
How could they only do an inspection?

300
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,679
There are times when an autopsy is done
after an inspection.

301
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,306
Will they do it then?

302
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,614
Hwajeong's chairman and QL's chairman

303
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,492
studied together in the US.

304
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,951
They've been friends for a while.

305
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,331
If it ends like this,
it'll be the best-case scenario for them.

306
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,707
For the Speaker too, obviously.

307
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,010
I keep having this thought.

308
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,515
"What will happen to us?"

309
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,605
A person died,
but that's what I'm worried about.

310
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,193
Why is everything so messed up?

311
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,094
Who's that?

312
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,555
I worried for nothing.

313
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,348
He's fine.

314
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,903
-Should we go and introduce ourselves?
-No.

315
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,427
You said there's something
you have to do. Go.

316
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,804
-What about you?
-I'll wait.

317
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,348
I'll be quick.

318
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,647
Don't cry, okay?

319
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,206
You knew, didn't you?

320
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,379
That Seon-woo had feelings for me.

321
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,716
Yes.

322
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,347
Why didn't you tell me?

323
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,600
You always share everything
about him with me.

324
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,314
Were you afraid that I would
hurt his feelings if I knew how he felt?

325
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,903
It's about you, too.

326
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,530
What?

327
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,824
It's much harder than it seems

328
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,077
to have a disabled family member.

329
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,290
For the first few years,
every single day was a war.

330
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,508
Seon-woo may be my brother,
but you're my friend

331
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,593
of 15 years.

332
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,847
How could I ask you to fight with me?

333
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,769
How could I ask you to grab a rifle

334
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,730
and jump into this war?

335
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,693
But No-eul…

336
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:11,861
Yes?

337
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,446
You really didn't know…

338
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,158
that he smiled only at you?

339
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,329
Was that so hard to see?

340
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,630
He was always your little brother, and…

341
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,264
I see.

342
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,775
Dr. Lee.

343
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,155
Here's what you asked for
regarding the AGE patient with diarrhea.

344
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,825
Increase Medilac dosage
to three times a day.

345
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,662
It's quiet here.

346
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,539
What do you mean?

347
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,752
You know, it had been all over the news
because she died in our Emergency Room.

348
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,879
The director was on TV, too.

349
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,839
I didn't see it.

350
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,632
I heard it was broadcast practically live.

351
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,054
Are things quiet
in the president's office?

352
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,347
The president's office?

353
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,475
We'd have no clue

354
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,685
whether it's quiet there or pure mayhem.

355
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,565
I'll go for real this time.

356
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,400
Okay. Good night.

357
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,485
See you tomorrow.

358
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:05,850
Don't cry.

359
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,855
That's how hospitals are.

360
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:14,901
Even if we don't do anything,
problems of society come barging in on us.

361
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,947
Like when a conglomerate chairman
comes in a wheelchair.

362
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,290
It'll pass.

363
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,167
I'll see you tomorrow, Mr. Gu.

364
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,253
See you tomorrow.

365
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,715
Why are you coming back?

366
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,883
Where are you going?

367
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,719
I heard something happened here.

368
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,816
I guess I shouldn't have come.

369
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,037
Are you going home?

370
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,206
I'm going to the chairman.

371
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,332
Oh, goodness.

372
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,845
I know we can't…

373
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,931
pretend like it didn't happen,

374
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,393
but let's act as if it didn't.

375
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,480
Like we did today,

376
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:37,358
let's call each other
if something happens to Jin-woo,

377
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,319
and check on him together.

378
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,908
Like how we normally did.

379
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,832
Thanks to that,
I got to see his girlfriend.

380
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,668
That sneaky guy.

381
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,756
I thought he was busy, but I guess
he even had time for his love life.

382
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,843
You just wait a bit.

383
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,097
I shall torture him tomorrow
and get all the juicy details.

384
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,064
Thanks.

385
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,732
For torturing him?

386
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:19,984
Yes.

387
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,243
Each brother was keeping a secret.

388
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,665
How do you think you'd feel

389
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,378
if Jin-woo was sick but kept it from you?

390
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,967
If he keeps it from me,
I'd have nothing to say or do.

391
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,136
If I were to find out…

392
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,516
I know…

393
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,645
how he'll feel, being unable
to do anything

394
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,981
for who knows how long.

395
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,984
I know that

396
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,694
for sure.

397
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,116
You didn't need to know, either.

398
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:10,869
I'm sorry.

399
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,749
I'm not sorry for finding out.

400
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,726
Hey.

401
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,228
Dr. Joo isn't in his office.

402
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,690
He went home because it was his daughter's
birthday the day before yesterday.

403
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,111
-What is it?
-I'll see you around.

404
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,237
Okay.

405
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,949
See you around!

406
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,546
The hospital transferred her
without notifying the family.

407
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:12,096
My coworker wanted
to go after him as well.

408
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,098
Hong Seong-chan.

409
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:37,914
REPORTER ATTACKS AND KILLS INFORMANT

410
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,793
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

411
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,336
Hey.

412
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,337
Hi.

413
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,965
Did you get a renovation?

414
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,217
It looks like you got a makeover.

415
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,512
You're looking good.

416
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,932
We're not old enough to look bad.

417
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,184
I guess things are going your way.

418
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:02,021
Lucky you. I'm getting a frozen shoulder.

419
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,648
You've never been a fan of sports.

420
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,068
I liked studying.
You're the one who liked sports.

421
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:15,284
This guy's rock-hard.
You should work out together.

422
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,954
You should take him.

423
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,624
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Gu's busy.

424
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,043
-He has to launch the health app.
-Yes, sir.

425
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,671
It's not like he didn't because
he didn't have the technology.

426
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,717
It'll be preinstalled on phones
and wearables coming out this fall, right?

427
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,385
-Yes, sir.
-Which products?

428
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,221
From the new models.
Not the preexisting ones.

429
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,724
Are you upgrading your preexisting phones
with our app?

430
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,811
Come on, now. You were begging
to work with us.

431
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,439
Begging?

432
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,278
What about you? You were the one
that asked for help.

433
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,491
Am I the only one involved?

434
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,994
You wanted to annihilate them, too.

435
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,044
Chairman Hong.

436
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,130
Chairman Cho has mentioned that

437
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,008
his company will handle
the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

438
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,302
We need to go through them?

439
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,472
Yes. Any device
that can measure heart rates

440
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,016
is categorized as a medical device,

441
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,143
so it cannot be sold in general stores.

442
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,103
Including the 10% tariff on exports.

443
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,521
Yes.

444
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,816
Our product must be excluded from
being considered a medical device

445
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,693
prior to its release.

446
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,694
How?

447
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,905
We must change the law.

448
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,075
A heart rate measuring mechanism
of a smartphone

449
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,453
is not for medical use,
but for exercise and for fun.

450
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,038
That's what we'll need to stress.

451
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,165
Will it work?

452
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,793
We'll have to send the legal team
to Yeouido.

453
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,213
You two make a great team.

454
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,428
I heard you guys got the educational
business deal in Mongolia and Russia.

455
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,387
What about that?

456
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,432
Everyone wants to be like
Korean celebrities now, don't they?

457
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:05,144
In some countries, people are interested
in knowing which facilities rich people

458
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,606
get their health check-ups, skincare
treatments, and cosmetic surgery from.

459
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,943
When public figures such as
Ambassadors use those services,

460
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,529
it can create a real buzz there.

461
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,241
I happen to have a meeting
at the Embassy soon.

462
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,201
Thank you, Chairman Hong.

463
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,496
I only said there's a meeting…

464
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,963
Fine. I'll set something up.

465
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,050
Okay, then. The final piece of business…

466
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,346
You're excused, Mr. Gu.

467
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,158
The Speaker called, right?

468
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,118
Yes, just before.

469
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,203
That idiot.

470
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,080
Don't get me started.

471
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,916
He can't even take a handout,
but he's so greedy.

472
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,424
The arrest warrant for the reporter
was issued.

473
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,092
Everyone at Saegeul21,

474
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,219
including the editor-in-chief,
is being questioned.

475
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:23,347
There's a search warrant against
the company for fabricating a story.

476
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,141
That was quick.

477
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,061
Lee Jeong-seon is said to have been
nervous ever since

478
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,521
her interview aired.

479
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,608
She often said she couldn't breathe
due to the stress.

480
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,736
Her family stated that she got into
a heated argument

481
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,321
with Kwon Hui-sang on the phone.

482
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,449
Even on the day of the incident,
they said she ran over

483
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,367
to Saegeul21 out of anger.

484
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,412
The building superintendent heard her
and the reporter fight.

485
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,247
Did they really fight?

486
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:50,583
The superintendent heard her say,
"Let go,"

487
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,294
so it had to have been physical.
They heard her fall, too.

488
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,005
Then was it really…

489
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,509
-And the funeral?
-They're having her cremated tomorrow.

490
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,846
But more people are demanding an autopsy.

491
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,766
Most of them are Saegeul21's employees
and religious groups.

492
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,882
Please give us your official statement.

493
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:40,883
Didn't you predict that

494
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,843
-her identity would be revealed?
-Hey, move!

495
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,221
-All the employees will be questioned.
-Over here.

496
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,514
They're here!

497
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,023
We have a search warrant. Please comply.

498
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,282
Do you admit the charge?

499
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,119
-Was the evidence indeed fabricated?
-Give us a statement.

500
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,912
Please give us a statement.

501
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:23,926
Why are you crying?

502
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,388
We went through this during the strike.

503
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,974
Why won't the world change?

504
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,561
Why won't it change?

505
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,340
Why did you go to the morgue?
People could've seen you.

506
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,300
I went alone at dawn.

507
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,011
Besides, I don't need permission to be
anywhere inside the hospital.

508
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,096
So?

509
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,474
There is a laceration. About this big,
as she said.

510
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:15,144
However, the director did not
mention the depth.

511
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,062
Is it deep?

512
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,942
Well, the depth isn't
the real problem here.

513
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,861
I'm sure Mr. Gu gave the order
to the director.

514
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,114
What matters is,
who gave Mr. Gu the order.

515
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,786
This is a double-edged sword.

516
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,871
You'll still go after him, right?

517
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,127
He says he'll build a large,
new cancer center.

518
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,630
You can run that proudly. What's with you?

519
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,050
Isn't it better for you if he does well?

520
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:50,179
What do you take me for?
I'm not doing this for myself.

521
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,806
It's because it's illogical.

522
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,580
It is possible.

523
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,249
I can't say for sure though.

524
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,501
What if she had atrial fibrillation

525
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,629
and was pushing and shoving in a state
of extreme agitation that lead to

526
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,881
a part of her cerebral artery
getting clogged?

527
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,049
If that's why she fainted--

528
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,759
If that's how she got the laceration…

529
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,220
If the fight wasn't what made her fall…

530
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,222
If she fell due to her illness…

531
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,932
It's all about the "If."

532
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,892
They're all hypotheses.

533
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,272
What are the primary symptoms
of this case?

534
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,983
Paralysis, dyslalia,
loss of consciousness.

535
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:46,152
I heard Lee Jeong-seon could not speak,

536
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,696
and could not move.

537
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,322
That's what the eyewitness said.

538
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,325
Of course, she couldn't.
She fell and was injured.

539
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,662
Dysarthria can result from
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

540
00:40:56,745 --> 00:41:00,499
Her family said she often said
she had difficulty breathing.

541
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:04,128
The difficulty in breathing
wasn't induced by atrial fibrillation.

542
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,298
It was because of the stress after the
news broke out that she was the informant.

543
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,387
She also said her heart was racing

544
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,306
before leaving to meet the reporter.

545
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,642
She was arguing with him on the phone.

546
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,271
-Of course, her heart was racing.
-Then why did Director Oh get involved?

547
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,566
If you look only at that and insist on
her illness, ignoring all other factors,

548
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,153
how are you different from the director,
who announced the cause of death based on

549
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,112
external observations?

550
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,575
Do you oppose the autopsy?

551
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,661
The autopsy should have been done
in the first place.

552
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,538
Then what?

553
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,463
What's the probability

554
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,217
that the cause of death was an embolism
compared to a head injury?

555
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,844
We'd need an autopsy--

556
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,095
What is it?

557
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,517
As of now, it's 50 to 50.

558
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,231
Saegeul21 was the thorn
in many people's sides,

559
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,066
all of them are rich and powerful.

560
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,861
The person who fought with the reporter,
who was digging into him, collapsed.

561
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,572
"Good. Let's bring her to our hospital."

562
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,699
But she died there.

563
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,452
"Even better that she was hit.

564
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,038
Make that the cause of death."

565
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:25,417
But we're in
the same position as Director Oh.

566
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,795
Neither of us knows
the exact cause of death.

567
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,007
Just because Mr. Gu was involved
doesn't mean she distorted the truth.

568
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,425
It may have been an illness,

569
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,428
or it may have been because of
the blunt force trauma as she announced.

570
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,811
The problem is if you insist
on an autopsy,

571
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,104
and by chance,

572
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:48,983
let's say we do perform an autopsy,
but it turns out not to be an embolism.

573
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,403
It's confirmed as cerebral hemorrhage
due to a head injury.

574
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,654
What will happen to you, then?

575
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:03,789
The real problem starts when the autopsy
reverses the conclusion.

576
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,624
It wasn't assault.
It was due to an illness.

577
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,627
So, that reporter gets out,

578
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,963
and the higher-ups
have a mess on their hands.

579
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,924
Would they leave you alone?

580
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,720
They made that reporter a murderer
without a problem.

581
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:18,971
Who do you think

582
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,016
their next target will be?

583
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,277
Let's just say

584
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,947
that I'm naive and have no fear.

585
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:42,953
Do you have a suit?

586
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,039
Sorry?

587
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,167
Oh, no.

588
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,336
Go home and get it.

589
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,381
-I'll borrow it at the funeral parlor.
-They lend you suits?

590
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,051
You didn't know? You haven't been
borrowing one all this time?

591
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,138
I have mine.

592
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,765
Shoot.

593
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,812
It's fine.

594
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,569
I have a meeting

595
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,031
and a surgery.
It'll take around three hours.

596
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,282
Can you wait?

597
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,408
I'll go alone--

598
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,452
No. Go with me later.

599
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,121
Let's do it together.

600
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,165
Yes, sir.

601
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,509
Making a reporter look like a murderer
is a piece of cake for them.

602
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,511
If the result is overturned,

603
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,346
who do you think they will blame?

604
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:57,820
FORMAL WEAR RENTAL

605
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,955
MEMORIAL ALTAR 2
NAME OF DECEASED: LEE JEONG-SEON

606
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,591
People from Saegeul21 are here.

607
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,677
They seem to be requesting an autopsy.

608
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,805
How dare you show your face here?

609
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,102
Wasn't it enough
that you killed the poor child?

610
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,938
How could you ask us to put a knife
on her body?

611
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,732
Would you ever let your child
go through such a thing?

612
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,735
Please, help us this one time.

613
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,947
It isn't only because of our colleague.

614
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,617
For the sake of the deceased,
an autopsy must--

615
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,537
How dare you say it's for her sake?

616
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:53,375
Is that how you got her to quit
her perfectly fine job?

617
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,671
Is that how you made her get
threatening calls day and night?

618
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,509
You used her, made sure everyone
could identify her, and killed her.

619
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:06,096
Then you rush over to us because you need
our help. And what do you ask for?

620
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,724
An autopsy so you can prove
your innocence?

621
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,394
You know what. Let's cut you open first.

622
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,688
I'll cut you open first, you bastards!

623
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,231
Please, calm down.

624
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,567
-Get over here!
-Please, don't do this.

625
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,651
Stop that.

626
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,030
-Please stop.
-Let's cut you open!

627
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,406
Please, calm down.

628
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,200
Please, ma'am.

629
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,833
We'll note that your department
refused to provide the documents.

630
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,006
Ma'am, please calm down.

631
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,591
You should go.

632
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,140
It's okay.

633
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,309
They're gone. It's okay.

634
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,814
You need to leave.

635
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,068
We're very sorry.

636
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,570
What are you doing at someone's funeral?

637
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,113
-Please leave.
-Please leave.

638
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,657
You need to leave.

639
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,868
I'm begging you.
This won't solve anything.

640
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:12,120
Now. Leave right now, okay?

641
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,831
-Please leave.
-Just go.

642
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,875
I'm sorry,

643
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,502
but you need to go.

644
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,380
You can't do this here. Please leave.

645
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:29,054
Some departments haven't
submitted the previous quarter's figures.

646
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,766
What am I to make of this, Ophthalmology
and Organ Transplant Center?

647
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,144
I apologize. We'll finalize it soon.

648
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,771
And when is that?

649
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,232
We're more than halfway through
the third quarter.

650
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,984
Must I hound you about something
like this?

651
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,569
Like a teacher checking for homework?

652
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,780
I'm sorry. We'll have it ready
by the end of the week.

653
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,953
I hear the residents' evaluations
are circulating.

654
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,080
Why bother writing it by hand, then?

655
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,916
You should just do it on the computer,
if you'll show it anyway.

656
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,752
Let's be vigilant about security.

657
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,129
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

658
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,341
We won't be needing this chair anymore.

659
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,343
We will process
the deputy director's resignation.

660
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,387
Did he resign?

661
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,472
He should.

662
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,351
He's taking up a spot,
so we can't hire a replacement.

663
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,520
Meanwhile, others have to
carry his weight.

664
00:48:19,479 --> 00:48:22,190
He must either accept the punishment
or resign.

665
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,567
So, tell him to choose.

666
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,403
Okay?

667
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,240
Yes, ma'am.

668
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,248
Don't you have something to tell us?

669
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,627
Our hospital name is all over the news,

670
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,879
but we don't know anything.

671
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:47,049
We're all department chiefs.

672
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,426
An autopsy should've been performed,

673
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,763
so why did you step in, when you're not
even a pathologist?

674
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,058
You all know the reason.

675
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,397
Our hospital was in the spotlight

676
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:05,442
because a politician was involved.

677
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,402
It was a sensitive matter,

678
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,280
so I, the hospital director,
made the call to do it myself.

679
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,573
Is that a problem?

680
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,329
You should've said something
before taking the body.

681
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,331
Why take the body just like that?

682
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,211
Did I have the body moved secretly?

683
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,254
Did the ER kids not see them take it?

684
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,048
Is the transfer team invisible?

685
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,675
They did see, but…

686
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,970
That's not what I mean.

687
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,515
Aren't we doing an autopsy?

688
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,475
The family is against it.

689
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,605
Then it's not for us to quibble about.

690
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,320
Reporters are all over the hospital.

691
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,906
Make sure no one talks.

692
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,450
Especially Emergency Medicine.

693
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:59,705
Given how you, the chief of Emergency
Medicine, keep raising doubts about

694
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,373
what happened that day,

695
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,875
I can't imagine what nonsense
the doctors there might blab.

696
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,086
That won't happen.

697
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,511
The reporters don't have anything on us,
do they?

698
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:15,637
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

699
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,097
Be careful what you say.

700
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,432
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

701
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,769
Did the president set all this up?
The inspection and everything?

702
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,950
You didn't go home?

703
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,243
Was a patient admitted?

704
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:40,036
No, none.

705
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,455
Then why…

706
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:47,419
Why are you wearing black?

707
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,924
Should I be wearing red?

708
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,180
Go home. You stayed up all night
last night.

709
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,681
It wasn't the first time.

710
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,517
I'm trying to be nice here…

711
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,562
Go home! We have a meeting to start.

712
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,106
Go ahead, have your meeting.

713
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:10,776
See you guys.

714
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,027
-Bye.
-Bye.

715
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,366
Go straight home! Don't go anywhere else.

716
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,871
He looks like he is going to go to
the funeral parlor.

717
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,405
Why, hello.

718
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,705
Do you have business with Mr. Gu?

719
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,040
No, I was…

720
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,627
I was just walking by.

721
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,505
I see.

722
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,386
I'm on my way out.

723
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,971
I see.

724
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,851
You should go. I'll be on my way.

725
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,227
Okay.

726
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,007
Will you

727
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,134
go with me?

728
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,824
THE LATE LEE JEONG-SEON

729
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:20,715
I'm Joo Kyung-moon.
I work here at this hospital.

730
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,843
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

731
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,387
Thank you.

732
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,015
Aren't you…

733
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,980
She looks exhausted.

734
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,648
I think she should rest.

735
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,736
You should go inside and rest a little.

736
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:45,490
They're right. Go in and sleep a little.

737
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,049
We think she should rest.

738
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,592
Is there a problem?

739
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,224
If she is very unwell,
we can get her a room.

740
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,308
No.

741
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,769
We're doctors. Let her be.

742
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,159
Thank you for all your help.

743
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,744
Not at all, sir.

744
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,579
Please.

745
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,132
I'm sorry we couldn't save your daughter.

746
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,177
Did you see our child's final moment?

747
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,511
No.

748
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,891
I should have.

749
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,862
I'm okay now.

750
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,698
Thank you.

751
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:11,951
Ma'am.

752
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,380
This is an image of your daughter's chest

753
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,257
minutes before she passed.

754
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,435
So?

755
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,356
This is a blood clot in her heart.

756
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,151
This may have caused her death,

757
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:48,988
not her head injury.

758
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,699
So?

759
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,164
I'm sorry, but…

760
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,669
no one can know…

761
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,715
the true cause of death
without looking in here.

762
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,934
Do you even…

763
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,063
consider our daughter human?

764
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,694
Look.

765
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,740
This isn't right.

766
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,493
You people shouldn't do this.

767
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,331
Our child left home in the morning,

768
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:43,710
but she never came home.
She fainted somewhere.

769
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:48,423
You moved her around however you wanted.

770
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,508
You said she was hurt,

771
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,927
and then you say you want to cut her open.

772
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,555
She's my daughter. My daughter!

773
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,975
She's my baby, whom I gave birth to!

774
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,270
What do you people know?

775
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,815
What's wrong?

776
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,493
Calm down.

777
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:19,120
-Jeong-seon.
-Okay.

778
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,289
-Okay.
-I'm truly sorry.

779
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,167
I'm sorry.

780
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:37,138
Honey.

781
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:53,488
What is it?

782
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,620
Sir.

783
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:04,165
Excuse us. Please, step aside.

784
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,237
They want an autopsy for their child.
What is wrong with you people?

785
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,574
Word's out that you told the family
to have an autopsy.

786
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:23,077
Did you go to the funeral parlor
because of that reporter?

787
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,787
Did you go to the funeral parlor

788
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,874
-because of someone?
-Please answer me this time.

789
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:29,751
Remember when I asked you…

790
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,836
Why do you want to know that again?

791
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,796
What about now?

792
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,507
Was it you who gave the order?

793
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,427
I think those two doctors I reported about
said something to them.

794
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,553
Who was it?

795
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,305
Ye Jin-woo of Emergency Medicine.

796
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:45,767
Should I make sure both brothers
are confined to bed for life?

797
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,269
I guess having a paraplegic brother
is not a big deal for him.

798
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,938
Let's give her a chance
to correct it herself.

799
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,358
How do you know if that's what she wants?

800
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,198
I repeat.

801
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,033
I hereby refute the conclusion

802
01:01:03,701 --> 01:01:04,911
of the initial inspection.

803
