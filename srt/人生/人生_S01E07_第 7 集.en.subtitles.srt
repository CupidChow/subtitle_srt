00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:56,473
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,475
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,269
EPISODE 7

4
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,306
Your cap…

5
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,225
-Yes.
-Yes.

6
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,038
Did you start already?

7
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,123
Just now.

8
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,625
You found the cap?

9
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,418
I just bought another one.

10
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,421
Are these dogs all homeless?

11
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,631
There are so many of them.

12
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,387
Stop looking at them,
and clean up their poop.

13
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:22,642
Come with me.

14
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,195
Were there that many people
at the hospital that I didn't know?

15
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,532
I think it's because
most of them are juniors.

16
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,867
I've never seen them either.

17
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,703
Then why did you come?

18
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,247
-And you?
-I'm off today.

19
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,373
Just me. You?

20
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,835
I wanted to see…

21
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,130
What?

22
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:53,965
What else?

23
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,593
I want to raise one,

24
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,804
but I leave early morning
and go home late at night.

25
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,807
That would mean my mom
would have to end up taking care of it.

26
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,477
This is how I get to spend time with them
as much as I want.

27
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,562
Right?

28
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,564
I see.

29
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,441
You're here for the puppies.

30
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,326
-Over there?
-This way.

31
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,793
Now, go inside and bring out
the puppies that need bathing.

32
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:31,753
-All right.
-Okay.

33
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,131
Hello?

34
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,801
This isn't a place where you dump dogs.

35
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,345
If you'd rethink…

36
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,639
It isn't even a month old?

37
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,767
If you bring it here,
it could get bitten by the bigger dogs.

38
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,644
So--

39
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,941
It will be abandoned again…

40
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,986
People are heartless.
How can they think of doing such a…

41
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,248
Are you allergic to dogs?

42
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,041
Let me see.

43
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,628
What…

44
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,469
Hey.

45
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:28,268
Hey. Over here!

46
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,107
Gosh, this dog…

47
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,567
How do I bathe it?

48
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,666
Sit.

49
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,751
Good dog. Let me brush your hair.

50
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,004
Good boy.

51
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,006
You took a bath,

52
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,383
and let me brush you.

53
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,635
What a good dog.

54
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,393
-Are you done?
-Good dog.

55
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,936
What a good dog.

56
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,646
-So cute.
-Good boy.

57
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,856
-Good dog.
-We're all done.

58
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,357
-What a good dog.
-Give it to me.

59
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,029
Come here. Let's go.

60
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,573
Let's go.

61
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,534
It's nice taking a bath, right?

62
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,120
Come here. There you go.

63
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,458
Are you that happy?
Let's get you brushed, too.

64
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,676
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong with his leg?

65
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:45,303
Was it dislocated?

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,224
It was dislocated.

67
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,142
Even now?

68
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,518
It's stiff now.

69
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,230
It wasn't treated when it first got
dislocated, so it became permanent.

70
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,025
That must have hurt a lot.

71
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,360
Is that all you know how to do?

72
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,529
Treating patients wherever you go?

73
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:10,244
They seem to really like you.

74
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,333
Let me see.

75
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,590
What now?

76
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,217
Do you feel a tumor or something?

77
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:27,136
It could just be a fibroma or a lipoma.

78
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,597
But if it's cancer
that's making me feel this lump,

79
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,808
we need a scan right away.

80
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,935
You want to examine it?

81
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,615
People and animals alike
shouldn't be sick.

82
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,622
Excuse me. May we get a picture
of the three of you together?

83
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,295
Okay. Come here.

84
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,687
For some, it'll probably go up
hundreds of millions of won.

85
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,357
I can't do anything
until the police investigation is over.

86
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,823
That's not right. Why would you wait?

87
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:33,369
You should point out
how much the Cancer Center will make.

88
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,958
Here.

89
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,635
Couldn't he just volunteer
to help people like we did before?

90
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,596
Why is he making this fuss
about caring for dogs?

91
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,683
You hardly ate during lunch.

92
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,934
-Here, have this.
-What?

93
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,352
-Have some--
-Why you…

94
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,315
Oh, no! Sorry.

95
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,903
Must they do that in front of people?

96
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,071
Why not? It's like being on a date.

97
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,782
It must be nice, being worry-free.

98
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,078
Mr. Gu. How did you know about this place?

99
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,122
We're gaining a great experience
thanks to you.

100
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,709
Thank you. Please come back
whenever you'd like.

101
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,754
Everyone, gather around!

102
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:29,217
Thank you, everyone, for your hard work.
We're going to start wrapping it up now.

103
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,843
Tonight's dinner…

104
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,346
will be on Mr. Gu!

105
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,892
It'll be at the barbecue place
right across from here.

106
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,648
We'd like to thank

107
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,108
all of you from
Sangkook University Hospital.

108
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,904
I told the restaurant to give you
lots of free food,

109
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,489
so please enjoy.

110
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,742
Their parking lot is small,
so you should leave your cars here.

111
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,410
It's right across the street.

112
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:01,916
Also, please do not purchase pets.
Please adopt them.

113
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,126
Thank you. We appreciate your hard work.

114
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:09,257
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

115
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,111
-Please take a seat.
-The smoke is going to…

116
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,821
This is Mr. Gu's seat, so scoot over.

117
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,489
Let's sit here. It's near the bathroom.

118
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,283
I need to leave early so…

119
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,409
Mr. Gu!

120
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,038
Your seat's here. You can sit here.

121
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,248
This is so…

122
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,928
-Is this place good?
-Yes.

123
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,221
Let's have a drink.

124
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,307
Let me.

125
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,517
Thank you.

126
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,646
Thank you.

127
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,856
Oh, okay.

128
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,483
Thank you.

129
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,904
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Thank you.

130
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,698
Thank you.

131
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,950
-Me too.
-Thank you for your hard work.

132
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,248
Let me.

133
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,708
Okay.

134
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,627
Well…

135
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,587
Would you like to say a word?

136
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,797
Please.

137
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,637
I just want to say thank you
for your hard work today.

138
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,764
If your glasses are full,
let's make a toast.

139
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,975
Here's to the endless development
of Sangkook University Hospital.

140
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,978
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

141
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,107
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

142
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,281
Enjoy yourselves. I'll see you tomorrow.

143
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,492
Please stay seated.

144
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,380
Gosh.

145
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,632
Didn't think he'd leave so soon.

146
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,717
-As he said,
-What's wrong?

147
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,594
enjoy yourselves.

148
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,682
Mr. Gu left his credit card with us,

149
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,434
so order as much as you want.

150
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,018
Could you take our order, please?

151
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,939
Wait. Let me pour you a drink.

152
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,692
Thank you.

153
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,277
-Okay.
-Thank you.

154
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,029
Mr. Gu is quick-witted.

155
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,656
Why doesn't he take the hint?

156
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,160
Those two are the most uncomfortable
to be around.

157
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,245
Okay. Here's to everyone's health!

158
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,665
Here.

159
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,343
We should've just driven over.

160
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,847
What?

161
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,599
You should go ahead.

162
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,768
Come with me.
We can have dinner with Seon-woo.

163
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,772
You're leaving the get-together because
you don't want him to eat alone, right?

164
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,774
"Get-together…"

165
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,738
I don't get to see him
except on my days off.

166
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,491
He won't go out to eat,

167
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,494
and doesn't want to leave home.
I wonder why.

168
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,579
I'm the same.

169
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,539
Aren't you?

170
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,627
When you get older,
you become more of a homebody, no?

171
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,795
Is that it?

172
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,175
Jin-woo.

173
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,053
You're like your mother.

174
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,722
That's not possible.

175
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,350
Go first.

176
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,728
If you and I skip out together,
it'll look bad.

177
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,439
It's nothing new. Why do you care?

178
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:37,733
Drive safely.

179
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,777
You too.

180
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,279
-See you tomorrow.
-Later.

00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,212
We rescued it from a dog farm,
so we don't know the exact age.

183
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:43,883
Maybe like, three or four?
That's our guess.

184
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,191
It's been overwhelming
just maintaining this place.

185
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,485
We noticed something was wrong
with the paw, but…

186
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,322
What will you name it?

187
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,200
I don't need to.

188
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,329
He's only getting it examined.
He isn't adopting it.

189
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:14,997
I see.

190
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,124
Did you leave something behind?

191
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,767
Thank you.

192
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,061
I should have been the one to do it.

193
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,812
Good night.

194
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,065
Thank you for today.

195
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:50,866
Thank you.

196
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,997
It was the right thing to do,
but I'm still grateful

197
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,041
that you decided to keep
the essential departments.

198
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,296
But people sometimes get swept away
by the circumstances

199
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,882
and can't do what should be a given.

200
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,843
Because of their pride or
the opinions of others.

201
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,722
I never put my pride on the line.

202
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,266
The opinions of others? Whose?

203
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,728
There's something I really want to know.

204
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,481
Regarding the medication error,

205
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,486
was it all planned from the beginning
to tell the family about it?

206
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,446
Was it all calculated,

207
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,950
so that if we fight back about
selling vitamins for another company,

208
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,286
you could say they're the ones
who bought us the readers

209
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,081
so that we wouldn't make errors?

210
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,168
It wouldn't have happened if there wasn't
a medication error in the first place.

211
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,087
But there was.

212
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,134
Is that what you were after?
From the start?

213
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,179
Is that important?

214
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,557
Yes. Very much so.

215
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,891
Why is it very much so?

216
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,563
Because it says a lot about
what kind of person you are.

217
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:06,775
I see. So, depending on
whether it was intended from the start

218
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,987
or things just happened that way,
it determines who I am.

219
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,739
Is that it?

220
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,574
Yes.

221
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,412
The result is the same regardless.

222
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,251
I've been waiting for someone like you.

223
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,713
That's why

224
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,383
I hope you'll stay at our hospital
for a very long time.

225
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,013
Don't let anything happen along the way.

226
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,766
I've been here only a few months,

227
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,143
so it couldn't be that you're worried
I'll get replaced.

228
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,854
Should I be watching out
for someone, then?

229
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,028
For nothing to happen,
you should think about

230
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,823
what you can do for the hospital
so that you'll be irreplaceable.

231
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,412
There are so many things you can do.

232
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,211
I still can't tell

233
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,255
whether you're someone
I can place my hope in,

234
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,216
or whether you're here to ruin us.

235
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,884
I came to do my job.

236
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,137
I don't plan to ruin anyone

237
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,515
or to become anyone's hope.

238
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,642
You're a businessman.

239
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,439
Just as we want to be people
who save lives,

240
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,566
and not merely stitch up wounds,

241
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,861
don't businessmen have something
they want to fulfill,

242
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,655
beyond just giving out paychecks?

243
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,081
I wish your scan results
wouldn't show anything.

244
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,916
You have to be healthy, okay?

245
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,089
Thanks. That's a lot of stuff.

246
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,513
Good night.

247
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,681
Bye.

248
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,232
How could you…

249
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,027
bring home an animal
without telling your mom?

250
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,238
Do you know how much work
taking care of a dog is?

251
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,700
You said you'd just take it
to the hospital, right?

252
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,328
Do you mean it? You mean it, right?

253
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,538
Of course, he means it.

254
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,750
It'll shed, bark,
and even poop everywhere.

255
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,085
Who will clean after it?

256
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,878
Cleaning isn't the only problem.

257
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,464
No, it isn't. Someone needs to bathe it,

258
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,216
take it to the hospital,

259
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,592
and take it out for walks.

260
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,095
That's why we won't raise it. Right?

261
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,104
What's its name?

262
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,773
Name? "Someone else's dog."

263
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,906
Why did you buy all that
if it's staying for only a few days?

264
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,743
The men in this family love
causing trouble. It's in their blood.

265
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,130
Hey, are you going to sit there?

266
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,090
Come here.

267
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,134
That's right.

268
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,267
Nighty?

269
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,271
Let's go with Nighty.

270
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,108
Come here, Nighty.

271
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,693
No, don't go up there.

272
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,946
Nighty.

273
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,033
Don't go up there.
I put the cushion here for you.

274
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,328
Come here. This is your spot.

275
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,791
Nighty.

276
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,878
Paw.

277
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,672
I guess you can't do that.

278
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,593
Thank you.

279
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,810
SANGKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL DOCTORS
VOLUNTEERING AT AN ANIMAL SHELTER

280
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,200
Veterinary Center?

281
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,834
Don't tell me…

282
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,761
Increase the incentives for all employees.

283
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,138
Hire a doctor specializing
in emergency Veterinary Medicine

284
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,598
and establish a veterinary center.

285
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,810
Obesity, smoking cessation,
hair loss, and anti-aging.

286
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,852
The clinic…

287
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,687
What did we decide to call it?

288
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,942
Results showed that terms like
"Healthy Life" were better received than

289
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,902
terms like
"Beauty Clinic" or "Well-being."

290
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,780
Then announce that the hospital
is establishing

291
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,908
Healthy Life Clinic.

292
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,326
Announce them all at once.

293
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,369
Yes, sir.

294
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,746
QL Electronics' Chairman Hong
is available at 6 p.m. tonight

295
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,165
and for lunch tomorrow.
Which do you prefer?

296
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,876
Today at 5 p.m.

297
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,796
How about Songtan? Are we making progress?

298
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,423
The arrangements are taking
longer than expected,

299
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,342
since it's such a big change in land use.

300
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,470
We're targeting the end of
next month to start construction.

301
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,848
The floor area ratios will be decided
for the Cancer Center,

302
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,432
Examination Center, and funeral parlor.

303
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,476
The blueprint will be ready
by this weekend.

304
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,354
-Mr. Lee.
-Yes?

305
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,731
Find out if our nurses' starting salary

306
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,025
is higher than other hospitals,

307
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,861
as well as the engineers.

308
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,822
And we'll check the medical charts
of every department

309
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,490
once a month from now on.

310
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,661
It's going to be a madhouse.

311
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,247
The guys from Veterinary Medicine
are excited already.

312
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,125
Be it medication error,
prescription error,

313
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,585
or whatever type of error it may be,

314
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,503
the person who dispensed
the wrong medication

315
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,423
and the person in charge
will both be identified

316
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,716
and their pay will be docked.

317
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,803
Make sure they understand
that covering it up

318
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:34,639
and keeping quiet among themselves
will not be condoned.

319
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,434
Even if it means getting the entire
Restructure Team

320
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:40,103
to delve into this matter,
I will get to the bottom of this.

321
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,482
He won't increase manpower,
yet all he does is complain.

322
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,403
He's all hat and no cattle.

323
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:49,487
Anyone can talk.

324
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,283
These things are happening because one
person is doing the work of five people.

325
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,995
If he's identified the problem,
shouldn't he be giving us a solution?

326
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,959
If you guys get sidetracked
by the incentives

327
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,795
and order unnecessary tests,
I'll be out to get you.

328
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:10,008
The Emergency Medical Center
may have the most loss,

329
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,177
but we have the biggest conscience.

330
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,262
None of us will do that.

331
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,645
Sure. To be blunt,

332
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,857
if we go, "Screw it,"
and run every test possible,

333
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,027
make them stay six hours
to collect for an overnight stay,

334
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,989
and extort the patients,
our salaries will go up.

335
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,659
But if that's the kind of people you were,

336
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,245
you would've worked at a money
printing factory and not come here.

337
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:39,871
Stay true to that.

338
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,248
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

339
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,584
You've done well up to now.

340
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,002
I'm grateful to you.

341
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,338
Gosh. This is too sappy for me.

342
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,885
Anyway, don't get swept away by
what's going on, and keep steadfast. Okay?

343
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,221
Just do as you have been doing so far.

344
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,806
That's all.

345
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,474
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

346
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,937
Hurry up and get ready.

347
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,230
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

348
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,240
Let's go eat.

349
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,200
I'm good.

350
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,126
What are you eating…

351
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,795
That jerk. Would it hurt to ask again?

352
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,264
This won't be covered.

353
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,349
This won't be covered, either.

354
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,813
By using one Beriplast per case

355
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,108
would mean 150,000 won more per patient.

356
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,026
So in a day…

357
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:58,283
It's four times a day, so… Let's see.

358
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,370
In a week, it's three million won.

359
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,831
In a month, it's 12 million…

360
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,461
Shit. My incentive…

361
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:12,964
Twelve million…

362
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,259
Twelve million.

363
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,053
It's 12 million won.

364
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,932
What am I talking about? You crazy fool.

365
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,893
Get it together, punk. Get it together.

366
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:32,192
PROPOSAL FOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT SYSTEM

367
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:35,570
"The number of patients
per doctor is reflected 50 percent.

368
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:38,198
The net profit
compared to cost is reflected 50 percent.

369
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,785
The follow-up visits after initial
examinations are reflected 30 percent."

370
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,580
PRESIDENT GU SEUNG-HYO

371
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,669
You have to increase
the time you spend walking.

372
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,672
I'll prescribe…

373
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,674
a painkiller--

374
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,308
THIS PRESCRIPTION IS NOT COVERED BY
THE HEALTH INSURANCE SERVICE

375
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,559
NOT COVERED DRUG: OXIDON

376
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,979
We should've gone on strike to stop
the pay-for-performance program.

377
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,733
We should've fought back about this.

378
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,278
Mr. Gu totally got us.

379
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,657
How long can we rely on our conscience?

380
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,035
If you have the same years of experience
and the same title,

381
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,995
but the pay is drastically different…

382
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,332
Everyone will fall in a matter of time.

383
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,420
Mr. Gu may disclose people's
personal bank accounts at this rate.

384
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,590
So, depending on
whether it was intended from the start

385
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,843
or things just happened that way,
it determines who I am.

386
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,177
Is that it?

387
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,014
The result is the same regardless.

388
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,489
Before you know it,

389
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,534
some people's incentives will be
in the hundreds of millions of won.

390
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,290
For some, it'll probably go up
hundreds of millions of won.

391
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,589
How much more

392
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,508
must they charge the patients
to afford to pay that much incentive?

393
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,678
But it's too much money
to just simply tell each individual

394
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,721
to refuse it.

395
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,899
It's probably a done deal for people
who will benefit

396
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,026
a lot from the program.

397
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,826
WEEKLY FACULTY MEETING

398
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,795
ADMINISTRATION TEAM, INSURANCE CLAIMS TEAM

399
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,350
Deputy Director Kim. This just came
to the Insurance Claims Office.

400
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,394
HIRA, again? I'm getting sick of them.

401
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,981
THE INTEGRITY OF DR. KIM TAE-SANG
HAS BEEN QUESTIONED

402
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,900
THUS WE WILL CONDUCT
AN ON-SITE INVESTIGATION

403
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,364
What is it?

404
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,408
HIRA is coming to do
an on-site investigation on him.

405
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,538
What the hell?

406
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,291
Check what?

407
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,460
A government employee is coming here?

408
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,670
He's already here.

409
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,886
Do they think I'm stupid?

410
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,641
Are they fucking kidding me? Fire me?

411
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,476
They don't know who they're messing with.

412
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,911
REALIZING THE VALUE OF HUMANITY
HWAJEONG

413
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,009
Cut.

414
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,225
I didn't see the glass bottle
and just grabbed it while I was cleaning.

415
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,769
People carelessly throw away
broken glass, don't they?

416
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,479
We see this often.

417
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,565
Dr. Ye.

418
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,733
Yes?

419
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,860
Your brother is here.

420
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,238
My brother? Seon-woo?

421
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,991
He's at the Insurance Claims Office.

422
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,659
He's here for an on-site investigation.

423
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,012
Those immoral bastards.

424
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,765
Wasn't killing one doctor not enough?

425
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,185
They chose the wrong person this time.

426
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,604
They don't know who they're messing with.

427
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,773
That's right.

428
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,651
Whoever it is that's coming from HIRA

429
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,195
is going to get screwed over instead.

430
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,613
He's finally getting what's due.

431
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,698
They should have done their research.

432
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,079
Who's investigating whom?

433
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,999
Who in Korea would dare investigate me?

434
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:43,628
Is there anyone better than me
who's better at what I do?

435
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,422
We received a formal civil complaint.
We had no choice.

436
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,466
I'm not talking about
a small complaint here.

437
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,178
There was a tip that
you overtreat patients.

438
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,389
So, who's the jerk that reported me?

439
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,974
How would we know?

440
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,476
Even if we did, what will you do about it?

441
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,353
Are you going to beat
the person up or what?

442
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,564
How could you stab me in the back
without giving me any warning?

443
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,026
Look, Dr. Kim. If we tell you first,
that wouldn't be an investigation.

444
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,236
It would be an act.

445
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,280
That's not how we do things.

446
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,077
For Christ's sake,
can't I be the hospital director for once?

447
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,372
Is the election coming up?

448
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,875
What bad timing.

449
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,838
That's why I need to know who reported me.

450
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,841
I don't know the details, either,
but I'll ask exactly what the claim was

451
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,178
that's calling for
an on-site investigation.

452
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,930
Is Lee Jong-hyeok in charge?

453
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,974
Is that punk coming to investigate me?

454
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,268
"Punk"? Show some respect,
he's your senior.

455
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,311
Anyway, he retired.

456
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,688
Then it must be someone younger.

457
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,565
Just wait until I get
my hands on that punk--

458
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,233
Why are you taking it out on us?

459
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,820
It may be one of your people
who reported you.

460
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,741
Regardless of who goes to the site,

461
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,951
if you did nothing wrong,
it'll be over in no time.

462
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,426
Oh, my gosh.

463
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,184
He blew a fuse and ran right over?

464
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,979
Poor Seon-woo is going to get
his head bit off.

465
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,608
He'll do well, right?

466
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,070
He will, which is why they'll harass him.

467
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,447
Maybe his brother will protect him.

468
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,199
They'll both be harassed.

469
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,327
He's no match for the deputy director.

470
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,912
If only his legs were okay…

471
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,039
I wish someone would protect him.

472
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,958
Who? The doctors?

473
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,805
It may be one of your people
who reported you.

474
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,852
If you keep pretending not to care,

475
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,188
all your efforts could go in vain.

476
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,610
What was she trying to imply?

477
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,621
I want you as the director.

478
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,609
He won't go down alone, is that it?

479
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,006
No.

480
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,843
Don't even bring it up.

481
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,432
Sir.

482
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,519
Accepting that she's brain-dead

483
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,939
doesn't mean that you've given up on her.

484
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:38,237
This is regardless of whether or not
you consent to donating her organs.

485
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,202
It's not that you're giving up
on your child.

486
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,787
Min-seo…

487
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:52,043
is probably ready to go to
a better place now.

488
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,758
Please don't…

489
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,512
torture yourself about it.

490
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,350
You'll cut my child open,

491
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:12,480
rip things out, and throw her aside.
I won't allow that.

492
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,233
Don't

493
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,818
come near her.

494
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,154
That isn't true.

495
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:25,868
I, too, have read articles before
about donors regretting it later on.

496
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,790
That's why I can't blame you

497
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,542
for misunderstanding how it works,

498
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,587
but we don't do that.

499
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,715
I watch the operation until the very end,

500
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,800
and I'm there…

501
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,302
at the funeral as well.

502
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,888
If you…

503
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:48,599
decide to donate,

504
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,810
many children…

505
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,023
will live thanks to Min-seo…

506
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,693
and walk out of here alive.

507
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,572
Through those children,

508
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,825
Min-seo will live forever.

509
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,079
She will be able to see the world

510
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,873
through someone else
that will receive her eyes.

511
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,167
Her heart will pump
in somebody else's body…

512
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,587
and it will beat healthily

513
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,549
and for a long time.

514
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,011
Don't try to lie to me.

515
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,637
You people…

516
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,559
killed a man and covered it up.

517
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,895
I'm not stupid.

518
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,817
Get out.

519
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,157
RESTRICTED AREA

520
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,301
I'll be back.

521
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,433
I'll try talking to him again.

522
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,061
Thank you very much.

523
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,888
Look here, doc.

524
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,351
I'm Min-seo's uncle.

525
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,937
I see.

526
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,064
-But I'm not a doctor--
-Are you happy

527
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,400
you're taking my niece's organs?

528
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,070
Why do you think…

529
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,616
they're removing their child's respirator?

530
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,412
Because they don't have money.

531
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,958
Because they can't afford
the hospital bills anymore.

532
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,127
-Sir.
-And you're saying…

533
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,338
that you want to take her body?

534
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,216
When you people don't even pay any money?

535
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,344
We'll subsidize a part of
the medical cost and funeral--

536
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,139
How can they live on that?

537
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,641
How are the ones left behind
supposed to live?

538
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:39,061
Do you know how hard it was
for my sister-in-law to decide to do it?

539
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:44,483
It was so hard for her to decide
to give up her baby's body!

540
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,571
But how could you harass
someone like that for the hospital bills?

541
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,365
Oh, my goodness.

542
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,409
Let go.

543
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,875
Are you okay?

544
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,543
You're all a bunch of thieves.

545
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,507
Assholes.

546
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,516
ORGAN TRANSPLANT CENTER COORDINATOR

547
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,366
WORKER ANT

548
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,096
Hey.

549
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,100
Hey.

550
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,646
What's wrong?

551
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,356
What?

552
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,775
What is this?

553
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,110
Just say what you want.

554
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,320
What if someone sees us?

555
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:16,867
I'm leaving.

556
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,954
Is it common for someone from
HIRA to come to the hospital?

557
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,414
How will it affect our reputation?

558
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,084
It depends on the result
of the investigation.

559
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,295
-Is it about the unnecessary surgeries?
-Yes.

560
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,258
Orthopedics overlaps with us the least,

561
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,926
so I don't know the details.

562
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,762
But there's a saying among doctors that

563
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,224
once a spinal specialty hospital opens up,

564
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,476
the elderly in that town
all become cyborgs.

565
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,602
What does that mean?

566
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:46,105
The doctors put metal pins
in their backs and knees.

567
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,066
And the patients accept it as a given.

568
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,236
How the deputy director has come
to be known as someone

569
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,905
who's performed the most surgeries
in the nation could be--

570
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,283
Still, an on-site investigation
isn't common.

571
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,829
Not long ago, a doctor who was
being investigated committed suicide.

572
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,289
Since then, the doctors association

573
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,374
and HIRA have been hypersensitive
towards each other.

574
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,504
You know, before I came here,
I didn't know that doctors

575
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,173
personally requested payment from HIRA

576
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,092
and were evaluated and stuff.

577
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,469
I thought the doctors had the most power.

578
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,765
That's ridiculous. Doctors even get
hit by patients.

579
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,809
Everyone's the same.

580
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:30,065
Remember how you brought up Dr. Ye Jin-woo
when talking about Dr. Lee No-eul?

581
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,819
The person from HIRA who came
is his brother.

582
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,654
What?

583
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,577
Why didn't he request an exemption?

584
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,579
What's that?

585
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,082
Most of them at HIRA are former nurses,

586
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,043
so they have many doctors
in their families.

587
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,629
So, if they're assigned to a hospital
where a family member is,

588
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,922
they have to notify the higher-up

589
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,924
and request an exemption.

590
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,927
Was Ye Jin-woo's brother a nurse too?

591
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,722
On-site investigations are done
by doctors. I heard he was

592
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,140
an orthopedic specialist.

593
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,350
His name

594
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,061
was similar to Ye Jin-woo.

595
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:10,773
It's more similar to yours. Sunwoo Chang.

596
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,316
That's right. Ye Seon-woo.

597
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,818
I've never seen him,

598
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,696
but he was pretty famous
at the med school.

599
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,947
With his physical condition,

600
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:23,077
it had to have been hard doing
his internship and residency.

601
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,955
Who pushed his wheelchair around?
His brother?

602
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,956
His mom.

603
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,627
She was always there to help him
with the wheelchair.

604
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,545
She apparently went through a lot.

605
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,965
Why did she do it by herself?
Was the dad busy working?

606
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,551
He passed away or something.
I don't know much myself.

607
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,472
But he's coming to his brother's hospital.

608
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,892
Is it a coincidence?

609
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,851
Why--

610
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,941
You go first.

611
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,612
Which asshole did that to you?

612
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,782
What do you care
if some asshole did this to me?

613
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:05,202
Now you're just being an ass.

614
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,039
Oh, and…

615
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,876
-What now?
-Who was that?

616
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:17,047
That female doctor who's close
to Ye Jin-woo.

617
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,091
Right, Dr. Lee No-eul.

618
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:21,343
Why did she come to your office?

619
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,678
It's obvious.

620
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,181
Are they dating?

621
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,601
I don't know. Some say they are. Why?

622
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:34,523
They should be working, not dating.

623
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,066
Not everyone is like you.

624
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,279
Hello?

625
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,240
Prepare a desk in Restructure's office.

626
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,827
Yes. I'm talking about
the Restructure Team's office.

627
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,971
Our chief is out right now, so we can't.

628
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:09,016
We need his permission
before we can give them to you.

629
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,312
The chief is the person
being investigated.

630
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,523
What do you mean, you need
his permission to give them to me?

631
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,985
Right? What could it mean?

632
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,196
You're Jin-woo's kid brother?

633
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,698
I'm his senior
so I won't be formal with you.

634
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:29,536
You suddenly barge in,
and demand to see this and that.

635
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,954
What do you want from us?

636
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,998
Are we your filing system, kid?

637
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,251
Excuse me.

638
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,340
Are you Dr. Ye Seon-woo?

639
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,134
-Yes.
-It's nice to meet you.

640
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,844
I'm Kang Gyeong-a.

641
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,679
Do you have a few minutes?

642
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,307
May I ask what this is about?

643
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:54,436
Our president, Mr. Gu Seung-hyo,
would like to meet you.

644
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,605
He does?

645
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,232
Yes. Is that okay?

646
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,942
Yes.

647
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,203
It's like he hasn't learned any manners.

648
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,039
-You know…
-Yes?

649
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,500
Good looks must run in the family.

650
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,043
Pardon?

651
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,087
This way.

652
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,707
What do you need from the Insurance Claims
Office? You left your laptop, right?

653
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,294
In that case… Just a minute.

654
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,927
I'm Ye Seon-woo from HIRA.

655
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:55,098
My apologies for not being able to show
respect like everyone else.

656
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,730
I need to be out soon,
so I'll get right to it.

657
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,274
What's the issue?

658
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,653
Deputy Director Kim Tae-sang

659
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,989
is someone we've been monitoring
for a while now

660
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,659
due to many medical bill complaints
filed against him.

661
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,495
Recently, his improper deeds
were pointed out again

662
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,331
on the medical center's website,

663
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,833
and thus, we have a duty to comply.

664
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,003
Which improper deeds?

665
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,590
Malpractice? Did he misdiagnose
patients thinking that he can

666
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,300
hide behind
his title as a Sangkook doctor?

667
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,596
Actually, Orthopedics has been under
scrutiny for the past ten years,

668
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,848
since it is most known for
doing unnecessary surgeries.

669
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,100
"Unnecessary."

670
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:41,395
He deceived patients that didn't need
the surgeries,

671
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,189
and turned them into cyborgs?

672
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,777
It's different from deception.

673
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,030
Do you know anyone personally,

674
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,740
who's had a spinal surgery?

675
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,702
It's common with the elderly.

676
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,789
It's best not to touch the spine,
even for the elderly, unless they have

677
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,166
extreme scoliosis or spinal stenosis.

678
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,585
Surgeries for artificial joints
are common,

679
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,629
but even they have expiration dates.

680
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,716
They may get deformed,
or get compartment syndrome.

681
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,634
Compartment syndrome is--

682
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,054
It's when the muscle swells
or there's internal bleeding.

683
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,229
What? Are you mocking me for acting
like I know something?

684
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,231
No.

685
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,652
As I said, the artificial joints'
life span is numbered.

686
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,904
Currently, it's between 10 to 15 years.

687
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,290
That's all.

688
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,170
Once they expire,
you need joint replacement surgery.

689
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,588
Then they can get one.

690
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,090
It's better than living with the pain
from a bad knee.

691
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,552
With current technology,
a second surgery is extremely difficult.

692
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,805
If you operate on someone
in their 50s now,

693
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,684
that person's artificial joint may expire
when that person is in their 60s,

694
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,978
and they may become incapable of walking.

695
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:08,440
Well, that shouldn't happen. They have to
be able to walk fine even at that age.

696
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,693
Shouldn't they be notified
prior to surgery?

697
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,528
Then who would agree to the surgery?

698
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,282
Unlike university hospitals, hospitals
specializing in surgeries would go under.

699
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,409
They're like surgery factories,

700
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,745
and the factories would come to a stop.

701
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:26,208
Are you saying that is how
he built his reputation until now?

702
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,336
-We still have to look into it.
-And if it's true?

703
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,130
To be honest,

704
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,426
the water will stay stagnant, and only
the one who casts the stone will change.

705
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,096
Things will soon be forgotten anyway.

706
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,642
But we must do it anyway.

707
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:53,276
Are the materials we received from
Orthopedics during the evaluation

708
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,487
-sorted according to attending surgeons?
-Yes.

709
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,118
We recently acquired everything from

710
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,038
examination records to surgery records,
so just let us know what you need.

711
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,706
Thank you.

712
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,543
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

713
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,710
In exchange,

714
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:13,463
please be fair.

715
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,175
Don't nitpick at other things
with an attitude of

716
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,845
finding other issues while you're here.

717
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,346
I won't.

718
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,937
But why did you come to
your brother's hospital?

719
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,943
Only specialists in the area are permitted
to conduct on-site investigations.

720
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,320
There was one other orthopedics
specialist at our office,

721
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,197
but he recently retired.

722
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,574
I'm the only one left.

723
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,703
Is that… Is that funny?
Why do you keep smiling?

724
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,917
Our doctor here has a resting happy face.

725
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,720
Mr. Gu.

726
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,974
Please call me
if you'd like to speak to me.

727
00:53:06,057 --> 00:53:07,183
I'll go to your office.

728
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,729
Suit yourself.

729
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,000
HEALTHCARE FUND SKYROCKETING

730
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,674
Ji-won, don't worry.

731
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,052
I'm taking you to a nice place.

732
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,470
You'll make lots of friends there,

733
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,181
so don't worry, okay?

734
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:51,186
Mommy?

735
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,480
Don't worry about a thing.

736
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,858
I'll introduce you to many good friends.

737
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,068
Let's go.

738
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,988
Are you looking for someone?

739
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,115
Whom would I look for?

740
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,619
What's his problem?
What's wrong with looking for someone?

741
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,314
They're all in there. Shit.

742
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,484
My goodness.

743
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,153
Come in.

744
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,328
You wanted to see…

745
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:52,998
It was you, right?

746
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,001
You reported me, right?

747
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,420
You reported me, and your brother
is digging into it.

748
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,463
You're loving it, aren't you?

749
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,465
I am not.

750
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,471
You didn't know until
your own brother crawled in here?

751
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,975
No, I didn't.

752
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,561
I've got to give credit
to you both for keeping

753
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,396
your personal and
professional lives separate.

754
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,941
I guess your single mom
taught you that well.

755
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,069
Answer me!

756
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,785
Listen carefully.

757
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:33,413
The police? Go ahead.

758
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,248
But if you do,

759
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,209
you'll have to expose
what the director was up to as well.

760
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,509
It is you.

761
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,511
It is not.

762
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,555
It is.

763
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,682
It is not.

764
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,933
It's you!

765
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,143
It is not.

766
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,145
If not you…

767
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,961
Hey. Did you look into it?

768
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,422
Why did you go on TV and create this mess?

769
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,841
What do you mean? It wasn't my first time.

770
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,511
You apparently bragged about
how many surgeries you did.

771
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:32,972
There was a complaint saying that it's
impossible that they were all needed.

772
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:34,557
I think someone saw you on TV

773
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,601
and got jealous, so they reported you.

774
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,354
You can find out who posted it, right?
You can track the IP address.

775
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,107
Why not? Just tell me.

776
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,192
I'll find the person myself.

777
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,113
How could you do this to me?

778
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,741
It's because I have a hunch.

779
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,413
One of our doctors' brother
is here from HIRA!

780
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,167
He had requested an exemption!

781
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,045
But like I told you,
Dr. Lee Jong-hyeok retired.

782
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,006
We had only two orthopedics specialists,

783
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,425
but now we're left with one.
Do you think he had a choice?

784
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,928
-Is that true?
-Of course, it is!

785
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,181
And stop asking me about who reported you.

786
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:17,767
You're the one
who's being investigated right now!

787
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,437
I've already done more than
I should for you. I'm hanging up!

788
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,984
Damn it.

789
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:13,907
Why you?

790
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,951
Why did you come?

791
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,704
Why didn't you tell me?

792
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:22,373
Because if I did,

793
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,626
you would've stopped what you were doing.

794

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR CANDIDATES

795
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,463
If I'd told you I'd be investigating,

796
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,256
there was a chance you'd change your plan.

797
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,008
CANDIDATES
CHIEF OF ORTHOPEDICS KIM TAE-SANG

798
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,261
Hey.

799
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,430
Find all cases of patients
in the US and Japan,

800
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,807
who had replacement arthroplasty
in their 40s.

801
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:40,892
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

802
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:43,645
Also, find patients to interview.

803
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,898
People whom I operated on recently
that were successful.

804
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,191
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

805
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,616
Did you know then?

806
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:03,039
That you'd be sent?

807
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,889
What did you report?

808
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:22,892
That the deputy director

809
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,813
-performed unnecessary joint replacements.
-You submitted a civil complaint?

810
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,400
It won't put you in a tough spot.

811
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:33,903
They know you're my brother,
so they won't send you.

812
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,573
Just play dumb.

813
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,949
What about you?

814
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,952
What if it puts you in a tough spot?

815
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,623
Then, that's too bad.

816
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,500
Why was that necessary?

817
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:53,214
He claims to have done 5,600 surgeries,
but that's not a realistic number.

818
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,094
The deputy director…

819
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,556
You said he's not fit to be a director.

820
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:06,144
It's not just for you.

821
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,146
If that's what you thought,

822
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,857
I'm sure Uncle Bo-hun
would've thought the same.

823
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,067
He would be sad

824
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,570
if just anyone succeeded him.

825
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,707
He performed 5,600 surgeries in a year.

826
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,669
A surgery that is only performed
as a last resort

827
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,421
on patients with end-stage arthritis.

828
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,174
But 5,600 people?

829
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:35,358
That must be a habit.

830
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,610
Doing this when you're focused.

831
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:40,238
I don't do that.

832
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,572
Yes, you do.

833
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:43,574
Hasn't it been decided already?

834
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,910
The question is, who will it be?

835
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,286
Deputy Director Kim.

836
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,622
We were the ones
who had to bear the burden!

837
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,084
While one punk
pretended to be some noble guy

838
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,545
with determination
and the rest acted like philanthropists,

839
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,339
we had to work our asses off
to pick up the slack!

840
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,134
If the deputy director
loses his candidacy,

841
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,137
who will jump into the race for director?

842
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,638
He pulled them out of the game.

843
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,640
The fourth and fifth batters specifically.

844
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,767
The chief of the Cancer Center
and the deputy director

845
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,519
were the lead candidates.

846
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:14,188
Why must it be one of those two?

847
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:17,608
You're the first female chief
of the Neurosurgery Center.

848
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,153
Why must that be the highest position
you hold?

849
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:29,579
