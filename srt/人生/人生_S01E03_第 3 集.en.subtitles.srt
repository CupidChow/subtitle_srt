1
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,347
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,266
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,729
EPISODE 3

4
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,628
You figured out the password.

5
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,097
Director Lee typed slowly.

6
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,937
I often posted things for him.

7
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,941
I understand how you feel,

8
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,443
but did you think about the method?

9
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,155
Was there no better way
than to use a deceased person

10
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,825
to cause a stir
while hiding yourself completely?

11
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:02,956
Dr. Ye.

12
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,084
You've given us a weapon.

13
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,379
Proof that we have reason to fight.

14
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,799
However,

15
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,260
it should not involve any trickery.

16
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,348
Trickery will end up

17
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,059
giving the enemy a means to attack.

18
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,065
We've already seen countless people
get criticized and taken down

19
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,859
for even trivial things.

20
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,235
A proper…

21
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,015
Go eat.

22
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,228
Weren't you on your way?

23
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,689
Eat when you can.

24
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,400
I have no appetite.

25
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,207
It's evidence that they've been
treating us like money-grubbers.

26
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,755
And to think of that crap he went on about
women dying from childbirth…

27
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,924
I get that he's all about business,
but still.

28
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,509
That jerk has no sense of ethics.
How dare he…

29
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,016
Hello.

30
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,311
How are things in your department?
What do you plan to do?

31
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,022
-What could we do?
-Are you not going to take any action?

32
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,275
Then the efforts of the person
who took on the risk will be wasted.

33
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,402
Even if we gather like last time,

34
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,447
Mr. Gu will come and rattle off
whatever he feels like saying anyway.

35
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,658
Why should we create
that platform for him?

36
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,618
He doesn't have to be there.

37
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,786
There's a meeting later

38
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,288
at 4 p.m. for the entire medical staff.

39
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,751
You want us to do it then?

40
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,420
-Secretly, just us?
-It wouldn't be in secret.

41
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,215
The medical staff meetings
have always been for just us doctors.

42
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,677
I'll tell the others in the ward.
I'll see you then.

43
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,723
Dr. Joo is such a good guy.

44
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,646
As if you never excluded him before.

45
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,451
Dr. Ye.

46
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,120
What?

47
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,372
The police are asking
if they can take him.

48
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,086
What happened?
Was the child stabbed in front of the dad?

49
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,921
He attempted suicide.

50
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,423
It was a murder-suicide.

51
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,467
He did that to his own daughter?

52
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,013
Even if he meant to commit suicide,
it's still seen as murder.

53
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,141
-What should we do?
-What's the problem?

54
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,601
The wound's been treated,
but his diagnosis from psychiatry…

55
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,021
I thought maybe
you should examine him yourself.

56
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,689
Discharge him.

57
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,608
Yes, sir.

58
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,488
He says you may take him.

59
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,489
Okay.

60
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,830
Hi, Dr. Yang. Are you free this afternoon?

61
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,082
Can you take my surgery at 3 p.m.?

62
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,126
It's simple. Varicose veins.

63
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,922
Of course. I wasn't requested to take it.
It came through the ER,

64
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,132
so you can do it instead.

65
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,010
Okay, thanks.

66
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,519
The baby is barely one,
but has a third-degree burn.

67
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,774
Plus, any later, it would've been
difficult to get a skin graft.

68
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,529
What are we supposed to do if Pediatrics
and Emergency Medicine leave?

69
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,364
Do we leave such patients to just die?

70
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,079
Well, I'm in no position
to worry about others right now.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,414
But, from the looks of it,

72
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,043
they'll probably make us only do
surgeries that are profitable.

73
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,087
Just watch.

74
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,882
In no time, patients will start coming
here for nose jobs and eyelid surgeries.

75
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,135
Anyway, see you at 4 p.m.

76
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,031
They'll leave just enough ER staff
to transfer patients out?

77
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,908
Then there won't be any coming from other…

78
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,829
If you're done, go.
Why are you just standing there?

79
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,006
ORGAN PROCUREMENT AND TRANSPORT RECORDS

80
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,430
When Dr. Lee Sang-yeop heard
that we are leaving just enough ER staff

81
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,765
to transfer incoming patients
to other hospitals,

82
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,852
he said, "Then there won't be
any coming from other…"

83
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,562
Well, that's pretty much all.

84
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,815
He caught himself before he said too much.

85
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,859
What do you mean?

86
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,611
He's happy they won't have to take
urgent cancer patients.

87
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,407
The Cancer Center doesn't like
patients who switch hospitals

88
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,742
after being treated elsewhere.

89
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,412
Because switching hospitals means

90
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,248
that it was a difficult case
to begin with.

91
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,792
If something goes wrong
with the patient who transferred here,

92
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,002
they'd have to take the fall.

93
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,881
But then, it's not like
they can turn patients away

94
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,509
and tell them to go back
to the hospital they first got treated.

95
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,637
I see.

96
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,140
If the ER is gone,
so are cases like those.

97
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,101
It's a burden off their shoulders
for them.

98
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,897
Still, everyone says they'll be attending
the meeting at 4 p.m.

99
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,231
You didn't tell anyone

100
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,651
that I had you ask around, did you?

101
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,236
Of course not.

102
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,532
Everyone's too busy
thinking about themselves.

103
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,329
And what do you think, Chief?

104
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,875
What do you think? I'm really worried.
We can't afford to lose them.

105
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,338
If they really are being kicked out
for not making money, we're next.

106
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,924
We've never been in the black either.

107
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,009
Even if we survive this cut,

108
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,221
how will we sustain ourselves
without the ER?

109
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,725
Without the ER,
we'll have much fewer brain deaths.

110
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,562
The ER is a necessity
for the Organ Transplant Center.

111
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,568
-Right.
-Don't worry too much.

112
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,279
The worst couldn't really happen,
could it?

113
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:08,089
At least the chief of OB-GYN is trying her
best. The rest seem to be just watching.

114
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,799
Was she the one who called the meeting?

115
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,885
It wouldn't have been arranged
unless someone had initiated it, would it?

116
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,595
Chief. Did you want to see me?

117
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,223
Yes. Ms. Kim went home, right?
You come then.

118
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,182
Where to?

119
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,394
Listen carefully and explain
to the other nurses later.

120
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,355
-About what?
-You'll see.

121
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,198
GLUTTON: MEDICAL STAFF MEETING AT 4 P.M.

122
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,534
LIKELY TO DISCUSS THE POST
REGARDING THE THREE DEPARTMENTS

123
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,678
Where is he when he's the one
who first brought it up?

124
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,431
-Who?
-Dr. Joo.

125
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,932
He's so inconsistent.

126
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,497
Is everyone here?

127
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
Okay, let's begin.

128
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,714
I was extremely offended

129
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,344
when I saw this post this morning.

130
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,597
I was so angry, I almost cried.

131
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,351
EMERGENCY MEDICINE, PEDIATRICS, OB-GYN

132
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:45,311
DEPTS SUBJECT TO RELOCATION
= DEPTS IN THE RED

133
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,192
Okay.

134
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,235
Chief.

135
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,907
Lee Jang-uk went into shock.
Dr. Yang can't handle him alone.

136
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,826
-What are you talking about?
-His BP dropped, so he's giving CPR.

137
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,372
-Anything else?
-Possible bronchial spasms.

138
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,873
-Bronchial spasms?
-Yes.

139
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,543
When I was in the US, my roommate
lost two fingers in an accident.

140
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,296
But he got only
his index finger reattached.

141
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,382
I asked why, and this was his answer.

142
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,220
This cost 15,000 dollars, but it would be
60,000 dollars to attach this finger too.

143
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,346
Isn't that ridiculous?

144
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,182
Do you mind putting that down?

145
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,727
Where's Eun-ha?

146
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,854
She clocked out.

147
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,611
Eun-ha? It should be "Ms. Kim" to you.

148
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,572
It's a country where if you get cancer,

149
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,324
you feel like a sinner, not a patient.

150
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,660
But that's our owner's plan.

151
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,956
For those of you

152
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,042
who think this doesn't apply to you,

153
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,670
once they begin to rate departments
based on financial statements,

154
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,923
it's only a matter of time
before they get to you.

155
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,759
That's not the point right now.

156
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,345
It's not just about who is affected
and who is not.

157
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,435
We are doctors who save people's lives.

158
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:12,356
You cannot put a price tag
on what I do with these hands.

159
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,775
That pride kept me going.

160
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,360
That's true,

161
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,238
and now that this is out,
if we don't do anything about it,

162
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,282
the president will look down on us.

163
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,951
We'll all look like a bunch of fools.

164
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,244
Let's go on strike.

165
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,666
We can't go on strike.
Did you forget what happened before?

166
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,210
Going on strike is our only option.

167
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,880
How else can we fight?

168
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,465
Do you have any ideas?

169
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,967
You young doctors don't know what happens

170
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,262
if we band together
and take action, do you?

171
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:47,433
When dispensing separation took effect,
the entire country treated us like crooks.

172
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,019
They said we were striking
and selfishly fretting over drug money

173
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,604
when we were making enough money already.

174
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,897
GLUTTON

175
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,775
They cursed us out, saying the rich
are greedier. Don't you remember?

176
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:01,322
There are laws in place. So, he won't be
able to get rid of essential departments--

177
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,033
Was Gimhae Medical Center shut down
because there were no laws?

178
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,786
There's less than 10% remaining
of the public medical centers.

179
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,247
But even they are being shut down
for being in the red, too.

180
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,291
How can the law protect us?

181
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,463
Why do you think conglomerates
are buying up schools?

182
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,839
For the money, right?

183
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,759
Where can they get that? From the tuition?

184
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,721
Hospitals are the only source of income
for universities.

185
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,183
We were the target from the get-go.

186
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,810
There's no reason or time
to hesitate striking.

187
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,604
We have no other choice.

188
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,440
-I agree. Let's do it.
-Let's go on strike.

189
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,736
Let's go on strike. Let's do it.

190
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,041
Who just spoke?

191
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,751
GLUTTON

192
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,716
Did someone say something?

193
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,054
The new president has a cause,

194
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,894
which is to support rural hospitals.

195
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,654
We know that's just an excuse now.

196
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,115
Didn't you see this post?

197
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,202
The loss isn't just limited
to those three departments.

198
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,667
Emergency Medicine, Pediatrics, and OB-GYN
lose even more money in rural areas.

199
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,129
Which is why healthcare centers
specializing in them are so few there.

200
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,427
WORKER ANT

201
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,221
That's what Mr. Gu will stress.

202
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,102
Then we'll just look like a self-centered
group resisting because we don't want

203
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,645
to go to the rural areas.

204
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,064
Not only will we lack justification,

205
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,525
but we'd also be taking patients hostage.

206
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,279
Don't you think that's exactly what
Mr. Gu wants?

207
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,822
Who is this jerk?

208
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,699
We'd be digging our own graves.

209
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,579
I'm Ye Jin-woo, from Emergency Medicine.

210
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,207
RECORD

211
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,271
NOTE

212
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,913
Ye Jin-woo.

213
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,422
Tell the director's assistant to stay put.

214
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,386
So what do you propose?
Don't just oppose without an alternative.

215
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,390
I thought we were gathered
to discuss what we should do.

216
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:16,850
That's right.

217
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,403
Given the evidence that we see here,

218
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,531
we need to take action.

219
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,199
Let's take a vote.

220
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,494
Including Admissions
and the Specialty Clinic,

221
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,581
each of the 37 medical departments
will take a vote.

222
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,375
If 80 percent, that is,

223
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,712
at least 30 departments vote yes,
we will go on strike.

224
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,048
ICU and ER cannot go on strike
no matter what the result.

225
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,175
Any objections?

226
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,927
-No, sir.
-No.

227
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,179
Let's set the deadline for the vote.

228
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,891
-How about by this weekend?
-That's fine.

229
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,145
-We should do the vote soon.
-We have no other options.

230
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,731
There's no point in delaying.

231
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,486
-Let's do it quickly.
-Let's vote.

232
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,092
You know there's a better way.

233
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,513
Don't hide behind the dead man.

234
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,893
You should've just printed 1,000 copies
and thrown them from the roof

235
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,187
so that anyone coming or going can see it.

236
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,773
Why couldn't you do that?

237
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,114
What do you mean?

238
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,454
You wanted to save your ass.

239
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,707
You wondered what you could do

240
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,795
to protect your ass,
and also remain in Seoul.

241
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,422
You tried to be smart.

242
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,007
However…

243
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,801
What a shame.

244
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,886
You got caught right away.

245
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,430
Very humiliating, isn't it?

246
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,023
If you're going to talk to yourself,
I'll get going.

247
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,486
Lee Bo-hun taught you
a lot of good things.

248
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,206
I see what the misunderstanding is.

249
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,625
Misunderstanding?

250
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,336
You just started at your new job,
but problems keep arising.

251
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,171
I bet you want to show
what you're capable of.

252
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,550
It's your anxiety
that led to the misunderstanding,

253
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,386
so you don't need to feel humiliated.

254
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,433
And yes, Director Lee taught me
many good things.

255
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,479
If you were more like him,
maybe things would have looked

256
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,772
much better than right now.

257
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,072
Congratulations.

258
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,659
You've achieved your goal.

259
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,661
You won't be sent…

260
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,581
to Naksan.

261
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,001
How do you think he found out?

262
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,503
Don't hide behind the dead man.

263
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,423
However, there can't be any trickery.

264
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,596
What do you think he meant by

265
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,973
you not going to Naksan?

266
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,856
Yes, that's correct.

267
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,233
Just a minute.

268
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,901
Sir, it's Hwajeong Life Insurance.

269
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,654
They're adamantly refusing to pay
1.5 million won per data set.

270
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,947
-Mr. Nam?
-Yes.

271
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,703
Gu Seung-hyo speaking.

272
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,498
I thought you absolutely refused.

273
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,585
I'm saving you from giving payouts
by offering you patient information,

274
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,004
but if you don't want it,
we can forget about it.

275
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,674
You didn't need to bother calling.

276
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,135
"Not give payouts"? What do you mean
by that? We're not thieves.

277
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,097
The clients made the payments for us
to give it to them when they need it.

278
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,224
So when they need it,
we should give it to them.

279
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,226
That's what leads to client satisfaction.

280
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,769
I see.

281
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,063
That's odd.

282
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:17,150
If you're always willing
to pay the clients,

283
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,819
how can you consider

284
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,613
client payments
as Hwajeong Life Insurance's assets?

285
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,326
No, no. Think about it.

286
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,329
It's money you're going
to give back to the clients anyway.

287
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,831
It was never your money.

288
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:32,916
It's a zero.

289
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,627
Hwajeong Life Insurance has zero assets.

290
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,963
Mr. Gu. Stop this, will you?

291
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,507
Let's bury the past already.

292
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,009
Stop being so unprofessional.

293
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,053
Even kids know insurance companies
pull tricks

294
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,639
to avoid paying out their policies.

295
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,684
Seeing how you're talking to me
about client satisfaction,

296
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,602
you must really not want them.

297
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,731
I understand. We're not interested in
selling them to you either.

298
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,107
Good day.

299
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,402
How dare he say it's in the past?

300
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,281
I still remember and can't forget it.

301
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,993
If I had disrespected
and looked down on them like that,

302
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,661
they would have tried to kill me.

303
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,957
They're the ones who need it.
We have nothing to lose.

304
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,292
Don't take his calls.

305
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,921
Also, process the termination
of Emergency Medical Center's Ye Jin-woo.

306
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:22,382
What? The Greek god doctor?

307
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,970
-Who's a Greek god?
-He's a modern-day god.

308
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,723
-When did you see him?
-I went down to the ER.

309
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,436
Process it immediately.

310
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,110
The Restructure Team
says they'll be here tonight.

311
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,695
Okay.

312
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,618
It's the deputy director.

313
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,846
Yes?

314
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,017
Well, there was a medical staff meeting.

315
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,645
I see. And?

316
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,063
Unfortunately,

317
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,900
the doctors have decided to vote
on whether or not to go on strike.

318
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,362
That's everyone's weapon.

319
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:27,405
Factory workers go on strike all the time.

320
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,034
A decision voted on by doctors
is different

321
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,995
from factory labor workers
going on strike.

322
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,003
Anyway, don't worry too much.

323
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,798
I'll guide them
toward a favorable decision.

324
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,636
Sure. Okay. Keep it up.

325
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:51,972
Yes, sir.

326
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,416
GLUTTON

327
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:23,211
I thought we were gathered
to discuss what we should do.

328
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,840
Given the evidence that we see here,

329
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,967
we need to take action.

330
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,343
Let's take a vote.

331
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,637
Including Admissions
and the Specialty Clinic,

332
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,433
each of the 37 medical departments
will take a vote.

333
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,144
If 80 percent, that is…

334
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,898
He went into shock from the anesthesia,
and went into cardiac arrest.

335
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,317
You said…

336
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,197
You said it was a simple surgery.

337
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:38,703
You said…

338
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,793
No…

339
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,169
No…

340
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,268
Chief?

341
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,353
Yes?

342
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,533
It would've been the same
even if you had operated.

343
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,703
No one could've predicted it.

344
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,749
Right.

345
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,794
Luck wasn't on our side.

346
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,843
Right.

347
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,430
-You may go.
-Okay.

348
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,642
What?

349
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,357
How did you know…

350
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,778
that it was me who posted it?

351
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,989
How did you know?

352
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,494
Did you know…

353
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,872
that Director Lee was hurt?

354
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,627
That you acted…

355
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,047
like you didn't know him at the hospital.

356
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,549
That you intentionally…

357
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,552
kept your distance in front of people.

358
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,224
He was hurt?

359
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,368
He was.

360
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,379
How did you know?

361
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,798
Why did you distance yourself from him?

362
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,886
He wouldn't give preferential treatment
just because he knew someone personally.

363
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,098
He wouldn't have.

364
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,350
You should've been nicer to him.

365
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,310
Is that why you told Mr. Gu?

366
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,480
"You may not be able to tell,

367
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,234
but Ye Jin-woo
and Director Lee were close.

368
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,319
Enough to share passwords."

369
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,989
Are you afraid that I'll tell Mr. Gu?

370
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,033
Did you come here to silence me?

371
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,706
Please leave.

372
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,708
You said our weapon

373
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,627
should not involve any trickery.

374
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,048
However, I've seen
more people get stomped on

375
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,925
while trying to play fair.

376
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,010
Get out.

377
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,434
I'm hearing that a lot today.

378
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,772
I'll get out for good.

379
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,744
"Get out for good"?

380
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,477
Drink slowly.

381
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,396
There's plenty of alcohol around.
Don't worry.

382
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,025
I can't stand to see my shot glass full.

383
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,319
-Here.
-Good for you.

384
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,112
Here.

385
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,198
Goodness, my arm.

386
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,408
If I dislocate my shoulder
while pouring drinks for you,

387
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,619
it will also count as a workplace injury.

388
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:38,878
-Is it the hospital?
-No. Spam call.

389
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,508
How did it go?

390
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,679
We still have to wait for the results.

391
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,351
How do you know Dr. Ye's entire family?

392
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,854
I heard you know his mother too.

393
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,399
Everyone knew Jin-woo's mother.

394
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,400
Why?

395
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,152
-Is she pretty?
-Why you…

396
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:07,657
Hey. How do you think
Seon-woo went to school?

397
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,702
Literally, rain or shine, his mom

398
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,122
pushed his wheelchair, and carried it
up and down everywhere he went.

399
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,124
All the way through his time
as a resident.

400
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,710
Everyone in our school knew her.

401
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,420
That's incredible.

402
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,714
Sending both her sons to medical school.

403
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,340
Even the disabled second son.

404
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,802
She was incredible,
especially for a woman to do that alone.

405
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:30,346
Dr. Ye doesn't have a father?

406
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,599
What happened?

407
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,018
Car accident. It happened a long time ago.

408
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,228
I see.

409
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,522
So that's why…

410
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,151
What? Why?

411
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,529
Single parents aren't a big deal anymore,

412
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,615
but he's a bit…

413
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,450
rude, in a way.

414
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,704
He isn't too polite to his elders.

415
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:57,665
Maybe you didn't act like one
in front of him.

416
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,083
What the…

417
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,920
Why are you defending a cold punk
who ignores you at the hospital?

418
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,130
I'm not saying it's his fault.

419
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,926
I meant it may be because he didn't
have much interaction with his father.

420
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,346
-Why you little…
-Are you trying to hit me?

421
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,097
Why are you so worked up?

422
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,600
Is he your secret son?

423
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,687
Don't you dare say that
in front of Jin-woo.

424
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,649
He hates hearing that more than anything.

425
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,652
Who cares if he hates it?
It's just a joke.

426
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,236
Wait.

427
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,948
Something's up.

428
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:33,076
There must be a reason why
he hates being called your son.

429
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,411
Stop drinking soda.

430
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,497
It's not even good for you.

431
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,457
That's why you're talking nonsense.

432
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,216
See? I knew there was something.

433
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,093
I said no.

434
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,722
Dr. Ye's mother

435
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,892
was very pretty, wasn't she?

436
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,023
She was pretty.

437
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,948
She became a widow when Jin-woo was ten.

438
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,034
-So many men…
-Right…

439
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,912
I'm sure many men hovered around her,

440
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,748
even if she didn't want it.

441
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,919
That's right.
Jin-woo extremely hated that.

442
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,671
He hated men
showing interest in his mother.

443
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,674
It must've been hard for Dr. Ye.
Having to take care of

444
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,925
his brother as well.

445
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,387
So, be good to him.

446
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,557
That was random.

447
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,809
Be good to him.

448
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,354
Is that why you told Mr. Gu?

449
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,983
"…but Ye Jin-woo
and Director Lee were close."

450
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,070
I'm hearing that a lot today.

451
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,780
I'll get out for good.

452
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,531
Mr. Gu…

453
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,076
He found out.

454
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:49,170
These are the lab results
for the abdominal pain patient.

455
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,506
He says the pain is gone,
so check him an hour later

456
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,466
-and decide if he'll need treatment.
-Okay.

457
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,051
So-jeong.

458
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:57,220
Yes?

459
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,640
In the ER, having good
organizational skills is half the battle.

460
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,850
I'm pretty good at it now.

461
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,354
If a patient with connections gets pushy,
pretend to give in and treat them first.

462
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:09,524
Shouldn't you tell me not to do that?
Even if you don't mean it?

463
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,401
When you send up that patient,
tack on patients

464
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:15,029
that have been waiting long
or were refused admittance.

465
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,406
They'd freak out then.

466
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,991
They'll complain later,

467
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,661
but they don't know at the time
how many patients are actually VIPs.

468
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,871
If they want to use their connections
even in the ER,

469
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,456
we should get some use out of them.

470
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,458
Sure. Okay.

471
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,753
But Dr. Ye. Are you planning
to go to Naksan?

472
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:32,547
Are we splitting up?

473
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,301
It feels like you're handing down
your know-hows before you go.

474
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,349
You'll become a good doctor.

475
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,855
What's the point
when they're dying to kick us out?

476
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,066
Are you upset?

477
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,735
I'm worried that the guys
will be really upset.

478
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,071
I'm worried that we'll ruin their future.

479
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,615
Stuff you learn now
sticks with you for life.

480
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,369
Well… I'm not saying
we won't study in between.

481
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:05,037
I know what you mean.

482
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,958
If they crush the spirits of
the young doctors who are still learning

483
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,710
and teach them to care only about money,

484
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,463
what kind of doctors will they become?

485
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,548
That's what scares me.

486
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,176
They've barely gained experience
and we're ruining things for them.

487
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,721
ER doctors can't open their own practice,
so they weren't here for the money.

488
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,598
Exactly.

489
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,100
Above all else,

490
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,311
this is our school.

491
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,690
We lived here for ten years,
from undergrad till now.

492
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,359
It's like home to us.

493
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,783
So-jeong, you're all grown up.

494
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,578
You were a little kid when you first came.

495
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,787
I was not.

496
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,961
-What's this?
-The varicose vein patient from yesterday.

497
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,546
He went into shock.

498
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,256
And he died?

499
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,177
Yes. Around four o'clock?
It happened during surgery.

500
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,804
It was shortly after he was anesthetized.

501
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,933
It wasn't Chief Joo.

502
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,309
He was there, too.

503
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,145
They called him in for help,
but it was too late.

504
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,240
Dr. Ye.

505
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,324
Yes, Chief.

506
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,160
You set the schedule.

507
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,079
We should, you know…

508
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,498
also vote on the strike.

509
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,626
-Are we really striking?
-Keep it down.

510
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,462
It looks that way.

511
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,382
They act fine,
but I'm sure they're nervous.

512
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,883
And they can't stand the president.

513
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:44,178
Anyway, even if we have to keep working,
we'll still vote.

514
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,263
So you take care of it.

515
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,682
-Chief.
-Yes?

516
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,016
You heard him, right?

517
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,102
I'll see you tomorrow.

518
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,690
Hey. You were against it, right?
Are you pissed off?

519
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,983
Are you bailing?

520
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,734
I'm bailing and going home.

521
00:37:58,818 --> 00:37:59,986
Why that…

522
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,617
Don't pass the buck. Do it yourself.

523
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,576
Okay.

524
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,255
Jae-hyeok. I have a mission for you.

525
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,187
"Is the center of life
the brain or the heart?"

526
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,482
You said that was a 2,000-year-old debate.

527
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,153
I wanted to answer, "Blood."

528
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,533
It connects the brain to the heart

529
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,660
and circulates to every corner
of the body.

530
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,620
It is the flower of life.

531
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,583
I saw blood pouring out.

532
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,295
How can my alma mater
cut off its arms and legs

533
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,630
in order to salvage its brain and heart?

534
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:05,885
I couldn't let the blood

535
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,263
spilling out from the wounds
stain our home.

536
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,435
I felt I had to protect it.

537
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,395
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER, YE JIN-WOO

538
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:25,905
Director Lee.

539
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,034
Did I do the right thing?

540
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,301
I'm not here to discuss
whether it was right or wrong.

541
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,475
I'm just here to tell you

542
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:58,229
that I posted the financial statement.

543
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,858
Why reveal yourself now

544
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,986
after secretly stabbing me in the back?

545
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,323
I won't complain even if you fire me.

546
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,870
You keep beating me to the punch.

547
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,962
Post another entry.

548
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,881
Say you did it. Say that you posted it.

549
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,603
Same as the first time.

550
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,815
Using the deceased's ID, not yours.

551
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,325
That's not hard, is it?

552
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,911
You're ready to leave, anyway.

553
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,374
You forgot the password already?

554
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,305
Whether or not you believe me,
I've said what I came to say.

555
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,391
You must have offers from hospitals
lining up for you.

556
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,185
Are you returning to Gimhae or something?

557
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,228
"Or something"?

558
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,397
What do you mean?

559
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,609
What do you mean, "Gimhae or something"?

560
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,529
It would be nice to return to my hometown.

561
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:35,409
If returning there can erase the power
struggles and the smell of blood,

562
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,162
that would be great.

563
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,539
Stop copying old movies.

564
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,668
"I'm the rebel. No. I did it.
Strike me instead."

565
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,006
Everyone is insisting he's the rebel to
the soldiers who are there to arrest them.

566
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,427
I can't stand cringy, forced emotions.

567
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,890
But seeing it in real life…

568
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,061
is even worse.

569
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,691
What do you mean?

570
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,785
The Restructure Team's director is here.

571
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,165
If there are two rebels,

572
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,043
I should get rid of them both.
Don't you think?

573
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,131
Go right ahead.

574
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,605
We just arrived.

575
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,320
Should I come back later?

576
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,991
The dismissal of Ye Jin-woo…

577
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,909
-Tomorrow--
-Stop it.

578
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,796
We'll finish setting up the office tonight
and begin work tomorrow.

579
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,258
Is the chairman doing better?

580
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,596
Pardon? Was the chairman not well?

581
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,098
Which of our subsidiaries was it

582
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,601
that had problems
with the Ministry of Environment?

583
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,021
He was stressed out because of that.

584
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:31,108
You mean Hwajeong Steel
regarding the environmental fees.

585
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,776
Yes, that's right.

586
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,197
It looked like it'll be extremely
expensive if they do things by the law.

587
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:41,076
Yes. Their emission allowance
was cut to 60 percent.

588
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,247
The fines will be worth
tens of billions of won.

589
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,334
Probably, if they have to pay it all.

590
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,755
Okay.

591
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,257
You should go get ready.

592
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,224
Mr. Gu.

593
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,603
It would be nice if we moved my desk
into the Restructure Team's office.

594
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,689
No, that's a bad idea.
I'm going to Seosan.

595
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,191
But it's…

596
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,652
See you here tomorrow.

597
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,993
But it's so uncomfortable here!

598
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,497
He's always watching.

599
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,625
At least get me a partition or something.

600
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,835
I can't stand it.

601
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,848
Looks like they're getting new equipment.

602
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,192
Did you get them?

603
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,696
Wow. It's the new flavor.

604
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,782
It was hard to get.

605
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:06,203
The one who accepts my missions
shall never go hungry.

606
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,420
-Remove everything in here.
-Okay.

607
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:27,724
Who are you and why…

608
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,768
We're from the Restructure Team
from headquarters.

609
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,313
Excuse us.

610
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,983
Restructure Team?

611
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,820
Aren't they the ones who lay off people

612
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,489
and force them into retirement and stuff?

613
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,407
Yes.

614
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,162
Shit. It had to be
the medical supply room of all places.

615
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,663
That's our snack storage.

616
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,249
You knew?

617
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:57,129
Just who is that president trying to fire
that he has to bring those people in?

618
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,714
Does he take us for fools?

619
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:02,843
He's fanning the flames
to set the strike in motion.

620
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,690
There's so much traffic.

621
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,859
We should've bought it near there.

622
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,489
I didn't see you at the meeting.

623
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,118
Did you miss me, little boy?

624
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,662
I said not to do that.

625
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,166
It was obvious what everyone would say.

626
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,419
You of all people know
that I had to be the one

627
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,173
who posted that in Director Lee's name.

628
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,259
You know about my family's
relationship with him.

629
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,220
Why aren't you saying anything?

630
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:53,519
Even children don't open up
the more you force them to talk.

631
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,024
Look here. Ms. Runt.

632
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,070
Who gave you the financial statement?

633
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,738
Ms. Kim.

634
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,739
How?

635
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,993
I knew she printed it two months ago
during salary negotiations.

636
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,788
IT Department sides
with the unions anyway.

637
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,085
The method was wrong, but…

638
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:22,589
It was?
Me posting the financial statement?

639
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,552
No. Not that.

640
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,768
It's clearing up.

641
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,535
Seon-woo.

642
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,371
Sorry. You must be starving by now.

643
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,914
I don't mind waiting.

644
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,797
You set the table so nicely.

645
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,717
I've raised you well.

646
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,731
I'll go wash my hands.

647
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,495
Did you find out?

648
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:41,460
Your hospital asked
to sweep it under the rug.

649
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,378
That doesn't make any sense.

650
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:44,838
The incentive…

651
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,632
went missing.

652
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,886
-How can they just bury 360 million won?
-It's because they got the money back.

653
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,971
Your hospital withdrew it.

654
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,434
How? You said Director Lee
had already moved it from his account.

655
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,897
Neither party
wanted to draw attention to it,

656
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,607
so the higher-ups decided to bury it.

657
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,109
For your side, sure, but for the hospital…

658
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,535
See? The chicken got cold.
I told you we should've got Jjimdak.

659
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,536
-No way.
-No way.

660
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,496
Jinx.

661
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,795
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

662
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,175
Thank you.

663
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,015
What did you do today?

664
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,935
Today?

665
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,729
I cleaned, did the laundry…

666
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,065
You're so diligent.

667
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,318
-You eat.
-Okay.

668
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,321
Thank you.

669
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,573
-What?
-Getting beer.

670
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,493
-What about these?
-You wouldn't let me get more.

671
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,246
It's not like you can even drink much.

672
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,582
How's your mother?

673
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,127
She went to Europe with her husband.

674
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,795
On vacation?

675
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,839
They must really be happy together.

676
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,737
Your test is in a few days.
You're not going anywhere.

677
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,739
Go to your room and study.

678
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,910
Sorry, Jin-woo.

679
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,705
Let's hurry, Dad.

680
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,196
I said I'm fine.

681
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,407
You can't let them get cold.

682
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,368
-You may think it's okay, but--
-It's okay.

683
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,037
I mean it.

684
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,048
Where's the beer?

685
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,300
I forgot my wallet.

686
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,303
You knew that just now?

687
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,388
How far did you go?

688
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,266
Wait until you're my age.

689
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,770
It's all cold.

690
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,898
My body's aching everywhere.

691
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:57,233
I think I'll have to retire soon.

692
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,946
You're young. How about you support
this old brother of yours?

693
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,656
Who are you?

694
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,368
Maybe I should really quit.
You make good money. I can rely on you.

695
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,912
What is it? Is it too tiring?

696
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,039
Is something going on at the hospital?

697
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,500
There's never a quiet day, is there?

698
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,711
If you really are that tired,
take a few days off.

699
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,838
Besides, we haven't gone
on a real vacation this year.

700
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,883
It got warm.

701
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,512
You could go to the beach.
You like beaches.

702
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,057
I don't like beaches.

703
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,017
Where did you get that?

704
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,228
Forget it then.

705
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,440
Then will you go with me,
Mr. Civil Servant?

706
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,693
This civil servant can't go
because he has to go to work.

707
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,736
I know you have unused annual leaves.

708
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,742
What? You're leaving?

709
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,328
-I have to go in early tomorrow.
-But you…

710
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,497
See her out.

711
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,916
No, it's okay. Stay.

712
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,459
Bye.

713
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,836
Seriously, don't come out.

714
00:54:58,837 --> 00:54:59,796
See you tomorrow.

715
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,717
Bye, No-eul.

716
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,843
Bye.

717
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,793
Should we open a small medical center
in a small beach town?

718
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,379
You, Seon-woo, and I.

719
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,506
No. I hate the smell of seawater.

720
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:45,675
You said you wanted to go.

721
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,178
He's the one that wants to go.

722
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,806
He'll say no if I ask,
saying he'll be a nuisance.

723
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,100
A nuisance? Why?

724
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,480
People in our country stare blatantly.

725
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,900
"Why did he come out in that condition?"

726
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,735
That's the look they give you.

727
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,322
If I can feel it, how could he not?

728
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,033
They do that to kids, too.

729
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,080
They flat-out ask kids with burn scars
how they got burned.

730
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,878
Go back in. Don't leave him alone.

731
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,673
Hey, don't be too…

732
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:27,509
What?

733
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,056
Bye.

734
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:34,974
See you.

735
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,440
Don't treat Seon-woo too much like a kid.

736
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,322
He'll probably be more hurt
from being treated

737
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,408
like that by you than when he gets
stared at by strangers.

738
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,146
Is this it?

739
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,690
Yes, it is, sir.

740
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,806
I'll help you.

741
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,767
Who… are you?

742
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,102
I'm Gu Seung-hyo, sir.

743
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,028
Here.

744
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,407
It'll take you all night to do this alone.

745
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,078
Just who are you?

746
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,040
I'm…

747
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,087
Gu Seung-hyo from
Sangkook University Hospital.

748
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,838
I called you before.

749
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:12,799
Gu…

750
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,140
Wait. But…

751
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,560
Do you remember now?

752
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,646
Sir.

753
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,273
Just a minute.

754
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,067
I only need a minute.

755
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:35,363
Your son told me to come see you.

756
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,031
That's why I…

757
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,616
Sir?

758
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:40,827
Just a minute.

759
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,763
Have a good night.

760
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,770
How can he call himself
the Minister of Environment,

761
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,565
when his parents are living
in an environment like this?

762
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,411
Good night to you too.

763
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,915
Who is that?

764
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,710
He's nobody. Let's go to sleep.

765
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,202
Chief, take a look at this.

766
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:07,038
What is it? Did something else come up?

767
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:11,584
Dear respected staff
of Sangkook University Hospital,

768
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:15,213
we will be undergoing modification
as proposed

769
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,590
by the Restructure Team
from the headquarters.

770
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:20,843
The management efficiency evaluation

771
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:25,223
will be the first step in providing
a forward-looking business structure.

772
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:29,686
It will also help cut out the inefficiency
in our medical services.

773
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,938
What does he take our work for?

774
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:38,194
Thus, every member of the staff
is asked to participate.

775
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:39,654
Please note

776
01:01:39,737 --> 01:01:43,116
that your participation will be considered
in the evaluation.

777
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,827
Through the first efficiency evaluation

778
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,329
in the history of the hospital, we promise

779
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,622
we will develop into

780
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,584
an even more reasonable
and patient-friendly medical institution.

781
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,255
Wow. What a fancy way of saying,
"Screw you."

782
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,632
His way of saying,
"Just do what you're told,"

783
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,050
was too hard for me to understand.

784
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,770
-Why isn't everything ready?
-Sorry.

785
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,984
This 3-month-old infant
was transferred in at 2 a.m. last night.

786
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,239
If you're late, you should just quickly
come in. Why bother knocking?

787
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,283
Come in.

788
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,582
We’d like the Emergency Medical Center’s
on-call schedule,

789
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:36,002
and the interns’ and residents’
evaluations for the past year.

790
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:38,921
-What was that?
-And--

791
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,214
And?

792
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,258
We need the Mortality Conference
records as well.

793
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:43,426
What was that?

794
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:45,470
MORTALITY CONFERENCE:
A BRIEFING ABOUT THE DECEASED

795
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,036
Good. Stay.

796
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,412
Here.

797
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,956
Nice. There you go.

798
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,293
Good boy.

799
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:21,547
Even the dog is lovely at this place.

800
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,842
How cute.

801
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,305
Good morning, sir.

802
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,435
I think mutts are the cutest dogs.

803
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:37,230
That isn't a mutt.

804
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:38,815
I'm sorry.

805
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,025
What breed is it?

806
01:03:42,985 --> 01:03:43,903
It's…

807
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,477
People in this field
do not admit to mistakes.

808
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,980
It's impossible not to make them,
but they insist they don't.

809
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,690
Doctors must admit to their mistakes, too.

810
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:24,360
What is this? It's like
they're exercising a search warrant.

811
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,196
They won't know what they're looking at.
Just pretend to cooperate.

812
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,741
They can figure things out
if they really try to.

813
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,076
They are asking for our records
on the mortality conferences.

814
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,995
What's running through your mind
right now?

815
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:38,165
You lack the energy or interest
to worry about other departments, right?

816
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,834
If you continue to show
a lack of interest,

817
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,836
they'll eventually hold our future
in their hands.

818
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:43,838
Let's wrap up the vote on the strike.

819
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:45,631
-And if that doesn't work?
-We fight head-on.

820
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,427
We have justification.
We'll show we aren't just whining.

821
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,262
What was the first thing you did
as soon as you came here?

822
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:53,681
Your first idea was to fire people
for causing losses.

823
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:55,850
You know what happens
if a person works without rest?

824
01:04:55,933 --> 01:04:57,727
Do you have any idea what it is like
for the doctors here?

825
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,271
Do you also work 100 to 120 hours a week?

826
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,772
If you felt so bad for them,

827
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,650
you should've spread the load
as per the law.

828
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,694
You covered it up,
but now that you got caught,

829
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,905
you whine about how badly they have it?

830
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,281
And some of you

831
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,159
cooperated in covering it up.

832
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:14,410
We did not cover it up.

833
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,329
We reported it.

834
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:17,747
To whom?

835
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,248
Whom do you think?

836
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,293
The hospital director.

837
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:28,424
