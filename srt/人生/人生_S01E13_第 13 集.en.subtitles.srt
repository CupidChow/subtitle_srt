1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:56,431
ALL CHARACTERS, NAMES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,475
ANY RESEMBLANCE IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL

3
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,186
EPISODE 13

4
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,319
Although a day has passed
since they changed their position,

5
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,155
the hospital has not
disclosed the autopsy result.

6
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,407
Is that good?

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,327
Speak a little slower
and raise your tone just a bit.

8
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,129
The director took the day off
and won't be at the meeting.

9
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,009
We're busy as it is.
Couldn't she have told us sooner?

10
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,137
Good thinking. I wouldn't come either.

11
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,140
I know. The reporters must be
hounding her.

12
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,945
What are you doing?

13
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,663
The Ministry of Health and Welfare
sent a notice.

14
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,165
Counseling services regarding
suicide prevention are needed.

15
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,460
People from our hospital will need to
undergo training.

16
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,631
The department in charge is…

17
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,140
What's up? Did something good happen?

18
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,978
I think this year's achievement award
recipient should buy us drinks.

19
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,354
Pardon?

20
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,566
Is Mr. Ye receiving it again?

21
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,901
Apparently, HR unanimously approved it.

22
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,820
You're so popular.

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,240
What's the standard?

24
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,617
Standard? I don't know.

25
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,662
It's not like achievement is graded. Why?

26
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,957
You worked hard. Especially
how you handled the Sangkook case.

27
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,543
The two of you went on-site

28
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,879
more than I did.

29
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,590
Don't overthink it.
If they give it to you, just take it.

30
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,427
All I did was

31
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,140
wake up, eat, and go to work
like everyone else.

32
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,851
I don't know what makes that
such a great achievement.

33
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,114
It's not that it's anything special,
just that you--

34
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,200
Is the report on Sangkook having
an unlicensed person operate

35
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,494
not ready yet?

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,955
That's right. Why aren't you
submitting it? You finished it.

37
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,249
I will soon.

38
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,461
They're in the news so much already
that the medical malpractice issue

39
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,004
is not the center of attention.

40
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:33,922
True.

41
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,841
Your brother must be stressed.

42
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,384
Isn't the hospital a mess right now?

43
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,012
My brother isn't high-up enough
to be stressed out.

44
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,431
-Rather, the person in charge…
-Who's in charge?

45
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,685
Never mind.

46
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,773
So, do I tell them you refuse
the achievement award?

47
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,945
I'll tell them. Don't concern yourself.

48
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,501
Isn't that Mr. Gu?

49
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,418
You're right.

50
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,088
Why is he standing there?

51
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,354
It's over with QL.

52
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,441
He says to forget about the partnership.

53
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,527
I'm sorry, sir.

54
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,530
Why do you think
I didn't cut a deal with the family?

55
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,158
It wouldn't have cost much.

56
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:30,413
I could've had them take down all
the articles about it and moved the body.

57
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,041
That would've been easier.

58
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,669
You know why I didn't do all of that?

59
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,840
Because

60
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,384
you were confident.

61
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,096
I'm sorry, sir. I can--

62
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,222
Forget it.

63
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,184
Don't do anything. We'll do it.

64
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,274
Don't you need to go back to the hospital?

65
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,701
What?

66
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,661
So soon?

67
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,067
Mr. Gu. I'm sorry, but I was told
the lobby was filled with reporters.

68
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,278
May we go through the basement garage?

69
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,332
We'll do it.

70
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,442
I'm not asking for something impossible.

71
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,570
You're close to a doctor there,
so ask him. Why are you being difficult?

72
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,114
If he's a doctor at Sangkook,
he must know something.

73
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,533
Why she changed her position,
and why they're staying silent.

74
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,660
There must be something
circulating among themselves.

75
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,621
We're not that close.

76
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,206
So? Is that a problem?

77
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,293
Did you work only with people
you were close to?

78
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,005
Hui-sang thinks he'll be released soon.

79
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,301
And most importantly,
we're all on the line because of this.

80
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,179
Am I wrong?

81
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,348
We should be desperately
grabbing hold of anyone

82
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,309
at Sangkook for an interview right now.

83
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,353
But you have an inside source.
What are you waiting for?

84
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,441
Aren't you a reporter?

85
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,236
I am a reporter.

86
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,292
JIN-WOO

87
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,965
MESSAGE FROM JIN-WOO

88
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,149
You don't remember.

89
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,817
Oh, well.

90
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,531
No. I'm just saying it's back.

91
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,118
That's right. It turned into
some drugstore, but it's back now.

92
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,036
You do remember.

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,956
Right now?

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,168
Sure. Come.

95
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,904
I'll take that cake and coffee.

96
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,219
Is this Lee Jeong-seon's father?

97
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,264
Yes, this is Ye Jin-woo.

98
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,766
Is something wrong?

99
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,978
Tell Director Oh to come here.

100
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:04,937
Yes, sir.

101
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,487
Is the director seeing patients?
Can you tell her to come--

102
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,574
Okay.

103
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,328
Director Oh is taking the day off today.

104
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:21,954
What?

105
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:28,628
DIRECTOR OH SE-HWA

106
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,764
Do you have her home number?

107
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,557
I'll try calling it now.

108
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,685
DEPARTMENT CHIEFS EMERGENCY CONTACTS

109
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,281
Her husband's number is listed here too.
Should I try calling him?

110
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,583
It's off.

111
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,261
"We'll do it."

112
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,140
Mr. Lee from Restructure Team.

113
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,977
-What about Mr. Lee?
-He's working at the head office today.

114
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,397
He works for the hospital now.
This is his head office.

115
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,482
-Tell him to come right now.
-Yes, sir.

116
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,954
The autopsy photographer called.

117
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,416
He said he wants his memory card back.

118
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,086
And to make sure we don't mention him.

119
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,757
I promised I wouldn't,
and told him not to worry,

120
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,551
but he seemed so nervous.

121
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,433
You're still here?

122
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,353
What are you two doing here?

123
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,355
We'll go right back in
after filling our bellies.

124
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,149
What are you doing here alone?

125
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,276
Are you not eating that?

126
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,032
We'll go stuff our faces now.

127
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,033
What?

128
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,331
Who could it be?

129
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,625
What do you mean?

130
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,960
It must be a woman.

131
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,129
What?

132
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,926
Just go.

133
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,344
We have to see.

134
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,475
But…

135
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,332
You look like you need this.

136
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,713
Why didn't you eat it?

137
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,141
Has there been anything new,

138
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,643
or any word going around internally?

139
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,730
That's what you wore yesterday.

140
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,817
I'm sorry.

141
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,404
That's not what I mean.
How long have you been up?

142
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,657
It's okay. I'm used to it.

143
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,327
Why must you be used to that?

144
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,544
What were you about to say?
Is it about Lee Jeong-seon?

145
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,554
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

146
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,055
Sorry?

147
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,682
I'm fine.

148
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,352
No, you're not.
You look like a total zombie.

149
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,521
You look like you'll pass out
once you start driving.

150
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,274
A zombie…

151
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,401
I'm really okay, though.

152
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:38,961
Slow down!

153
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,009
You're a completely different person
behind the wheel. I was fooled.

154
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,428
How do you handle blood
when you're this scared?

155
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,055
I'm trying to avoid seeing blood
right now.

156
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,850
I just got out, and you're here trying to
send me back to the hospital.

157
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,769
I said I'll bring you home safely.

158
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,438
Don't you trust me?

159
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,326
You said you're used to it, but I guess
you don't want to go back to work.

160
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,829
Nothing beats bumming around at home.

161
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,089
Whom do you live with? Your parents?

162
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,592
My brother. Younger brother.

163
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,804
Since you're brothers, you guys
don't really nag each other. Right?

164
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936
Is he cute?

165
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,604
Him?

166
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,356
No way.

167
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,542
He must be popular.
He has a girlfriend, right?

168
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,253
I don't know.

169
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
What about me? Introduce me.

170
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,179
What? Who? You to him?

171
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,180
Yes.

172
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,105
Don't laugh.

173
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,732
Why not?

174
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,819
Can't I even laugh as I please?

175
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,861
You may not.

176
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,321
I'm going to laugh.

177
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,615
You're so mean.

178
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,451
You should take a nap.

179
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,161
How can I sleep? You drive aggressively.

180
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,455
-I'm a really good driver. Want to see?
-What--

181
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,374
Watch where you're going. Focus.

182
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,508
DOCTOR YE JIN-WOO

183
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,554
DIRECTOR OH SE-HWA

184
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,146
We're ready for you.

185
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,397
Okay.

186
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,777
Say that Sangkook's official position is,

187
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,740
if laws on for-profit hospitals pass,
the accessibility of medical services

188
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,992
for low-income patients
must be guaranteed as well.

189
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,370
It's not like we don't know
that public health is vulnerable.

190
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,247
That's our premise.

191
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,959
Yes, sir.

192
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,837
The Institute said they'd give
the presentation

193
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,798
on attracting foreign patients
in our annex building, as per our request.

194
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,091
Okay.

195
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,430
Also, Director Oh Se-hwa,
Dr. Joo Kyung-moon,

196
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,725
Dr. Lee No-eul, and Dr. Ye Jin-woo.

197
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
Dismiss them all.

198
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,067
Effective immediately.

199
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,193
Yes, sir.

200
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,906
Rather than dismissing the director
and chief all at once,

201
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,407
why don't you just…

202
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:02,956
Very well, sir.

203
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,251
I'll post the notice.

204
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,468
I hear even people from
the National Assembly are calling

205
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,678
to speak to Director Oh.

206
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,555
I mean, who wouldn't

207
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,350
avoid calls in her situation?

208
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,852
Has Director Oh ever called to say

209
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,646
she can't come to work that very day?

210
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,899
I thought she said herself
that she was taking a vacation day.

211
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,734
Maybe she went somewhere nice.

212
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:36,448
"You may turn it off
when you're in a whole new world."

213
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,202
Are you really quoting something that old?

214
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,372
It's not my problem
that you've heard of it before.

215
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:48,085
The biosimulator comes in today.

216
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,549
There's no way
Director Oh would miss that.

217
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,932
Hey. No. I'm done eating.

218
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,725
Is it regarding a patient?

219
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,435
Yes.

220
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,272
Okay. What?

221
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,359
You don't think something bad
could've happened to her, do you?

222
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,866
What is up with him?

223
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,996
-Come see me two weeks from now.
-Okay.

224
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,873
-See you again.
-Bye.

225
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,332
Let's go.

226
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,458
Please see them out.

227
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,044
Mr. Lee Won-seok, please come in.

228
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,671
Excuse me. Pardon me.

229
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,383
Chief.

230
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,180
-What did you do?
-Sorry?

231
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,764
What trouble did you get yourself into?

232
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,766
What is it that you did
that he wants to fire you?

233
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,562
Director Oh, Chief Joo, Ye Jin-woo.

234
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,939
Those three, I can understand.

235
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,399
But why you?

236
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:53,942
Me?

237
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,402
You're on the list too.

238
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,530
The president says he's firing you.

239
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,241
What the hell is going on?

240
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,535
What did you do that ticked him off?

241
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,996
Why is he directing his rage at us?

242
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,835
What about Lee Jeong-seon's death?

243
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,924
You don't want me to implement
the pay-for-performance program.

244
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,508
And yet,

245
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,261
you slashed the nurses' starting salaries.

246
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,640
The result is the same regardless.

247
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:39,571
That moron.

248
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,906
YE JIN-WOO

249
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,991
Where the hell is he now?

250
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,842
My goodness. Aren't you Dr. Ye's mother?

251
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,219
What brings you here?

252
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,553
How have you been?

253
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,014
Is Jin-woo not around?

254
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,768
He worked all night.

255
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,021
He must be zonked out at home.
He won't pick up.

256
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,192
Oh, my. Why is he not answering
his chief's calls?

257
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,944
That's not like him.

258
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:20,988
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,324
No, no. Not at all.
That wasn't what I meant.

260
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,995
It's nothing.

261
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,623
Okay, then. You must be busy. Good day.

262
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,875
Okay. Get home safely.

263
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,715
Dang it.

264
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,964
Hey, are you--

265
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,884
Are you up?

266
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,594
It's good that you're up.

267
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,596
Eat, and go back to sleep.

268
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,309
When did you come? You should've woken me.

269
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,310
Just now.

270
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,854
We don't even use all of these.

271
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,689
I'm done.

272
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,152
Is your hospital okay?

273
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:47,908
It's all over the news on TV
and in the papers.

274
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,618
That's the outside world.

275
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,537
We're too busy to notice what's going on.

276
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,998
Is everything okay
between you and Seon-woo?

277
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,708
Of course, we're okay.

278
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,213
He says he wants to live on his own.

279
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,633
Did he say anything to you?

280
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,593
Is that why you're here?

281
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,346
It's understandable.

282
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,115
Seon-woo sent an email.

283
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,700
To you?

284
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,454
He's so sappy at times.

285
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,876
What did he say?

286
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,671
He said…

287
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,259
it was his fault
that the accident happened.

288
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,179
He says your dad died because of him.

289
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,725
It's my fault

290
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,727
for ignoring it,

291
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,105
claiming it was for his sake.

292
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,109
For all these years…

293
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,907
I didn't know it was
burdening him so much.

294
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,289
But if I come out now and say that I knew,

295
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,333
and so did you,

296
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,170
he'll worry

297
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,506
that you and I resented him

298
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,467
all this time.

299
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,394
I'll chat with him,

300
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,646
so he doesn't think that.

301
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,205
When Seon-woo said he wanted to move out,

302
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,166
I thought

303
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,628
maybe it was because you found someone.

304
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,087
Whom would I find and where?

305
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,589
I'd rather sleep in my spare time.

306
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,009
What about someone at the hospital?

307
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,095
There's no one at the hospital.
There are only people like No-eul.

308
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,850
Mom.

309
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,269
I would never do such a thing to Seon-woo.

310
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,354
I wouldn't date her.

311
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,857
Besides,

312
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,276
even if you drop No-eul and me
on a deserted island,

313
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,570
we'd both be busy hunting.

314
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,988
We'd fight over food.

315
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,492
I should go.

316
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,327
But…

317
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,455
All you did was work.
Seon-woo will be back soon.

318
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,499
It's okay.

319
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,293
I need to go home early.

320
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,379
I wasn't planning to come here.

321
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,257
I'll drive you back.

322
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,636
I drove. Will you walk me
to the parking lot?

323
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,306
My son.

324
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,516
Goodness.

325
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:15,949
Mom.

326
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,201
Okay.

327
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,247
You'll catch a cold. Put something on.

328
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,873
I'll die of heat exhaustion.

329
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,963
Still. You should put something on.

330
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,629
I can't imagine how you must have felt,

331
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,925
how frightened and lost
you must have been.

332
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:18,595
Now that I think about it,

333
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,931
when Dad passed away,

334
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,225
you were my age now.

335
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,898
You shouldn't have suffered
at such a young age.

336
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,193
We should've let you go then.

337
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,614
Do you have to cook when you get home?

338
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,240
No.

339
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,993
We don't cook much,
since it's just two old fogies.

340
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,455
Someone who's much older than you
would be offended if they heard you.

341
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,957
You think so?

342
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,380
I realized much later,

343
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,883
that you were in your prime

344
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,594
when you became a single mom.

345
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,307
My mother,

346
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,726
who pushed and pulled me,

347
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,648
a grown man,
to the med school on top of the hill…

348
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,484
countless times.

349
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,740
You always waited for me

350
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,284
in the cold school hallway.

351
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,163
Why did I accept it so easily,

352
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,165
thinking you were okay?

353
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,335
When I think about it now…

354
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,338
it frustrates me that

355
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,425
I was such a stupid and immature brat.

356
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,310
Hey.

357
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,485
Don't think you abandoned me.

358
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,780
Please

359
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,949
don't feel bad.

360
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,207
I was a spoiled brat

361
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,334
who thought only I was hurting.

362
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,297
I couldn't say anything outside,
but I screamed and was angry

363
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,841
only at home.

364
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,513
You devoted every day of your life,

365
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,766
and your entire youth

366
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,477
to me.

367
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,397
Who in this world

368
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,484
would love me the way you loved me?

369
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,618
Oh, my.

370
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,078
Ma'am.

371
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:49,996
Hello.

372
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,498
Yes, hello.

373
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,916
How have you been?

374
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,168
I've been doing well, thank you. And you?

375
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,294
Yes, I'm doing well.

376
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,963
You must be here for your boys.

377
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,340
I brought some food.

378
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,466
I see.

379
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:04,219
-Please, let me.
-That's okay.

380
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,650
There's something I need to tell you.

381
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:25,198
There were times I had wished
Uncle Bo-hun would've told you for me.

382
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,578
But he'd never share anything he heard
during a consultation, so…

383
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,085
And now…

384
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,296
Now that he is no longer by our side,

385
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,466
I should be the one to tell you, right?

386
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,385
Mom.

387
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,306
I didn't tell you right away,

388
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:51,975
and afterward,

389
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,061
I just couldn't get myself to bring it up.

390
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,398
Jin-woo doesn't know.

391
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,524
ACCEPTANCE LETTER

392
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:02,694
Honey. I sent our son to med school.

393
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:04,696
I did well, right?

394
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,491
You're super proud of me, right?

395
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,125
NAME: YE JIN-WOO
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE

396
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,129
I'm the one who did that

397
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:23,590
to Dad.

398
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,300
The accident…

399
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,386
was my fault.

400
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,403
Dad told me to stop.

401
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,073
He said not to play in the car.

402
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,326
But…

403
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,411
I…

404
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,048
It was me.

405
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,134
I took him away from your lives.

406
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:14,140
He, who was a husband to you
and a father to Jin-woo.

407
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,145
Mom.

408
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,441
Please don't feel sorry for me.

409
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,777
Being paralyzed

410
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,029
is the punishment I deserve.

411
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,976
He says he wants to live on his own.

412
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,521
I saw you two together.
Seon-woo was with me too.

413
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,616
ZIGBANG

414
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,786
RENTAL LISTINGS

415
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,126
-What are you doing?
-Weren't you sleeping?

416
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,089
Do you want to move?

417
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,134
No, I'm just looking.

418
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,764
Sleep in your room.

419
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,350
I have the night shift tomorrow.
I can sleep during the day.

420
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,561
Okay.

421
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,067
So that's why…

422
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,045
17 MISSED CALLS

423
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,465
CHIEF LEE DONG-SU, MS. KIM, PARK JAE-HYEOK

424
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,552
CHIEF LEE DONG-SU

425
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,973
Hi, Chief--

426
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,059
Why are you just calling?

427
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,769
I told you to keep it to a minimum.

428
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,354
-What?
-You must be excited that

429
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,482
you don't have to see
my nagging face again.

430
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:31,152
Why did you have to get involved
and get into this mess, you moron?

431
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:32,820
What will you do now?

432
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,448
What do you mean, I won't see you?

433
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,868
Whatever! Do whatever you want.

434
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,584
Why is…

435
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,637
I'll go home now.

436
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,307
Dr. Lee.

437
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,185
Want to grab a drink?

438
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,355
I need to go.

439
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,199
Well, how could she want a drink?

440
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,793
Are you leaving now?

441
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,003
Yes.

442
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,262
Ms. Kang.

443
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,265
Yes? Me?

444
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,976
Do you want to grab a drink with me?

445
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:46,853
Sorry?

446
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,694
Let's go.

447
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,698
Cheers.

448
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,123
This is it.

449
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,000
This is how you end a day.

450
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:10,960
Do you not drink often?

451
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,588
With whom would I drink?

452
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,505
Mr. Gu?

453
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,385
I'm the "team manager", but I have
no one to go to team dinners with.

454
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:29,103
Well… Mr. Gu is usually
a good person, but…

455
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,244
How long have you worked with him?

456
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,372
It's been about five, six years.

457
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,709
He joined the department
where I was working,

458
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,921
and when he was transferred
to Logis, he took me with him.

459
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,506
So, you were scouted.

460
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,008
That man…

461
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,095
has a great eye for people.

462
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,275
Love-hate relationships are the strongest.

463
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,694
At first, he was a bit… You know.

464
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,572
But he doesn't say useless things,

465
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,907
or pester me.

466
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,952
Even as a man, Mr. Gu is--

467
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:29,080
He doesn't pester people.
But he sure fires them without hesitation.

468
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,541
That's…

469
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,585
Terminating people in retaliation…

470
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,922
Does Mr. Gu do that often?

471
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,009
-Dr. Lee.
-Does he?

472
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,107
He must've hated having me
constantly talk to him.

473
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,111
I didn't even know
he was dying to fire me.

474
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,370
Another bottle of soju, please.

475
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,871
Make it two, please.

476
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,138
Yes, Ms. Kang.

477
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,766
Mr. Gu. I'm nearby.

478
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,476
Come pick me up.

479
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,147
What was that?

480
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,443
I always pick you up.

481
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,156
Can't you do that for me just once?

482
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,701
You never do anything I ask for.

483
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,120
Ms. Kang.

484
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,498
Have you gone insane?

485
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,590
SUMMARY OF CURRENT NUMBER OF
FOREIGN PATIENTS

486
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,727
Ms. Kang isn't there, sir.

487
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:25,821
Wait here.

488
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,406
Yes, sir.

489
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,837
Ms. Kang.

490
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,382
Where are you? Hurry back.

491
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,139
Excuse me.

492
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:57,144
Could you check to see if someone
has passed out in the restroom?

493
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,821
Let's go.

494
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,160
Let's go.

495
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,830
Are you going to stay here all night?

496
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,374
Excuse me.

497
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:19,708
There's no one in the restroom.

498
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,145
The other lady already paid.

499
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,231
How much did they drink?

500
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,649
Six bottles of soju.

501
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,026
Just the two of them?

502
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,084
Ma'am, I'll take you home.

503
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,253
Who are you?

504
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,754
Sorry?

505
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,134
You called for a designated driver.

506
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,969
I did?

507
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:13,387
Where should I take you?

508
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:16,891
Seocho-dong.

509
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,351
Okay.

510
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,693
She's so…

511
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,242
You need to slide in--

512
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,097
How could you just get in?

513
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,025
Do you even know whose car
you just got in?

514
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,781
Don't you know how dangerous it is
to just follow a stranger like that?

515
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,452
Right?

516
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,706
Why did I follow just anyone?

517
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,502
Even after hearing
what kind of a man he was…

518
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,380
Why did I trust him?

519
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,953
Mr. Gu.

520
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,623
We're in Seocho-dong. What should we do?

521
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,258
Her ID must have her address.

522
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:36,071
SEON-WOO

523
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,704
Dr. Ye Seon-woo?

524
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,956
Who's this?

525
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,208
This is Gu Seung-hyo from Sangkook.

526
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,461
Do you happen to know
Dr. Lee's home address?

527
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,504
Mr. Gu?

528
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,801
Why are you…

529
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,973
How drunk is she?

530
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,227
I'll go. Where are you?

531
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,439
Her place is five minutes
from here by car.

532
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,024
I'll go. Where are you?

533
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,985
No, we're not anywhere. We're in a car.

534
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,029
Do you know her address?

535
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,908
Hill Village, Building 301.

536
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,661
Yes.

537
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,956
Taxi!

538
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,420
Taxi!

539
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:16,964
Taxi.

540
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:00,549
We're here.

541
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,179
Dr. Lee.

542
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,099
Dr. Lee.

543
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,436
Thank you.

544
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,867
Doctor…

545
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,997
She must really hate me.

546
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:46,929
She went in.

547
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,556
You said five minutes by car…

548
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:03,654
Taxi!

549
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:07,699
Take that.

550
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,289
Shit. What's his license number?

551
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,124
Forget it.

552
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:17,960
Let's go.

553
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,256
Good night.

554
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,556
Do you like Dr. Lee?

555
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,312
No.

556
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,608
If I do,

557
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,905
I should be able to run right over
to the person I like

558
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:49,992
when she's drunk.

559
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,332
Since I couldn't do that,

560
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,253
I suppose I don't like her.

561
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,299
But you came for her.

562
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,843
How is this any different from not coming?

563
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,556
-Take this to the lab.
-Okay. I'll run this to the lab.

564
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,558
-Is the on-call doctor coming?
-Yes.

565
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,060
His BP dropped to 60.

566
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,895
-Administer saline.
-Okay.

567
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,563
Prepare for transfusion and intubation.

568
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,648
Yes, sir.

569
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,443
Position at 24cm.

570
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,070
Positioning it at 24cm.

571
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:09,863
-Get the echo ready.
-Yes, sir.

572
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,698
BP is 50 and still dropping.

573
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,087
He fell

574
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,713
from his 11th-floor apartment.

575
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,382
He hit a tree and avoided direct impact.

576
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,676
Fractures are suspected in his
arms and legs.

577
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,512
Internal bleeding is suspected
due to a constant drop in BP.

578
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,222
Maybe it's cardiac tamponade.

579
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,307
Cardiac tamponade.
We'll perform pericardiocentesis.

580
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,475
Yes, sir.

581
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,983
-Here's a sample.
-Okay. I'll run this to the lab.

582
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,330
BP and heart rate are stable.

583
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:46,168
Have him transfused and move him to the OR
before his BP drops again.

584
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,294
Yes, sir.

585
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,649
I can't tell what's really on his mind.

586
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:14,362
If I were him, I would've cursed
my head off and stormed out.

587
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:22,454
Did Mr. Gu fire you as well?

588
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,293
Even Dr. Lee No-eul and Director Oh.

589
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,464
No one's been able to reach Director Oh.

590
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:35,967
Could she have heard from someone?
Or who knows if she saw it coming.

591
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,386
With that ego of hers…

592
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,555
Dr. Ye, you can't just let this happen.

593
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,765
Don't take it lying down.

594
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:43,183
If I take it lying down,

595
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,852
that would be rude to Mr. Gu.

596
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,814
What do you plan to do?

597
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,192
He wants to fight, so I'll fight.

598
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,122
You're all I have.

599
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,596
I was too drunk and lost--

600
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,763
You lost your senses,

601
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,182
but you paid the bill just fine.

602
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:09,102
Paying for things is my drunken habit.

603
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,273
Calling someone over and jetting.
Leaving a person behind.

604
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,025
Are those your new drunken habits?

605
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:18,486
I didn't mean to drink so much,

606
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,281
but it was so sad. There wasn't much
I could do at that moment.

607
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,576
Dr. Lee No-eul started crying
out of the blue,

608
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:25,785
so I had no choice…

609
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,038
So?

610
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,374
Will you drink with everyone
who gets fired?

611
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,084
Then how many more times must I go?

612
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,961
That's not it.

613
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,969
Dr. Ye Seon-woo. The person
who came from the HIRA before.

614
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,264
He's very sick.

615
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,017
He has 10 to 15 years at most.

616
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,771
What do you mean by "at most"?

617
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,689
Because of his legs.

618
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,109
I think she said he has
some kind of thrombosis.

619
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,528
He's… dying?

620
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:08,620
As she said that, tears flowed
from her big, round eyes.

621
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:11,831
I can get very emotional,

622
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,669
so when she told me that, it tore me
to think he'd die at such a young age.

623
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,962
That's when we started…

624
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:36,856
As I said, the artificial joints
have expiration dates.

625
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,900
Currently, it's between 10 to 15 years.

626
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,279
That's all.

627
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,291
RESTRUCTURE TEAM

628
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,460
Yes? What is it?

629
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,753
Mr. Gu.

630
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,589
Almost all the chiefs are gathering
in the auditorium.

631
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,633
Why?

632
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,218
I don't know yet,

633
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:07,679
but many of the doctors
are attending as well.

634
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:16,271
WORKER ANT: AUDITORIUM. WHAT'S GOING ON?

635
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,879
I'M IN A MEETING.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK LATER.

636
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,693
Dr. Ye.

637
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,074
Director Oh's phone is still off.
We'll have to do it without her.

638
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:40,188
I'll begin.

639
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:43,733
REGULATIONS REGARDING THE
REMOVAL OF THE HEAD OF THE HOSPITAL

640
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,986
The current political and medical
suspicions toward our hospital

641
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,738
fall under regulation one

642
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,242
for removing the head of the hospital
for dereliction of duty.

643
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:55,245
The subsequent retaliative
termination of doctors

644
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:58,832
falls under regulation two, which
prohibits terminating medical personnel

645
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,543
at his discretion and not for a cause
determined by the institution.

646
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,548
As we must not tolerate
the management's abuse of power,

647
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,424
I am proposing

648
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:12,637
the dismissal of the president,
Gu Seung-hyo, here today.

649
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:29,779
Will that work?

650
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,616
Did anything go our way even once?

651
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,828
I'm skeptical.

652
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,081
We haven't even discussed
how we'll do it yet.

653
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,667
Right, like there's a way.

654
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:45,044
He wants to fight against the foundation.

655
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:48,298
Forget it. It's better to stay quiet
and lay low.

656
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,217
Haven't we stayed quiet long enough?

657
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,094
How little did he think of us,

658
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,221
that he fired the director
with a single notice?

659
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,933
How could we fight against Hwajeong Group?

660
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:02,103
Worst-case scenario, we'll lose our
jobs and have to go into private practice.

661
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,024
Is private practice
the worst-case scenario?

662
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,906
But then again,
if he fires all the doctors,

663
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,243
even Hwajeong Group couldn't
fight back for very long.

664
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,705
We can't leave a cancer cell
because we're afraid it'll spread.

665
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:21,623
Let's give it a try.

666
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:23,833
How will you do it?

667
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,009
It's either Director Oh's motion,

668
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,595
or two-thirds of the chief

669
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,014
-agreeing on--
-Is there anyone here

670
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,434
who can get in touch with Director Oh?

671
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,106
The director is not exercising

672
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,360
her authority during
these important times.

673
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,700
It looks like we have a consensus
regarding his dismissal,

674
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,246
so let's vote. I'll make the motion.

675
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,747
You're not qualified.

676
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,000
You are suspended indefinitely.

677
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,128
You cannot make the motion.

678
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,714
And what authority do you have
to run your mouth?

679
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,966
Who here besides me…

680
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:29,440
Currently, the deputy director position
at Sangkook University Hospital

681
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,276
is vacant.

682
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,194
I nominate Dr. Joo Kyung-moon,

683
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,197
Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery,
to fill that vacancy.

684
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:39,284
Someone who is suspended isn't
qualified, but someone who was fired is?

685
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,078
What logic is that?

686
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,413
Who fired me?

687
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,584
Do you consent to Mr. Gu's
decision of terminating us?

688
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,337
If you do, how could you make a motion
to remove him?

689
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:58,553
Dr. Joo received the second most votes
during the election for director.

690
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,514
What better qualification is there?

691
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,767
Does anyone oppose?

692
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:06,352
If you object--

693
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,521
Do you know what this punk did?

694
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,566
He secretly ratted me out to the HIRA!

695
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,657
The HIRA's on-site investigation.

696
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:24,162
He used a fake name,
pretending to be an outsider,

697
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:26,664
and ratted out somebody who is a chief
and 20 years his senior.

698
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,376
Nothing went wrong with the surgery.
It was a success.

699
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,503
But he reported me. Ye Jin-woo!

700
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,507
We give our all to save a life,

701
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:40,136
but this guy sold me out to
none other than the wretched HIRA

702
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,680
that comes at us to pay
as little as possible.

703
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:45,141
He then called in his crippled brother

704
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,018
to buy pity points, and ratted me out!

705
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:58,905
Lee Dong-su!

706
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,493
You took a traitor under your wing.

707
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,954
How dare a traitor talk to me
about qualifications?

708
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,836
Did you know he was like this
when you teamed up with him?

709
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,588
Did you two conspire to do this

710
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,173
from when you left your hick town?

711
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,309
Dr. Ye. Is this true?

712
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,402
Answer me.

713
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,864
Did you report Dr. Kim Tae-sang
to the HIRA?

714
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,713
Yes, I did.

715
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,256
Are you insane?

716
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,303
-That lunatic.
-I know.

717
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,473
How could you report him
to them of all people?

718
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:13,730
Why?

719
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,272
Hey, Jang Min-gi. Lee Sang-yeop.

720
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,066
Kim Jung-hee. Seo Ji-yong.

721
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:04,322
Can any one of you here
say that you didn't suck Lee Bo-hun dry?

722
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,953
Joo Kyung-moon. Do you really not have
any ambition to become the director?

723
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,624
Your codes are locked too, right?

724
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,751
I cannot see outpatients
or perform surgeries.

725
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,669
I've been deleted.

726
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,672
-Why did you do it?
-Why must I explain myself?

727
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,050
-How low will you go?
-If you don't want to see the worst,

728
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,259
just leave.

729
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,470
Someone wanted to show you this.

730
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:31,265
She said that if you saw things yourself,
even you would change.

731
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,685
You saw this every single day,
but you didn't change.

732
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,145
Do you like living like that?

733
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,022
Do you enjoy destroying
every place you go?

734
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:39,565
Why did you come here?

735
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,652
Do you want to know what it truly
feels like to be hurt and destroyed?

736
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:49,492
