[Episode 32]

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,760
With both witnesses and evidence present,

13
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,510
what do you have left to deny?

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,270
Let me ask you again.

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,600
Why were Xu Nanying's bribes

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
at your Baicaojing House?

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,920
Inspector Zhang,

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,150
it has nothing to do with Qin Mu.

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,560
I did it.

20
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,480
Yeah.

21
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,510
She did it.

22
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,960
I only lent her the place.

23
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,400
I didn't know what she was doing.

24
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,230
Bai Niao.

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,790
Do you know

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,040
that harboring bribes is a capital offense?

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,760
Lady Bai, clear your mind.

28
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,430
It's a capital offense.

29
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,480
Qin Mu.

30
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,880
Why did you lend your Baicaojing House

31
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,200
to Bai Niao for no reason?

32
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,630
Because...

33
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,070
Because she's like a sister to me.

34
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,720
I had to do.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,390
You finally admit

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,630
that you think of me as a sister.

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,790
When you were a kid,

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,670
I took you to Yangzhou.

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,000
You were seriously ill.

40
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,600
I had no choice

41
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,920
but to sell myself.

42
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,920
I managed to get the money

43
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,390
to treat you.

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
When you grew up,

45
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,160
I supported you.

46
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,830
I hope you can bring honor to our family.

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,440
Father, Mother.

48
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,880
It's all my fault.

49
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,600
I didn't take good care of Mu.

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,160
Shut up.

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,790
When did you say that?

52
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,040
Isn't it embarrassing enough?

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,950
Do you think

54
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,950
I'm willing to be an orphan

55
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,720
that no one loves?

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,160
If it weren't a songstress,

57
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,350
we wouldn't be here.

58
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,880
Do you know

59
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,000
how much I've been through

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,350
to get to where I am today

61
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,280
because you are a songstress?

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,670
I'd rather you weren't my sister.

63
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,440
You'd rather I wasn't your sister.

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,070
Enough.

65
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,920
I need evidence.

66
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,400
I don't need

67
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,160
your nonsense.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,600
Qin Mu.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,990
Can you prove what you're saying is true?

70
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,960
I have proof.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,080
I have proof!

72
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,990
She has an affair with Xu Nanying.

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,870
She's been taking bribes on Xu Nanying's behalf.

74
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,280
I put everything

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,840
in a ledger.

76
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,720
Inspector Zhang, please investigate.

77
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,600
Yeah.

78
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,080
I did everything.

79
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,350
I embezzled jewelry.

80
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,280
I had an affair with Xu Nanying.

81
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,550
I harbored stolen goods and sold them.

82
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,920
I, Bai Niao, did everything.

83
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,520
It has nothing to do with Qin Mu.

84
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,280
Inspector Zhang, I'm at your disposal.

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,190
Qin Mu.

86
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,080
You poisoned Yuanxiang.

87
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,230
I sentence you fifty cane strokes and a fine of three million.

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,790
You can't leave Yangzhou

89
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,040
until Xu Nanying's case is cleared.

90
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,840
Take him down.

91
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,640
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

92
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,640
I'm innocent.

93
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm innocent.

94
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,920
Stupid woman.

95
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,750
It's all your fault. You're killing me.

96
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,840
Stupid woman.

97
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,840
I'm innocent, my lord.

98
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,990
Move fast. Be careful.

99
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,490
Okay.

100
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,190
Tong.

101
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,670
How's it going?

102
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,310
It's almost done, Lady Shijiu.

103
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,190
There are only a few boxes left.

104
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,480
Put your goods down.

105
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,640
Who is Lady Shijiu?

106
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,840
It's me.

107
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
Inspector Zhang is investigating a case.

108
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,400
Please come with us.

109
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,990
What does it have to do with me?

110
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,670
We're here under orders.

111
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,230
Please come with us.

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,960
Lady Shijiu.

113
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,160
Don't worry. Take care of the shop.

114
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,280
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,750
Please.

116
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,350
Lady Shijiu.

117
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,990
What do we do?

118
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,790
Why did the jewelry in Zhenlang Pavilion disappear

119
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,790
after the auction?

120
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,720
Why did it appear in Baicaojing House?

121
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,920
I don't know.

122
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,280
Zhenlang Pavilion was an empty shop

123
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,790
when I took it over.

124
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,350
Are you saying

125
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,840
that Mr. Xu took away the jewelry?

126
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,760
Or did you bribe him with the jewelry

127
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,750
to get Zhenlang Pavilion back?

128
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,280
Lady Shijiu, you acquiesced,

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,750
right?

130
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,920
Cui Shijiu.

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Do you know these South Sea tribute pearls?

132
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,920
Why were they in Baicaojing House

133
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
with Yan's Zhenlang Pavilion's jewelry?

134
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,040
The tribute pearls case was closed

135
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,280
in Chang'an.

136
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,750
I don't know where they came from.

137
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,720
These South Sea tribute pearls were all from Cui's Pearl Farm.

138
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,310
They are not

139
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,480
in Yan's Zhenlang Pavilion's manifest.

140
00:07:58,990 --> 00:07:59,670
Cui Shijiu.

141
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,640
Can you prove where they came from?

142
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,310
If my Cui family had tribute pearls,

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,550
we wouldn't be where we are today.

144
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,840
That is to say,

145
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,640
those South Sea tribute pearls were there

146
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,480
before you took over Zhenlang Pavilion.

147
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,480
No.

148
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,480
I should say

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,520
before the Cui family's tribute pearls fraud case.

150
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,160
I have feelings for Zhenlang Pavilion.

151
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,640
That's why I bought it.

152
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,920
I don't know anything about those tribute pearls

153
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,190
and those goods.

154
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,280
Inspector Zhang.

155
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,760
Zheng Zhiheng has something to report.

156
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,000
Let him in.

157
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,830
Yes, sir.

158
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,310
Inspector Zhang.

159
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,070
Zheng Zhiheng.

160
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,070
What is it?

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,280
Cui Shijiu

162
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,920
wanted to buy the Zhenlang Pavilion from the government.

163
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,240
But Xu Nanying took the opportunity

164
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,160
to ask Cui Shijiu for all the goods in Zhenlang Pavilion.

165
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,710
I was there as a witness.

166
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,120
I can find witnesses to prove

167
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,710
how the jewelry

168
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,240
got from Zhenlang Pavilion to Baicaojing House.

169
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,550
I can confront Xu Nanying.

170
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,310
This box of tribute pearls has nothing to do with Cui Shijiu.

171
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,190
Inspector Zhang, please investigate.

172
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,020
[Grand Governor's Office]

173
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,670
Mr. Zheng, the master wants to see you.

174
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,520
Shijiu.

175
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
Go back to Zhenlang Pavilion first.

176
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:43,950
Go.

177
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,640
Don't worry. It will be all right.

178
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,670
The patriarch said

179
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,830
The master wants to see you and Lady Shijiu.

180
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,360
Wu.

181
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,400
For this woman,

182
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,040
the Zheng family lost a lot of money,

183
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,360
and Prince Ying lost Xu Nanying.

184
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,430
Tell me.

185
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,590
How am I supposed to punish you?

186
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,190
It was my idea.

187
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
It has nothing to do with Cui Shijiu.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,670
Someone.

189
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,000
Punish him according to the family rules.

190
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Master, please leave him alone.

191
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,190
He realized his mistake.

192
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,590
Hold him down

193
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,790
and cane him.

194
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:38,070
Wu, apologize to your father.

195
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,880
Apologize.

196
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,640
Say you're wrong.

197
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,040
Say it.

198
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,670
The Zheng family bribed Xu Nanying

199
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,280
with a lot of money.

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,360
But this money became evidence of Xu Nanying's guilt.

201
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,590
Cui Shijiu got Zhenlang Pavilion.

202
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,400
But she didn't make anything out of it.

203
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,000
Pig.

204
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,120
What do you think of the Zheng family?

205
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,120
Mr. Zheng.

206
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,000
It's none of his business.

207
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,550
Cane me if you want.

208
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,240
Cui Shijiu.

209
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,120
You are not my daughter-in-law.

210
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
I can't cane you.

211
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,790
But I underestimated you.

212
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,430
Xu Nanying is finished.

213
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,190
The Zheng family is finished.

214
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,470
What's in it for you?

215
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,760
If I didn't do that,

216
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,430
how will the Cui family...?

217
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:18,640
Shut up. It's all your fault!

218
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Mother!

219
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,360
Wu.

220
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,670
Sober up.

221
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,280
She's been using you!

222
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
If you go on like this,

223
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,360
you will killed by her.

224
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,710
Master.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Please have mercy.

226
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,830
- Cane him! - Master!

227
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,310
Keep caning!

228
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,950
You will kill him, Master!

229
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,710
Master, please have mercy!

230
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,280
Senior.

231
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Do you regret

232
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,950
coming this far?

233
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,550
I'm a prisoner.

234
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,310
I have nothing to say.

235
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,950
I didn't expect you

236
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,190
to call me senior.

237
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,070
The law comes first.

238
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,590
But we have a personal relationship.

239
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,830
Don't try to lecture me.

240
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,710
If you are not from a famous family,

241
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,240
how could you learn from our master

242
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,470
at a young age,

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,550
be appreciated by Prince Ying,

244
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,240
and be recommended to the Emperor?

245
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,280
You've always been better than me.

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,760
Now, you don't care that I'm your senior brother

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,880
and go after me.

248
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,240
You're

249
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,000
ungrateful.

250
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,670
I am ungrateful?

251
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,240
Prince Tan appreciated you.

252
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,640
But you left him and went to Prince Ying.

253
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,400
You succeeded easily

254
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,550
and gained the trust of Prince Ying.

255
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,550
How did you do it?

256
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,670
Switching sides is a taboo in life.

257
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,520
Why does Prince Ying trust you?

258
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,590
A wise man chooses a good master to serve.

259
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,640
Don't ask me about it.

260
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,000
You can

261
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,240
ask Prince Ying.

262
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
Looks like

263
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,880
you don't want to be honest with me.

264
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,430
Say no more.

265
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,400
In your current position,

266
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,880
you can't convict me.

267
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,160
If you want to convict me,

268
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,400
we'll talk about it when we get to Chang'an.

269
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,040
I can't convict you.

270
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,000
But Qin Mu, Bai Niao, and Cui Shijiu

271
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,040
have made a confession.

272
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,040
They have presented all the evidence.

273
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,950
I have written to the Emperor

274
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,190
to explain the situation.

275
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,710
Prince Ying can't do anything about it.

276
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,190
Senior.

277
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,950
Can you still be so calm

278
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,240
when you get to the Court of Judicial Review?

279
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
Jinran.

280
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,240
Jinran.

281
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,550
Jinran.

282
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,040
Jinran, don't go.

283
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,120
Please help me, Jinran.

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,710
I beg you on my knees.

285
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,310
Think about our master.

286
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,190
If he knows

287
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,950
we are against each other,

288
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,190
he will be upset.

289
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,070
Think about our master.

290
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,430
Jinran.

291
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,670
Jinran.

292
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,120
Jinran.

293
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,280
Jinran!

294
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,880
I know one thing

295
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,190
from sixteen years ago.

296
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,520
Yan's Trading Convoy.

297
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,190
Black Dragon Bandits.

298
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,470
Yan's Trading Convoy?

299
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,790
It was a long time ago.

300
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,000
It doesn't make any sense to mention it.

301
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,430
No one brings it up

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,830
because it's not the right time.

303
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,430
Then we'll die together!

304
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,740
[Zhang Jinran is going after the old case]

305
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:21,380
[Baicaojing House]

306
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,880
Mu.

307
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,430
Am I beautiful?

308
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,510
I won the top beauty title again.

309
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,320
I'll make a lot of money

310
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,190
to open a branch for you.

311
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,920
I'll find you a wife.

312
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,560
She's been like this since she got out of jail.

313
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,800
She's crazy.

314
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
She doesn't recognize people.

315
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,710
We don't let her out

316
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,470
because we're afraid someone will mess with her.

317
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,990
We can only lock her in the room.

318
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,320
I'm still the Top Beauty.

319
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,750
Qin Mu is ruthless.

320
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,710
Look at his sister.

321
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,030
He doesn't even care about her.

322
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,430
Get a loyal servant to take care of her.

323
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,190
Duckweed Society will pay for it.

324
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,320
Ms. Su.

325
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,560
She tried to destroy you.

326
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,270
But you want to take care of her.

327
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,270
Yeah.

328
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,080
I thank you for Lady Bai.

329
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,600
Have children...

330
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,600
This is

331
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,920
her punishment.

332
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,510
The one who should be punished

333
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,640
should not have gone far.

334
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,780
Hurry.

335
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,130
Go.

336
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,490
Stop.

337
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,860
Gadgets. Have a look.

338
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,890
Have a look.

339
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,560
Don't run!

340
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,540
- What? - Stop!

341
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,230
What do you want?

342
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:37,800
You...

343
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,710
Get him back!

344
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,880
Don't move!

345
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,080
What do you want to do?

346
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:42,920
Beat him!

347
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,690
What do you want?

348
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,560
I'll kill you!

349
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,030
- I'll kill you! - Help!

350
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,560
Beat him!

351
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,500
Beat him!

352
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,060
You're ruthless!

353
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,400
Out of the way!

354
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,560
Give it to me!

355
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,360
It's robbery.

356
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,750
I'll go to the officer!

357
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,030
Robbery?

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
We are just taking back what belongs to Lady Bai.

359
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,430
What's wrong with you?

360
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,160
She tried to destroy you.

361
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,360
Lady Bai will take her punishment.

362
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,120
You're scum.

363
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,400
You're ruthless to your sister.

364
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:26,880
You deserve to die!

365
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,800
Miss.

366
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,160
Miss, please leave something for me.

367
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,320
Leave something for me.

368
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,430
- Otherwise, how will I... - Go on beating him!

369
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,850
Die!

370
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,130
Help!

371
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,190
Help!

372
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,880
I'll kill you!

373
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,600
You're ruthless!

374
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,750
It's time to eat.

375
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,710
It's time to eat. Come on.

376
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,670
It's time to eat.

377
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:15,750
What do you want?

378
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,470
Get down.

379
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,270

00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,840
Recuperate at Zhenlang Pavilion.

566
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,670
[Qin's Glass Workshop]
Look, Yingtao.

567
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,990
It's beautiful.

568
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:25,560
The glassware I made in the past

569
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,230
was old-fashioned.

570
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,160
Mr. Qin, you have the best skills

571
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,270
in Yangzhou.

572
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,510
Only you can make my design

573
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,320
come to fruition.

574
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,360
It will be the first batch of glassware

575
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,360
made by Clear Mind.

576
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,210
I want it to impress everyone

577
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,320
and be the best glassware in Yangzhou.

578
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,640
Can we do it?

579
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,470
Of course.

580
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,880
Why not?

581
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,600
As long as you hang in there, there will be a turnaround.

582
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,920
People should live

583
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,120
with expectations.

584
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,670
You can be a thief all the time.

585
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,190
But you can't guard against thieves all the time.

586
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,510
The Zheng family is strong.

587
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,120
You'll be busy dealing

588
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,270
with their means.

589
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,230
They will destroy you.

590
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,270
I'm old.

591
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,080
I can't handle it.

592
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,430
I don't have the energy

593
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,190
and the mood.

594
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,430
Mr. Qin.

595
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,030
They are evil.

596
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,640
They bullied you before.

597
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,710
Now, they are bullying Ms. Su.

598
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,710
Who knows

599
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,840
who they will bully later?

600
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,990
It is not easy for Yangzhou

601
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,880
to prosper.

602
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,230
But it's easy

603
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,640
to ruin it.

604
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,270
We can't handle it.

605
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,880
You're right. We are normal

606
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,710
and weak.

607
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,160
We need to stick together.

608
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,030
The Cui family and the Zheng family

609
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,360
have been in jewelry industry for years.

610
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,360
When they're good, we're good.

611
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,950
When they're not good, we're not good.

612
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,800
Why?

613
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,080
They are industry leaders.

614
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,750
But they bully us.

615
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,600
We must work together

616
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,710
to fight them.

617
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,120
Mr. Qin.

618
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,880
I know we are weak.

619
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
We can't beat them.

620
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,160
I promise you

621
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,600
that if you join Clear Mind,

622
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,510
I will do everything to protect you,

623
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,030
so you don't have to be as scared as before.

624
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:29,990
Trust me.

625
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,080
I'm old.

626
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,920
I don't want to get into trouble again.

627
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,800
They will torture you.

628
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,230
I've been scared

629
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,880
all these years.

630
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,560
Father.

631
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,190
Mr. Qin.

632
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,400
I understand.

633
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,320
Mr. Qin.

634
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,070
I'm sorry to bother you these days.

635
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,030
Thank you.

636
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,150
I'll give you

637
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,360
the money.

638
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,470
Don't worry.

639
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,680
Thank you.

640
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,920
My name was not Su Muzhe.

641
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,760
Mr. Qin.

642
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,950
You can call me Duanwu.

643
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,510
I was a pearl diver in Hepu.

644
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,150
I went through a lot to get here.

645
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,680
I've known since I was a kid

646
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,630
that people make things happen.

647
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,590
You do it,

648
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,630
so you make it.

649
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,590
Maybe I'm stubborn.

650
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,990
Even if it's a dead end,

651
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,400
I will try to find a way

652
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,630
out of it.

653
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,800
If I hadn't tried,

654
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,150
I wouldn't have come this far.

655
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,590
I won't

656
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,470
depend on others.

657
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,510
I will

658
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,720
find my way by myself.

659
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,360
See you.

660
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,840
Wait.

661
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,110
This is a good place.

662
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,280
This is the perfect place for a glass workshop.

663
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:43,550
Let's tidy up this place.

664
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,030
Tidy it up, okay?

665
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,470
- Okay! - Okay!

666
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,550
Come on. Let's get to work.

667
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,540
Here. Duanwu.

668
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:52,340
Careful.

669
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,540
Careful. Let me.

670
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,920
Let me.

671
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,990
Probably...

672
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,280
Here.

673
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,920
Mr. Qin, look at this.

674
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
Here.

675
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,950
Here.

676
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,280
Supervisor Kang, give me a hand.

677
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,150
Let me.

678
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,150
Push.

679
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,200
Mr. Qin.

680
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:55,760
Mr. Qin.

681
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,990
How about it?

682
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,240
Ms. Su.

683
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,240
The kiln is good.

684
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,760
We can make glassware now.

685
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,280
Great.

686
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,240
- Great. - Great.

687
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,320
We made it.

688
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,880
Yunxiu, we can make glassware.

689
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,510
We made it.

690
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,720
That's great, father.

691
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,140
[Time is precious]

692
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,590
Mr. Wang.

693
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,030
Inspector Zhang.

694
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,550
I am here for Yangzhou Governor Xu Nanying's bribery case.

695
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,800
I was ordered to escort him back to Chang'an for trial.

696
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,510
You were ordered?

697
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,430
Mr. Wang.

698
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,590
You must have an imperial edict from the Metropolitan Secretariat.

699
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:43,880
Inspector Zhang.

700
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,430
You have written to impeach Xu Nanying.

701
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:52,680
But he's the governor of Yangzhou,

702
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,360
one of the highest officials in Southeast.

703
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,240
You've caused a lot of discussion

704
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,880
by arresting him in the Governor's Office.

705
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,320
Inspector Zhang, think about it.

706
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,430
I think

707
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,800
my impeachment

708
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,590
should have just gone to the Chancellery.

709
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,510
It shouldn't have been forwarded yet.

710
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,550
Mr. Wang.

711
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:17,720
How did you know I impeached Xu Nanying?

712
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,720
You have to know

713
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,990
that if the Chancellery leaks it out,

714
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,920
you'll be guilty of a crime.

715
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:26,550
Well.

716
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,840
If you have an imperial edict from the Metropolitan Secretariat,

717
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,990
I'll do as you say.

718
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,320
If it's just the Court of Judicial Review,

719
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,760
you'd better leave.

720
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,720
The Court of Judicial Review

721
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:42,630
and I, the Inspector of Huainandao, don't belong to the same department.

722
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,360
You!

723
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,760
Inspector Zhang.

724
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:48,720
What is it?

725
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,200
Inspector Zhang.

726
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,920
Mr. Xu doesn't feel good.

727
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,950
I didn't dare to make a decision.

728
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,430
Please go there and have a look.

729
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,150
Physician Lin, how is he?

730
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,150
His pulse is disturbed.

731
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,760
Give me some more time.

732
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,840
Can I take him back to Chang'an immediately?

733
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,840
I don't think so.

734
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,760
He could die on the road.

735
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,400
No!

736
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,170
I must

737
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,470
take Mr. Xu to Chang'an immediately.

738
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,280
Mr. Wang.

739
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,510
Are you taking Mr. Xu back for interrogation?

740
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,110
Or do you want him to die halfway?

741
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,890
Zhang Jinran!

742
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,920
I'm telling you.

743
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,070
If he dies in your prison,

744
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,240
can you afford it?

745
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,070
Mr. Xu.

746
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,430
Mr. Xu.

747
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,280
Can you hold on

748
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,720
and go back to Chang'an with me?

749
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,030
Mr. Xu.

750
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,400
Mr. Xu.

751
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,400
Mr. Wang.

752
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,280
He's seriously ill.

753
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,240
You'd better talk about it later.
