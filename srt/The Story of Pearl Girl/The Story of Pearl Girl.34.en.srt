[Episode 34]

12
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,680
Mr. Yan. Ms. Su.

13
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,280
It's a pity.

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
Your beryl stones are beautiful.

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,950
But no design is worth mentioning

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,680
in front of the beryl of this quality.

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,510
It's nature's design.

18
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,480
It's unparalleled.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,790
Ms. Su.

20
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,280
I'll work with you.

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,310
Clear Mind's designs

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,790
are best in Yangzhou.

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
I'll keep that in mind.

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,680
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,310
Clear Mind will do its best.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,520
The beryl stone he showed us...

27
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,310
It was the one that the Black Dragon Bandits robbed

28
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,030
from the Yan's Trading Convoy.

29
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,630
It's the only one in the world.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
It was supposed to be sent to the palace.

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,190
But Cui Shijiu tore it apart.

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,870
It's a waste of treasure.

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,910
The Zheng family started selling the stolen goods.

34
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,280
Even if they use the stolen goods,

35
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,560
they can't fill Mr. Kang's order.

36
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,190
Zheng Shiyuan will buy beryl stones

37
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,120
from other shops in the guild.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,520
In that case,

39
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,750
the beryl stones you bought at a high price are useless.

40
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,360
We've been pressing it for a long time.

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,000
It's time.

42
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,030
Let's do it

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,710
in the name of Clear Mind.

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
What do you want to do?

45
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,750
All you care about is making money.

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,430
You're so greedy.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,280
Now that you're making money,

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,080
you pay for this.

49
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,710
Sir, is it ready?

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,310
Yeah.

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,910
Miss Su, here's your wonton.

52
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:37,710
Thank you.

53
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,430
Have a taste.

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,080
He called you Miss Su.

55
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,280
Have you been here a lot?

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,240
When I first arrived in Yangzhou, I often came here.

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,680
At that time, you...

58
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,310
I always thought

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,280
the living were more important.

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,600
Just like the road ahead

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,000
is more important than the road you came.

62
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,190
Maybe your eight years on the pearl farm

63
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,480
made you yearn for freedom

64
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,720
and a big world.

65
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,630
It also makes you who you are now.

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Maybe.

67
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,390
Is it delicious?

68
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:53,920
It's okay.

69
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,360
Mr. Kang.

70
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,190
Zijing.

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,510
My good friend.

72
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
Thank you for this time.

73
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Have a seat. Let's drink.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,480
Have a seat.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,830
Cheers.

76
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,480
About beryl stones,

77
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,720
thank you for your help.

78
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,750
Here's to you.

79
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,750
I'm a businessman.

80
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,270
I won't miss any opportunity

81
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,800
to make money.

82
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,240
There have always been wars in the Western Regions.

83
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,430
I can't get the goods out.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,240
Besides, I do need beryl stones.

85
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,070
Zijing.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
Why did you do this?

87
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,680
The price of beryl stones in Yangzhou has risen.

88
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,720
You should have lost a lot of money.

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,310
Yes.

90
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,950
But my purpose is different from yours.

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
Are you against the Zheng family?

92
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,480
Not only that,

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,830
but I want to suppress

94
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,950
and destroy the Zheng family.

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,680
Is Ms. Su of Clear Mind also involved?

96
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,120
She offered to be a part of it.

97
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,560
This will make the Zheng family more convinced.

98
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,120
You must have something to do with Ms. Su.

99
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,070
The relationship between us

100
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,160
is complicated.

101
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,240
Zijing, I've known you for so many years.

102
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,720
It's the first time I've seen you like this.

103
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,800
Please don't laugh at me.

104
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,920
Forget it. Let's drink.

105
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,360
Cheers.

106
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,800
Let's drink it away.

107
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,270
Okay.

108
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,270
I want to thank you again

109
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,870
for your help.

110
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,510
I'll remember it.

111
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,950
We are friends.

112
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,040
We helped each other

113
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,390
when we did business in the West Regions.

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,830
We broke out from the pack.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
That's how we got to where we are today.

116
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,510
We helped each other.

117
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,190
When you come back to Kang,

118
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,070
I'll treat you with nice wine and food.

119
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,950
That's a deal.

120
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,750
Cheers.

121
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:57,680
Let's eat.

122
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,070
Come.

123
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,600
Father, Cui Shijiu closed the deal.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,040
We wanted to stall with Kang Ming

125
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,680
to discuss the price.

126
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,870
Unexpectedly, Su Muzhe suddenly jumped into the deal.

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,070
We could only close the deal.

128
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,310
It's Clear Mind again.

129
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,070
She sells shattered glass.

130
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,310
Isn't she self-aware?

131
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,750
Never mind.

132
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,160
We want a long-term collaboration with Kang Ming.

133
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,630
Well.

134
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,750
How's Cui Shijiu doing with the jewelry?

135
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,510
We've broken up all the goods.

136
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,670
We only have three hu of beryl stones.

137
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,960
It can't fill

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Kang Ming's order.

139
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,080
Its price is too high in the market.

140
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
What do you think we should do?

141
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,960
There are many merchants in the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild.

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,910
They must have hoarded beryl stones.

143
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's buy it at the original price.

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
You have made progress.

145
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm worried that they're greedy

146
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,960
and won't sell it as they see that it's profitable.

147
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,790
Father, you have to do it yourself.

148
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,840
I should teach them a lesson.

149
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,320
Otherwise,

150
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,510
they will forget

151
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,670
who the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild belongs to.

152
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,750
Arrange for the signing of the contract as soon as possible.

153
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,440
We'll be safe after we sell those goods.

154
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,510
Yes.

155
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,480
After completing the business with Kang Ming,

156
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,030
remember to get rid of Cui Shijiu.

157
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,750
Father,

158
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,630
Shijiu closed this business.

159
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:43,840
She made a contribution to us.

160
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,910
Since she closed it,

161
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,600
give her a dignified death.

162
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,320
Mother.

163
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,000
Are you feeling better?

164
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,440
I'm here every day

165
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,550
waiting for you to come back.

166
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,080
Mother.

167
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,550
Shijiu didn't mean it.

168
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you like her

169
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,440
that much?

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,670
Mother.

171
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,240
I never really loved a woman

172
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,600
growing up.

173
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,630
I never asked you for anything

174
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,390
growing up.

175
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,790
I beg you

176
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,150
to allow me

177
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,480
to stay with Cui Shijiu for the rest of my life.

178
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,870
Mother.

179
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,480
This is not my home.

180
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,200
It isn't your home, either.

181
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,080
The fame and fortune of Yangzhou Jewelry Guild

182
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,510
are not what I want.

183
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,200
I want to take you

184
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,360
to live a safe and secure life.

185
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,840
When I finish this,

186
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,200
everything will be different.

187
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,120
Wherever you are,

188
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,510
that's my home.

189
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,000
I will

190
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,550
stay with you every day, okay?

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,750
Okay.

192
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,270
Okay.

193
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,270
Mother.

194
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,080
Wait for me.

195
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,360
I'll wait for you.

196
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,460
[beryl stones jewelry drawing]

197
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,670
Your design is also exquisite.

198
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,790
But it's not as good as Ms. Su's.

199
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,150
For that beryl stones stone,

200
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,030
I would like to sign a contract with you.

201
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,030
Mr. Kang, you made the right choice.

202
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,670
Thank you.

203
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,600
I'll pay the deposit in time.

204
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,840
I look forward to your good news.

205
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,960
Mr. Kang, we'll do our best.

206
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,080
Mr. Zheng, what is it

207
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,150
about?

208
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,030
I'll be blunt.

209
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,750
Three years ago,

210
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,600
you spent three million mace on two hu of beryl stones.

211
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,360
I won't let you lose money.

212
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,720
I'll pay you ten percent more.

213
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,510
That is 3.3 million mace.

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,030
Here's a contract.

215
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,550
Well...

216
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,720
I've sold out

217
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,200
of those beryl stones.

218
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,030
Mr. Sun.

219
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,600
Mr. Zheng.

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,240
What about you?

221
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,120
I didn't have many of them.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,150
And I've sold them out.

223
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Who did you sell them to?

224
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I sold them to someone who paid the higher price.

225
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,360
Mr. Zhou.

226
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,960
Have you also sold yours out?

227
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,200
Looks like

228
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,390
you don't want to stay at the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild.

229
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,670
No, Mr. Zheng.

230
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,670
We didn't think much about it.

231
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,080
The beryl stones had a high price.

232
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,200
Our liquidity was tight.

233
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,240
And we needed money,

234
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,750
so we sold them.

235
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,030
Right, Mr. Huan?

236
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,840
Yes.

237
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,870
Right?

238
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,360
Yes.

239
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,080
All right.

240
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,440
Forget it.

241
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,630
I'd like to propose another toast.

242
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,670
Cheers.

243
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,360
Cheers.

244
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,080
Here's to you, Mr. Zheng.

245
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,790
I didn't expect

246
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,910
you to convince them.

247
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,840
I didn't convince them.

248
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:37,240
They wanted to earn more money.

249
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,030
We bought them at a high price.

250
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,120
What's there to be happy about?

251
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,150
Forget it.

252
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,510
I want the Zheng family to buy beryl stones from me.

253
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
I got what I wanted.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,360
In that case,

255
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,200
are you against me?

256
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,270
I also have a lot of beryl stones.

257
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,000
We'll see.

258
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,270
Okay.

259
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,960
Don't forget

260
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
I bought my beryl stones at a low price.

261
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,440
No matter what price you offer,

262
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,270
I can offer 30% less.

263
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,440
What do you use against me?

264
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,390
The Kang royal family likes Tang's styles.

265
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,510
Clear Mind is all about styles and production.

266
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,600
As a result,

267
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,600
it makes up for the price loss.

268
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,150
Will you

269
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,000
offer the Zheng family a low price?

270
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,870
I don't think so.

271
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,030
In that case,

272
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,670
you don't have any advantage.

273
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,630
Good for you.

274
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,510
You're becoming

275
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,110
more and more like a businesswoman.

276
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,480
I don't know

277
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,000
what Mr. Zheng is going to do.

278
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,070
Idiot.

279
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,070
I'm sorry, Father.

280
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,640
I didn't expect

281
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,160
the directors to rebel against us.

282
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,720
Those hateful men.

283
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,440
They are against me behind my back.

284
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,790
How dare they!

285
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,310
After this,

286
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,790
I will send people to deal with them one by one.

287
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:44,880
Father.

288
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
We just signed the contract with Kang Ming.

289
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,000
We haven't gotten all the beryl stones

290
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,790
he wants yet.

291
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,830
I'm afraid...

292
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,750
What?

293
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,160
We can only buy them at a high price.

294
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,510
You two, get out.

295
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,510
Yes, sir.

296
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,590
Wu, you know.

297
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,310
The Zheng family is different now.

298
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,790
The Zheng family

299
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,200
lost a lot of money on the Red Leaf Crown.

300
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,110
We can't come up

301
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,000
with the money.

302
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
When you get to my position,

303
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
you'll know my difficulties.

304
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,720
Father.

305
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
Look.

306
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,550
Can we embezzle

307
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,440
the membership fee?

308
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,680
I'm sorry, Father.

309
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,240
I shouldn't have said that.

310
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,790
I'll think about it.

311
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,110
Master, Clear Mind's Ms. Su wants to see you.

312
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,640
Su Muzhe?

313
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,110
Why did she come to me?

314
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,400
I'll stop her.

315
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,830
No need.

316
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,640
Send her in.

317
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:10,790
Yes, sir.

318
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,000
Mr. Wu.

319
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:37,000
Mr. Zheng, long time no see.

320
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,510
What do you want to see me about?

321
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,070
I came to congratulate Jubao House

322
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,960
for signing a contract with Mr. Kang.

323
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,270
I heard

324
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,160
that Jubao House needed some beryl stones.

325
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,720
Clear Mind has some.

326
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,590
I'd like to offer them to you.

327
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,750
Su Muzhe, you're buying beryl stones.

328
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't say that.

329
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,270
Mr. Zheng is busy.

330
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,790
I want to help him.

331
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,720
You made it sound harsh.

332
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:04,790
No need.

333
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,790
Jubao House has channels to get them.

334
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,310
Ms. Su, you bought beryl stones at a high price.

335
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm afraid Clear Mind's liquidity is tight.

336
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,480
Worry about yourself.

337
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,240
You're right.

338
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,880
I thought too much.

339
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,350
Mr. Zheng.

340
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,240
I think

341
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,110
only Clear Mind

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,200
can help you.

343
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,750
Excuse me.

344
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,750
Ms. Su, wait.

345
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,400
Let's sit down and talk.

346
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,750
Ms. Su.

347
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:45,830
Please.

348
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,550
Wu, serve tea.

349
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,830
Father...

350
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,000
Mr. Wu.

351
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,960
Don't make it too hot.

352
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,070
Here, Ms. Su.

353
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,070
The temperature is good. Enjoy it, Ms. Su.

354
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,510
Mr. Wu.

355
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,240
The price of beryl stones has risen

356
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,350
in Yangzhou.

357
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,350
Everyone is expecting it

358
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,510
to go up.

359
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,030
But most of the beryl stones

360
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,110
are concentrated in the hands of a few people.

361
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,720
No, in my hands.

362
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,880
Mr. Kang

363
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,880
bought them from north to south. But he didn't get many of them.

364
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,400
If you want to buy them from Guangzhou,

365
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,400
it will take you more than a month to ship them.

366
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,640
If Jubao House can't deliver them in time,

367
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,160
Clear Mind can complete the deal

368
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
for Jubao House.

369
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,680
You just reminded me.

370
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,790
Clear Mind's liquidity

371
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,350
is tight.

372
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,480
But our shop is small.

373
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,720
I can get through it by closing the shop for a month

374
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,070
with those beryl stones in my hands.

375
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,070
I don't need to worry about it.

376
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,790
Ms. Su.

377
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,480
Name your price.

378
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,550
We both open jewelry shops in Yangzhou.

379
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,030
We should help each other.

380
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,480
We shouldn't fight each other.

381
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,750
About the price,

382
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,110
you think about it.

383
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,270
I believe

384
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,480
you will offer me a satisfactory price.

385
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,880
I'll wait for you at Clear Mind.

386
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:49,920
Excuse me.

387
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Father.

388
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,440
Although Su Muzhe asked for a high price,

389
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,750
we won't lose everything.

390
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,440
It's better than paying Kang Ming a huge indemnity.

391
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
What's wrong?

392
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,550
I'm sorry, Father.

393
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,830
It slipped out of my hands.

394
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,030
You startled me.

395
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,590
I thought Mr. Zheng was angry.

396
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,920
As long as it's okay.

397
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,440
As long as you're all right.

398
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,110
Shijiu.

399
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,790
Shijiu.

400
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,200
Why did you come back so late?

401
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,680
What did your father say?

402
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,480
Wu.

403
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,110
What did your father say?

404
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,480
The directors

405
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,920
sold the beryl stones to Clear Mind.

406
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,270
My father was furious.

407
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,920
But the delivery date is approaching.

408
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,640
We have to buy them

409
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,240
from Su Muzhe.

410
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,030
It's Su Muzhe again.

411
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,070
I didn't expect to be set up by her.

412
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,240
It doesn't matter.

413
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,350
I don't care about it.

414
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,790
When I finish this batch of beryl stones,

415
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,920
I don't want to do this anymore.

416
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,640
I want to run the Zhenlang Pavilion well.

417
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm afraid you can't.

418
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:53,680
Why?

419
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,240
It's dangerous for us to do this.

420
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,720
We'll be exposed sooner or later.

421
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,000
I know.

422
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,790
Shijiu.

423
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,240
Leave Yangzhou with me.

424
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,680
Leave Yangzhou?

425
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,960
After we deliver this batch of beryl stones,

426
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,310
let's leave here

427
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,350
with Kang Ming's payment.

428
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,880
Here's the official seal of Jubao House.

429
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,790
Are you crazy?

430
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,720
What happened?

431
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,830
After we complete this deal,

432
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,440
my father will kill you.

433
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,880
You will end up like Lady Huan.

434
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,240
Do you want Zhenlang Pavilion,

435
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,070
or do you want to live?

436
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,590
Garuda is ready.

437
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,270
Shijiu.

438
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,880
Leave with me.

439
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,720
Mr. Wu, there are officers outside.

440
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,550
Hurry.

441
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,510
Hurry. Leave with Lady Shijiu.

442
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,960
Lady Shijiu.

443
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,200
What's wrong with you? Take her away.

444
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,880
Lady Shijiu.

445
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,030
Hurry!

446
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,070
There!

447
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,550
Stop!

448
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,350
Go!

449
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,550
No. He's still there!

450
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,440
Mr. Wu asked me

451
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,680
to protect you no matter what happens.

452
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,310
Let's go!

453
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,070
No! I want to wait for him.

454
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,200
Zheng Zhiheng, you can't escape!

455
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:24,960
Chase him!

456
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,200
Don't run!

457
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,440
Chase him!

458
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,350
Stop!

459
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,880
Mr. Wu!

460
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,110
Let's go!

461
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,880
Go!

462
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:37,310
Hurry!

463
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,270
Stop!

464
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,200
Garuda!

465
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,640
Garuda!

466
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
Take these stolen goods back to the Grand Governor's Office.

467
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,680
The rest of you, search for them.

468
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,550
Yes, sir.

469
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,030
Sir, no one was in the carriage.

470
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,240
Inspector Zhang ordered us

471
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
to close the city gates!

472
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,160
The rest of you, search for them!

473
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,000
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

474
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,750
Come with me!

475
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,350
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

476
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,460
[Clear Mind]

477
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,510
Why are you drinking during the day?

478
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,400
What are you thinking about?

479
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,510
Mr. Zhang went to catch them.

480
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,590
What's the point of living

481
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,240
if I can't drink?

482
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,240
Drink tea then.

483
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,750
I'm thirsty.

484
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,110
Did you catch them?

485
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,680
They must still be in the city.

486
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,310
We have to find him before Zheng Shiyuan does.

487
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,680
What makes you so sure

488
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,270
he will testify against Zheng Shiyuan?

489
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,880
After Zheng Zhixing's death,

490
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,400
Zheng Wu wanted to leave Zheng Shiyuan.

491
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,880
I've sent Kang Ju to search.

492
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,720
But if you need anything,

493
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,510
you can ask Kang Ju.

494
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,550
Okay. I'll ask him if I need him.

495
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,790
Zheng Shiyuan is going

496
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,480
to deliver Kang Ming's order in a few days.

497
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,310
Zheng Shiyuan is like this now.

498
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,030
I'm afraid he can't deliver it.

499
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,680
Are you thinking about that?

500
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,640
Kang Ming is a businessman.

501
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,160
It's better.

502
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,680
Businessmen talk business. I can talk to him about business.

503
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,200
You have sold your beryl stones

504
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,790
to Zheng Shiyuan.

505
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,400
What do you do business with him?

506
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,920
Don't play dumb.

507
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,720
You have beryl stones.

508
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,440
Lend them to me.

509
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,200
I can lend them to you.

510
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,830
But I need to ask you for interest.

511
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,350
Interest is not a problem.

512
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,310
I'll pay for her.

513
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,070
What does it have to do with you?

514
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,550
I'm richer than you.

515
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,510
Mr. Yan, you know my economic strength.

516
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,750
Name the price.

517
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,440
Childish.

518
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,790
Since you are so generous,

519
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,480
I'll charge you

520
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,550
ten times the interest.

521
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,350
Ten times?

522
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,750
I have two gold leaves

523
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,070
in my book.

524
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,720
I think a gold leaf is worth a hundred times the interest.

525
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,030
Thank you for your gold leaf, Mr. Zhang.

526
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,830
You're welcome.

527
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,680
Okay.

528
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,680
Get down.

529
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,480
Get down.

530
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,400
There's somebody out there.

531
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,890
- Garuda was arrested. - Go over there.

532
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:58,780
- What do we do? - Search.

533
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,270
Why are there so many officers all of a sudden?

534
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,550
What do we do?

535
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,000
Shijiu.

536
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,400
What do we do?

537
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,030
Shijiu.

538
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,830
Listen to me. It's safe here.

539
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,720
Let's take a rest here.

540
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,550
You can go back

541
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,590
in the evening.

542
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,920
Where do I go back?

543
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,270
I can't go back.

544
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,920
When I go out, I'm bound to get caught.

545
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,550
- I can't go back. - No.

546
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,960
You can go back.

547
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,070
After dark,

548
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
you go to Zhang Jinran

549
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,590
and blame me for everything.

550
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,680
Tell him

551
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,070
you don't know anything.

552
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,200
You'll be fine.

553
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,510
He'll believe you.

554
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,350
I took the beryl stone down.

555
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,160
I signed the contract.

556
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,880
Even if I can put the blame on you,

557
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,000
will your father

558
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,070
leave me alone?

559
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,790
I have nowhere to go.

560
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,630
There's another way.

561
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,760
We leave Yangzhou.

562
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,510
How?

563
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,030
Right.

564
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,840
City gates can only be closed for up to three days.

565
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,190
If we can get away with it for three days,

566
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,440
we'll pick up my other

567
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,190
and take beryl stones to leave Yangzhou.

568
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,670
Yeah, we still have a chance.

569
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,190
Do you want to give it a try?

570
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,360
[Grand Governor's Office]

571
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,070
Zhang Jinran.

572
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,070
Where is Zhang Jinran? Get out of here.

573
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,230
[Time is precious]

574
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,760
Who asked you to close the city gates?

575
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,800
It's outrageous.

576
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,710
I'll impeach you.

577
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,480
Mr. Wang.

578
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,920
I'm the Inspector of Huainandao.

579
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,590
I have the right to make decisions.

580
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:02,800
But you can't ignore the people.

581
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,960
How can people do business and live

582
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,000
when you close the city gates?

583
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,670
Why are you going through all this trouble

584
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:10,920
to catch Zheng Wu?

585
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,880
Mr. Wang.

586
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,630
Zheng Wu harbors and sells stolen goods.

587
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,400
The stolen goods are in his mansion.

588
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,920
I have to arrest him.

589
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,480
Impeach me as you will.

590
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,510
I have work to do. Excuse me.

591
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:34,660
[Time is precious]

592
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,590
Master, please save Wu.

593
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,670
Master.

594
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,360
The whole city is on lockdown to catch him.

595
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,440
How can I save him?

596
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,000
What can I do to save him?

597
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,920
He's my only son.

598
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,280
What a cheek.

599
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,480
Your son

600
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,800
betrayed me and the Zheng family for a woman.

601
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,670
I wish I could kill him myself.

602
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,230
You can't do that.

603
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,630
He's your son, too.

604
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,190
He's also your only son.

605
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,070
Stop crying!

606
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,960
Master.

607
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,280
What is it?

608
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,280
Master, here's a letter for you.

609
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,760
Is it Wu?

610
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,480
Get out of here.

611
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,340
[I'm coming to you. Don't act rashly]

612
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,280
Master, there's one more thing.

613
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,190
Su Muzhe is here.

614
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,710
Su Muzhe?

615
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,440
Yes.

616
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,440
Master.

617
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,070
Wu.

618
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,670
My dear son.

619
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,030
Master, slow down.

620
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,070
Get out.

621
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,960
Yes, sir.

622
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,280
Su Muzhe.

623
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,150
What are you doing here?

624
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,320
Drop the act. What do you want to say?

625
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
I heard

626
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,360
Jubao House can't deliver the beryl stones

627
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,630
Mr. Kang ordered.

628
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,320
I'm here to help you.

629
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,550
Do you want me

630
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,110
to thank you?

631
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,110
No need.

632
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,550
However,

633
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:39,230
it took me a lot of effort

634
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,440
to deliver them.

635
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,110
Ms. Su, what are you doing?

636
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,550
Jubao House can't deliver the beryl stones.

637
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,960
I want to deliver them for him.

638
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,510
Mr. Kang, please transfer the contract to me.

639
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,920
The Zheng family can't deliver the beryl stones.

640
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,070
It's a hot potato.

641
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,360
If you push them hard,

642
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,670
I'm afraid...

643
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,030
I'll consume them.

644
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,320
As your friend, I have to remind you

645
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,880
that it's dangerous.

646
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,150
But as a businessman,

647
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,960
it's hard for me to refuse your request.

648
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,550
Jubao House couldn't deliver the beryl stones.

649
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,510
Clear Mind delivered them for you.

650
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,320
In other words,

651
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,920
from this day forward,

652
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,400
I am your creditor.

653
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,880
[Clear Mind has delivered the beryl stones to Kang Ming]

654
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,880
[The beryl stones Jubao House failed to deliver]

655
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,780
[will be recovered by Su Muzhe of Clear Mind]

656
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,920
Mr. Zheng, you're so rude.

657
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,110
You tore up the contract.

658
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,400
I'm telling you.

659
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,800
The government has a copy of the contract.

660
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,960
It's useless for you to tear it off!

661
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,400
Mr. Zheng,

662
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,110
you didn't pay us back, and you tore off the contract.

663
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,670
No one in Yangzhou will cooperate with you anymore.

664
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,630
Su Muzhe.

665
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,320
I don't care if my creditor is you or Kang Ming.

666
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,550
I signed the contract.

667
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,760
I'll deliver the goods.

668
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,670
Tomorrow is delivery day.

669
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,670
If you can't deliver the goods tomorrow,

670
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,760
you'll have to pay three times the compensation.

671
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,480
Three times.

672
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,630
Three times...

673
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,280
I can accept it.

674
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,320
Ms. Su.

675
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,710
Ms. Su.

676
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,000
What do you want?

677
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,710
It's not what I want.

678
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,590
It's what you owe me

679
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,880
for what you've done all these years.

680
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,760
Jubao House has give shops in Yangzhou.

681
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,150
I'll ask you

682
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,960
for three shops.

683
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,400
It's not too much.

684
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,400
Su Muzhe, you...

685
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,030

Officers have just searched here.

We're safe here for the time being.

735
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,190
When we get out of Yangzhou,

736
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,590
everything will be fine.

Okay. Stay out of this.
