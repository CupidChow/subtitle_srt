[Episode 21]

12
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,400
Duanwu.

13
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,400
I wonder if your lady likes gold accessories.

14
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,150
If she does,

15
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,000
we could create a gold-inlaid jade piece,

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,590
a brand-new design.

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,480
But if you want it flawless,

18
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,280
that won't be possible.

19
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,510
My lady does like gold accessories.

20
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,280
As long as you can fix it,

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,070
adding some gold is no issue.

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,760
Are you sure you can fix it?

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
Fix it according to this design.

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,150
Duanwu, the heat's just right.

25
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:22,980
Good.

26
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,820
Be careful.

27
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,680
This clasp needs to be a bit smaller.

28
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,390
Right here, it must be smaller.

29
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,480
Fill in this seam.

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,350
Mm, okay.

31
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,200
Who's crowding around the Zheng' Mansion gate?

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,480
Oh, you're here, Jin Xian.

33
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,740
I specially invited the two of them

34
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,170
to repair Lady Yu's bracelet.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,390
Zheng family has their own Jubao House,

36
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,600
so why trouble outsiders?

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,320
Can't you get them to work?

38
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,630
With this spare time,

39
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,790
you should focus on your own household.

40
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,760
With such a sharp tongue,

41
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,230
you should go comfort your lady more often.

42
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,920
What nerve you have?

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,070
How dare you speak ill of our lady!

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,110
I didn't.

45
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,280
I advise you to tone down the arrogance.

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,630
The lady and concubines each have their place.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,510
We Zhengs aren't one of those unruly families.

48
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,320
All will be revealed in time.

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,950
What's with blocking the doorway?

50
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,070
Once you're done, leave quickly.

51
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,720
Bah!

52
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,320
Let's see how long your pride lasts!

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,040
Miss,

54
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,630
who was that just now?

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,720
What's it to you?

56
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,670
Go back to fixing the bracelet!

57
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,480
We've caused you trouble.

58
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,830
We're new here,

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
afraid we might break some taboos,

60
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,550
so we asked a bit more just because of that.

61
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
No harm in telling you.

62
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,600
She's the maid of the primary wife, Lady Cui.

63
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,640
Her name is Jin Xian.

64
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,310
The Cui family in Zhenlang Pavilion?

65
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,990
Who else would it be?

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,790
But now that the Cui family has fallen,

67
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,480
let's see how long her pride lasts.

68
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,990
What are you standing around for?

69
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,110
Get back to fixing that bracelet!

70
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,640
I've been waiting forever.

71
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,680
Almost done.

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,660
It's finished.

73
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,200
- Here you are, Miss Zhegu. - Miss, take a look.

74
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,260
Is it to your liking?

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,520
You do have some skill.

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,190
Thank you, Miss Zhegu.

77
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,870
How do you know my name?

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,230
I heard

79
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,840
that you're Lady Yu's most trusted aide,

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,990
and also quite beautiful.

81
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,040
Seeing you today,

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,640
you truly are extraordinary.

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,110
Miss, which pair of earrings did you fancy just now?

84
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:20,990
This one.

85
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,960
Our Miss does have an eye for these.

86
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,990
Miss Zhegu,

87
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,760
these earrings

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,310
are the finest we've ever made,

89
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,640
and they suit you perfectly.

90
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,750
Very well.

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,280
We heard that the Qionghua Festival is coming soon.

92
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Could you put in a good word for us?

93
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,330
Of course, we wouldn't dare

94
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,920
to aim for those famed songstresses,

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,530
but maybe their maids

96
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,140
could take a liking to our jewelry.

97
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,080
Don't push your luck too far.

98
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,550
We're only being bold

99
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,160
because you seem so kind.

100
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,640
It's our first time in Yangzhou,

101
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,600
and it hasn't been easy.

102
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Please say a few good words to Lady Yu

103
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,040
on our behalf.

104
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,870
Hey...

105
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,480
Thank you, Miss.

106
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,190
Alright.

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
You may leave for now.

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,520
I'll first report to Lady Yu.

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,480
Thank you, Miss.

110
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,990
My lady, look!

111
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,990
Those self-important old folks at Jubao House

112
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,640
can only make old-fashioned gold-inlaid jade.

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,110
This can't be their handiwork.

114
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,430
You have a sharp eye, my lady.

115
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,840
There are two girls at the back door,

116
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,640
specializing in selling and repairing jewelry.

117
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,670
They made this piece.

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,350
What did they charge?

119
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,310
They didn't ask for money.

120
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,040
They only wanted to use your name

121
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,350
to connect with some of the songstresses' maids,

122
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,080
so they could sell a few trinkets.

123
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,790
Clever plan, indeed.

124
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,040
At least they know their place.

125
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,600
Let's see what kind of people they are.

126
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,720
If they're decent, I'll place them in Jubao House

127
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,280
to be Fifth Young Master's eyes.

128
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,160
Those old ones won't dare act against him.

129
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,350
Smart thinking, my lady.

130
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,870
What's Fifth Young Master been up to lately?

131
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,080
Why haven't I seen him around?

132
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,600
I heard he's been with Lady Shijiu from the Cui family...

133
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,430
Enough of that!

134
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,720
He and Shijiu grew up together.

135
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,920
Remember,

136
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
they're like brother and sister.

137
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,110
The Cui family fell on hard times,

138
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,230
so he's just helping her out.

139
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,280
Understood.

140
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,720
Off you go.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,550
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,640
Oh, Fifth Young Master,

143
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,750
don't you dare do anything foolish.

144
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,870
Lady Shijiu,

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,160
look who's here.

146
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,240
Master Shijiu!

147
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,120
Lady Shijiu!

148
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,010
Tong!

149
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,400
Tan!

150
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,520
- Master Shijiu! - Lady Shijiu!

151
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,160
Tan!

152
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,830
Master Shijiu!

153
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,880
Lady Shijiu!

154
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,400
Master Shijiu!

155
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,000
Lady Shijiu!

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,640
Are you all right?

157
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,780
- I'm fine. - Are you all right?

158
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,710
Master Shijiu...

159
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,640
Lady Shijiu, forgive me!

160
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,120
Lady Shijiu!

161
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:00,900
Lady Shijiu!

162
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,880
Get up!

163
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,430
Forgive me, Lady Shijiu!

164
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,710
Those bandits were closing in on us.

165
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,660
Tan and I had no other choice

166
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,000
but to push you down.

167
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,790
I understand.

168
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,100
How...

169
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,520
How did you end up so badly?

170
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,120
Lady Shijiu, you don't know.

171
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,640
Those bandits wouldn't let up.

172
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,810
I ran for days,

173
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,590
finally got out of the forest and into town.

174
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,000
After that, I could only beg for food.

175
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,830
Fortunately...

176
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,670
Mr. Zheng saved us.

177
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,280
Master Shijiu, I've missed you deeply...

178
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,040
All right.

179
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,670
Tong and Tan must have gone days without food.

180
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,310
Let's get them something good to eat.

181
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,520
Clean yourselves up.

182
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,790
This courtyard is empty most of the time.

183
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,880
If you don't mind, you can stay here.

184
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,360
Garuda, arrange it.

185
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,280
Yes, sir.

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,950
Thank you.

187
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,550
We've been friends since we were kids.

188
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,710
No need for thanks.

189
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,470
It's getting late.

190
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,640
Get some rest.

191
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,620
Lady Shijiu...

192
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,400
Lady Shijiu...

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,640
Get up, quickly!

194
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,280
Lady Shijiu,

195
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,710
now that the master is gone,

196
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,830
what are we going to do?

197
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,000
You still have me.

198
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,430
We are always

199
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,400
in the same boat.

200
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,160
But I'll need you to help me with something.

201
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,470
Who is it?

202
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,520
Lady Shijiu...

203
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,670
You...

204
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,710
Lady Shijiu...

205
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,520
It's so late. You...

206
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,520
Master Shijiu,

207
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:01,950
I'm sorry.

208
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,470
I must avenge the Cui family,

209
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,830
no matter the cost.

210
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,950
Most of the jewelry shops in Yangzhou

211
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
are now under Zheng's control.

212
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,070
If we want to find an opening,

213
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,240
we must start with the Qionghua Festival.

214
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,760
If we stand out at the Qionghua Festival,

215
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,240
it'll bring a handsome profit.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,950
However,

217
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,670
all the famous songstresses in Yangzhou

218
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,550
have powerful backers.

219
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,790
Each of them is driven by self-interest.

220
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,710
No one can resist the lure of money.

221
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,240
Keep yesterday's jewelry for me.

222
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,790
I'll make use of it.

223
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,190
All right.

224
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,310
Miss, let me peel an orange for you.

225
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,400
Does this look nice?

226
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,880
I think the one you had earlier looked better.

227
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,550
Really?

228
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,710
It should be a bit greener.

229
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:06,830
It looks good.

230
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,310
But it doesn't quite match my outfit today.

231
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,120
Look at this color.

232
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,070
You haven't visited in so long.

233
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,550
Without your help,

234
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,070
Lady Bai can't pick jewelry she likes herself.

235
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,550
I've been so busy lately,

236
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,040
handling various matters.

237
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,590
Lady Yu, please, have a seat.

238
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,950
It's a rare pleasure to have you here at Baicaojing House.

239
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,040
Today, you must lend me your discerning eye.

240
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,310
Zhegu, stay nearby.

241
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,920
Yes, ma'am.

242
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,790
Why did she leave so quickly?

243
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,520
Surely Baicaojing House has some new treasures.

244
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,550
Greetings, Miss Zhegu.

245
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,520
As if we could afford anything here.

246
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,160
- Yours is quite lovely. - We'll just admire this one.

247
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,360
Let me try it on.

248
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,760
Miss, is there anything you like?

249
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,360
I feel what Zheng family gave me is enough.

250
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,710
I'll take this one.

251
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,160
Or maybe...

252
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,250
- This one is like Lady Bai's. - I'll buy it,

253
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:09,960
so you can wear it later.

254
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,600
- Then I want the pink one. - With my natural beauty, I don't even need it!

255
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,280
Look at them.

256
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,810
Baicaojing House's goods are simply the best.

257
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:14,780
Indeed.

258
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,190
Thank you, Miss Zhegu, for bringing us here today.

259
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,920
Miss,

260
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,240
look at our new mother-of-pearl jewelry,

261
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,520
Miss Zhegu's favorite.

262
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,240
So beautiful!

263
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,120
Such shallow taste,

264
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,470
you haven't seen quality things, I suppose.

265
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,240
Compared to Baicaojing House,

266
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
they're still far off.

267
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,190
Miss Zhegu,

268
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,880
who are they?

269
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,400
The one on the left is Yan Fenfen,

270
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,000
always second place.

271
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,950
Every day,

272
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,950
she's scheming to compete with Lady Bai.

273
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:05,640
The one with the flower in her hair

274
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,510
is Xue Liniang.

275
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,230
She's straightforward by nature,

276
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,800
and the youngest among the songstresses,

277
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,880
so naturally, she's rising fast.

278
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,950
So Xue Liniang should be in the top three, right?

279
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,470
Top three?

280
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,140
She only gained popularity this year,

281
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,360
not even ranked yet.

282
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,320
But this year, with the Zheng family backing her,

283
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,710
who knows who will win

284
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,120
the top beauty title?

285
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,840
Miss Zhegu, you're quite the expert.

286
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,120
Do you like these two?

287
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,840
Why hasn't Lady Yu come out yet?

288
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,360
Isn't the Zheng family supporting you this time?

289
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,030
Yes.

290
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,800
But why is she talking

291
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,160
with Lady Bai for so long?

292
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,510
Do you think something's changed?

293
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,880
How could that be?

294
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,750
Yesterday, they brought over the jewelry for me to choose from,

295
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,270
all top-notch pieces.

296
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,750
Liniang,

297
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,400
with the Zheng family behind you now,

298
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,120
Lady Yu

299
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,710
will surely give you some favor.

300
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,320
Still, you should be cautious.

301
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,920
Don't be too naive.

302
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,600
Otherwise, someone scheming

303
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,230
might steal your good fortune.

304
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,320
These jewels are indeed fine,

305
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,080
worthy of Lady Bai.

306
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,710
But why would I need to appraise them?

307
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,560
Please.

308
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,670
It's rare to have your esteemed presence.

309
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,990
A chance to chat with you

310
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,430
is worth more than a thousand clever tricks.

311
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,640
Absolutely.

312
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,560
Just listening from the side, I've learned a lot.

313
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,160
The Qionghua Festival is near.

314
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,600
In previous years, the guild lead hosted it personally.

315
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,600
I wonder if that's still the case this year?

316
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,710
Our master is humble and low-key,

317
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,190
unlike Mr. Cui, who loves the spotlight.

318
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,880
So,

319
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,320
all these bothersome matters fall on me.

320
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,430
I'm so busy.

321
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,430
No one would be more fitting to host it than you.

322
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,810
The people of Yangzhou

323
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,050
still admire your charm from back then.

324
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,240
Mr. Zheng just took the seat this year.

325
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,190
If you could help Jubao House produce a top beauty,

326
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,920
wouldn't it be perfect?

327
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,670
A cherry on top, even.

328
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,230
Speaking of the top beauty title,

329
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,360
Lady Bai has won it two years in a row.

330
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,400
This year, if your Zheng family joins forces

331
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,470
with my Baicaojing House,

332
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,190
why worry about winning three in a row?

333
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,470
How could I take the one Baicaojing House has backed?

334
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,710
What are you saying?

335
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,270
We're joining forces.

336
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,120
It's not poaching.

337
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,190
I appreciate your good intentions,

338
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,360
but the Zheng family's journey is just beginning.

339
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,190
If we're supporting someone, it'll be a younger talent.

340
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,030
Xue Liniang would be a fine choice.

341
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,430
Miss Xue is indeed promising.

342
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,270
But...

343
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,950
she's young and impulsive.

344
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,400
She may not handle big responsibilities well.

345
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,120
You have a keener eye than Mr. Zheng.

346
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,840
You're kidding!

347
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,320
How could I compare myself to the guild lead?

348
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,560
Backing one or two

349
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,120
makes no difference.

350
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,600
There's no conflict.

351
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,160
I heard

352
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,560
Miss Xue was recommended by Mr. Si.

353
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:48,950
Both Si and Wu are Zheng family men,

354
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,920
wholeheartedly for the Zheng family.

355
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,430
Of course.

356
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,360
Both are outstanding individuals,

357
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
trusted deeply by Mr. Zheng.

358
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,670
The Zheng family prospers

359
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,840
with capable heirs to follow.

360
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:13,190
Miss Zhegu,

361
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,430
may I ask if all the songstresses here today

362
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,840
are attending the Qionghua Festival?

363
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Of course, who do you think?

364
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,360
Only Lady Huan didn't show.

365
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,400
Lady Huan?

366
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,880
Why didn't she come?

367
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,400
With that pride of hers,

368
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,790
even if invited, she wouldn't come.

369
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,920
Maybe

370
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,030
she doesn't want to be a living sign for Baicaojing House.

371
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,270
With Lady Bai around,

372
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:42,200
who needs her as a sign?

373
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,880
She lost to Lady Bai two years ago,

374
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,310
and didn't even show up last year.

375
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,640
If she didn't come last year,

376
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,230
why come this year?

377
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,160
Who knows?

378
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,520
Maybe she's plotting something.

379
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,990
And you'd know, would you?

380
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,360
After all,

381
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,880
Lady Huan was once a famous songstress,

382
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,990
and now there's a tough rival.

383
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,080
Someone might lose sleep over it.

384
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,190
The Huan family relied on the Cui family for business.

385
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,600
Now that the Cui family has fallen,

386
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
what do they have to live on?

387
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,400
So, the Huan family will step back?

388
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,360
How come I didn't know?

389
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,950
With your humble family background, you know nothing.

390
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:14,360
I...

391
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,800
Miss Zhegu, born of a noble family,

392
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,270
you truly know more than the rest of us.

393
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,430
How are your preparations for the Qionghua Festival?

394
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,600
Have you practiced enough?

395
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,640
Lady Yu is here!

396
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,510
Lady Yu has arrived.

397
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,750
The Qionghua Festival is near.

398
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,560
All of you should practice diligently,

399
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
and don't indulge in comfort.

400
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,230
Only then will you honor the hardships of your training.

401
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,430
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,670
Miss Xue, mind your posture.

403
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,600
Learn more from Lady Bai.

404
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,840
If you don't perfect this dance,

405
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,430
the Zheng family can replace you at any time.

406
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,640
Our Zheng family supports only the best.

407
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,270
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,920
Zhegu.

409
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,670
Here!

410
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,080
Let's go.

411
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,990
Step aside.

412
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,840
Lady Bai, don't be angry.

413
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,750
I...

414
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,030
Su Muzhe greets Lady Bai.

415
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,320
This Su Muzhe came with Lady Yu.

416
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,950
Are you from the Zheng family?

417
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,320
To answer Lady Bai,

418
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,190
I am not from the Zheng family,

419
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,270
but our jewelry has caught

420
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,920
Lady Yu's eye,

421
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,080
which brought us here to Baicaojing House

422
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,360
for a visit.

423
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,470
Lady Yu is not easy to please.

424
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,560
What skill do you have to earn her favor?

425
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,470
Lady Bai, look.

426
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,710
The jewelry we crafted

427
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,950
is quite different from what's found in Yangzhou.

428
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,640
I've heard your pipa playing is famous far and wide,

429
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,840
but at the Qionghua Festival,

430
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,810
other songstresses play equally well.

431
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,160
If you wore

432
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,120
these mother-of-pearl press-on nails while playing,

433
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,840
you would surely shine at the festival.

434
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,230
Typically, mother-of-pearl

435
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,430
is used on dowries or large items.

436
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,190
But you defy convention,

437
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,670
using it on such a small press-on nail.

438
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,950
The craftsmanship is exquisite,

439
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,510
and the thought behind it is clever.

440
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,270
So, your response?

441
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,990
Lady Bai, if you wish to win the top beauty title,

442
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,710
Zhenlang Pavilion is willing to support you fully.

443
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,320
Zhenlang Pavilion?

444
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,950
Is it you

445
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,470
who's replacing the Cui family?

446
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,510
Exactly.

447
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:12,270
But hoping to win Yangzhou's top beauty title

448
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,230
with just ten press-on nails

449
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,750
is rather naive.

450
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,920
Consider this a token of introduction from Zhenlang Pavilion,

451
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
a small gesture.

452
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,490
Lady Bai...

453
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,950
Lady Bai, I'm awaiting your response.

454
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,640
Miss Su, while the mother-of-pearl is exquisite,

455
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,670
it still can't match Zhenlang Pavilion's influence.

456
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,120
Apologies.

457
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,880
Serve tea.

458
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,430
Master Yan, please, have a seat.

459
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,880
No need.

460
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,510
I want you to win the Qionghua Festival,

461
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,710
no matter the cost.

462
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,190
Certainly.

463
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,030
You're welcome to choose from any of Zhenlang Pavilion's jewels.

464
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,230
Thank you for your generosity, Master.

465
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:33,640
Master Yan,

466
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
I will do my utmost.

467
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,560
But I do have a small request.

468
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,400
I'm fond of Baicaojing House,

469
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
so I wonder if you could...

470
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,600
Of course.

471
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,640
I'll look after Baicaojing House.

472
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,800
After all,

473
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,710
it was founded by your younger brother.

474
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Master Yan...

475
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,430
Duanwu, how did it go?

476
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,080
Shall we look elsewhere?

477
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,030
I saw plenty of songstresses earlier.

478
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,840
Yunxiu,

479
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,320
do you recall them mentioning

480
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,470
Lady Huan?

481
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,950
Lady Huan?

482
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,290
Women are so short-sighted,

483
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,100
selling themselves out for a set of jewels.

484
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,710
You saw Lady Yu's attitude toward us.

485
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,800
There's no way she'd turn to our Baicaojing House.

486
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,080
I just don't understand it.

487
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,560
How is Xue Liniang any better than you?

488
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,710
If Lady Yu is out of reach,

489
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,320
let's aim for Zheng Wu instead.

490
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,670
After all, no cat can resist the fish.

491
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,640
Invite him out for drinks a few times,

492
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,670
then, once he's had enough, you...

493
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,320
What are you talking about?

494
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,640
I'm your elder sister!

495
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,320
Clearly, the older you get, the more sensitive you become.

496
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,270
I can work with Yan Zijing.

497
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,920
Even if he doesn't approach me,

498
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,230
I'll find a way to get close to him.

499
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,920
Why?

500
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,080
Don't ask. Just focus on managing Baicaojing House.

501
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,430
I will pave the way for you.

502
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,920
Fine, I'll do as you say.

503
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,840
Yan Zijing...

504
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,120
Madam, Mr. Zheng has arrived.

505
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,230
Mom.

506
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,950
You were looking for me?

507
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,840
You're never home.

508
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,360
Can't I call on you without reason?

509
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,800
Mom,

510
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,470
I brought you some honey jujube cakes.

511
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,670
They're from Yichun Teahouse.

512
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,080
Don't think I don't know

513
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,920
where you've been.

514
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,950
Yichun Teahouse is in the other courtyard.

515
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,120
What were you doing there?

516
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,920
Mom...

517
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,800
Stand straight!

518
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,160
Wipe that grin off your face.

519
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,810
Turn around.

520
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,570
I'm not a child anymore.

521
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,640
Cui Shijiu is the legitimate daughter of the Cui family.

522
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,670
Marrying her was a great advantage before.

523
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,570
But now that the Cui family has fallen,

524
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,840
she's nothing but a burden to you.

525
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,600
With the lady's influence waning,

526
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:34,640
this

527
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,360
is the perfect opportunity for us.

528
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,930
Or do you want to remain a concubine's son forever?

529
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,840
Don't forget,

530
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,800
the lady is Cui Shijiu's own aunt,

531
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,560
and Zheng Si is her cousin.

532
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,750
Be careful not to let this woman ruin you.

533
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,710
Mom, don't worry.

534
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,800
I know what I'm doing.

535
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,750
What were you doing last night? Didn't sleep well?

536
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,190
Tell me the truth.

537
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:11,120
I slept just fine, really.

538
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,990
The Qionghua Festival is approaching...

539
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,430
Here,

540
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,030
- have some tea, Mom. - Zheng Zhiheng, listen to me!

541
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,650
Be cautious with the Jubao House.

542
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,120
Watch out for Zheng Si's schemes behind your back.

543
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,270
By the way,

544
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,640
I recently found a suitable candidate,

545
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,990
quite skilled.

546
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,160
I'm planning to place her in Jubao House

547
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,640
as an informant for you,

548
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,320
so those old folks won't disrespect you.

549
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,030
Take some time to check her out.

550
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,400
If she has your approval,

551
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,840
her skills must be top-notch.

552
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,510
Sachets and pouches...

553
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:57,190
Move on.

554
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,080
Have a look!

555
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,360
Weren't they supposed to bring me jewelry?

556
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,190
Why haven't they arrived?

557
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:06,990
Are they playing me?

558
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,270
Who's playing you?

559
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,880
Mr. Zheng. No one.

560
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,400
Where did you get this?

561
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,600
It's...

562
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,880
it's from Miss Su.

563
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,270
Is she the craftsman my mom recently met?

564
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,430
It's her.

565
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,400
What's her name?

566
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,470
She's called Su Muzhe,

567
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,670
just a little peddler.

568
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,600
Where does she live?

569
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,180
[Yunsheng Inn]

570
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,080
Sir,

571
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,800
Su Muzhe isn't here.

572
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,030
They say she went on business.

573
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:05,800
Business?

574
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Quite capable.

575
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:13,950
Let's go.

576
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,230
Zheng Wu?

577
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,270
Yunxiu,

578
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,920
you should head back first.

579
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,120
All right.

580
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,800
So, you are Su Muzhe,

581
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,190
the little peddler

582
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,160
who dares to target my mother?

583
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,560
In Yangzhou,

584
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,880
it's my first time

585
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,160
waiting for someone like this.

586
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,190
Greetings, Mr. Zheng.

587
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,750
Had I known you were waiting,

588
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,430
I'd have returned sooner.

589
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,600
Every year,

590
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,190
countless people try to ally

591
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,320
with the Zheng family.

592
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,400
I've seen too many like you.

593
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,750
Well,

594
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,990
since my mother recommended you,

595
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,230
there's an opening in Jubao House.

596
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,750
Let's see what you're capable of.

597
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,230
Thank Lady Yu for the opportunity,

598
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,710
and thank you for the recognition.

599
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,320
But with the Qionghua Festival near,

600
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,800
I ask you to return in a month,

601
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,990
by then you will certainly offer

602
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,920
a higher bid.

603
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:18,400
The Qionghua Festival has always been the domain of the jewelry families.

604
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,680
You,

605
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,280
a newcomer peddler in Yangzhou,

606
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,680
what can you pull off?

607
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,680
What can I pull off?

608
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,240
Just wait and see.

609
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:36,510
Fine!

610
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,680
Let's wait and see.

611
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,990
Lady Huan, come down!

612
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,110
Lady Huan!

613
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,880
Be careful!

614
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,550
Lady Huan...

615
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,650
Look.

616
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,400
Be careful!

617
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,840
- Please come down... - Who is that?

618
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,760
That's Lady Huan.

619
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,950
- What if you fall into the water? - She acts like that every day.

620
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,110
Lady Huan...

621
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,400
These songstresses,

622
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,480
- each has her own way. - Lady Huan...

623
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,380
- Just showing off - I beg you, come down!

624
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,050
Exactly.

625
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,650
Probably she's abandoned by the Huan family.

626
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,700
That's too risky!

627
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,240
Lady Huan, please come down.

628
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,950
Be careful not to fall into the water.

629
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,550
So what if I fall?

630
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,550
So what if I live or die?

631
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,590
Don't joke about this!

632
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,510
Please don't scare me.

633
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,360
When have I ever scared you?

634
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,470
When have I ever joked with you?

635
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,510
I wondered why Lady Huan stood here every day.

636
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,070
As expected,

637
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,320
the view from here

638
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,110
truly is different from the rest.

639
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,070
Free yet within bounds.

640
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,630
If you wish to jump in, then go ahead.

641
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,880
Why fear what others say?

642
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,240
Or perhaps,

643
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,360
you never intended to jump in at all.

644
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,800
If that's the case,

645
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,840
why not discuss a business deal with me?

646
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,800
Speak your mind.

647
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,320
Don't you want to be a songstress

648
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,800
or win the top beauty title?

649
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,280
Does it matter?

650
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,280
Gaining brings no joy,

651
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,590
and losing brings no sorrow.

652
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,590
Then what is it that you desire?

653
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,800
And you? What do you desire?

654
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,630
I came to Yangzhou after many close calls,

655
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,070
simply wishing to establish myself here.

656
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,280
I'm not like you.

657
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,280
What I seek

658
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,150
is to find a devoted heart

659
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,720
and never part till we grow old.

660
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,800
So, that's the reason you wish to retire?

661
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,110
But if you retire like this,

662
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,110
will those who once supported you

663
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,070
let you go so easily?

664
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,470
The Huan family promoted me

665
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,680
merely to be a living sign for their jewelry shops.

666
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,360
Those noble sons lifted me up

667
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,150
just because they liked my pipa's tune.

668
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,030
When Bai Niao used cheap tricks to win over me,

669
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,800
they suddenly decided

670
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,720
Bai Niao's pipa playing was the true melody of heaven.

671
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,550
This world is full of filth,

672
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,590
and I'm merely a puppet on strings.

673
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
Only he...

674
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,200
he promised to marry me.

675
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,320
He treats me differently

676
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,240
from everyone else.

677
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,360
If he's so good,

678
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,630
why hasn't he married you?

679
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,680
He has his own hardships.

680
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,110
But I trust him.

681
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,550
I believe

682
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,950
he will fulfill his promise.

683
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,400
And after you retire?

684
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,800
How do you plan to live?

685
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,510
I can do more than play the pipa.

686
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,470
I know my way around the kitchen, too.

687
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,630
At worst, I'll sell off the jewels

688
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,680
to support myself.

689
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,840
Living off savings

690
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,380
eventually leads to running out.

691
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,360
Would you like to have your own business

692
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,550
here in Yangzhou?

693
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,070
This way,

694
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,810
you won't need to bow to others.

695
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,590
And even if one day you wish to retire,

696
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,990
and live an ordinary life,

697
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,630
you'll have a place to shelter you.

698
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,680
If you rely only on the lover in your heart,

699
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,920
all is well in deep affection,

700
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,880
but once feelings fade,

701
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,920
you'll be as strangers.

702
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,920
Without a fallback plan,

703
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,530
you'll end up hurt in the end.

704
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,370
Perhaps what you say is right.

705
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,990
Lady Huan,

706
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,800
I can help you win the top beauty title.

707
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:48,200
In this Qionghua Festival, I am but a supporting role.

708
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,400
You want to help me win the top beauty title?

709
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,280
Not me helping you,

710
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,990
but rather, you helping me.

711
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,880
With your pipa skills,

712
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,430
paired with the craftsmanship of Clear Mind,

713
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,510
you will find it interesting.

714
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,280
Clear Mind?

715
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,680
I've never heard of it. Where is it?

716
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,990
It doesn't yet exist.

717
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,430
Actually, Clear Mind

718
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,480
is the reason I came to see you.

719
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,110
You want to open a shop in Yangzhou?

720
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,400
What is your name?

721
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,510
Su Muzhe.

722
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:55,120
Su Muzhe...

723
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,280
The Qionghua Festival is dull,

724
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,430
but you are intriguing.

725
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,200
I might just play along with you.
