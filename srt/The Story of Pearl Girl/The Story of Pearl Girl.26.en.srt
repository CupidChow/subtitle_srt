12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,350
We haven't seen each other

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,360
since we parted from Guangzhou.

14
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,640
Now, we both

15
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,150
work for Prince Ying.

16
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,710
We have to work in unison.

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,150
Nanying, that's not true.

18
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,270
I work for our country.

19
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,790
Prince Ying and I are friends.

20
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,150
I can't mix business with private matters.

21
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,630
Speaking of that,

22
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,230
I want to congratulate you on your promotion.

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
Over the years,

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,070
I have taken care of Prince Tan's hidden assets.

25
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,350
Prince Ying, I'd like to give it all to you.

26
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,440
Please give me a chance to work for you.

27
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,510
You're betraying your master for glory.

28
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,920
Why should I trust you?

29
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:19,390
I know one thing

30
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,280
from sixteen years ago.

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,480
What's that?

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
It was a long time ago.

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,920

Yan's Trading Convoy will arrive at Piti Spring the day after tomorrow.

36
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
Yan's Trading Convoy?

37
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,000
It was a Yangzhou merchant

38
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,670
who escorted Kang's tribute.

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,790
It was a long time ago.

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,040
It doesn't make any sense to mention it.

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,070
Of course.

42
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,230
No one brings it up because it's not the right time.

43
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,950
I'm worried that the Yangzhou Cui family is doomed to ruin.

44
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,390
When the time comes, Yangzhou will be chaotic.

45
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,830
I'd like to guard Yangzhou for you.

46
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,350
After all, I'm the only one around you

47
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,070
who is familiar with Yangzhou.

48
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,760
You said you were Jinran's senior brother.

49
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,320
Yes.

50
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,280
Since you're Jinran's senior brother,

51
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,280
we're on the same side.

52
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,600
Thank you, Prince Ying.

53
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,160
I'm serving the Imperial Court.

54

It doesn't matter what official position I have.

55
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,960
You went straight to the Zheng family as soon as you arrived in Yangzhou.

56
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
You said they were involved in a case

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,950
and murder.

58
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,280
There must be a misunderstanding.

I won't know

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,320

We will look into it.

62
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,440
Jinran,

63
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,830
you are the Inspector of Huainandao.

64
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,070
If you want to investigate a case in my area,

65
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,720
should you

66
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,320
think about me, the official of the Governor's Office?

67
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,160
Nanying,

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,140
do you want me to drop the investigation?

69
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,720
It's bending the law.

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,920
I won't ask you to do that.

71
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,600
She's just a woman who won the top beauty title this year.

72
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,870
It's a love killing

73
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,600
or a revenge killing.

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,310
I think

75
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,790
the Zheng family must be framed.

76
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,600
You have a point.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,480
However,

78
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,870
I came to Yangzhou by water.

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,350
I found a batch of the Black Dragon Bandits' robbed goods

80
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,870
that they were selling to Yangzhou.

81
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,870
I followed the goods

82
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,280
to the house

83
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,790
and discovered Lady Huan's death.

84
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,920
It's different from what you think.

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,350
It is not an ordinary love killing

86
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,110
or a revenge killing.

87
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,310
Hexi Black Dragon Bandits were involved.

Although Zheng Wu is suspected,

there's no further evidence.

and set up the trap in the ancestral hall

145

was Lady Huan's murderer,

who set you up.

he took your sleeve

149

to frame you.

150
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,640
If it was manslaughter,

151
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,640
it was even more suspicious

152
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,750

If he hadn't framed me for the murder,

he would have done it sooner or later.

00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,190
I'm going to report you.

190
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,160
Is that Lady Huan?

191
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,240
It sounded like Lady Huan.

192
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,430
I thought Lady Huan also came to buy jewelry.

193
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,120
What about the stolen goods?

194
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,430
What stolen goods?

195
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Stolen goods?

196
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,470
She's fine.

197
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,400
I'll explain later.

198
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,520
Come with me.

199
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,070
What do you mean by stolen goods?

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,550
I'll explain later...

201
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,720
Black Dragon Bandits' stolen goods?

202
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,640
Why are the Black Dragon Bandits' stolen goods in the Zheng family?

203
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,760
I told you.

204
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,330
I don't have time to explain. Just come with me...

205
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,670
Lady Huan is dead.

206
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,700
Yan Zijing.

207
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,120
Do you think about anything

208
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,670
other than revenge?

209
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,470
If you don't want Lady Huan to die in vain,

210
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,710
come with me.

211
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,420
[Zheng's Mansion]

212
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,360
Si, you should work hard.

213
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,790
After the Cui family was destroyed,

214
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,360
your father has always pissed on me.

215
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,550
If Zheng Wu gets favored by your father,

216
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,240
We won't have a place

217
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,880
in the Zheng family.

218
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
You're a legitimate son.

219
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
I know.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,040
As you know,

221
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
my father never liked me.

222
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,710
I don't have a chance to behave.

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,430
You have a chance now.

224
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,760
The Red Leaf Crown that was going to be given to the Empress Dowager was ruined.

225
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,830
Your father is anxious.

226
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,670
Tell this to your father.

227
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,360
Tell him that you will deal with the things

228
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,790
at home.

229
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,240
Mother.

230
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,760
Our family has such a secret.

231
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,070
Your father is wary of me.

232
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,280
But I know everything

233
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,190
that happened in the Zheng family.

234
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,550
However,

235
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,640
this matter

236
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,710
is too dangerous.

237
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,000
You can't do it in person.

238
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,400
You should find someone you can trust.

239
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,920
Someone I can trust.

240
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,920
Huan can be trusted.

241
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:56,130
But I can't let her know the truth.

242
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,550
Let go.

243
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,590
Mr. Wu.

244
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,880
You can't drink as much as I do.

245
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,100
You drink the most.

246
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,160
One, two, go.

247
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:16,950
Go home.

248
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,470
I found the person to do it.

249
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,430
About the scapegoat,

250
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,000
you're the right person, Wu.

251
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,240
Mr. Si.

252
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,920
The master wants to see you.

253
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,830
Tell me.

254
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,640
What happened?

255
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
It's all my fault.

256
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,430
I trusted Lady Huan

257
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,000
and implicated Wu.

258
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,430
Master. Zheng.

259
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,190
I'm here

260
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,310
to protect your Zheng family.

261
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,040
If you don't tell me the truth,

262
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
there's no need for me to stay.

263
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll explain to you later.

264
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,760
You should explain it to Inspector Zhang.

265
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,520
Who are Inspector Zhang's origins?

266
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,280
He's from a famous family.

267
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,310
He's Prince Ying's sworn brother

268
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,590
and the Emperor's pet.

269
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,670
He's Prince Ying's sworn brother. Then...

270
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,430
Why did he turn you down

271
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,310
and go after the Zheng family?

272
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,950
Do you know

273
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,920
why he refused to be a Secretariat Drafter

274
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,760
and volunteered

275
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,830
to be the Inspector of Huainandao?

276
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,950
Because he found the tribute pearls fraud in Guangzhou.

277
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,830
And he found clues

278
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,120
to Kang's tributes.

279
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,190
Then, he traced it all the way to Hexi

280
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,590
and found the Black Dragon Bandits.

281
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,070
He came here

282
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,550
to find those things.

283
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,710
We are hanging by a thread.

284
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,590
But you're not aware of it yet.

285
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,160
Idiot.

286
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,120
You're dragging the Zheng family down.

287
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,400
Tell me the truth.

288
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,070
I told the truth.

289
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Nonsense.

290
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,160
I left that to you.

291
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,550
How did Wu know that mansion?

292
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,710
How did your second and third uncles

293
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,470
find out so quickly

294
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,470
and accuse Wu?

295
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,070
Wu and Lady Huan have long been in collusion.

296
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,550
They invested in Clear Mind.

297
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,040
Father, you know about it.

298
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,470
Lady Huan is your lover.

299
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,880
I knew it.

300
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,430
I cut her off a long time ago.

301
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,920
I didn't expect her

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,310
to go to Wu after that.

303
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,550
Now, she's dead.

304
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,950
Which is great.

305
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,670
Where were you at the time?

306
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,710
I was with Steward Zheng.

307
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,830
If you don't believe me,

308
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,040
you can ask Steward Zheng.

309
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,830
Idiots.

310
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,920
You're both idiots.

311
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,000
All right.

312
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,830
They are not entirely to blame.

313
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,310
There's one more person.

314
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,470
Yan Zijing.

315
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Yan Zijing...

316
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,760
Are you saying that they didn't want to take it away?

317
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,590
They wanted to ruin my big thing.

318
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,430
Only

319
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,070
the Zhenlang Pavilion

320
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,000
has rubies

321
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,640
in Yangzhou.

322
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,790
Seventy million mace

323
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,280
in three days.

324
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,670
Cash on delivery.

325
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,950
The Cui family was ruined by him.

326
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,040
Su Muzhe

327
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,790
used to be called Duanwu.

328
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,520
She was from the Yan's Trading Convoy.

329
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,400
But they don't seem to know each other.

330
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,360
Are you sure?

331
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,880
You better think about it.

332
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,310
Mr. Xu.

333
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,400
Mr. Xu.

334
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,470
Mr. Xu.

335
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:05,950
Mr. Xu.

336
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,880
Mr. Xu...

337
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,510
You...

338
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,750
Think of a way

339
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,080
to go up and rub the footprint.

340
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,470
Yes, sir.

341
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,230
Are you done with the scene investigation?

342
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,230
Yes.

343
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,470
According to the scene,

344
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,750
we suspect a man and a woman.

345
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,190
They didn't enter through the gate.

346
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,470
A man climbed over the wall and entered the front yard.

347
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,120
A man and a woman climbed over the wall and left the backyard.

348
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,160
According to the footprints on the scene,

349
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,190
the man was carrying something.

350
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,920
There should have been a third person.

351
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,320
A third person?

352
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,120
Someone in the alley

353
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,640
saw two strange women and a strange man

354
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,190
enter the mansion.

355
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,750
Now that we know there are three suspects,

356
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,270
we should draw their portraits

357
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,880
and put out warrants.

358
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,990
We don't know who the killer is.

359
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,270
We can't jump to conclusions.

360
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,560
Jinran, I hope you solve the case sooner.

361
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,120
I have something to do.

362
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,180
Excuse me.

363
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,430
He's weird.

364
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,030
The case of selling the stolen goods turned into a homicide case.

365
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,470
What do we do?

366
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,770
We must catch the murderer.

367
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,360
The three people you just found

368
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,600
are important.

369
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,230
We must find them first.

370
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,920
I, Bai Niao,

371
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,880
want to sue Su Muzhe, the owner of Clear Mind,

372
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,030
for murdering Lady Huan

373
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,840
to get the jewelry she invested in Clear Mind.

374
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,470
Here's Lady Huan's blood letter.

375
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,600
And I have a witness.

376
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,190

She must have been wronged.

Why did Duanwu change her name?

Since we came from the desert,

418
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,470
Duanwu has been a different person.

419
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,640

Mr. Zhang, please trust Duanwu.

I'm sure Duanwu wouldn't have done such a thing.

Duanwu and Lady Huan are like sisters.

Duanwu is very sad

I didn't want to involve you in this.

Su Muzhe.

565
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,400
Ms. Su, you're really a heroine.

566
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,710
The government is looking for you everywhere.

567
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,120
But you came to me.

568
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,120
You, the Zhengs, sold the stolen goods and killed people.

569
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,120
I am innocent.

570
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,470
What do I have to worry about?

571
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,920
Selling stolen goods and killing people are serious crimes.

572
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,160
Who in the Zheng family are you talking about?

573

Watch your mouth.

If you are willing to help me,

I have a way to get him to confess.

578
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,510
Why should I help you against my brother?

579
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,120
If your father, Mr. Zheng doesn't want to give up his legitimate son,

580
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,160
who will take the fall?

581
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,270
Helping me

582
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,710
is helping yourself.

583
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,470
Ms. Su, what did you get?

584
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,510

Looks like you've been out all night again.

588
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,920
Inspector Zhang asked you to go to the Governor's Office to check in every day.

589
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,320
Did you go there?

590
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,560
Of course I did.

591
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,950
I went there.

592
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,880
And I heard something.

593
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,430
What's that?

594
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,920
It is said that the Huan family is broke.

601

rushed to the Huan family.

602
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,190
Is it funny?

603
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:36,080
I'm going to take a nap.

Lady Huan almost went to the Qionghua Festival

607

without jewelry.

608
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,190
They're trying to cheat money.

609
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,030
Yeah, you're right.

610
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

611
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,670
Lady Huan was noble and loyal.

612
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,320
It's hard to accept that she died at 24.

613
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,990
It's sad.

614
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,320
Our auction today is not for money.

615
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,840
We want the people of Yangzhou to gather

616
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,800
to mourn her.

617
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,030
This is the first item to be auctioned today.

I don't know.

622
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,600
She never mentioned it.

623

We don't know who her lover is.

624
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,880
But she went through a lot

625
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,320
and loved him deeply.

626

is from a famous family in Yangzhou.

628

They fell in love with each other at first sight.

629
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,230
They once sailed on the river

00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
What do you say?

752
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,840
If I'm not going to clear Lady Huan's name,

753
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,920
I'll kill you right now

754
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,360
and sacrifice you to her.

755
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,470
Ms. Su, thank you for not killing me.

756
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,280
Thank you.

757
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,920
Su Muzhe.

758
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:38,950
You...

759
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,240
Mr. Xu.

760
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,840
Mr. Xu.

761
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,760
Mr. Xu, help me.

762
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,950
Good-for-nothing. Get away.

763
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,720
Mr. Xu.

764
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,840
Arrest him.

765
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,430
Help me.

766
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,240
Mr. Xu.

767
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:55,760
Mr. Xu.

768
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,150
Mr. Xu.

769
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Mr. Xu.

770
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,760
Arrest Su Muzhe, too.

771
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,590
Nanying.

772
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,680
You heard it.

773
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,110
Zheng Zhixing killed Lady Huan.

774
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,510
Someone reported her.

775
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,320
And she has Lady Huan's suicide note

776
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
and the stolen jewelry.

777
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,510
Why shouldn't we arrest her?

778
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,510
Jinran, do you want to bend the law?

779
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,280
Nanying, wait...

780
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,680
Mr. Xu, Inspector Zhang.

781
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,760
Just arrest me.

782
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,280
I am innocent.

783
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,360
Mr. Xu, Inspector Zhang,

784
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
please clear Lady Huan and my names.

785
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,280
Arrest Su Muzhe.

786
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,360
I will interrogate her.

787
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,920
Duanwu.

788
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,950
Where is the suspect? Lead the way.

789
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,280
Duanwu.

790
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,840
I know why you were avoiding me.

791
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:29,800
You didn't want to get me in trouble.

792
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,800
But you and I...

793
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,200
