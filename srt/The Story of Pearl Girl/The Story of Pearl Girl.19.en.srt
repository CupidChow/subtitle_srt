Zijing led the convoy in a fierce fight to defend us.

Only then could I lead the merchants to escape.

159

- Duanwu! - Duanwu!

191
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,010
Duanwu!

192
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,240
How's it going? Did you find her?

193
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,030
Yes, we found her. Don't worry.

194
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,790
Then why didn't you bring her back?

195
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,120
She was rescued by some herders.

196
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,480
I ran into a few Black Dragon Bandits on the way.

197
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,720
I was afraid of drawing their attention,

198
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,200
so I didn't dare to show myself.

199
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,510
Don't worry. How are you?

200
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,360
I'm fine.

201
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,670
Her safety is all that matters.

202
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,840
Take me to see her. Let's go!

203
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,440
Let's go.

204
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,370
Let's go.

205
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,790
Let's go.

206
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,300
Wait.

207
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,550
We can't go.

208
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,750
We can't go.

209
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,820
What's the Black Dragon Bandits' movement now?

210
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,790
Li Kui ordered them to hunt you down.

211
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,000
They're searching the whole city for you.

212
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,440
Alright,

213
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,840
find two people

214
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,080
to spread the word that I have the blood-stained pearl.

215
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,550
That way, Duanwu will be safer.

216
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,910
Understood.

217
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,270
Later, I'll take some men to fetch her.

218
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,480
No need.

219
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,270
I can't see her.

220
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,670
The witch doctor is dead now,

221
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,030
so I don't have long to live.

222
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,960
In this final time, I just want

223
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,080
to avenge my Yan family.

224
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,270
Cao Da, Shrimp, Loud,

225
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,390
Wei Yan,

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,630
and all those people in the convoy.

227
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,630
They all died for my revenge.

228
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,480
I can't let Duanwu

229
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,390
keep getting caught up in this danger.

230
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,240
You can't blame yourself for this.

231
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,160
We walked right into an ambush.

232
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,920
When I take the men and fight back,

233
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,790
explain everything to her.

234
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,680
She'll understand.

235
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,070
You have to tell Duanwu,

236
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:15,310
or she'll hate you.

237
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,740
Let her hate me, then.

238
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,310
At least she'll be safe.

239
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,070
Miss, you're awake!

240
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,830
We saved you.

241
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,960
My mother thought you wouldn't make it.

242
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,350
Mom!

243
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,350
She's awake!

244
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,550
She's awake?

245
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
You're awake!

246
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,110
Here, have some hot water to warm up.

247
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,400
Miss, you're lucky. No vital injuries.

248
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,400
Here.

249
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,690
Miss, what's wrong?

250
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,370
Where's your family?

251
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
Alright, it's okay.

252
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
I won't ask anymore.

253
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,480
Dear, now that you've survived,

254
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,620
live on with all your strength.

255
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,790
The setting sun fills the ground,

256
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,920
Deep feelings best forgotten.

257
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,960
Blood stains my clothes, tears drench my chest.

258
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,960
In the chill of dusk, grief soaks my bed.

259
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,750
White bones lie buried beneath wild grass,

Duanwu!

- The convoy guards are trying to kill us! - How can I bear

263
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:01,650
- Run, Duanwu! - to recall those days?

Yan Zijing, why?

266
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,960
The world twists and turns, hard to foretell,

267
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,960
And the human heart is a mystery as well.

Duanwu traded with the herders for money and food.

I searched a few places along the way,

275
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,030
but there's no sign of her.

Any leads?

277
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,480
Yan Zijing is seriously injured. He can't have gone far.

otherwise,

we might not get out.

No.

326
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,070
I need a room.

327
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,960
I have money.

328
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,590

00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,590
There's fresh goods here.

332
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,720

335
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,070

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,350
What are you looking at?

337
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,110
Miss, you're looking so fresh and delicate,

338
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:35,960
weak and sickly.

339
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,960
You want to talk to me, huh?

340
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,480
Alright,

341
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,070
talk.

342
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,200
Help me!

343
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,790
Don't scream!

344
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,440
Scream all you want, it's useless.

345
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,960
There's no one here.

346
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,550
Tomorrow, I'll sell you,

347
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,920
and you'll sing ditties

348
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,510
to earn money for daily essentials.

349
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,640
Upstairs, there's another girl,

350
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,590
also quite pretty.

351

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,480
You just want money?

355
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,680
Please, let me go.

356
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,180
I work with jade.

357
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,610
I can get you gold and jewels.

358
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,010
Please, let me go.

359
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,900

360
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,990
Gold and jewels? I'll take them.

361
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,320

We're rich!

366
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,470
Let her go!

367
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,990
Duanwu, I'm scared...

368
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

369
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,880
The city gates are already closed.

370
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,880
Let's just stay here for the night.

371
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,430
Finding Duanwu is more urgent.

372
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,750
Anyone here?

373
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,800
Anyone here? We need a room!

374
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,430
Who are you?

375
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,430
Why are you tied up here?

376
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,470
We were wronged by two vile women!

377
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,800
Those brats...

378
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,230
If I catch them,

379
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,560
I won't let them off easy!

380
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,230
Sir!

381
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,120
Please save us.

382
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,170
Please, help us!

383
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,470
Sir!

384
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,080
It's Duanwu's arrow.

385
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,750
Sir!

386
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,880
It's Duanwu's arrow!

387
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:56,880
Quick!

388
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,560
Free us first!

389
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,720
Duanwu!

390
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,030
- Duanwu! - Duanwu!

391
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,560
Duanwu!

392
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,320
Come out!

393
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,880
I'm Zhang Jinran.

394
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,880
Duanwu!

395
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,030
Sir!

396
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,160
Out here in the middle of nowhere,

397
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,950
where will you look for her?

398
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,600
The blood on the arrowhead hasn't dried.

399
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,470
She couldn't have gone far.

400
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,130
- Move aside! - Sir!

401
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,800
- Sir! - Move aside!

402
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,950
If Duanwu wants to hide,

403
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,990
you won't be able to find her.

404
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,560
Judging by the situation here,

405
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,670
she should be safe.

406
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,670
Since she was around here,

407
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,360
they're likely heading to the city.

408
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,710
Tomorrow, we'll go to Bianzhou City

409
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,030
to look for them.

410
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,400
Duanwu.

411
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,880
Did you sleep well?

412
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,430
It's been so long since I've slept this soundly.

413
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,190
Let's have breakfast.

414
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:10,710
Duanwu.

415
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,670
I have good news for you.

416
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,320
Look!

417
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,080
My hands are healed.

418
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,400
Weren't you staying with Mr. Zhang?

419
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,230
How did you end up kidnapped?

420
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,230
In the camp, they said something happened to you,

421
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,750
I was terrified.

422
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,400
Mr. Zhang never came back,

423
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,950
so I went to the desert to find you.

424
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,510
But I couldn't find you anywhere.

425
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,640
Thankfully, I found you now.

426
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,270
Now we can stay together forever.

427
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,800
Yunxiu,

428
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,230
I've already paid the inn for a month for you.

429
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,800
Just settle in and rest.

430
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,950
If you feel unwell, just tell the innkeeper.

431
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,920
And here's some money,

432
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,240
enough for your journey.

433
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,400
Take this money,

434
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,240
go to Chang'an if you wish,

435
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,680
or look for Mr. Zhang.

436
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,720
I told you,

437
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,110
once your hands are healed,

438
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,470
you can make a life for yourself anywhere.

439
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,800
Duanwu, I don't want money.

440
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
I won't go to Chang'an.

441
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,990
I won't go looking for Mr. Zhang.

442
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,320
I just want to stay with you!

443
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,200
You can't stay with me.

444
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,150
Why?

445
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,360
Why can't I stay with you?

446
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,320
I won't go to Chang'an.

447
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,680
I won't go looking for Mr. Zhang.

448
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,360
Why can't I stay with you?

449
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,200
Yunxiu.

450
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,700
Shrimp is dead.

451
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,880
Shrimp is dead.

452
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,360
I failed to protect him.

453
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,070
Cao Da is dead too.

454
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,760
Be good,

455
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,400
take this money, go to Chang'an or anywhere.

456
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,950
Be obedient.

457
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,550
Duanwu!

458
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,990
Duanwu.

459
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,840
Shrimp and the others are gone,

460
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,150
but you still have me.

461
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,320
My hands are healed now.

462
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,720
I'll protect you!

463
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,200
Don't leave.

464
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,890
Duanwu, trust me.

465
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,720
Duanwu,

466
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,760
I would give my life to protect you.

467
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,880
Don't leave.

468
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,400
Let's buy some cakes for the journey.

469
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,240
Freshly baked cakes!

470
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,990
Get some cakes.

471
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,030
Alright.

472
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,320
Make sure they're warm, thanks.

473
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,510
Sure thing.

474
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Thank you.

475
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,590
Four cash.

476
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,950
Let's go.

477
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,990
Cakes! Freshly baked cakes!

478
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,590
Come and take a look!

479
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:53,760
[Bianzhou City]

480
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,110
We've searched all over Bianzhou.

481
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,400
There's no trace of her.

482
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,840
Maybe Duanwu have left the city.

483
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,510
They must be nearby.

484
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,200
I will find her.

485
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,030
But Prince Ying

486
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,680
has repeatedly urged you to return to Chang'an.

487
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:08,110
If you delay any longer, it may not go over well.

488
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,590
Don't worry. I'll assign men to keep looking.

489
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,200
Alright.

490
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,550
Hyah!

491
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,110
Hyah!

492
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,800
I didn't expect such a pleasant surprise on the way.

493
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,840
These three young ladies

494
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,150
all look quite nice.

495
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,320
For these ones,

496
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,430
we'll have to negotiate separately with the buyer.

497
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,200
Don't worry.

498
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,540
We'll discuss once we reach Yangzhou.

499
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,980
Run!

500
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,550
Don't let them get away!

501
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,010
Stop!

502
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,590
Don't run!

503
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,080
- Chase! - Run, Tan!

504
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,120
Stop!

505
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,120
Don't run!

506
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,880
Stop!

507
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,800
Stop!

508
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,680
Don't run!

509
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:14,070
Don't run! Catch her!

510
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,720
Quick!

511
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,550
Don't run! Didn't you hear me?

512
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,030
Master Shijiu!

513
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,240
Don't run!

514
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,050
Over there!

515
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:23,900
Tong!

516
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,340
Chase!

517
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,430
Hurry!

518
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,070
Over there! Chase them!

519
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,320
Stop!

520
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,430
Stop!

521
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,590
This way.

522
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,920
Prince Ying!

523
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,320
Zhang Jinran.

524
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,030
Let me have a good look at you.

525
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,950
You look so travel-worn.

526
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,030
You've been all over.

527
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,200
It must have been at least a year.

528
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,360
Thanks for worrying about you.

529
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,760
When I heard you were returning to Chang'an,

530
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,470
I was overjoyed.

531
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,680
I prepared a table for you

532
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,800
with all your favorite dishes.

533
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,280
Enjoy it.

534
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,430
You've been so considerate.

535
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,200
You may all leave.

536
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,400
I'll handle it.

537
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,510
Now that you're back, don't go wandering again.

538
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,880
What's the matter?

539
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,030
Still not settled?

540
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,950
The position of Secretariat Drafter awaits you.

541
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,610
His Majesty has mentioned you many times.

542
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,400
This time, I went to Hepu,

543
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,020
then traveled from Lingnan through Shannan to Hexi.

544
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,320
I saw hardships and suffering

545
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,110
like I've never seen in my life.

546
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,400
So, I don't wish to take up the post.

547
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,510
I want to see this through to the end.

548
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,920
So, you're still entangled

549
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,430
in the Yan family's tribute case?

550
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,320
It's not just about solving one case.

551
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
I want to bring justice for those caught in the middle,

552
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,360
whose lives and fates

553
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,950
were beyond their control.

554
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,920
But their lives and fates

555
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,630
are beyond your reach.

556
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,630
Stay in Chang'an,

557
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,880
and you'll be the youngest Secretariat Drafter,

558
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,680
His Majesty's favored young talent.

559
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,280
Your writings will depict a golden age of culture,

560
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,950
not the bloody harshness of punishment.

561
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,760
No.
