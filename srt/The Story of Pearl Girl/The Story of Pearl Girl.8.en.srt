[Episode 8]

12
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,480
Duanwu, this place is great.

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,760
There are big windows,
and we can see the sea.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
It's much better than the bilge.

15
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,760
Even the blankets smell good.

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,040
The smell of the sun.

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,960
Duanwu, you're amazing.

18
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,030
l can finally get a good night's sleep.

19
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,190
Duanwu.

20
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,560
You work too hard, so take a break.

21
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,120
I can only rest easy
if I work all the time.

22
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,470
We've already entered the upper cabin,
joined the trading convoy,

23
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,520
and lived in such a big house,

24
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,870
so what's not to worry about?

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,750
Shrimp, let me ask you.

26
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,910
If you were to enlist the help

27
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,560
of a friend you've just met,

28
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,560
what do you

29
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,150
think the success rate would be?

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,420
Basically zero.

31
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,740
You've always taught me

32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,200
not to make unreasonable requests

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,630
when befriending someone

34
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,560
and not to expect friends

35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,910
to give freely without regard

36
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,120
to their own interests.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,430
That's true.

38
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,590
Friends should be mutually beneficial.

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,030
No one is obligated to help others.

40
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,000
Duanwu.

41
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,240
Has Master sent you on another mission?

42
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,080
That's hard,

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,080
but I have to do it.

44
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
This is the finest Zui Ling Long

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,840
I've ever gotten.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,080
I brought it as a gesture of goodwill.

47
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,630
It's good wine.

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,150
Assistant Pang.

49
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
I don't know if I can drink

50
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
with you again after this.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,870
What are you talking about?

52
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,560
I'm about to lose my job

53
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,430
because of that girl.

54
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,630
That girl does have some skills.

55
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,240
She beat you once with scraps,

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,390
sold Coral Pearl like hotcakes,

57
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,480
and can risk her life for Shark Hunting.

58
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,510
She's tough.

59
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,510
It's true that I'm not
as good as that girl

60
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,560
when it comes to these shenanigans,

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,430
but I'm loyal to you.

62
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,800
Absolutely.

63
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,870
If there's any benefit,

64
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,360
you'll be the first one I think of.

65
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,360
Speak cautiously.

66
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,000
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,630
You should be loyal to Master.

68
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:55,800
That's right.

69
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,870
Assistant Pang is loyal to the Master,

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,040
and I'm loyal to Assistant Pang.

71
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,600
Different ways with the same goals.

72
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,830
No difference.

73
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,560
Anyway,

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,600
I will work for you in my life,

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,680
so you can't watch me die.

76
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,720
You've worked for me

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,070
for so many years,

78
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,560
so how could I treat you badly?

79
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,680
Don't worry. There's a long way to go.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
I want to see how big a storm

81
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,560
this girl can create.

82
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,650
Look at this.

83
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:33,600
Yeah, look.

84
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,130
This is good, look.

85
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,950
Take the ledger.

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,070
Duanwu.

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,040
Sister Wu.

88
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,190
Why didn't you come to me until now?

89
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,630
I missed you.

90
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,680
I came to you today

91
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,000
because I have something to tell you.

92
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,750
Is this hairpin unsellable?

93
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,360
If yes,

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,070
let me take it back so it won't

95
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,630
take up space in the display case.

96
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,240
Who said it's not selling?

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,390
Look.

98
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,430
I put your hairpin

99
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,360
in the most prominent place

100
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,070
because it sells so well.

101
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,040
It's the ace of my store.

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,360
It's unique and low-priced,

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,190
so all the girls in Guangzhou

104
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,120
are clamoring to buy it.

105
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
You don't have to comfort me.

106
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,580
I can make another one.

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,560
Why should I comfort you?

108
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,190
I've asked my men

109
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,270
to take down the orders.

110
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,190
Lan, the ledger.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,870
Wait a minute.

112
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,040
Look.

113
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,360
Let me turn to a random page.

114
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,120
Look.

115
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
This and this

116
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,190
are the orders for the hairpin.

117
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,310
You're now.

118
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,120
my cash cow.

119
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,600
By the way...

120
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,950
Looks like I'm just in time.

121
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,870
Look.

122
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,270
I've just made these recently.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,430
It's beautiful, Duanwu.

124
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,600
I'll take them all.

125
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,070
What were you going to tell me?

126
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,870
There's something I want to ask you.

127
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,190
How about this?

128
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,920
I'll buy you a cup of tea.
We can take our time.

129
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,390
Tea?

130
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,310
No problem.

131
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,830
I'm rich nowadays,

132
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,750
so let me treat you.

133
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,040
What's the difference
between my treat and yours?

134
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,600
We don't need to argue about that.
Let's go.

135
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,800
Don't worry. Let me treat you.

136
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
Come on, Shrimp,
let's go eat something good.

137
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,680
Let's go.

138
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,600
They make a great Cherry Dew Ball.

139
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,560
You must try it.

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,800
Cherry Dew Ball?

141
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,510
[Qingsong Inn]
That's enough.

142
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,390
Get outta here.

143
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,390
Get outta here.

144
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,240
Please.

145
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,720
Sorry.

146
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,510
If you guys don't leave,

147
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,830
we'll go out of business.

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:40,680
Please.

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,120
Sorry.

150
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,980
Please.

151
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,480
Mr. Zhang.

152
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,000
Sorry for the trouble.

153
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
What happened?

154
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,600
- Mr. Zhang.
- Mr. Zhang.

155
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,070
Duanwu.

156
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,870
Because he pissed off Sea God.

157
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,750
Look what they've done to our hotel.

158
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,510
Pissed off Sea God?

159
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,950
Duanwu, don't worry.

160
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,680
That's enough. Go away.

161
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,630
Did Yan Zijing give you a hard time
after you went back last time?

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,720
Mr. Zhang.

163
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,310
Master didn't give me a hard time,

164
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,240
and Shrimp and I
joined the trading convoy.

165
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,120
Mr. Zhang, you...

166
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,600
It's unfair for my master.

167
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,360
After the Sea God Festival,
he just composed a poem,

168
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,830
but some people say

169
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,160
my master angered Sea God.

170
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,800
This morning, paint was thrown
on the aluminum tubes,

171
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,120
so they won't allow us to stay here.

172
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,190
There must be something strange
about this.

173
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,870
Someone must be behind this.

174
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,480
The owner is just being used.

175
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,160
So what now?

176
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,720
Why don't you

177
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,680
let me find you a place to stay?

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,870
Guangzhou is so big,

179
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,720
so how can I not have a place to stay?

180
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,750
As the saying goes,

181
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,910
I can use the sky as my blanket

182
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,240
and the earth as my bed.

183
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,240
It's a good thing

184
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,200
to have the sky and the earth
as my shelter, isn't it?

185
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,600
Mr. Zhang, you are so funny.

186
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,360
Duanwu and I are going for tea,

187
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,320
so you want to join us?

188
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,320
Right.

189
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,630
Lady Wu said

190
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,910
she'd take us

191
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
to Cherry...

192
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,960
Dew Ball.

193
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:57,910
Right.

194
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,380
Do you want to join us?

195
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,840
Yeah. Let's go together.

196
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,200
- Come on, Mr. Zhang.
- Let's go.

197
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,960
Let's go.

198
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm even stuffed today.

199
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,670
Don't eat so fast.

200
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,670
I said you should eat slowly.

201
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,840
Have some tea.

202
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,630
Feeling better?

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
Mr. Zhang.

204
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,390
What's Chang'an like?

205
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,960
Duanwu.

206
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,200
Do you remember what I told you?

207
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,510
Baked flatbread of the West Market.

208
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,750
There's something better than that.

209
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,840
Inside the West Market in Chang'an,

210
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,270
there are merchants

211
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,550
and stalls everywhere.

212
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,510
Stores run by girls

213
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,320
abound.

214
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,320
Can a woman do business

215
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
as a merchant in Chang'an?

216
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,510
In some cases,

217
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,600
women are even better.

218
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,670
For example, the largest silk store

219
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,080
in Chang'an's West Market.

220
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,720
Its owner is a female embroiderer.

221
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,870
It gets better than that.

222
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,360
In Chang'an's West Market,

223
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,150
there is a famous winery.

224
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,150
It's a popular destination

225
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,360
for the rich and famous.

226
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,000
At first, we thought

227
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,510
it was owned by a man,

228
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
but no one realized

229
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,270
it was a determined

230
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,870
and business-savvy woman.

231
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,960
Mr. Zhang, you are very insightful.

232
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,840
I must learn the ways of business

233
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
from my father

234
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,270
to open Zhuobao House in Chang'an.

235
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,270
You can do it.

236
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,750
When you get to Chang'an,

237
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,080
you will be one

238
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,390
of the top merchants

239
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,200
in the West Market in Chang'an.

240
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,790
At that time...

241
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,270
You'll have a good man.

242
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,390
Don't be ridiculous.

243
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,510
I found a place on the west side.

244
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,440
It's getting late,
so do you want to check it out?

245
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Sure.

246
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,790
Girls.

247
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm gonna go check out my place.

248
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,080
Excuse me.

249
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,150
Mr. Zhang, let me go with you.

250
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:05,960
Okay.

251
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,790
I'll see you off.

252
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,670
Duanwu.

253
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,720
For you, Mr. Zhang seems...

254
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,720
Don't joke.

255
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,870
Mr. Zhang is a gentleman

256
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,200
and nice to everyone.

257
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,960
He's been

258
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,510
helping me

259
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,750
since we first met.

260
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,030
Mr. Zhang is a good man.

261
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,200
But

262
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,240
when he was worried about

263
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,480
your situation after Shark Hunting,

264
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,670
he had a very concerned look,

265
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,480
so I'm afraid
he wasn't just helping you.

266
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,480
In fact, I think

267
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
Mr. Zhang would be a good choice

268
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,360
if that's what he's trying to do.

269
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,000
You're joking again.

270
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,240
That's Mr. Zhang.

271
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,000
How can I be compared to Mr. Zhang?

272
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,440
Sister Wu.

273
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,200
I grew up on a pearl farm

274
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,550
and lived in degradation all my life,

275
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,320
so I wanted to escape one day

276
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,750
to be free and travel around.

277
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,440
Now that I'm out,

278
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,120
I want

279
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,200
to experience

280
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,320
the world for myself.

281
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,120
Duanwu.

282
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,550
You're so smart and strong,

283
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,720
so you will have whatever you want.

284
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,510
Before, I was trapped in my fate

285
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,550
and was sad every day

286
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,550
until I met you,

287
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,840
In fact,

288
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,240
the lies of the fortune tellers
you uncovered for me

289
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
were not crucial.

290
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
What really changed me

291
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,480
was the power you gave me.

292
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,240
Not me,

293
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,630
but yourself.

294
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,870
You have the power.

295
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,360
Sister Wu.

296
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,550
There's something I want to ask you.

297
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,600
Please.

298
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
Can Zhuobao House

299
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,270
purchase pearls
for Yan's Trading Convoy?

300
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,550
I know

301
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,750
this is a difficult matter for you.

302
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,240
There's a lot at stake here.

303
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,720
If you take this deal,

304
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,240
you will be involved

305
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,270
in a fight between Cui's Pearl Farm

306
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,000
and Yan's Trading Convoy,

307
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,870
and Cui's Pearl Farm
may turn against you,

308
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,870
so I understand

309
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,080
your concern.

310
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,960
You don't have to force yourself.

311
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,510
Duanwu.

312
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,320
Tell me.

313
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,910
Are you already involved?

314
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,790
Yes,

315
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,150
but don't worry,

316
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,480
I have another way.

317
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,390
This will not affect me.

318
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,240
I will help you.

319
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,510
Zhuobao House
has always been non-aligned,

320
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,720
but I don't care
what Yan's Trading Convoy is.

321
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,390
As long as it's from you,

322
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,390
I'll take the deal

323
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,080
and convince my father.

324
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,030
Don't worry.

325
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,670
You've been so good to me.

326
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,390
How should I thank you?

327
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,910
We don't need to discuss this.

328
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,270
Sister Wu.

329
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,320
Your friendship with me is one thing,

330
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,750
but Zhuobao House
and Yan's Trading Convoy are another.

331
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,670
I've requested from Master

332
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
that 10% of the turnover

333
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
will be used
to compensate Zhuobao House.

334
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,960
I won't let you lose out.

335
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,840
OK.

336
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,790
Let's make

337
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,750
a lot of money together.

338
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,960
Jia's voice in the night
heralds prosperity.

339
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,480
We can look at the handsome boy
on the other side of the river.

340
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,200
Later, let's go to Chang'an together.

341
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,000
That's right.

342
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,860
[Fuxu Port]

343
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,070
Excuse me, please.

344
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,790
Duanwu.

345
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,950
Mr. Zhang.

346
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:25,400
You're...

347
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,240
Is the place on the west side bad?

348
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,480
Can you take me to your master?

349
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,520
I want to stay at The Mirage.

350
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,910
The Mirage?

351
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,910
Didn't you say

352
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,520
you were looking for a place for me?

353
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,240
I can take you to Master,

354
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,040
but I can't decide

355
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,190
if you can stay at The Mirage.

356
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,880
Thank you very much.

357
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,760
Please.

358
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,710
You're back.

359
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,430
I heard you were very skillful.

360
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,400
You can sell a lot of pearls

361
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,160
and make men fall in love with you

362
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,430
like a mistress.

363
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,880
Seeing you today

364
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,950
is a real eye-opener.

365
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,120
Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry.

366
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,120
Please.

367
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,670
Everything you've done will be known.

368
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,040
I've been asking around.

369
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,430
At Cui's Pearl Farm,

370
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,790
that friend of yours

371
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,830
always gets laid with men.

372
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,760
What did you say?

373
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,400
Mr. Zhang.

374
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,000
It's crowded here.

375
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,240
You guys...

376
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,760
Please.

377
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,070
Come on.

378
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,430
Go to work.

379
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,120
- Go to work.
- Mr. Zhang.

380
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,070
Go...

381
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,360
Go away.

382
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,160
Damn, Duanwu.

383
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,880
She colluded with Zhuobao House

384
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
and is now seducing Mr. Zhang
to make him work for her.

385
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,550
Assistant Pang.

386
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
If you don't do something,

387
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,430
she'll step on your head soon.

388
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,040
Idiot. Get to work.

389
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,550
Mr. Zhang.

390
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,830
Master.

391
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,760
Hello, Master Yan.

392
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,390
You've finally come back.

393
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,960
I thought you'd never come back.

394
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,720
How's it going?

395
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,150
Have you eaten?

396
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,630
Mr. Zhang.

397
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,040
Come on. Sit down.

398
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,240
Mr. Zhang,

399
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,720
what brings you

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,070
to The Mirage so often?

401
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,960
Your place

402
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,040
is very elegant.

403
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,630
I can listen to the waves

404
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,350
and watch the current from here,

405
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,830
so

406
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,480
I'd like to stay at The Mirage.

407
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,830
Just say you want to stay here.

408
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,070
You don't have to make it so pleasant.

409
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,440
But how can a man

410
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,480
of Mr. Zhang's talent live here?

411
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,870
Master.

412
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,150
There are rooms available in The Mirage.

413
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,630
Is it your turn to talk?

414
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,110
Don't forget who you are.

415
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,480
It's ungenerous

416
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,200
for a man

417
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,040
to take it out on a girl.

418
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,680
Everything she has is from me.

419
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,920
What's the point

420
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,110
of Mr. Zhang's sweet talk?

421
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,870
You're staying in my place,

422
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,870
so where's your dignity as a man?

423
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,790
It won't matter if I don't have that,

424
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,790
but it'll be best if I do.

425
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,920
Plus,

426
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,870
you'll be able

427
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,680
to return the favor

428
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,240
of my entering Cui's Pearl Farm for you.

429
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,440
Since you're using me as a tool,

430
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:22,200
you should use it well.

431
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,830
A cunning rabbit dies.
A good bow will be hidden.

432
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,350
The cunning rabbit

433
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,830
is not yet dead,

434
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,330
so you need not be in such a hurry

435
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,830
to part with the good bow.

436
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,870
Good tea.

437
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,790
I don't understand

438
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,240
what you're saying,

439
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,240
but

440
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,150
I'll allow you to stay.

441
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,150
Kang Ju, arrange a good room

442
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,760
for Mr. Zhang.

443
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,240
Thank you, Master Yan.

444
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,150
Master.

445
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,350
Lady Wu agrees.

446
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,200
If there's nothing else,

447
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,240
I'll leave now.

448
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,630
This is a small token
of Master Shijiu's appreciation.

449
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,630
You're worthy of the one
who's traveled the world

450
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,200
with Yan's Trading Convoy
and seen great things.

451
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,630
You really don't care

452
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,440
about ordinary jewelry.

453
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,200
This is one of Cui's Pearl Farm's

454
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,390
eighteen jewelry houses.

455
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,630
Master Shijiu would like to give it
to you to manage.

456
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,520
Your ambition and skills

457
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,070
can be utilized here.

458
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,200
This is Master Shijiu's sincerity.

459
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,480
What do you think?

460
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,440
Come in.

461
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,550
Mr. Zhang.

462
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,070
You're cheekier than I thought.

463
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,240
In that respect,

464
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,110
I am no match for you.

465
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,920
A Xiuwen Pavilion scholar

466
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,240
has taken up residence at The Mirage

467
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,110
because he just wants an answer.

468
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,110
Go ahead.

469
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,350
You attracted the attention of Guangzhou's
jewelry houses with the Poetry Gathering,

470
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,550
enlisted the guild lead
to enter the Guangzhou market

471
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,920
with the colored stone,

472
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,870
and then used the help of the guild lead

473
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,390
in Guangzhou to acquire pearls for you.

474
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,110
You failed in Shark Hunting,

475
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:32,920
but you secretly went

476
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,280
to Lady Wu's Zhuobao House

477
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,550
and asked them to buy pearls for you.

478
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,480
At this point, the Cui family,
waiting to be saved by the pearls,

479
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,480
was at the end of their rope.

480
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,390
Under your plan,

481
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,310
they will not be able
to acquire any pearls

482
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:45,200
or have a chance
to get back on their feet.

483
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,550
You did all this

484
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,550
so that the Cui family would die.

485
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,070
So what?

486
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,040
What does the Cui family,
having prospered for a hundred years,

487
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,200
have against you

488
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,720
that you would kill them all like this?

489
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,720
What's so strange about that?

490
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,040
The business world
is like a battlefield.

491
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,590
Everyone fights to the death,

492
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,240
so the fewer rivals the better,

493
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,310
but Mr. Zhang,

494
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,550
you're just a civil official

495
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
and not a businessman,

496
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,520
but what were you doing
at Cui's Pearl Farm?

497
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,310
I'm just

498
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:51,040
a profit-seeking businessman,

499
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,390
but I can see

500
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,550
you're ambitious,

501
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,040
so

502
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,830
do you want to gain power?

503
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,240
Peace is only possible

504
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,830
when everyone is settled.

505
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,790
So did you get the answer
you were looking for?

506
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,720
That depends on what clues

507
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,760
you'll give me.

508
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,240
Clues

509
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,240
are like kites.

510
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,000
Sometimes, you think
the thread is broken,

511
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,000
but in fact,

512
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,760
it may be right next to you.

513
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,040
Master Shijiu, it is indeed as you said.

514
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,870
Zhuobao House
is secretly buying pearls in bulk.

515
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,790
How much money can an obscure
jewelry house have for stockpiling?

516
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
Keep an eye on them.

517
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,760
But they're offering

518
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,520
more than double the market price

519
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,590
and threatening to buy
as many as they can.

520
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,720
How can a jewelry store
have so much money?

521
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,200
There must be someone behind the scenes.

522
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,680
Yan Zijing?

523
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,760
Yes.

524
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,440
By the way,

525
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,440
we've kicked Zhang Jinran

526
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,720
out of the inn as you ordered.

527
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,110
We wanted to take the opportunity
to do that,

528
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,960
but Zhang Jinran

529
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,520
stayed at Yan Zijing's The Mirage.

530
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,830
Cui Jia can't find an opportunity now.

531
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,590
It's better that he has no chance.

532
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,310
With Zhang Jinran's status,

533
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,240
we can't do anything to him.

534
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,520
The sly jerk Xu Nanying wants

535
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,150
to use us to remove a thorn in his side,

536
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,870
but he's pushing us into trouble.

537
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,240
Tell Cui Jia

538
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,000
there's no need to rush things.

539
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,280
Yes.

540
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,240
Sir.

541
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,520
We've recently checked

542
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,830
Special Envoy Xu's tracks
and connections.

543
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,720
He's only been receiving

544
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,070
small favors from Cui's Pearl Farm.

545
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,590
Can that pay for itself?

546
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,070
Will a small favor

547
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,520
make Cui Shijiu keep coming after us?

548
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,790
Then we'll invite him

549
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,520
and set a trap for him.

550
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,480
I want to know how much my senior

551
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,720
is willing to contribute.

552
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,280
Is this clerk

553
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,040
so frightened by Cui Shijiu that he

554
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,040
doesn't want to leave the ship?

555
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,680
He is waiting

556
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,200
for me,

557
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,720
Cui's Pearl Farm, and Xu Nanying.

558
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,070
He knows it's time to finish it.

559
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,350
He wouldn't hesitate

560
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,520
at the first opportunity.

561
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,960
Urgent.

562
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,310
Urgent, sir.

563
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,480
Why are you in such a panic?

564
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:13,960
Tell me.

565
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,390
There's official word

566
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,240
that Zhang Jinran
has called for a fast horse

567
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,720
to get back to Beijing immediately.

568
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,240
I heard they'd got

569
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,310
Cui's Pearl Farm's ledgers

570
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,440
and a witness.

571
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,720
Zhang Jinran isn't dead?

572
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,520
Cui Shijiu drove him out of the inn

573
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,390
by some means,

574
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,240
but not long after, he checked

575
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,110
into The Mirage in Yan Zijing.

576
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,310
After that, they didn't stand a chance.

577
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,590
I'll leave this

578
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,280
to you.

579
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,150
Understood.

580
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,200
Throw him out of the inn?

581
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,790
Cui Shijiu, were you so perfunctory?

582
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,480
Sir, are you alright?

583
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,550
Yes, go after him.

584
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,350
Master.

585
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,310
The pearls have all been counted.

586
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,720
Tomorrow,

587
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,070
a merchant from the South Sea
will arrive in Guangzhou.

588
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,440
I will also acquire

589
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,000
the pearls he brought.

590
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,760
Even this batch of pearls?

591
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,390
What's the problem?

592
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,480
Master is not in business, I'm afraid.

593
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,920
You're in no position
to speculate on my mind.

594
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,280
Come with me.

595
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,920
Come in.

596
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,060
[Yan]

597
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,680
The people of the Central Plains

598
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,720
only know white jewels

599
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,520
but not colored stones,

600
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,550
such as these.

601
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,110
Red Huo Qi.

602
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,680
Blue Se.

603
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,870
Yellow Naosou Pearl.

604
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,280
As well as crystal, aurin,

605
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,200
amber, and glaze.

606
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,960
All from the Western Regions.

607
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,590
Why are you showing me this?

608
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,520
To open your eyes.

609
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,550
Don't move.

610
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
When you meet the client tomorrow,

611
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,790
dress up well

612
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,720
so you won't lose your grace.

613
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,480
Make an offer with Wei Yan,

614
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,000
but remember

615
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:51,390
I want

616
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,040
all the pearls.

617
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,110
Master.

618
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,830
Mr. Zhang is back.

619
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,590
He seems to be injured.

620
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,830
Mr. Zhang, this is Duanwu.

621
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,920
May I come in?

622
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,830
Come in.

623
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,720
What happened?

624
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Why are you hurt?

625
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,240
Don't worry.

626
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,040
It's just a scratch.

627
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,110
Are you hurt anywhere else?

628
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,310
No.

629
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,000
Let me help you.

630
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,630
I can...

631
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,280
Hold on.

632
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,520
There you go.

633
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,590
Why haven't I seen Mr. Du?

634
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,720
He had some work to attend to.

635
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,440
You didn't go to Hepu

636
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,070
just for fun, did you?

637
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,350
That's right.

638
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,110
For Cui's Pearl Farm

639
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,310
or Yan's?

640
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,760
Maybe there's no difference.

641
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,280
Don't you think Yan Zijingd's purpose
is not business?

642
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,480
What do you mean?

643
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,680
I told you before

644
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,480
you should stay away from him.

645
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,350
I don't know

646
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,550
what your intentions are

647
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,040
or what you want to do.

648
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,680
And I don't want to know.

649
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,350
When I get what I want,

650
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,670
I'll leave.

651
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,920
But when is that?

652
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,800
You said before

653
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:26,960
that you just wanted

654
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,520
to be a free peddler.

655
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
I haven't forgotten.

656
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,320
That's what I've always wanted.

657
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,270
At first, I only came to the ship

658
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,520
to get back my mother's relics,

659
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,070
but now,

660
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,070
I think I can

661
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,670
see hope on this ship.

662
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,320
This is what Yan Zijing calls
the law of the jungle.

663
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,190
Mr. Zhang.

664
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,150
People like us are weaklings

665
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,840
who could be eaten

666
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,270
by the strong anywhere.

667
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,800
There's nothing wrong with that.

668
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,800
I don't want you
to become like Yan Zijing.

669
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,040
Remember to change
your medicine tomorrow.

670
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,040
Master Shijiu.

671
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,520
Every cloud has a silver lining.

672
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,400
A merchant from the South Sea
has recently arrived in Guangzhou.

673
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,070
He is selling pearls
in large quantities.

674
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Is this man trustworthy?

675
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,190
I can't confirm it, but...

676
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,400
Master Shijiu.

677
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,110
Xu Nanying tried to kill Zhang Jinran,

678
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,550
but Zhang Jinran escaped.

679
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,550
Zhang Jinran.

680
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Where is Zhang Jinran?

681
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,320
Zhang...

682
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,360
He has returned to The Mirage.

683
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,800
Where is the ledger?

684
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,270
Have you seen the ledger?

685
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,230
Is that still with him?

686
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,710
At that time,

687
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,400
the killers only saw

688
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,840
Zhang Jinran and Du Ming

689
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,440
but no one

690
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,920
from Cui's Pearl Farm.

691
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,070
Did he not see

692
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,520
or did he not find

693
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,110
the ones you sent?

694
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,520
Why would we send someone

695
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,270
to kill him if there were not those two?

696
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,880
I...

697
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,920
No.

698
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,000
Not right.

699
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,750
Zhang Jinran was setting a trap.

700
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,000
The killers came back

701
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,040
and saw Zhang Jinran back at The Mirage.

702
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,270
Was he alone

703
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,840
or with someone else?

704
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,190
Zhang Jinran returned

705
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,070
to The Mirage alone.

706
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,960
The killer was followed.

707
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,270
We were exposed.

708
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,670
It was my fault.

709
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,520
Where is the killer now?

710
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Right outside the door.

711
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,630
Get up.

712
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,440
Now.

713
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,440
Kill him

714
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,550
quietly.

715
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,550
Go.

716
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,800
Yes.

717
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,190
I followed the killer
to Xu Nanying's place.

718
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,630
The killer

719
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,590
went to see Xu Lin.

720
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,360
It's really him.

721
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,590
Since he's so nervous

722
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,590
that he tried to kill you,

723
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,270
I'm afraid we're deeply involved in it.

724
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,750
Xu Nanying and I were fellows,

725
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,840
but now, he's become like this.

726
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,230
My master would be heartbroken

727
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,480
if he knew.

728
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,270
So what do we do next?

729
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,800
Send the ledger secretly to Beijing

730
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,070
and hand it over to Prince Ying.

731
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,960
When the matter of Cui's Pearl Farm's
tribute pearls is irreparable,

732
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,320
take the opportunity
to report it to the Emperor

733
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,710
and ask for a thorough investigation.

734
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:51,710
Yes.

735
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,820
[Sister, Yan Zilin]

736
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,800
The secret agent wrote back.

737
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,920
Back then, Cui Ding did pass

738
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,510
through Shaozhou
after leaving Yan's house.

739
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,000
Any news from Shaozhou?

740
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,190
Not yet.

741
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,150
We have to step up
our game in Guangzhou.

742
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,880
We can't stay here for long.

743
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,860
[Sister, Yan Zilin]

744
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,190
Be careful.

745
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,150
Hold it lightly.

746
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,510
Be careful.

747
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,110
Mr. Cao.

748
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,320
Take another count.

749
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,000
Okay.

750
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,150
Zai.

751
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,280
Today, Master gave Duanwu

752
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,110
a new set of clothes

753
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,670
and a lot of jewelry.

754
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,840
They're all very nice.

755
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,670
Why?

756
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,840
Don't you know this?

757
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,070
Duanwu is going to do something big
with Accountant Wei.

758
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,510
Do something big with Accountant Wei?

759
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,110
Duanwu is really something.

760
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,280
Of course.

761
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,150
When we're done, let's get a drink.

762
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,670
No. I said I'd see Duanwu off.

763
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,670
Accountant Wei hasn't come down yet,

764
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,320
so we can come back
after we get some water.

765
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,360
Okay.

766
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,550
Let's go.

767
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,670
Let's go.

768
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,360
Sisters.

769
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:27,840
Drink water.

770
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,710
We'll go down

771
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and get some water.

772
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,960
Okay.

773
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,670
Take it easy.

774
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,110
Hurry up.

775
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,230
Okay.

776
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,960
Mr. Cao.

777
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,230
Follow me.

778
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
Be careful. Don't let Master find out.

779
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,000
Then

780
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,710
you can speak louder from now on.

781
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,230
What are you doing?

782
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,710
Ten catties of scrap you handled
are missing.

783
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,670
How dare you

784
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,440
embezzle public property?

785
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:33,550
I didn't.

786
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,880
Don't argue. Arrest him.

787
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,960
- I didn't. You're wronging me.
- Come on.

788
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,440
You're slandering me.

789
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,960
Let me go.

790
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,280
Let me go.

791
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,480
You're slandering me.

792
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,550
Duanwu.

793
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,320
Xiu.

794
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,070
Hu.

795
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,920
You look so pretty today.

796
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,800
This hairpin is so chic.

797
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,880
By the way, have you seen Shrimp?

798
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,670
I can't find him.

799
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,320
I think Shrimp

800
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:07,150
went to the bilge with Loud for water.

801
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,960
Right.

802
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,150
Duanwu.

803
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,800
Let's go.

804
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Tell him

805
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,320
I'm going out and will be back
as soon as I can.

806
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:15,800
Okay.

807
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,480
I'll bring you some goodies.

808
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:16,800
Nice.

809
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,070
These scraps were 100 catties,

810
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,800
and I weighed them in front of you,

811
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,920
so how can they be 110 catties

812
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,670
in the ledge?

813
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,280
Still quibbling? I'll...

814
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,110
You do it.

815
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,880
Mr. Cao, this is...

816
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,140
Not a misunderstanding.

817
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,450
Assistant Pang is here,

818
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,880
so who would frame him?

819
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,360
On this ship, whoever makes a mistake

820
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,880
has to receive punishment.

821
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,440
I didn't make a mistake.

822
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,400
Hit him.

823
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,480
Shrimp.

824
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,760
I'm going to Duanwu.

825
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,230
Don't go to her.

826
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,030
Duanwu has

827
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,440
