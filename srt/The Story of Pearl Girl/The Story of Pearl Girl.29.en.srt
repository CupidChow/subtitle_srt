[Episode 29]

12
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,990
Such a lavish spread today!

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,320
Please sit down first.

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,070
Wipe your hands.

15
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,600
What does Master Zheng say?

16
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,120
This Yan family

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,680
really has a deep blood feud

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,510
with the Cui and Zheng families.

19
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,480
Back then, Cui and Zheng joined forces

20
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,000
to take over the Yan family,

21
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,110
leading to their massacre by the Black Dragon Bandits.

22
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,720
So,

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
do you still want to kill Yan Zijing?

24
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,830
That's always been the way.

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,950
Business is naturally bloody.

26
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,390
Business...

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,600
Over a single Red Leaf Crown,

28
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,070
costing my brother's life,

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,440
consuming millions from our family fortune,

30
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,600
and being involved in the smuggling scandal,

31
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,230
almost couldn't escape.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,790
So, I don't believe

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,480
your father would remain unmoved.

34
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,720
He's always been cautious.

35
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,550
He said he's just testing the waters

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,070
to see if Yan Zijing came for the Black Dragon Bandits.

37
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:08,790
Wu,

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
if the Yan family truly was framed and destroyed

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,630
by the Cui and Zheng families,

40
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,440
do you think Yan Zijing will let this go

41
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,230
now that he's back in Yangzhou?

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,070
The Cui family

43
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,320
is a lesson from the past.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,110
He must die.

45
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
I didn't expect Ms. Su to actually keep your word.

46
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,230
Count it.

47
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,600
There is five hundred thousand mace,

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,070
not six hundred thousand.

49
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,880
No need to count.

50
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,870
I've sold off everything from Clear Mind.

51
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,310
I sold all the jewelry.

52
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
This is all the cash we got.

53
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,990
Not a penny more.

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,840
I never compromise.

55
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,430
What I want is six hundred thousand mace,

56
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,600
not a penny less.

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,750
In partnerships, profits and losses are always our own responsibility.

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,750
No business always makes a profit.

59
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,520
You've been in the business longer than me.

60
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,280
You should understand this better than I do.

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,550
What you're saying doesn't concern me,

62
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,990
but let me tell you,

63
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,600
if it's even a penny short,

64
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,600
I will make sure you will never stand

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,310
in Yangzhou again.

66
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,960
When have I ever stood in Yangzhou?

67
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,040
Clear Mind has been reduced to this today.

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,280
Do you think I feel good about it?

69
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,670
When all the jewelry shops suppressed Clear Mind,

70
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,670
what were you doing?

71
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,870
Did you lift a finger?

72
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,080
You didn't.

73
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,790
How do you have the nerve to ask me for six hundred thousand?

74
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,280
Who was it that made such a promise?

75
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,040
Who turned Clear Mind into this?

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,350
How do you have the nerve to sit here?

77
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,920
How do you have the nerve to bargain with me?

78
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,310
Even if you force me to death,

79
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,190
I still have only five hundred thousand mace.

80
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,920
My life's a wreck,

81
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,310
not a penny more.

82
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,670
Meeting someone as shameless as you,

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
I've truly opened my eyes.

84
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,190
Fine.

85
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,670
I'll consider myself unlucky,

86
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,160
but from now on,

87
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,750
don't let me run into you in Yangzhou again.

88
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,640
Sorry, sir.

89
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,520
We only sell jewelry.

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,840
We don't buy jewelry back.

91
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,400
Sir,

92
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
these shabby pieces,

93
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,310
I'll sell them for a hundred thousand mace.

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,230
That won't work.

95
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,110
I can't make that decision.

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,720
How about eighty thousand?

97
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,990
Sir, the rules here are strict.

98
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,190
I can't go against them.

99
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,190
Perhaps you should try asking elsewhere.

100
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,190
Take care.

101
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:53,670
You ran into Yingpeng?

102
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,520
How dare the Black Dragon Bandits enter Yangzhou?

103
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,670
They even dared to collude in Chang'an,

104
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,990
let alone Yangzhou.

105
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,670
This is the Yan family's glassmaking technique.

106
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,350
Yan Family Glass?

107
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,670
Duanwu,

108
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,550
it's late.

109
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,160
What are you looking at?

110
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,870
The Persian glassware from Jubao House

111
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,670
is the finest in Yangzhou,

112
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,670
worth a fortune.

113
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,670
But their supply

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,670
still depends on Persia.

115
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,280
I was thinking,

116
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:40,760
if Clear Mind could make glass,

117
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,100
our own glass,

118
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,640
even if it's just for accessories,

119
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,710
even if

120
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,590
it's just these glass hairpins,

121
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,760
then we could break

122
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,760
Clear Mind's

123
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,590
lack of foundation,

124
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,550
and from then on,

125
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,640
our supply wouldn't be controlled by others.

126
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,830
But Jubao House excels at glassmaking,

127
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,470
and they're the only one in Yangzhou.

128
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,590
If we also start making glass...

129
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,040
Duanwu, are you trying to revenge on the Zheng family

130
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,000
for Lady Huan's death?

131
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,000
Clear Mind has become so bad,

132
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,070
and I can't escape the blame.

133
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,470
It's all because I was too hasty.

134
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,360
A heart like a clear mirror

135
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,670
is what helps one go far.

136
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,640
Let me tell you

137
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,950
why I want to make glass.

138
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,920
This is the Yangzhou jewelry map Mr. Zhang gave me.

139
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,470
It includes all the techniques and jewelry

140
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,070
from 67 jewelry shops in Yangzhou.

141
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,400
But look here,

142
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,950
before, in Yangzhou,

143
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,830
there were glass workshops,

144
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,830
not just Jubao House alone.

145
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,190
Like Qin's Glass Workshop.

146
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,710
Mr. Qin...

147
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,190
So...

148
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,640
We can ask Mr. Qin to help us!

149
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:34,950
If we do that,

150
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,400
it will be the best solution.

151
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,070
So, you're not trying to shut down Clear Mind,

152
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,950
but using this opportunity

153
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,470
to have Zheng Wu completely withdraw.

154
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,670
After that, there will be no more ties with them.

155
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,400
Duanwu, you really think ahead.

156
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,000
But with Zheng Wu pulling out,

157
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,400
we're left struggling.

158
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,590
And soon, we have to pay back

159
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,520
Xue Liniang and the others.

160
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,760
What do we do about their money?

161
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,950
We will definitely repay them.

162
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
First, give them the IOU.

163
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,830
Xue Liniang and the others

164
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,120
are reasonable people.

165
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,360
They've worked hard to earn that money.

166
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,710
That's why I am anxious.

167
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,280
Then this time,

168
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,310
we're betting everything to survive.

169
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,430
Let's take a chance,

170
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,640
one last chance.

171
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,000
Go!

172
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:09,880
We need them alive!

173
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,120
There's someone in the forest. Let's go!

174
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,040
Hurry!

175
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,400
It's a trap!

176
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:30,000
Retreat!

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,430
Yes!

178
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,360
Find an exit!

179
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,950
Protect the Master!

180
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,120
Master!

181
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,070
Master!

182
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,520
Master!

183
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:30,950
Master!

184
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,120
Master!

185
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,360
Hurry!

186
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,430
Go!

187
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:45,760
Go!

188
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,400
Hurry, go!

189
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,360
Go!

190
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,830
Hurry!

191
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,120
Master!

192
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,040
Go!

193
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,880
Go, retreat!

194
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,760
Gee up!

195
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,550
Gee up!

196
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,360
Lady Shiqi!

197
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,000
Lady Shiqi!

198
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,000
Lady Shiqi!

199
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,430
We're in trouble.

200
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,950
There are traps set all around Zhenlang Pavilion.

201
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,280
We need to hide here for now.

202
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,920
How did you get in?

203
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,310
You're badly injured. Go to the medical hall.

204
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,190
Don't let Duanwu see you.

205
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,280
- Help us out! - Hurry up and get out!

206
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,880
There are traps outside. I'm begging you.

207
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,190
What happened, Yunxiu?

208
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,950
Duanwu...

209
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,920
What's going on?

210
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,640
Duanwu!

211
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,640
We found the Black Dragon Bandits.

212
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,070
It was an ambush.

213
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,430
Now Zhenlang Pavilion is surrounded.

214
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,310
Can we rest here for a while?

215
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,950
Yunxiu, take him to the back room.

216
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:02,470
Alright.

217
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,360
Yunxiu, wait.

218
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,190
Alright.

219
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,880
Useless!

220
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,880
How could you let him get away?

221
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,430
It should have been a success.

222
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,240
But who knew Yan Zijing had left people

223
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,470
on the outside?

224
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,120
But although Yan Zijing escaped,

225
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,950
he was severely wounded.

226
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
From now on,

227
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,640
send people to watch all herbal shops and medical halls in town.

228
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,040
Write down anyone who buys medicine or calls for a doctor,

229
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,310
especially those related to Yan Zijing.

230
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,640
Not a single person should escape notice!

231
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,950
When I was waiting around Zhenlang Pavilion,

232
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,280
I saw Lady Shiqi from Clear Mind leave.

233
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,670
It looked like she was headed for the medical hall.

234
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,760
Impossible.

235
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,190
Su Muzhe and Yan Zijing

236
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,120
have a grudge that can't be resolved.

237
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,550
If there's enough profit at stake,

238
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,990
any hatred can be temporarily set aside.

239
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,640
No matter where Yan Zijing is hiding,

240
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,710
letting him go is asking for endless trouble.

241
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,710
We can't afford to waste any time.

242
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,430
Wu,

243
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,400
it's time to call on Mr. Xu.

244
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,990
Now that we've made our move,

245
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,400
there's no turning back.

246
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,360
Go.

247
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,120
Use this.

248
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,990
I'll handle it. Apply the medicine first.

249
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,880
[Clear Mind]

250
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,670
Mr. Xu,

251
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,950
bandits broke into Jubao House, killing and wounding innocents.

252
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,270
They're suspected to have fled to Clear Mind.

253
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,120
Please investigate.

254
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,670
Search!

255
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,640
Su Muzhe,

256
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,840
Mr. Xu is investigating the case.

257
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,760
Hurry up and come out to meet him!

258
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,880
Search!

259
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,320
What are you doing?

260
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,230
What's going on?

261
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,080
Nanying,

262
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,190
You came without saying a word?

263
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,670
In the middle of the night,

264
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,430
what are you doing at Clear Mind?

265
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,990
We are all men.

266
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,320
What do you think I'm doing here?

267
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
But what about you?

268
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,840
Bringing so many soldiers,

269
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,600
looking into a case?

270
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,470
Today, Jubao House was attacked by bandits,

271
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,920
and there were many casualties.

272
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,190
The Governor's office is carrying out a city-wide manhunt.

273
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,120
There's word

274
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,750
that the bandits might be hiding in Clear Mind.

275
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,230
That's why I came to search.

276
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,800
Nanying, what are you talking about?

277
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,430
Yangzhou has always been peaceful.

278
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,840
How could there be bandits here,

279
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,080
killing so many people?

280
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,320
This matter must be thoroughly investigated!

281
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,230
I, too,

282
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,640
must fulfill my duty as Inspector.

283
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,710
I'll report it to the court.

284
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,640
A few bandits

285
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,360
are not worth troubling the Emperor over.

286
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,800
Search!

287
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,080
Nanying!

288
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:13,950
Nanying,

289
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,750
wait...

290
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:20,510
Oh,

291
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
what's going on?

292
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,320
Muzhe,

293
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,510
You're suffering from such severe chills.

294
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,600
Why are you out here?

295
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,360
Well...

296
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,120
Greetings, Mr. Xu.

297
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,750
Greetings, Mr. Wu.

298
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,320
What happened at Clear Mind?

299
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,360
Why are there so many people here?

300
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,080
Just now, Mr. Xu said bandits broke into Jubao House

301
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,230
and killed quite a few people.

302
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,880
He said the suspects fled to our Clear Mind.

303
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,920
So, he brought soldiers to search.

304
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,640
Jubao House...

305
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,080
They fled to my Clear Mind?

306
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,160
Oh, they're at Clear Mind...

307
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,160
If they are here,

308
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,120
then, Mr. Xu, please search.

309
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,030
A search will help us feel at ease.

310
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,510
Yes, Nanying.

311
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,920
Why haven't you even put your clothes on properly?

312
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,640
Carry on with your search.

313
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:25,880
Jinran,

314
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,080
you're now the Inspector of Huainandao.

315
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,560
You serve the imperial court.

316
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,750
Your health is important.

317
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,880
Look at you, working day and night.

318
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,710
It's getting late.

319
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,510
Then,

320
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,990
I won't bother you further.

321
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,030
Won't you search?

322
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,080
Ms. Su, you don't seem to be feeling well.

323
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,160
In a couple of days,

324
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,120
I'll have someone

325
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,600
bring over some medicinal prescriptions

326
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,430
Thank you for looking after me, Mr. Xu.

327
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,430
Thank you.

328
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,270
I have some urgent matters to attend to.

329
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,160
Farewell.

330
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,030
Take care.

331
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,750
Let's search somewhere else!

332
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,190
Yes, sir!

333
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,360
Retreat!

334
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,160
Mr. Xu,

335
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:09,920
we...

336
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,560
Come by often, Mr. Xu!

337
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,160
Zheng Wu,

338
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,190
would you like to stay for a while?

339
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,880
Your performance today

340
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,360
was really impressive.

341
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,920
Mr. Zheng,

342
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:32,840
rest up early.

343
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,950
Let me escort you back. It's cold outside.

344
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,470
Take care.

345
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,640
Mr. Xu, please wait!

346
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,470
[Clear Mind]

347
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:53,990
Mr. Xu...

348
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,800
Yan Zijing must be here at Clear Mind.

349
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,750
Who ordered you to kill Yan Zijing?

350
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,190
Now you've made such a big scene.

351
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,800
Am I someone the Zheng family can command?

352
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,160
Mr. Xu,

353
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,950
you and the Zheng family both serve under Prince Ying's command,

354
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,360
Helping each other is only natural.

355
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,470
From now on, you need to think things through more carefully.

356
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,750
There aren't many young men left in the Zheng family.

357
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:31,840
Retreat!

358
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,840
I'll follow Mr. Xu's advice!

359
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,600
Everyone's gone.

360
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,160
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

361
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,710
You called me here today

362
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,880
just to help Yan Zijing?

363
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
He found the Black Dragon Bandits on the outskirts of Yangzhou.

364
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,670
The Black Dragon Bandits injured him.

365
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,670
I have no reason not to save him.

366
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,030
You're just giving yourself

367
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:16,880
a reason to save him.

368
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,950
I'm not trying to dig into your wounds.

369
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,430
What happened when you both set off from Langhuan Dockyard?

370
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,670
What happened after that?

371
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,880
What happened when your convoy was ambushed?

372
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,920
Why did you and Yan Zijing

373
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,430
fall out?

374
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,470
Back then, I made an agreement with Yan Zijing

375
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,230
to meet at Piti Spring.

376
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
He would lure out the Black Dragon Bandits,

377
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,750
and I would lead my men to eliminate them.

378
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,600
But when I arrived,

379
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
I didn't find any of you.

380
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,470
Later, I heard

381
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,880
that near Langhuan Dockyard,

382
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,320
the Black Dragon Bandits had ambushed your convoy.

383
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,750
But when I got there,

384
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,190
the place was covered with bodies.

385
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,160
I even saw that among Yan Zijing's guards,

386
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,430
there were our native people

387
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,320
and also Sogdians.

388
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,080
You must have recruited warriors and were about to leave.

389
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,670
Mr. Zhang,

390
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,640
back then...

391
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,600
Wait, did you just mention

392
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,470
there were Sogdians?

393
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,640
There were no Sogdians in the convoy.

394
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,320
That's impossible.

395
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,160
I saw it with my own eyes.

396
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,120
Could it be that the Black Dragon Bandits

397
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,080
disguised themselves as guards and infiltrated the convoy,

398
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,270
planning to do something sinister?

399
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,750
Duanwu, the convoy guards want to kill us!

400
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,880
Run!

401
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,120
Run, Duanwu!

402
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,160
Shrimp!

403
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,950
The convoy guards want to kill us!

404
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,990
They've all left?

405
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,840
Why would there be Sogdians in the convoy?

406
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,800
I don't know.

407
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,190
Supervisor Kang,

408
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,670
I've never hidden anything from you.

409
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,360
I just want to know

410
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,360
what exactly happened in the desert.

411
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,920
So many people died in the desert.

412
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,600
We were fully prepared.

413
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,030
We meant to use the convoy to lure out the Black Dragon Bandits,

414
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,710
but who would have thought

415
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,360
that they would cross the border,

416
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,990
disguise themselves as our guards, and ambush us?

417
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,510
Do you know why Yan Zijing

418
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,990
shot that arrow at you?

419
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,430
Because at that moment, Li Kui's arrow was already aimed at you.

420
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,600
In a split second, he had no other choice.

421
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,670
He didn't want you to know that it was the Black Dragon Bandits,

422
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,080
that it was Li Kui who killed Shrimp,

423
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,950
killed Cao Da,

424
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:07,360
and killed everyone in the convoy.

425
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,260
♪As time dissolves without a trace...♪

426
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,190
If you had known...

427
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,540
♪Fate drifts in silence...♪

428
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,080
what would you have done?

429
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,120
If you had known,

430
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,640
would you still be the same Su Muzhe now?

431
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,880
If we hadn't kept this from you,

432
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,360
what would you have done?

433
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,880
That's something Yan Zijing himself may never achieve in this life.

434
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,840
How could he possibly

435
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,640
let you do it alone?

436
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,800
He threw you away at Langhuan Dockyard

437
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,320
because he wanted to protect you.

438
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,920
He didn't want you to fall into danger.

439
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
He'd rather you hate him.

440
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,360
At least, he'd never hurt you.

441
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,030
I've always been by his side,

442
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,120
and I know how much pain he's in.

443
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,880
But you've never known

444
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,430
that hating you hurts more than hating the Black Dragon Bandits.

445
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,800
Why did you make decisions for me?

446
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,080
Did you never believe in me,

447
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,470
or did you never believe in yourself?

448
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,640
Foolish!

449
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,080
Who told you to do this?

450
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
How are you acting so impulsively,

451
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,120
like Zheng Si?

452
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,840
If he truly is a remnant of the Yan family,

453
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,880
shouldn't we make a move?

454
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,030
Originally, we could have dealt with him in secret,

455
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,750
but now you've exposed the entire Zheng family!

456
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,710
So what?

457
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,230
Father,

458
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,950
since he's an enemy of the Zheng family,

459
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,640
just kill him!

460
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,270
We must kill him, of course.

461
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,430
Those who are already in the ground

462
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,600
should be wiped out completely.

463
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,800
But Zheng Wu, remember this:

464
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,320
Never let the Zheng family be harmed!

465
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,510
I understand.

466
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,120
Be careful!

467
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,030
Thank you.

468
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,320
How did I end up here?

469
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,160
Where is Kang Ju?

470
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,230
The wound has been treated.

471
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,360
I'll go heat the medicine.

472
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,600
Wait a moment.

473
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,080
Why are you saving me?

474
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,710
Don't you have something to say to me?

475
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,470
Thank you.

476
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,160
That's all?

477
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:05,710
Don't worry.

478
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:07,950
Once I'm healed,

479
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,110
I'll leave Clear Mind immediately.

480
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,630
Just stay at Clear Mind.

481
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,110
It's safe here.

482
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,070
How is it?

483
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,630
The same.

484
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,150
I'm the same as him.

485
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,400
I can be abandoned just like Zheng Si can.

486
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,950
What's wrong?

487
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,200
Have you found Yan Zijing?

488
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,590
Is he dead?

489
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,400
No.

490
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,800
What are you doing?

491
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,630
Hey...

492
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,470
Are you crazy?

493
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,720
What fine designs!

494
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,880
Why are you burning them?

495
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,990
What do you mean by this, Cui Shijiu?

496
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:56,400
Just because I didn't manage to kill Yan Zijing?

497
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,510
Is he that important to you?

498
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,840
Were you with me

499
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
just to kill Yan Zijing?

500
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,430
Yes.

501
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,070
Mr. Wu.

502
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,990
What?

503
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,030
Bai Niao's invitation.

504
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,590
Lady Shiqi,

505
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
hurry and go after Fifth Young Master!

506
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,990
The Cui family is already gone.

507
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,920
If you anger him,

508
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,720
what will you do in the future?

509
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,240
The Cui family is gone,

510
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,320
and Father is dead.

511
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,470
Yan Zijing is the one who started it all.

512
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,510
But Zheng Wu isn't innocent either.

513
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,150
He's the one who stole

514
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,800
the Pearl Lotus Terrace the Cui family worked so hard on.

515
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:04,880
He's the one

516
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,070
who destroyed the last pillar of the Cui family.

517
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,630
Does he think

518
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,430
I've forgotten?

519
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,400
But before,

520
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,200
didn't you desperately help him?

521
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,470
Of course, I had to help.

522
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,150
Without him,

523
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,840
how could I take revenge on Yan Zijing?

524
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,360
You see,

525
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,030
he doesn't care at all

526
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,200
about me from the ruined Cui family.

527
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,800
He knows

528
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,920
that without him,

529
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,550
I can't survive in Yangzhou.

530
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,950
But he also knows

531
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,030
that for him and me,

532
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,840
it's all just mutual use,

533
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,760
a game of pretense.

534
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,260
[Clear Mind]

535
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,070
How did it go?

536
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,150
What did you say to Duanwu?

537
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,430
I... I didn't say anything.

538
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,280
We have a prisoner alive. I'll interrogate him.

539
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,840
Come back!

540
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,760
What did you really say to her?

541
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,070
I told her

542
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,110
that Shrimp and the others' deaths have nothing to do with you.

543
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,880
Oh...

544
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,150
Why did you tell her that?

545
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,070
Zhang Jinran has already found

546
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,030
that the Black Dragon Bandits infiltrated our convoy,

547
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,840
and he's already told Duanwu.

548
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,920
How could I hide it?

549
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,630
Duanwu is no longer the pearl diver from before.

550
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,400
She will have her own choices.

551
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,200
You saw it yourself.

552
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,630
Although she hates you,

553
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,280
she can't let go of you in the end.

554
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,880
You can't let her live her life

555
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,070
with that hatred toward you forever.

556
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,150
Don't take it too much to heart.

557
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,880
She's already let go.

558
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,030
Why can't you?

559
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,320
What's up?

560
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,720
Ms. Su,

561
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,880
Last night, Yan Zijing was severely injured.

562
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,880
What happened?

563
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,950
What happened isn't important.

564
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,150
What matters is

565
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,720
that we don't know where Yan Zijing is hiding now.

566
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,590
I'll ask you just one thing.

567
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,030
Are you willing to join forces with me to draw him out?

568
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,880
Not willing.

569
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
The smuggling case

570
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,070
almost ruined Clear Mind for good.

571
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,950
Last night,

572
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,470
Mr. Xu came and searched Clear Mind.

573
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,590
It must be related to this case.

574
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,950
I don't want to get involved.

575
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,280
I advise you not to either.

576
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,360
Su Muzhe,

577
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,920
are you afraid now?

578
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,950
Have you forgotten the reason you came to Yangzhou?

579
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,880
Yes, I'm afraid.

580
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,880
Cui Shijiu,

581
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,280
you're different from the Cui family.

582
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,630
Don't let revenge cloud your judgment.

583
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,760
Don't trap yourself in it and get stuck.

584
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,950
Su Muzhe,

585
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,240
do you still hate him?

586
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,720
I see.

587
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,110
Thank you, Mr. Zhang, for saving me yesterday.

588
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,880
It's alright.

589
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,320
There's no need to say that between us.

590
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,880
How did this happen?

591
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,550
What exactly are you investigating?

592
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,920
The century-old Zheng family,

593
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,070
colluding with the Black Dragon Bandits,

594
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,840
openly smuggling in Yangzhou,

595
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:07,920
who's supporting them behind the scenes?

596
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,510
After the incident,

597
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,470
the Governor's office hastily closed the case,

598
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,110
pinning the blame

599
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,720
on the now-destroyed Cui family.

600
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,840
Who's behind this?

601
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,400
What do you think I'm investigating?

602
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,880
Are you trying to say

603
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,630
that behind the Zheng family

604
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,550
is Prince Ying?

605
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,950
Since you figure out this,

606
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,200
are you planning to change your course

607
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,150
or stick to your original purpose?

608
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,320
In this life,

609
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:50,920
I believe only in the law and justice.

610
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,240
I wonder

611
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,550
if you believe in me.

I'm already feeling much better.
