[Episode 6]

12
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,230
You spent so much money,

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,760
but only brought me these?

14
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,200
Yan Zijing colludes

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,040
with the head of Guangzhou's guild
Pan Xinglu,

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,480
and buys Guangzhou's stock of pearls

17
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,310
in bulk with treasure jewelry.

18
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,480
Yan Zijing appears to backstab us

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,070
and force Cui's Pearl Farm to die.

20
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,760
Cui's Pearl Farm can be considered one

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,640
of the top merchants
in the jewelry industry,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,350
so how can we be under the control

23
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,230
of a nobody from Western Regions?

24
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,400
Did my brother write back after I

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,310
asked you to write to him?

26
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,560
Not yet.

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,240
So what if he's powerful now?

28
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,190
Relationships in this place
are deeply intertwined,

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,630
and everyone has his or her own path.

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Cui's Pearl Farm has been here
for years,

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,910
so he should know something about it.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,630
Let's go meet Yan Zijing.

33
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,470
Yes.

34
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,960
Lady Shijiu is no worse than a man.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,470
As a woman, you show up

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,030
and dedicate yourself
to the family business.

37
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,750
I admire that.

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,280
Men and women are both born
and raised by their parents,

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,680
so what's the difference?

40
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,630
Master Yan is a business wizard.

41
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,470
How can you be so biased?

42
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,470
I'm sorry if I'm being rude.

43
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,400
Do you realize you're about
to be in big trouble?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm just a law-abiding businessman,

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,120
so why would I be in trouble?

46
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,840
You bought the pearls at a low price,

47
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,310
but you don't know

48
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,590
that the pearls are needed
by Special Envoy Xu,

49
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:21,520
who is highly respected by Prince Tan.

50
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,840
If you have offended him,

51
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,560
how can you continue to trade here?

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,150
So in your opinion,

53
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,240
how can I make amends?

54
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,080
If you can offer the pearls

55
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,240
to Special Envoy Xu

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,840
and we persuade him in your favor,

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,280
then the problem can be solved,

58
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,080
and Special Envoy Xu
will surely promote you.

59
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
Offer it to him?

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,520
I thought you came here today

61
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,840
to talk business with me.

62
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,750
Business is a transaction.

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,080
Offering him pearls
is an expression of your loyalty,

64
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,520
so it's more important than business.

65
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:16,630
If you have contacts in officialdom,

66
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,630
you won't fear
any business difficulties.

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,630
The official world might be
better suited to the Cui family.

68
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,120
I am a stupid businessman

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,870
who is profit-oriented.

70
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,120
You're so smart

71
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,390
that you predicted
we'd get involved in officialdom.

72
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,720
In that case, name your price.

73
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,240
I like that.

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Kang Ju.

75
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,800
I have

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,360
many pearls,

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,560
but

78
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,480
I don't dare sell them.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,870
A Qizhen pearl

80
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,560
is worth two million mace.

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,310
If it's a tael pearl plus a Babao pearl,

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,240
it's worth 2.2 million mace.

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,510
Are you having a price hike

84
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,160
because you think Master Shijiu
doesn't know the market?

85
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
The price of jewelry
depends on the market,

86
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,800
so why is this a price hike?

87
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,800
You're just being quibbling.

88
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,070
You think we...

89
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,800
Tong.

90
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,630
Don't lose your manners.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,000
Lady Shijiu.

92
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,630
Since you are no worse than any male,

93
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,510
I need not be too polite to you.

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,070
If you can't make the decision,

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,160
then ask the head
of the Cui family to step in

96
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,480
so as not to break the rules

97
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,560
or influence the market.

98
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,430
Since I'm sitting here,

99
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
I can make a decision
for the Cui family.

100
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,560
You hoard commodities so much,

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,830
so aren't you afraid
of losing everything then?

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
I won't bother you with that.

103
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,160
This price

104
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,950
is very good.

105
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,360
Of course.

106
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,630
Look at that.

107
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,510
What's that?

108
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,720
What's that?

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,600
That's the fabric store.

110
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,920
There, the fabric store.

111
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,270
It's beautiful.

112
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,800
Look at that.

113
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,430
It's awesome.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,310
There's a fire show over there.

115
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,310
You can try it.

116
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,360
Sir, I'll take these.

117
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,310
Come on, you can try some.

118
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,830
Give me a few more.

119
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,430
Which one do you want?

120
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,920
This one.

121
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,390
Okay.

122
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,310
Give me one of these, please.

123
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:21,870
And this one.

124
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,510
No problem.

125
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,600
Duanwu, give me one.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,830
It's so good.

127
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,680
It's delicious.

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,190
Please come and take a look.

129
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,160
Come. Look at the hairpin.

130
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,830
Look. This is a nice hairpin.

131
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,870
There's also rouge here.

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,510
If you like it, you can try it on.

133
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,240
This one is beautiful.

134
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll try it on for you.

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,040
There's a bronze mirror.

136
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,630
It's beautiful.

137
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,510
I'll try this on for you.

138
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,070
Come on.

139
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,190
It's nice.

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,430
How much is it?

141
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:42,870
It's nice.

142
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,630
It's made of pure coral.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,630
50 cash.

144
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,680
How much is it?

145
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,190
50 cash.

146
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:49,720
Wait a minute.

147
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,750
It's obviously coral trimmings,

148
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,040
so how can it cost so much?

149
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
Stop.

150
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,040
Are you buying?

151
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,560
Yeah, sure.

152
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,430
Let's go somewhere else.

153
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,310
Duanwu.

154
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,750
Let's go somewhere else.

155
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,360
Let's go.

156
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,190
Go that way.

157
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,720
Let's go.

158
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,310
Let's go.

159
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,040
Shrimp.

160
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,680
OK.

161
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,040
Special Envoy Xu is really not here.

162
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,190
Master Shijiu, please return.

163
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,190
Master Shijiu.

164
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,360
This...

165
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,190
Special Envoy Xu's place is so noble

166
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,240
that even Cui's Pearl Farm
doesn't deserve to be here.

167
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,040
Xu Lin.

168
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,870
You can tell lies

169
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,070
or put on airs

170
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,600
elsewhere,

171
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,070
but why do you dare

172
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,950
to stop Master Shijiu even here?

173
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,480
Ask Master Shijiu to take his seat.

174
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,270
Aye.

175
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,680
I was uninformed,

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,270
so I apologize to you.

177
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,750
Please be seated.

178
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,390
I came here today

179
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,040
because I had a chance

180
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,040
to try this pastry
and thought it was good.

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,680
Then I brought it here

182
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,920
for you to try it.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,430
I am new to Guangzhou,

184
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,800
so I rely on your help.

185
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,160
After all,

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,160
I don't know what I should do

187
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,630
if something happens to the Cui family

188
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,630
and involves you.

189
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,160
Master Shijiu, you are overstating it.

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
You also know that I

191
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,480
have always favored the Cui family,

192
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,270
but lately,

193
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,830
Zhang Jinran
has been keeping an eye on me.

194
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,720
If I insist on

195
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
favoring you for a while,

196
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
I may

197
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,750
be criticized and hindered.

198
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,550
Regarding Zhang Jinran,
I'll do something.

199
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,150
I like dealing with smart people.

200
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,320
You're just in time.

201
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,870
In a few days, come with me

202
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,080
to meet the head of Guangzhou's guild.

203
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,150
Yes, sir.

204
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,270
Thank you, Special Envoy Xu.

205
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,080
See you later.

206
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,870
I suddenly remembered something

207
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,150
and would like your help.

208
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,870
Please let me know

209
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,000
if you need anything.

210
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
I recently

211
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,030
acquired a white jade Guanyin

212
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,960
and would like to dedicate it
to Prince Tan as a birthday gift,

213
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,200
but it lacks

214
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,840
a pearl lotus flower base
to complement it.

215
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,510
It's a pity that it's not as beautiful

216
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,000
as it should be.

217
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,750
Special Envoy Xu.

218
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,750
The immediate priority is

219
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,910
to resolve the matter
of the tribute pearls.

220
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,390
Aren't we working

221
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,790
on your tribute pearls?

222
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,510
Prince Tan's needs are no small matter,

223
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,150
so the pearls must be
of the highest quality.

224
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
Don't worry.

225
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,270
I will pay

226
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,510
for the pearls.

227
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,910
Think of it as me

228
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,270
buying them from Cui's Pearl Farm.

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,550
Of course.

230
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,200
See you.

231
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,870
Buy?

232
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
When has he ever paid for anything?

233
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
What a greedy vampire.

234
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,600
But we have no choice.

235
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,080
Now the tribute pearls are imminent,

236
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,750
so I still need this treacherous guy

237
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,320
to maneuver through it for me.

238
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,270
After this is over,

239
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
we can't have any more dealings
with this man.

240
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,750
Aye.

241
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,630
Shrimp.

242
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,750
Shrimp.

243
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,240
Shrimp.

244
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,670
Come on.

245
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,120
Come on.

246
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,240
Look.

247
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,960
Does this look like a peach blossom?

248
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
Yes, it does.

249
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,270
Doesn't this look better than the one
we saw on the street?

250
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,200
Look.

251
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,630
If I add a little more tassel

252
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,030
down this branch,

253
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,030
do you think

254
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,670
this hairpin will look good?

255
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,080
Yes,

256
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
but Duanwu,

257
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,670
why did you draw this?

258
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,790
You mean this?

259
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,390
I want to make hairpins.

260
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,150
Since we have jewelry,

261
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,870
we can just make a hairpin

262
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,120
out of this scrap jewelry.

263
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,670
Some girls will love it.

264
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,480
But now,

265
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,840
we only have these jewels.

266
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,750
What can we use

267
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,750
for the main part?

268
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,960
Wood?

269
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,630
Wood will crack in water,

270
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,200
so wood definitely won't work.

271
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,200
Duanwu, wait a minute.

272
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,790
What's this?

273
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,200
It's old ship wood.

274
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,120
Duanwu, don't underestimate it.

275
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
old ship wood

276
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,240
is top hardwood.

277
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,750
Soaked in seawater,

278
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,790
it'll never get soaked or cracked.

279
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,670
Then I'll try it with this.

280
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,150
Look.

281
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,840
Duanwu.

282
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,870
Help me...

283
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:38,630
Duanwu.

284
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,030
Dear Hu, why are you still up?

285
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,510
I heard

286
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,600
that Overseer Cao received

287
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,270
the Coral Pearl trafficking assignment
from Assistant Pang

288
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,840
and was allowed
to enter the trading convoy

289
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,670
after the job was done.

290
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,270
Why would someone

291
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,240
as shrewd as him

292
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,390
keep this greedy lapdog with him?

293
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,910
Coral Pearl?

294
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,390
Thank you.

295
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,840
I think Coral Pearl

296
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,630
might be a good way for us.

297
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
Hello, Accountant Wei.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,080
Hello, Assistant Pang.

299
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,480
Assistant Pang.

300
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,790
Sorry to bother you.

301
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
I heard Overseer Cao say

302
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,510
he's selling Coral Pearl for you.

303
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,630
Can I try?

304
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,750
What?

305
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,150
You want to sell Coral Pearl?

306
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,600
It's Coral Pearl,

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,360
not scrap.

308
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,870
If you lose it,

309
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,670
you'll suffer more than a whipping.

310
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,870
It would kill you.

311
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,720
My life isn't worth much,

312
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,960
so I hope you'll give it a chance

313
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,840
and let me try.

314
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,030
Whether you care
about your own life or not,

315
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,510
you have to know the product first.

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Have you seen

317
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,030
Coral Pearl?

318
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,120
Is Assistant Pang selling
this batch of Coral Pearls?

319
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:17,910
It's dyed

320
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,870
and inferior.

321
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,080
It's worthless.

322
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,000
Duanwu.

323
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,360
Do you want to join the trading convoy?

324
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:25,960
Of course.

325
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,030
It's not up to me.

326
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,240
Not up to you?

327
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
But Overseer Cao said

328
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,510
it's your call

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,550
to join the trading convoy.

330
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,870
When did I say that?

331
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,670
Everyone in the lower deck knows that.

332
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,390
Overseer Cao is a slave,

333
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,440
even though he's the head.

334
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,030
If you don't keep your word,

335
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,630
the slaves in the lower deck
will know about this

336
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,240
and the whole ship

337
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,750
will be unsettled.

338
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,630
Duanwu, you know what?

339
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,390
Assistant Pang.

340
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,630
A businessman

341
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,240
must keep his word

342
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,390
after saying something.

343
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,870
Makes sense.

344
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,390
How about this?

345
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,270
Whoever gets the order first

346
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,750
joins the trading convoy.

347
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,550
Thank you, Assistant Pang.

348
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Thank you, Accountant Wei.

349
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,870
Also,

350
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,960
I'm going to bring out a box
of fine Coral Pearls.

351
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,750
It costs 200,000 mace to buy,

352
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,390
so its selling price should be
at least 500,000 mace.

353
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,480
We know you love incense,

354
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,960
so we have prepared
a small gift for you.

355
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,630
Please accept it.

356
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,510
I've seen

357
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,200
a lot of nice things

358
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,960
along the way

359
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,320
from Chang'an to Lingnan,

360
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,200
but I can't get enough

361
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,750
of the Lingnan Pearl.

362
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,080
I'm glad you like it.

363
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,550
But recently, I heard that some people

364
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,240
want to compare
Western Regions colored stone

365
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,750
with Lingnan pearls.

366
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,910
Is this true?

367
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,080
The seniors of several jewelry stores
and I

368
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,440
did recently purchase a batch
of Western Regions colored stone.

369
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,510
After Hepu's accident,

370
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,630
the pearl market is slightly depressed.

371
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,550
Colored stone is a rarity locally.

372
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,200
But even so,

373
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,440
it's a minority item

374
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,440
and not of grace.

375
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,320
Mr. Pan.

376
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,630
You've just become
the head of Guangzhou's guild,

377
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,600
so it's best not to rush into things

378
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,000
until you know what's going on

379
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,390
so you don't end up
making everyone unhappy

380
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,320
or bringing shame to Lingnan Pearls.

381
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,320
You're right.

382
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:02,270
Lingnan pearls are rare,

383
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,310
so I don't want them all

384
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,830
to fall into other people's hands.

385
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,200

Yes.

Yes, it is.

It looks very luxurious.

so I pray
to the South Sea God every day.

448
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,110
Perhaps because South Sea God

449
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,750
was moved by my devotion,

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,350

and sets up their own torture chambers.

524

jumping out of the water

but I sincerely hope you

543
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,720
don't do anything against your will

545
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,070

but I can't help it.

549

Mr. Zhang, I can't help it.

550
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,440
I wanted to sell Coral Pearl
to Zhuobao House,

551
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,240
but I'm new here,

552
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,590
so why would they do business with me

553
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,110
or trust me?

554
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Noble people will do what is right.

555
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,960
A businessman will say nice things

556
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,960
in order to make a profit.

557

558
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,160

559
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,720
to start a pearl poetry gathering.

560
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,350
It's the same thing

561
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,880
as your promotion of Blessing Red Coral,

562
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,310
but you can only fool some people
for a while

563
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,590
if you use blessing as a gimmick.

564
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,590
If Lady Wu doesn't get lucky later

565
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,030
and gets angry,

566
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,350
will she hold it against you?

567
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,920
Yan Zijing's business

568
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,830
is a deadly fight.

569
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,550
It's too aggressive,

570
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,070
but Duanwu, you're different.

571
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,510
You have to keep your heart true.

572
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:31,960
A utilitarian approach

573
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,480
won't last long.

574
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,720
If you are sincere

575
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,640
with Lady Wu just now,

576
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,920
maybe she'll give you more business

577
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,550
and become friends

578
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,510
with you later.

579
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,030
She won't.

580
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,270
How can someone

581
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,720
like me be her friend?

582
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,070
You will.

583
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
Today,

584
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,680
you told me the truth

585
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,550
about Cui Ding,

586
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,550
so we are still friends.

587
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,350
But how can I apologize to Lady Wu?

588
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm just like you.

589
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,590
The fortune teller said
I'm a plague on my husband.

590
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,750
That fortune teller...

591
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,310
Is it really her destiny?

592
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,510
Come on.

593
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,350
Thank you.

594
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,920
Come again. See you.

595
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,200
Miss, what kind of clothes do you want?

596
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,000
Ma'am,

597
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,480
do you have any fine clothes?

598
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,200
A new shipment just arrived today.

599
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,880
Come on. Take a look.

600
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,350
This is the most fashionable fabric

601
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,310
and the latest style.

602
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,640
All the famous nobles here want it.

603
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,550
Do you like it?

604
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,880
That fortune teller
is only for the rich.

605
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,160
Yes.

606
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,400
Yes.

607
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,200
Madam.

608
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,720
Could you rent it to me for half a day?

609
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,200
We sell all our clothes here.

610
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,960
Miss.

611
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,680
Are you going to see your lover?

612
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,510
No.

613
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,920
I want to make amends to a lady

614
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,350
by doing something for her.

615
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,960
Okay, then.

616
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,270
Since you want to make amends,

617
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,110
I'll do what you want this time,

618
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
but please keep it safe.

619
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,400
Let me wrap it up for you.

620
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,400
Here you go.

621
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,160
Lady Wu.

622
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,310
I'm Duanwu.

623
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,160
I'm...

624
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,790
What?

625
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,270
How dare you even come to my house?

626
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,270
It's not what you think.

627
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,400
I've come to apologize to you.

628
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,480
I did have the wrong idea today

629
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,310
and wanted to approach you
with the red coral.

630
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,400
I'm one of Yan's Trading Convoy,

631
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,830
so I have Coral Pearl

632
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,510
and want to sell it to Zhuobao House.

633
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,110
That's why I did such a stupid thing

634
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,270
and made you sad.

635
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm very sorry.

636
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,720
You're honest,

637
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,400
but my father is in charge of business,

638
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,160
not me.

639
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,350
You're talking to the wrong person.

640
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,350
It's not about business.

641
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
It's not about business

642
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,110
or red coral.

643
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,750
It's about you.

644
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,830
I want to help you.

645
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,110
Do you think I'll ever trust you again?

646
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,720
I was born with bad luck,

647
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,480
so it's no wonder
you've come to lie to me too.

648
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,480
I'm sorry.

649
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,720
I'm really sorry.

650
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,750
I know you're a little depressed,

651
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,750
but I'd like to say

652
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,110
that luck doesn't depend

653
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,720
on things

654
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,000
but on people.

655
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,720
Please believe me

656
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,640
for the last time.

657
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,240
Master.

658
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,640
Master.

659
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,480
My friend is the ninth daughter
of the Pan family.

660
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm a distant cousin
of a jewelry shop in Guangzhou.

661
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,000
I've heard that you're skillful
in reading fortunes,

662
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,200
so I've come

663
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,240
to ask you to read my fortune.

664
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,880
You are good-looking.

665
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,830
I can tell you're from a rich family.

666
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,720
But there's a curse

667
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,720
on your forehead,

668
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,830
so you're destined for a disaster.

669
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,960
Master,

670
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,110
what is it?

671
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,400
Miss.

672
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,960
The fairy said

673
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,310
your husband

674
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,720
died because of you.

675
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,550
I knew

676
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,070
I caused my husband's death.

677
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,640
If I had known I would live

678
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,590
such a lonely life,

679
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
I should have died with you.

680
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,480
Is that okay?

681
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,110
Don't be too sad.

682
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,240
Your husband...

683
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,480
My husband was most worried

684
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,720
about me before he died.

685
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,720
Now he has passed away,

686
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,960
but he is still worried about me.

687
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,680
Today, knowing I've come
to ask for your help,

688
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,550
he came with me.

689
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,960
Came with you?

690
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,200
My husband

691
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,030
is right behind you.

692
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,480
How dare you be so rude?

693
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,880
I've never been married,

694
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,960
so how could I have a husband?

695
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,480
Aren't you the ninth daughter
of the Pan family?

696
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,590
Why do you know about
the ninth daughter of the Pan family?

697
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,350
I'm just a slave.

698
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,590
Knowing some news

699
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,720
of famous families,

700
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,160
you're swindling everywhere.

701
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,590
And you told Lady Wu's fortune

702
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,750
and said she was a plague
on her husband.

703
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,720
Of those two,

704
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,240
one fell off a horse
and the other died of disease.

705
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,830
What does that have to do with Lady Wu?

706
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,960
Do you know how many rumors

707
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,350
she suffered because of you?

708
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,830
Are you really telling fortunes?

709
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,200
You're trying to kill people for money.

710
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,510
Miss.

711
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,920
My fortune-telling in the past
was pure nonsense.

712
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,110
I was just making some money.

713
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,110
Please spare me.

714
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,310
Please spare me.

715
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,480
Don't dirty my clothes.
I'll give it back.

716
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,480
Get her.

717
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,510
Let go of me.

718
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,760
Please spare me.

719
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,550
You're a fraud
and a disgrace to the gods.

720
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,550
Take her to the official.

721
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,190
Yes, Madam.

722
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,550
Please forgive me.

723
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,920
Please forgive me.
I won't dare to do it again.

724
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,320
Lady Wu.

725
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,110
You saw that just now.

726
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,880
I wish you all the best in the future.

727
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,590
Goodbye.

728
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,070
Duanwu.

729
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,440
How are your new clothes?

730
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
Don't worry.

731
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,360
It's not dirty.

732
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,840
I can return it.

733
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,590
Thank you.

734
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,440
I'm not in a position
to accept your thanks.

735
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,230
It's my fault in the first place.

736
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,150
I should apologize.

737
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,360
I'm sorry to say that,

738
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,630
but a woman shouldn't be bound

739
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,480
by her so-called destiny.

740
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,880
Remember.

741
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,760
Don't look back.

742
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,510
Dark clouds can't hide the sun.

743
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:35,960
From now on,

744
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,000
you don't have to wear a veil.

745
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,550
Do you still want to sell Coral Pearl?

746
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,880
Thanks, Dad.

747
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,510
Duanwu.

748
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,920
Thanks, Mr. Feng.

749
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,630
Thanks, Lady Wu.

750
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,710
This is my first order

751
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,960
in my life.

752
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,760
If this sells well,

753
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,030
I'll come back and order from you.

754
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,000
Okay,

755
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,230
Duanwu.

756
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,320
You can call me Wu from now on.

757
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,190
Wu.

758
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,840
Mr. Feng, we...

759
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,880
This is...

760
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,670
Don't break it.

761
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,360
Duanwu.

762
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,400
You...

763
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,030
This is the slave on our ship.

764
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,360
It's the same if she signs it or I do.

765
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,800
It's not the same.

766
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,150
Duanwu negotiated this order with me.

767
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,550
Duanwu.

768
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,960
30% of the profits

769
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,070
from slave Duanwu's jewelry
and other items

770
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,960
go to Yan's Trading Convoy.

771
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,840
Is this true?

772
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,400
A deposit from Zhuobao House.

773
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,670
We can deliver the goods tomorrow.

774
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,320
Do you still think

775
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
this is false?

776
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,150
It's great.

777
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,670
I sold Coral Pearl,

778
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,400
so can I enter the trading convoy?

779
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,400
This requires Master's approval.

780
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,590
Master's approval?

781
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,400
We had a deal,

782
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,480
and that's not
what you told Overseer Cao.

783
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,960
Master's approval?

784
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,190
When will he approve?

785
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,400
Wait a minute.

786
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,960
It's...

787
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,510
No way.

788
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,360
You're being greedy on both sides.

789
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,360
You're selling goods
under the trading convoy name

790
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,400
while stealing from the trading convoy

791
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,440
to sell your own goods to your clients.

792
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,630
I'd like to know
how she explains about this.

793
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,030
The mica on the hairpin

794
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,670
is scrap that I bought.

795
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,440
The wood on the hairpin

796
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
is old ship wood
that was abandoned on the ship.

797
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,510
Why do you say it's stolen?

798
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,800
Even if these were yours,

799
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,230
you sold them

800
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,030
under the name of the trading convoy.

801
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:22,920
30% of the sales

802
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
of these things

803
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,070
have been agreed upon to be divided
amongst the trading convoy.

804
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,030
It is very clear.

805
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,360
I...

806
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,230
Stop.

807
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,840
It's no one else's fault
if you can't sell.

808
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,030
At Yan's Trading Convoy,

809
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,670
whoever can sell is the boss.

810
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,510
Overseer Cao,

811
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,550
if you like this pin, tell me.

812
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,440
I'll make one in your size,

813
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,190
okay?

814
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
Don't forget

815
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,440
to let me into the trading convoy.

816
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,550
It's really difficult
to invite Master Yan.

817
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,110
Special Envoy Xu
sent out the invitation,

818
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,320
so how dare I disobey?

819
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,440
Master Yan, you've been

820
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,760
so successful and popular

821
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,190
in Guangzhou these days

822
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,230
while

823
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,150
I've been having

824
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,230
a hard time.

825
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,030
You are flattering me.

826
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,760
Haven't you already instructed Mr. Pan?

827
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,630
However,

828
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,630
business is business.

829
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,000
Since we placed the order
and signed the contract,

830
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,630
we have to act
according to the contract.

831
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,840
Special Envoy Xu.

832
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,150
Are you keeping an eye
on the jewelry shop

833
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,880
in Guangzhou for the officials

834
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,590
to mess up your own business?

835
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,230
The business of jewelry in Guangzhou

836
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,110
belongs to jewelry shop owners

837
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,230
instead of me.

838
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,400
That was my mistake.

839
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,510
But Master Yan, are your recent moves

840
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,510
for monopolizing the Guangzhou market,

841
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,280
suppressing Lingnan pearls

842
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,630
with Western Regions colored stone,

843
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,590
and messing up
the local jewelry business?

844
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,550
Even if there is no
Western Regions colored stone,

845
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,550
Hepu pearls cannot be handed over.

846
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,800
When you talk about others,

847
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,000
you'd better see if you've taken care
of your own business first.

848
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,400
We are here for a drink.

849
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,710
We don't have to

850
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,320
talk business now.

851
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:21,800
Come on.

852
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,150
Master Yan has come a long way,

853
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,190
so I must not let you go home
empty-handed.

854
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,230
For this,

855
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,280
I'm well aware,

856
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,840
but Hepu Pearl is a local industry,

857
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,510
and you want a piece of it.

858
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,840
You're too ambitious.

859
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,710
This is my only shortcoming.

860
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,800
Businessmen are driven by profit,

861
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,230
but yes,

862
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,510
I want Western Regions colored stone

863
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,710
and pearls.

864
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,590
Western Regions colored stone

865
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,400
and pearls?

866
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,840
Fortunately, my words carry weight

867
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,590
in Guangzhou's jewelry industry.

868
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,110
So you mean...

869
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,070
Three days from now
is the South Sea God Festival.

870
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,480
According to local customs,

871
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,550
we have to place a high-priced treasure
at the bottom of the lake,

872
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,070
and then

873
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,630
it's Shark Hunting.

874
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,400
What is Shark Hunting?

875
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
Each party can send their skilled men
to pretend to be sharks

876
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,440
and go into the water
to capture the treasure.

877
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,110
The winner is the one
who gets the treasure

878
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,070
within half an incense stick's time.

879
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,510
I know

880
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,030
that both of you

881
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,840
want full rights

882
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,280
to the purchase of Hepu Pearls,

883
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,880
so let's use Shark Hunting

884
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,150
to determine

885
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,590
who's qualified.

886
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,110
Okay?

887
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,960
No problem.

888
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,670
I just love

889
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,480
taking someone else's treasure.

890
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,110
I've paved the way for you.

891
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,230
The rest

892
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,550
is up to you.

893
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,030
Don't worry.

894
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,920
On that day, the bottom of the lake
will be covered with sharp blades.

895
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,280
Participants are responsible
for their own lives.

896
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,110
At Shark Hunting,

897
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,670
Cui's Pearl Farm will win.

898
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,000
Anyone who tries to go

899
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,280
against us will disappear.

900
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,710
Xu Nanying wants to help Cui's Pearl Farm
buy tribute pearls

901
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,800
and use Shark Hunting to force me out,

902
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,710
but how can I let him do that?

903
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,510
Our trading convoy
is full of northerners.

904
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,590
They're not good swimmers,

905
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,000
so they don't stand a chance

906
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,110
in the water.

907
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,230
In this South Sea God Festival,

908
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,590
Master Yan intends

909
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:00,840
to select slaves for Shark Hunting.

910
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,510
If you can capture the treasure,

911
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,480
you will regain your freedom

912
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,550
and

913
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,320
can take this one million mace
to live a good life.

914
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,630
That much money?

915
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,070
