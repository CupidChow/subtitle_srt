[Episode 33]

12
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,870
Mr. Qin,

13
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,560
how's it going?

14
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,010
Come over.

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,200
In glassmaking,

16
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,040
cooling is the most crucial part.

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,910
Its shape, its form...

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
all determined in that instant of cooling.

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,960
Don't rush it.

20
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,520
Is making glass this difficult?

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,280
I only know about jewelry,

22
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,310
not glass.

23
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,800
Let's hope it works.

24
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,710
My hands are rusty.

25
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,310
I haven't done this in years.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,150
I've done my best.

27
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,360
No worries, Mr. Qin.

28
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,000
There will always be a next time.

29
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,080
No big deal.

30
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,520
If it fails once,

31
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,630
we'll try again.

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,750
Yes, Ms. Su is right.

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,030
Yingtao, Shiqi,

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,750
check if there's anything that needs fixing.

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,150
Ms. Su,

36
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,710
could there be something wrong with the kiln?

37
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,080
Maybe the heat's off?

38
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,520
Mr. Qin is the expert on this.

39
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,710
We don't know much either.

40
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,910
Maybe it's just been too long for my father.

41
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,030
Let's try again.

42
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,880
What should we do?

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,630
I mean,

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,710
my hands may be rusty,

45
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,800
but the skills are still there.

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,430
Look!

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
It worked!

48
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,360
- It worked! - It worked!

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,960
Let me see!

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,190
Mr. Qin, you kept us in suspense!

51
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,520
I thought it was all for nothing.

52
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,870
Ms. Su, look!

53
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,870
It worked.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,270
This is just as good as the glass I saw in the West.

55
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,630
Mr. Qin, you haven't lost your touch!

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,750
Thanks to Miss Su's support.

57
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,160
In all of Yangzhou, no other shop

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,070
dares to invest like Clear Mind does

59
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,480
to make its own glass.

60
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,920
Miss Su, thank you.

61
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,750
You've shown me I still have a purpose.

62
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,720
Ms. Su, congratulations,

63
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,600
your wish has come true.

64
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,680
It came true.

65
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,070
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

66
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,870
Everyone at Clear Mind,

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
our wish has come true.

68
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,240
From today onward,

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,360
Clear Mind has its own glass.

70
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,480
Yes, indeed!

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
On a joyous day like this,

72
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,680
why the teary eyes?

73
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,000
We should celebrate

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,360
and have a proper meal!

75
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,510
Ms. Su, you're treating us, right?

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,920
Yes, Ms. Su. I want a feast!

77
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,870
- Let's go! - Whatever you want today.

78
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
- Alright, on the Ms. Su's tab! - Mr. Qin,

79
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,040
take a rest.

80
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,560
Let's go!

81
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,240
Let's go, Yunxiu!

82
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,430
Be careful.

83
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,160
- Let's go. - Thank you, Mr. Qin.

84
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,360
Let's go.

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,000
Watch your step.

86
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,950
Ms. Su, hurry up!

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,830
Take it slow.

88
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,070
In the future, if you experience

89
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,630
temporary blindness or numbness,

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,920
it means the illness is progressing.

91
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,310
Eventually, it will lead to permanent blindness,

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,190
then death.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,680
Master Yan.

94
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,190
Are you okay?

95
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm fine.

96
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,190
Let's go.

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,040
Let's go.

98
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,360
A dignified inspector like you coming to Clear Mind,

99
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,190
it can't just be to watch a kiln opening, right?

100
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,920
I came because I have something to ask you.

101
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,560
Someone's here to take Xu Nanying away.

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
Mr. Wang from the Court of Judicial Review.

103
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,190
You knew about this, right?

104
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,600
Mr. Wang is just a pawn.

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,120
He wants to take Xu Nanying,

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,630
but we'll make sure he can't.

107
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,270
Simple as that.

108
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,510
Yan Zijing,

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,240
I knew it was you who poisoned him.

110
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,190
A minor thing.

111
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,120
No need to thank me.

112
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,390
You actually expect me to thank you?

113
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,240
What you did was illegal.

114
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,240
Once Mr. Wang leaves,

115
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,270
another Mr. Li will come,

116
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,870
then an Mr. Zhang after that,

117
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,830
then another Mr. Li.

118
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,270
Eventually, someone will come

119
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,430
who won't let you keep your head up.

120
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,430
What will you do then?

121
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,750
But you can't just poison people.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,510
Can't you stop being so rigid?

123
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,360
Yan Zijing,

124
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,040
you keep breaking the law,

125
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
again and again.

126
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,000
Have you ever thought

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,160
about what would happen

128
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,920
if you're exposed one day?

129
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,190
You're so by-the-book,

130
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,160
but if criminals go free because of it,

131
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:43,920
what then?

132
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,680
Anyway,

133
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,310
at least for Duanwu's sake,

134
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,800
rein in your tactics.

135
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,830
Are you listening?

136
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,600
Got it.

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,120
The Black Dragon Bandits killed Shrimp, Cao Da.

138
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,390
Did you tell her about it?

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,830
I've told her everything.

140
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
But with Duanwu's nature,

141
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,920
she'll definitely seek revenge.

142
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,510
You'll protect her, right?

143
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,750
Of course, I will.

144
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,830
As a friend, of course.

145
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,920
You don't sound sincere.

146
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,720
I never got the chance before,

147
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,360
and maybe I won't in the future.

148
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,030
But as for you,

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,320
the misunderstanding is cleared up now.

150
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,600
So why are you still hesitating here?

151
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,120
It's too late.

152
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,440
Listen, Yan Zijing,

153
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,870
as long as you're alive,

154
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,000
there's still a chance.

155
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,870
What's all this "too late" nonsense?

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,200
Aren't you alive, too?

157
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,360
Isn't it too late for you, too?

158
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,510
I just can't talk sense with you.

159
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,240
Less talk, more work.

160
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
Look, the water's boiling. Add some now.

161
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,750
Here I am, an inspector, cooking at your place.

162
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,480
If you're happy with it, so be it.

163
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,750
Recently, fewer traders from the West are bringing beryl.

164
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,200
Beryl stones are getting scarce.

165
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,630
Prices are slightly up.

166
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,200
Speed up,

167
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,440
and ride this price wave

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,270
to finish and sell the beryl stones.

169
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,320
That way, we're on the safe side.

170
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,120
But we can't just rely on selling beryl stones.

171
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Zhenlang Pavilion is practically empty now.

172
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,150
We're down to selling worthless items to make up the numbers,

173
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,550
like flower hairpins and rouge.

174
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,790
It's not a sustainable plan.

175
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,480
Don't worry.

176
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,910
Once everything is ready on your end,

177
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,790
I'll go home and swallow my pride to ask my dad.

178
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,390
To keep things under wraps,

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,030
he'll definitely hand over some other jewelry

180
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,750
for Zhenlang Pavilion.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,200
Mr. Wu.

182
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,000
Come in.

183
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,270
Mr. Wu,

184
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Kang Ming, the wealthy merchant from Kang, arrives in Yangzhou tomorrow

185
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,510
to procure jewelry for the royal family.

186
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,870
Is this reliable information?

187
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,440
Yes, absolutely.

188
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,120
The other guild directors have heard the news.

189
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,030
You want to sell this batch to the State of Kang?

190
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,510
Isn't this a perfect opportunity?

191
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,150
But all we have is beryl stones.

192
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,630
They come from the Western Regions,

193
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,840
so why would the State of Kang buy them?

194
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,270
We could bundle them with other jewelry as accessories.

195
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,240
We can't miss this chance.

196
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,600
Tomorrow, you'll come with me.

197
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,200
Yunxiu,

198
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,360
what are you holding?

199
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,150
A new piece?

200
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,030
Yes.

201
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,030
Let me see it.

202
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,440
Yunxiu, let me have a look!

203
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,790
This is a glass sample.

204
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,120
Duanwu is taking it for business negotiations tomorrow.

205
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,840
Yunxiu, just one quick look!

206
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,480
Or at least tell me about it.

207
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,390
I swear I won't touch it.

208
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,360
You absolutely won't?

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,270
Look, Duanwu modified these designs over and over,

210
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,720
and these colors...

211
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,390
Aren't they unique?

212
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,840
Mr. Qin and I worked for days and nights

213
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,440
to perfect it.

214
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,910
There's a whole pile of flawed glass

215
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,790
stacked up in the workshop.

216
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,080
This glass is so rare,

217
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,510
so beautiful.

218
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,720
If those ladies see it,

219
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
they'll definitely rush to buy it.

220
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,030
They're sure to love it.

221
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,600
I love it too.

222
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,320
There's only this one set,

223
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,550
so if it breaks, that's it.

224
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,790
Yunxiu, I won't break it.

225
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,440
You just promised you wouldn't touch it.

226
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,750
Acting cute won't work now.

227
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,390
But there's a new set of jewelry in the workshop,

228
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:08,390
and no one's tried it on yet.

229
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,150
How about giving that one a try?

230
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,550
Let's go, then.

231
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's go!

232
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,440
Not angry anymore?

233
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Not even a little.

234
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,910
It's really beautiful, Yunxiu.

235
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,550
How did you make it?

236
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,960
Please,

237
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,120
just let us in.

238
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,390
Just one look at Mr. Kang.

239
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,790
Everyone should get a fair chance!

240
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,360
Exactly!

241
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,440
Mr. Kang rarely comes all the way from the West.

242
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,120
Just let us in to see him.

243

Just let us in!

How many times do I have to tell you?

[Yangzhou Jewelry Guild]
Only guild directors are allowed inside.

246

Who do you think you are?

247
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,960
Mr. Kang is here in Yangzhou to buy jewelry,

248
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,390
and everyone has a chance to compete.

249
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,550
Why can't we go in?

250
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,320
Yeah!

251
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,550
Why can't we go in?

252
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,480
Move aside!

Step aside!

Mr. Wu, please.

255
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,030
Mr. Kang is a prominent merchant from the West,

256
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,360
treated with high regard in the State of Kang.

257
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,630
Ordinary merchants wouldn't even catch his eye.

258
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,510
If anyone brings in

259
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,390
poor-quality jewelry,

260
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,200
it would disgrace the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild.

261
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,440
Keep an eye on them.

262
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,390
Don't let riffraff disturb Mr. Kang.

263
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,630
Yes, Mr. Wu.

Ms. Su, what should we do?

265
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,080
Just wait.

hoping to buy genuine treasures.

Don't waste my time

270
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,480
with these cheap items.

271
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,050

Greetings, Mr. Kang.

275
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,120
Mr. Kang,

276
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,390
my father is Zheng Shiyuan, head of Yangzhou Jewelry Guild.

277
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,270
I am Zheng Wu from the Zheng family.

278
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,120
May I know what type of jewelry you wish to purchase

279
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,550
on this visit to Yangzhou?

280
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,670
You can ask around.

281
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,720
In all of Yangzhou, Zheng's Jubao House leads the way.

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We can find any jewelry you want.

283
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,600
So you're Zheng Wu from the Zheng family?

284
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,750
That's correct.

285
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,670
Even in the Western Regions,

286
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,670
I've heard of Zheng's Jubao House.

287
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,150
Let me be frank with you.

288
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm here to buy a batch of top-quality beryl stones.

289
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,200
Pardon my curiosity,

290
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,480
but you're from the West,

291
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,670
why come all the way to Yangzhou

292
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,910
to buy beryl stones?

293
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,790
The West is unstable now.

294
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,390
Even if there are beryl stones, they can't be transported out.

295
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,150
It'd take a lot of manpower.

296
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,150
I came to Yangzhou

297
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,030
just to try my luck.

298
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,360
Mr. Kang, you've come at just the right time.

299
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,270
In Zheng's Jubao House,

300
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,510

This is Mr. Kang from the Western Regions!

Mr. Kang!

306
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,200
Mr. Kang, since it's an honor to have you here,

307
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,200
why not stop by our shop, Clear Mind?

A female merchant in the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild?

309
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,270
The Yangzhou Jewelry Guild is an open-minded place.

310
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,390
Though I am just a woman,

311
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,120
I've earned a place here.

312
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,790
Clear Mind may be a small shop,

313
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,240
but we do have some fine jewelry.

314
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,550
I invite Mr. Kang to take a look.

315
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,030
Indeed, this Clear Mind

316
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,080
has glassware in all kinds of designs.

317
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,510
It's quite popular among common women in Yangzhou.

318
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,360
I often travel between the Tang Empire and Persia,

319
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,480
and I'm quite fond of glass myself.

320
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,840
However, my purpose this time is beryl stones,

321
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,480
beryl stones as blue as the sky.

322
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,390
Beryl stones?

323
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,790
Ms. Su, do you even know

324
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,270
how much a beryl stone is worth?

325
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,560
For top-quality beryl,

326
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,710
one stone is worth a fine horse.

327
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,550
This isn't the kind of business

328
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,920
a small place like Clear Mind can meddle in.

329
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,760
So please, Ms. Su,

330
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,200
don't waste Mr. Kang's time.

331
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,960
While I may not have beryl stones,

332
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:48,920
Mr. Kang,

333
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,600
I do have glass as clear as spring water.

334
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,920
Crafted with Tang techniques,

335
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:54,560
the only one of its kind in Yangzhou.

337
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,070
Hold on.

338
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,510
If there's anything lacking,

339
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,470
I'd be honored if you could offer guidance.

340
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,710
Nowadays, only glass from Persia

341
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,400
and the Arabian regions is valuable.

342
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,750
Some even consider them gifts from heaven.

343
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,680
Do you know why?

344
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,840
They're crystal-clear, surpassing even quartz.

345
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,960
Yes. But as for your glass items,

346
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,600
the color is impure, and the quality is lacking.

347
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,550
You rely solely on design for appeal.

348
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,200
In the marketplaces,

349
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,510
they might make a small splash,

350
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,880
but they'd never catch the eye of nobility.

351
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,270
Such poor goods

352
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,230
would only taint Mr. Kang's sight.

353
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,400
Mr. Kang,

354
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,680
in Jubao House, we have both top-quality beryl stones

355
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
and glass as clear as crystal.

356
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,710
Please, do visit Jubao House.

357
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,680
Another day, perhaps.

358
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm a bit tired today.

359
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,030
Mr. Kang!

360
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,710
Su Muzhe,

361
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,990
you went through all this effort just to embarrass yourself. Was it worth it?

362
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,360
Embarrass myself?

363
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,640
Just getting Mr. Kang's feedback

364
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,230
is a reward in itself.

365
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,070
I'm curious to see

366
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,070
how long you can last

367
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,790
on Mr. Qin's glass alone.

368
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Let's go.

369
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,360

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,600
Mr. Wang is stuck there, frustrated every day.

372
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,710
How are things on your end?

373
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,960
This deal could lead to a long-term trade with the State of Kang.

374
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,200
The Zheng family surely wouldn't let that pass,

375
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,470
but of course, they'll proceed cautiously.

376
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,360
Ever since Kang Ming spread the word

377
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,360
about wanting to buy beryl stones,

378
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,920
all of Yangzhou has gone crazy.

379
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,790
The price of beryl stones shot up as a result.

380
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,790
The problem is,

381
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,710
now we can't find any beryl stones.

382
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,920
From what you're saying,

383
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,310
are you planning to enter the beryl business?

384
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,550
What's wrong with it?

385
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,360
Just focus on your glass.

386
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:20,600
That'll stretch you thin

387
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,680
if you try to juggle both.

388
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,470
You know I'm stretched thin,

389
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,600
yet you're being so wasteful?

390
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,400
Haven't I put in my share of effort, too?

391
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,200
And you...

392
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,400
I feel like

393
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,400
beryl stones aren't essential.

394
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,990
Look at how high the prices are now.

395
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,790
It's definitely not just for Kang Ming.

396
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,400
I'm afraid someone's already

397
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,360
started buying them up in secret.

398
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,160
We need to be careful.

399
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,510
But who's buying them up,

400
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,710
we don't know.

401
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,710
Master Yan,

402
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,310
who do you think it is?

403
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,440
Who's buying them up?

404
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,750
No need to be like that.

405
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,960
I'm the one buying them.

406
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,400
And I used real money to pay.

407
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,750
All spent at high prices.

408
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,600
Wait, what are you doing?

409
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,750
I'm just trying to tell you,

410
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,680
Zheng's jewelry shop dominates Yangzhou.

411
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,200
No other merchant dares compete with him.

412
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,400
So with this order from Kang Ming,

413
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,310
the Zheng family will keep stalling.

414
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,360
But if Clear Mind joins the competition,

415
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,510
the Zheng family will feel the pressure.

416
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,750
But I think

417
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,200
you should focus on making glass.

418
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,710
Don't get distracted.

419
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,750
I can manage both.

420
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,790
Kang Ming is a famous merchant from the West.

421
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,160
Silk, spices, jewelry...

422
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
any profitable trade,

423
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,310
he's involved in it.

424
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,230
This time,

425
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,640
he's indeed here to buy for the Kang royal family.

426
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,790
The State of Kang...

427
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,510
What's wrong with the State of Kang?

428
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,840
Yan Zijing once said he's from there.

429
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,070
Did you confirm it?

430
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,510
I did.

431
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,840
Kang Ming

432
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,310
is practically the wealthiest man in Kang.

433
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,030
Most items used by the Kang royal family

434
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,270
come from him.

435
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,990
Could it just be a coincidence?

436
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,200
I don't think so.

437
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,680
Back in Guangdong,

438
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,270
Yan Zijing plotted things,

439
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,710
hoarding pearls and bringing down the Cui family.

440
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,840
I'm afraid he's trying the same trick on the Zheng family now.

441
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,310
If this is indeed Yan Zijing's scheme,

442
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,600
the rise in beryl prices

443
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,880
actually benefits us.

444
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:25,790
Don't forget

445
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,920
that batch of goods included a lot of beryl stones.

446
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,990
After you dismantled, modified, and sold them,

447
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,270
then...

448
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
Yan Zijing

449
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,360
would be shooting himself in the foot.

450
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,510
But I estimate that batch of beryl stones

451
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,440
won't be enough to satisfy Kang Ming.

452
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,640
Then we have no choice.

453
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,550
We'll take it one step at a time.

454
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,990
For now, moving the stock is the priority.

455
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,070
A servant.

456
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,070
Come in.

457
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,510
Mr. Wu, the master requests your presence.

458
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
Our Clear Mind glass is high-quality and affordable,

459
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,880
spreading by word of mouth throughout Yangzhou.

460
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,790
We've truly opened up the market

461
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,470
for women's accessories.

462
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,200
But sales have been slightly dropping these past few days.

463
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,600
Ms. Su, take a look.

464
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,200
Ms. Su.

465
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,440
Over the last few days,

466
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,400
those who've come to Clear Mind

467
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,400
to buy glassware...

468
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,880
Pure and flawless...

469
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,510
What about making glassware?

470
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,310
Mr. Qin's glassware,

471
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,030
combined with Clear Mind's designs,

472
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,160
could sell very well.

473
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,920
Persian glassware is the best.

474
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,270
Even if Clear Mind makes some,

475
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,270
it will be far inferior.

476
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,200
Besides,

477
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,200
the Zheng family specializes in Persian glassware.

478
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,310
Why compete?

479
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,230
Could we experiment with colors?

480
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,310
Even in Zizhou, creating colorful glass

481
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,070
could take years, even decades, to master,

482
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,750
and the output can't be guaranteed.

483
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,030
So, which path should we take?

484
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Are you insane?

485
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,880
Why do you keep sneaking around?

486
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,840
I walked in openly.

487
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,680
What are you spying on here?

488
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,790
Spying?

489
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,510
What's wrong with you?

490
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Not feeling well again?

491
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,270
It's nothing.

492
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,270
Lately, I've suddenly

493
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,680
been unable to see things clearly.

494
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,840
Wasn't that expected?

495
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,680
Mother,

496
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,470
I pleaded with him for days

497
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,680
before your father agreed to see you.

498
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,230
Don't mess it up again.

499
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,030
Got it.

500
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,880
Your father's scolding is for your own good.

501
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,920
What kind of person is Xu Nanying?

502
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,200
Alright, I understand.

503
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,470
I'm going to see Father.

504
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,360
Father, you wanted to see me?

505
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:20,990
Sit down.

506
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,790
Regarding that wealthy merchant from the West, Kang Ming,

507
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,310
how did you find him after today's interaction?

508
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,440
He has sharp insight and knows the ways of trade.

509
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,270
He specifically asked for beryl stones.

510
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,070
He only wants beryl stones?

511
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,510
Yes.

512
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,600
Father, during the recent Lady Huan case,

513
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,680
Zhang Jinran publicly accused Zheng Si

514
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,070
of fencing goods for the Black Dragon Bandits.

515
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,200
Given Kang Ming's true intentions,

516
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,510
shouldn't we be cautious?

517
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,030
Keeping that batch of goods here

518
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,360
is nothing but trouble.

519
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,070
Selling it to the West is the safest option.

520
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,790
Right now, Zhang Jinran is focused

521
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,920
on Xu Nanying's case.

522
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,030
Let's take this chance to clear it out.

523
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,400
Also, our family's Western trade route is cut off.

524
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,030
If Kang Ming is trustworthy,

525
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,070
you should seize this opportunity

526
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,230
to build a relationship with him

527
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,160
and secure a future for our family.

528
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,470
In that case, I'll go back

529
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,640
and urge Shijiu to expedite the redesigns

530
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,840
to ensure everything goes smoothly.

531
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,120
Send out invitations,

532
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,710
and call everyone together.

533
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,920
Tomorrow, I'll represent the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild

534
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,550
and host a banquet for Kang Ming.

535
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,960
I'll take care of it.

536
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,600
This is the Zheng family's old residence.

537
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,470
Take your things and get out!

538
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,310
Don't bother our Zheng Wu anymore.

539
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,710
Zheng Wu let me stay here.

540
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,200
If I leave, it'll be on his orders.

541
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,550
How shameless can you be?

542
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,550
Wu has treated you more than fairly.

543
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,750
He even gave you

544
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,990
the whole Zhenlang Pavilion,

545
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,030
and yet you're still not satisfied.

546
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,160
He's willing.

547
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,030
Gather her things and throw them out!

548
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,680
The Cui family is already in shambles,

549
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
and you still won't stop?

550
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,160
Are you here to ruin my son's life too?

551
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,920
What do you have to be so proud of?

552
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,470
You're so young, yet seducing men,

553
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,680
pretending to be the legitimate daughter of a noble family.

554
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,750
You're just like your crazy mother,

555
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,990
always putting on airs as if she's the legitimate wife.

556
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,030
She can't even bear a son.

557
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,510
The Cui family line will die out!

558
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,750
Insult me if you want,

559
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,920
but don't insult my mother.

560
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,270
You and your mother are cut from the same cloth!

561
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,470
How dare you push me!

562
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,710
Lady!

563
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,440
Lady, let me see.

564
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,230
- Blood! - Blood...

565
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,030
You jinx!

566
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,920
Hurry! Go get Wu!

567
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,790
What do we do now?

568
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:03,600
Call a doctor!

569
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,750
I'm bleeding!

570
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,230
Get Wu right away!

571
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,880
Yes!

572
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,700
Hurry and get Wu!

573
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,510
Go call Mr. Wu! Now!

574
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,030
You jinx!

575
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:15,990
Shijiu.

576
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,840
Shijiu.

577
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,310
What's going on?

578
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,990
My mother...

579
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,960
She's always like that.

580
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,750
When she's angry, she acts like a child.

581
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,600
Don't let it bother you.

582
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,750
Having Zhenlang Pavilion is enough for me.

583
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,230
What's a few insults?

584
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:54,270
It's nothing.

585
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,160
Tomorrow, my father is hosting a banquet for Kang Ming.

586
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,310
Prepare yourself and accompany me.

587
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,990
Hosting a banquet for Kang Ming?

588
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,230
Shouldn't we be more cautious?

589
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,600
It's wise to be wary,

590
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,510
but we can't miss this chance either.

591
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,960
We'll make a decision after the banquet.

592
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,200
Mr. Kang, it's a long journey here.

593
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,310
I hope it hasn't been too tiring!

594
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,440
I've long heard of Mr. Zheng's great reputation.

595
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,400
To meet

596
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,400
with all you guild directors of Yangzhou today,

597
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,640
I am truly honored.

598
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,270
Is this your first time in Yangzhou, Mr. Kang?

599
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,990
Come, try this fine Qionghua wine.

600
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,710
Please.

601
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,510
Mr. Kang, this is Soft-Cooked Eel in Sauce,

602
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,030
and this is Stewed Pork Ball in Brown Sauce

603
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,470
Both are famous Yangzhou dishes.

604
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,600
Please have a taste.

605
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,440
Mr. Kang, why do you seem downhearted?

606
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,510
Have I failed to host you properly?

607
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,680
Mr. Zheng,

608
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,470
I am troubled.

609
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,160
I traveled south all the way from Chang'an,

610
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
through many places,

611
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,510
yet I still couldn't gather

612
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,790
ten hu of top-quality beryl stones.

613
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,960
Ten hu?

614
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,790
This...

615
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,200
I have some,

616
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,640
but not much.

617
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,030
I can try to gather more.

618
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,750
I have some, too.

619
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,540
I have some as well!

620
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,160
I have some, too!

621
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,120
We have some, too!

622
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,360
But with such scattered sources,

623
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,270
how many orders would I need to sign?

624
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,270
It's rather troublesome.

625
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,310
My dear Kang,

626
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,270
with the combined power of the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild,

627
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,710
ten hu of beryl stones is no great challenge.

628
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,960
How about this,

629
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,070
let Jubao House take the lead

630
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,360
and sign a contract with you.

631
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,750
We'll gather the beryl stones from each source.

632
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,550
Wouldn't that be much more convenient?

633
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,360
Does that sound acceptable?

634
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,510
Of course, that's fine.

635
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,790
The Yangzhou Jewelry Guild is united.

636
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,200
We're all one family here.

637
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,990
Everyone,

638
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,470
do you have any objections?

639
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,600
We will follow your orders!

640
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,640
With this deal,

641
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,470
let's all prosper together in the long run.

642
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,710
Step aside!

643
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,030
As fellow guild merchants,

644
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,550
why does Jubao House get to monopolize

645
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,600
and take all the profits?

646
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,400
How rude!

647
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,750
Yingtao, such disrespect.

648
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,510
Greetings, Mr. Kang.

649
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,310
We're all merchants of the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild.

650
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,160
Each should play to their strengths.

651
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,990
Why should one business dominate

652
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,600
and oppress the others?

653
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,270
Oppress?

654
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,990
As the guild head,

655
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,790
I'm doing this

656
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,990
to prevent unnecessary losses

657
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,270
from reckless stockpiling

658
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,640
and fierce competition.

659
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,160
Isn't that right, everyone?

660
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,360
Mr. Zheng is very considerate.

661
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,210
- You speak wisely. - Indeed.

662
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,930
Yes, absolutely.

663
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,710
Yangzhou is vast,

664
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,200
with so many merchants here.

665
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,440
Since Mr. Kang wants beryl stones,

666
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,470
he's bound to compare options.

667
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,030
Now, Clear Mind

668
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,360
also seeks a fair chance to compete.

669
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,360
Su Muzhe,

670
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,550
you weren't invited to this banquet,

671
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,710
yet you came uninvited.

672
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,270
You're certainly shameless.

673
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,550
In business,

674
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,840
being shameless is essential.

675
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,920
If I'm not shameless,

676
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,120
how could I do business in Yangzhou?

677
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,070
Right?

678
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,360
Ridiculous.

679
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,440
There are dozens of merchants in Yangzhou.

680
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,920
Do you think just anyone can sit here?

681
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,680
Zheng Wu.

682
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,160
We're all guild merchants here.

683
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,470
There's no distinction of rank.

684
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,750
Ms. Su, if you wish to join,

685
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,990
simply gather ten hu of top-quality beryl stones.

686
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,840
You, glass seller,

687
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,030
what business do you have here?

688
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,030
Exactly, do you even have beryl stones?

689
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,790
Clear Mind has beryl stones.

690
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,640
Mr. Kang,

691
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,710
Clear Mind now possesses beryl stones.

692
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,400
I ask you

693
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,440
to grant us a fair chance to compete.

694
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,510
Ms. Su, this isn't the place for you.

695
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,470
Please leave.

696
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,160
Just a minor interruption.

697
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,470
Let it not discourage your spirits, my dear Kang.

698
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,750
Come, let's empty this cup.

699
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:49,750
Cheers!

700
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,810
Cheers.

701
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,010
Don't embarrass yourself.

702
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:52,920
Let's drink!

703
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,710
The Qionghua wine is wonderful,

704
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,230
but our guest from Kang might prefer

705
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,030
Persian Sanlejiang Drink.

706
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,440
Zheng Wu.

707
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:03,960
Yes?

708
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,270
How did you manage things?

709
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,270
How are there always intruders disturbing our guest?

710
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:11,440
It's my fault, Father. I'll take care of it...

711
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,260
Sanlejiang Drink?

712
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,360
In Chang'an, Sanlejiang Drink is everywhere.

713
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,400
But sadly, I haven't seen it since coming south.

714
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,270
You're from the State of Kang?

715
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:21,960
Indeed.

716
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,960
An old friend in a foreign land lifts the weight of my lonely drink.

717
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:30,200
Mr. Kang, would you join me for a drink?

718
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:30,920
Very well.

719
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,360
Sit by my side!

720
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,440
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

721
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,160
Let me introduce you.

722
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,600
The Ms. Su of Clear Mind here is...

723
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,030
a dear friend of mine.

724
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,310
Sit by my side too!

725
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,400
Mr. Zheng, I'll trouble you to make the arrangements.

726
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,920
Meeting a fellow countryman in a foreign land,

727
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,400
we must catch up.

728
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,470
You're too kind.

729
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,600
Someone,

730
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,400
bring seats.

731
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,990
Here!

732
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,790
The men of the State of Kang are all strong and brave,

733
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,640
capable of wrestling lions and tigers!

734
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,630
And the dancers there are graceful and beautiful.

735
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,760
Their dance moves swift like falling snowflakes.

736
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
Exactly!

737
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,400
Here!

738
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,360
What a pity,

739
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,470
I've been trading with nomads since childhood,

740
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,360
and I haven't returned in so long.

741
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,030
I miss most the golden peaches of our homeland.

742
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,760
They're large as eggs, sweet and juicy,

743
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,190
truly a heavenly fruit.

744
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,470
Cheers!

745
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,030
Ms. Su,

746
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,280
you're a friend of Master Yan,

747
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,510
so that makes you my friend as well.

748
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,630
Come, let's drink.

749
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,400
I'll give you a fair chance to compete.

750
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,280
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

751
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:47,960
Cheers!

752
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,110
Everyone,

753
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,320
I'm here

754
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,150
to select items for the Kang royal family.

755
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,670
Our royal family

756
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,070
values not only the beryl stones,

757
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,510
but also

758
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,190
the styles of Tang beryl.

759
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,670
Let's see who can meet our needs.

760
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,670
I'll drink to that!

761
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,540
[Yangzhou Jewelry Guild]

762
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,630
This banquet tonight...

763
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,030
Disgusting, revolting!

764
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,840
Su Muzhe had a point.

765
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,320
Why should they monopolize everything?

766
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,510
Truly overbearing.

767
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,720
This is just bullying.

768
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,030
What can we do?

769
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,240
Hasn't the guild been like this for years?

770
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,800
For people like us, just getting scraps is lucky.

771
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,150
So what are we?

772
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,960
Just here to entertain like songstresses?

773
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,240
That Su Muzhe does have some skills, though.

774
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
She actually managed to team up with Yan Zijing.

775
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,320
With those two in the mix,

776
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,920
things might get interesting.

777
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,150
Let's go.

778
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,880
After seeing today's events,

779
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,550
it's clear that the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild isn't that solid.

780
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,510
Looks like the other merchants

781
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,280
are starting to have second thoughts too.

782
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,670
The Zheng family's desperate to fill their losses.

783
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,320
Their actions are quite ugly.

784
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,670
What's on your mind?

785
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,280
I'm thinking...

786
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,510
the Zheng family has held sway over Yangzhou for too long.

787
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,800
It might be time to stir things up.

788
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,400
Add some fuel to the fire,

789
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,630
and it'll burn even brighter.

790
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,190
No rush.

791
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,030
After tonight's banquet,

792
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,800
they should be less inclined.

793
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,800
Seeing us work so hard to win this deal,

794
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,920
the Zheng family should feel the pressure too.

795
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,150
What I didn't expect, though,

796
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,960
is that the price Cui Shijiu paid for Zhenlang Pavilion

797
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,070
was to sell stolen goods for the Zheng family.

798
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,320
What's wrong?

799
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:20,550
Are you pitying Cui Shijiu?

800
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,880
Not exactly.

801
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,360
Everyone makes their choices,

802
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,150
their own sacrifices.

803
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,440
You've really grown a lot.

804
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,320
I believe

805
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,190
the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild's future

806
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,760
will have a place for you.

807
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,630
Are you praising me?

808
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,630
Haven't I always praised you?

809
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,360
Fine.

810
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,400
I'll take that as a good omen.

811
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,240
Since you've said it,

812
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,590
we'll make sure Mr. Kang's beryl stones

813
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,590
are perfect.

814
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,360
Isn't that order for the Zheng family?

815
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,030
Why are you bothering with it?

816
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,280
In business, you can't focus on just one order.

817
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,550
Since Mr. Kang is here,

818
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,070
we need to make sure Clear Mind

819
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,190
holds a place in his mind.

820
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,990
You're getting smarter by the day.

821
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,440
Fine.

822
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,760
When I return,

823
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,720
I'll have Kang Ju bring you the beryl stones.

824
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,720
Let's go.

825
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,150
Wait.

826
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,150
Don't you think the scenery here is quite nice?

827
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,030
And it's rare for us to have a moment's peace.

828
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,670
It feels like we've never really taken the time

829
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,990
to appreciate Yangzhou's nights.

Add some more wood.

833

Ms. Su, take a break and have some tea.

truly brings out a unique charm
