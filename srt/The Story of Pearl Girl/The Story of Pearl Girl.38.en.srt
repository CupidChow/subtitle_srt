00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,830
besides Prince Ying

191
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,710
who wants to get the blood-stained pearl.

192
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,470
It's the Black Dragon Bandits.

193
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,800
Maybe

194
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,960
it's Li Kui.

195
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,960
Li Kui, Zheng Shiyuan, and Prince Ying

196
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,870
are in this together.

197
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,040
Now they have both two pearls.

198
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,080
They will look for an opportunity to leave

199
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,830
and find the legendary

200
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,920
Gulistan treasure.

201
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,990
Li Kui won't show up easily.

202
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,400
We need to find a way to lure him out.

203
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,830
I have an idea.

204
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,510
What is it?

205
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,160
I'll pretend I'm dead.

206
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,560
In that case,

207
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,320
I can lock down the city and search.

208
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,080
Zheng Shiyuan is hiding.

209
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,280
Prince Ying has to cope

210
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,040
with us.

211
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,630
In that case, he can only send Li Kui to do it.

212
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,590
And

213
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,230
if Duanwu is alive,

214
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,630
I can't convict him with Prince Ying around.

215
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,350
Directors, I'm sorry.

216
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,200
I scared you.

217
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:22,630
You're not dead. What are you doing?

218
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,230
Take her down!

219
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,320
I dare you!

220
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,080
Back off!

221
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,350
Back off!

222
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,800
Mr. Zheng.

223
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,510
I'm not dead.

224
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,750
I scared you.

225
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,080
It's my fault.

226
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,680
Mr. Zheng.

227
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,230
You took away Mr. Qin of Clear Mind.

228
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,320
And you lured me out of the city

229
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,470
and stole my treasure.

230
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,750
You wanted to kill me and Mr. Qin.

231
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,920
What did you want?

232
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,680
You're slandering me.

233
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,990
It's not true.

234
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,160
He...

235
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,160
Yes.

236
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,870
It's him.

237
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,200
As the Inspector of Huainandao,

238
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,630
he protected Su Muzhe

239
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,400
again and again.

240
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,510
It wasn't enough for him to kill my two sons.

241
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,990
Now they're colluding

242
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,470
to frame me for murder.

243
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,280
I called you here today

244
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,470
to explain everything

245
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,630
to you.

246
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,230
Jubao House doesn't want others

247
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,680
to compete with them for business.

248
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,510
Do you remember

249
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,280
Qin's Glass Workshop?

250
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,710
Before,

251
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,630
in order to suppress the Qin's Glass Workshop,

252
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,800
the Zheng family said they affected the people in the neighborhood.

253
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,680
Mr. Qin had to move his workshop

254
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
again and again.

255
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,630
Then, he drove up the price of raw materials

256
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,200
and asked hooligans to mess with his workshop

257
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
to stop customers from getting into his workshop.

258
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,560
He ruined his family.

259
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,960
Now, Mr. Qin

260
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,680
is working with Clear Mind.

261
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,990
But Mr. Zheng

262
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,470
wanted to kill Mr. Qin and me.

263
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,830
You have been in the jewelry guild for a long time.

264
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,080
Countless shops

265
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,280
were forced to close

266
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
by the Zheng family.

267
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,800
Not to mention Qin's Glass Workshop,

268
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,230
my Clear Mind

269
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,230
has also been suppressed by him many times.

270
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,990
Three people almost died

271
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,470
because of the Zheng family.

272
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,280
If you

273
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,200
don't step up

274
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,040
like you do today,

275
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,280
when Clear Mind is ruined,

276
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,750
no one will speak for you.

277
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,750
Don't take her word for it.

278
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,510
Come on.

279
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,320
Drive this crazy woman

280
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,470
out of the jewelry guild.

281
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,280
Drive her out.

282
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,280
Zheng Shiyuan!

283
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,400
Don't push your luck.

284
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,200
All of the above

285
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,640
is Clear Mind's business,

286
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,680
and it has nothing to do with you.

287
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,030
Do you know

288
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,270
where your

289
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,750
annual membership fees go?

290
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,120
What? Did he embezzle our membership fees?

291
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
As far as I know,

292
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,510
the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild

293
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,640
charges membership fees in three tiers.

294
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,750
Where is the ledger?

295
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,680
Yeah.

296
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,510
Have you seen the ledger?

297
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,960
Can you show them the ledger?

298
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,310
Jubao House pays a million cashes a year.

299
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,750
They paid the most.

300
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,160
But from what I know,

301
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,960
you misappropriated more than that.

302
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
- Mr. Zheng. - That's a lot.

303
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,990
Is Su Muzhe telling the truth?

304
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,600
The membership fees

305
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,790
are for emergency use by the guild's merchants.

306
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,070
How could you misappropriate it?

307
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,440
Don't take her word for it.

308
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,400
How could she have the ledger of our guild?

309
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,270
How could I have the ledger of the jewelry guild?

310
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:05,840
Directors.

311
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,310
Let me see.

312
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,510
Directors.

313
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,820
[Ledger of the Jewelry Guild]

314
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,470
You rat.

315
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,990
Yeah.

316
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,600
You embezzled our money.

317
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,380
[Withdraw 30 million mace]

318
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,310
It's our hard-earned money.

319
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,230
Listen to me.

320
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,840
She faked the ledger!

321
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,230
Look carefully!

322
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,680
It's written in black and white.

323
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,440
She faked it!

324
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,710
The ledger is not fake.

325
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,030
I gave it to her.

326
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,200
Cui Shijiu.

327
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,360
When my father was in charge of the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild,

328
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,750
we had two ledgers.

329
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,600
Mr. Zheng,

330
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,710
you must have followed this unwritten rule, right?

331
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,310
I can explain

332
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,600
these three accounts to you.

333
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,470
The first one, forty million cashes.

334
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,470
The Zheng family hoarded beryl stones with it.

335
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,230
The second one, thirty million cashes.

336
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,790
He wanted to please Mr. Xu

337
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,680
and bribed him with it

338
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,710
at the Qionghua Festival.

339
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,310
This third one, twenty million cashes.

340
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,470
He bought Zhenlang Pavilion with it

341
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,710
and gave Mr. Xu a majority stake.

342
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,920
All three accounts

343
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,360
have the guild head's seal on them.

344
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,990
Cui Shijiu, don't forget

345
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,270
that you're the legitimate daughter of the Cui family.

346
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,510
Wu treated you...

347
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,710
My father had kicked me out of the house.

348
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,710
Wu?

349
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,230
Wu died a long time ago.

350
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,880
You forced him to die.

351
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,310
I have nothing to do with your Zheng family.

352
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,070
Remember.

353
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,230
I'm not Cui Shijiu.

354
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,310
I'm Cui Zhuohua.

355
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,470
Cui Zhuohua, the owner of Zhenlang Pavilion!

356
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,440
The Zheng family embezzled the guild membership fees.

357
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
The ledger is the proof.

358
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,920
As for the Zheng family's oppression of the people

359
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,120
and all the illegal things they've done all these years,

360
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,470
I can testify in person.

361
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,990
You bully innocent people,

362
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,030
kill people for money,

363
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,880
and embezzle membership fees.

364
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,270
As merchants of the guild,

365
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,070
how could you tolerate him

366
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,400
as the guild head?

367
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,960
Dismiss Zheng Shiyuan!

368
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,920
You're guilty of kidnapping and murder.

369
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:39,880
Zheng Shiyuan.

370
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,640
Come with me to the Grand Governor's Office.

371
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:43,710
Take him away.

372
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,400
Yes, sir.

373
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,600
You deserve it.

374
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,360
Yeah.

375
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,200
- He deserves to die. - He deserves to die.

376
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,120
Jinran.

377
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,360
Someone reported to me

378
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,840
that you had a private relationship with Clear Mind's Su Muzhe.

379
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,710
Therefore, you framed Zheng Shiyuan.

380
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,400
You pretended to behead Xu Nanying,

381
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,030
making a huge scandal.

382
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,070
It's a big deal. I have to deal with it.

383
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,640
What do you want to do?

384
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,710
Hand over Zheng Shiyuan to me.

385
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,230
I'll take over the case.

386
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,880
Although you're a prince,

387
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,640
you don't have the right to deal with local affairs.

388
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,230
I was commanded by the Emperor

389
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,030
to hold the Jewel Exhibition.

390
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,680
Xu Nanying is an Official of Yangzhou.

391
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,880
Zheng Shiyuan is a wealthy businessman in Yangzhou.

392
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,790
They must be there.

393
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,600
Why can't I deal with it?

394
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,680
Jinran.

395
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,160
I've always treated you like a brother.

396
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,400
I treated you well

397
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,030
and recommended you.

398
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,160
I treat you with sincerity.

399
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,510
But you don't care

400
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,790
about our friendship.

401
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:28,120
You disappointed me.

402
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,640
Ying.

403
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,360
You used to tell me

404
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,440
that you wanted to rectify the officials, solve old cases,

405
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,230
and let the people live a clear life.

406
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,400
Zheng Shiyuan embezzled money,

407
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
sold stolen goods, and killed people.

408
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,400
But you want to cover him.

409
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,510
Come on.

410
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,030
For the sake of our friendship,

411
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,680
I hope you can stop it.

412
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,400
Ying.

413
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,360
Don't be obsessed.

414
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,590
You tricked me.

415
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,230
Zhang Jinran, how dare you?

416
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,120
Where is Zheng Shiyuan?

417
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,800
Where did you hide him?

418
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,670
Tell me.

419
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,800
I'll give you one last chance.

420
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,750
Either you hand over Zheng Shiyuan,

421
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,030
or we will be enemies.

422
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,560
We have been friends

423
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,470
for ten years.

424
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
Today, I cut my clothes.

425
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,160
We're not friends anymore.

426
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,400
You're cruel.

427
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,920
When I faked my death,

428
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,160
you didn't come to Clear Mind to mourn me.

429
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,030
I'm not your friend.

430
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,800
Why should I mourn you?

431
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,360
Besides,

432
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,430
wouldn't you be happier

433
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,160
if I killed Zheng Shiyuan

434
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,950
than if I went to Clear Mind

435
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,670
to pretend to mourn you?

436
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,360
You said you were not my friend.

437
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,710
But you know me so well.

438
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,710
You're like my confidant.

439
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,030
My best friend.

440
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,400
It's a pity that we only did half of it,

441
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,920
and we didn't get to see Zheng Shiyuan die.

442
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,880
Cui Shijiu.

443
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,880
Your other name... Cui Zhuohua?

444
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,750
Cui Shijiu is a good name.

445
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,800
The peach tree beams so red, How brilliant are its flowers!

446
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,990
The maiden's getting red, Good for the nuptial bowers.

447
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,990
My father gave me that name

448
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,990
because he wanted me to bring good luck

449
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,880
to the family I would marry.

450
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,880
My mother

451
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,800
wanted me to have a bright life.

452
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,120
That's why they named me Cui Zhuohua.

453
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,120
You're Cui Zhuohua, the owner of Zhenlang Pavilion.

454
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,470
You threw Zheng Shiyuan, the guild head of the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild,

455
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,920
out of his position

456
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,400
and became famous.

457
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,840
Congratulations.

458
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,990
Su Muzhe.

459
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,640
Didn't you think

460
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,670
I might give you a fake ledger?

461
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,030
Cui Shijiu, the legitimate daughter of the Cui family, may lie to me.

462
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,030
Because she was in trouble.

463
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,840
She only cared about the Cui family.

464
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,470
Cui Shijiu, the abandoned daughter of the Cui family, may also lie to me.

465
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,030
Because she was depending on the Zheng family.

466
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,270
She couldn't help herself.

467
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,950
But I don't think Cui Zhuohua, the owner of Zhenlang Pavilion,

468
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,160
will lie to you.

469
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,990
Because she was conscious.

470
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,120
She knew what she wanted.

471
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,230
Good.

472
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,950
Because of your words,

473
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,950
I will toast you.

474
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,670
Who would have thought

475
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,880
that a pearl diver

476
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,510
would be so successful today?

477
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,470
It's fate.

478
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:56,710
It's not fate.

479
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,950
I used to feel very miserable

480
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,160
when I was suffering.

481
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,710
In retrospect,

482
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,750
I, Su Muzhe, gained a foothold here

483
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,030
because of Duanwu.

484
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,710
How is it going between you and him?

485
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:33,840
No one wants to elope with me.

486
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,080
My fate is not as good as yours.

487
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,640
My fate is good.

488
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,080
You're back.

489
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,030
Come here.

490
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Did you drink?

491
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,950
I didn't.

492
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,190
I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

493
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,230
You've been drinking.

494
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,030
Have some porridge.

495
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,430
This is to celebrate your survival.

496
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,710
Zheng Shiyuan was put in jail.

497
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,840
You will live

498
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,080
a long and happy life.

499
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,360
Did you make this?

500
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,950
Is it delicious?

501
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,270
Yes.

502
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,510
Really?

503
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,360
Yeah.

504
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,190
Let me taste it.

505
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,710
I refuse.

506
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,270
It's great that it's delicious.

507
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,880
The taste is not important.

508
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,320
Its meaning is important.

509
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,030
What is it?

510
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,600
I wish you a long life.

511
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,750
People say, "Those who seek immortality cannot get it."

512
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,640
"Because life actually is short."

513
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,990
Many people are seeking immortality.

514
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,880
But I think

515
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,640
it's best if you make the most of the moment.

516
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,510
Duanwu,

517
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,080
I hope that whatever you do

518
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,030
in the future,

519
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,880
you will never be stumped by anything or anyone,

520
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,640
okay?

521
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,710
Eat more.

522
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,990
I'll eat it in my room.

523
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:32,840
In your room?

524
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,800
Careful.

525
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,030
I just misappropriated the membership fees.

526
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,230
I will pay it back double.

527
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,840
Zhang Jinran.

528
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,670
Do you have proof that I kidnapped and killed someone?

529
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,710
Zheng Shiyuan.

530
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,920
Do you think I have no proof?

531
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,270
If you don't let me go,

532
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,950
your reputation for justice will be ruined in Yangzhou.

533
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,470
Inspector Zhang seized a letter

534
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,470
from Xu Nanying.

535
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,320
It's useless to quibble.

536
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,560
No way.

537
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,190
He wasn't involved in what happened back then.

538
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,360
He didn't know anything.

539
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,990
Tan sent Cui to do it.

540
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,160
I ordered Zheng to clear it up.

541
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,950
Li Kui can show his talents.

542
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,750
I'm waiting for your good news. You know who I am.

543
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,920
If you are out to condemn somebody, you can always trump up a charge.

544
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,120
Zhang Jinran.

545
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,510
If you really have proof,

546
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:03,160
you should arrest Prince Ying.

547
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,360
You don't have to come to me.

548
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,560
I won't tell you anything.

549
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,320
How dare you?

550
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,600
Release Zheng Shiyuan

551
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,360
tomorrow morning.

552
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,990
You're looking for trouble.

553
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,910
Put the word out

554
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,560
that Zheng Shiyuan has confessed.

555
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,320
Send more hands to keep an eye on the Zheng's Mansion.

556
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,270
I'll arrange it right away.

557
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,150
Zheng Shiyuan was released?

558
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:02,230
Yes.

559
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,880
Lady Shijiu.

560
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,840
Wait.

561
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,030
Su Muzhe almost lost her life trying to catch him.

562
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,320
Yan Zijing and Zhang Jinran were mad about it.

563
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,680
They couldn't have let him go so easily.

564
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,510
There must be a reason for this.

565
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,910
A little impatience spoils great plans.

566
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,640
Or...

567
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,800
Do they want to use him as bait?

568
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,680
Sneak into the Zheng's Mansion

569
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,240
to keep an eye on Zheng Shiyuan.

570
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:44,320
Don't make any mistakes.

571
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,110
Yes, ma'am.

572
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,360
Zheng Shiyuan.

573
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,470
You've been a bully all your life.

574
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,030
But,

575
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,200
you're just bait in the end.

576
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,160
Come in.

577
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,360
Mr. Yuchi.

578
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,070
You've been busy for days.

579
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,280
His Highness asked us to make this soup for you.

580
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,470
I told you I didn't want it.

581
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,550
Take it away.

582
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,880
Here are some pastries.

583
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,430
I've said many times

584
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,430
that I like light food.

585
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,910
Take them away.

586
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,910
Here are fresh fruits from the West.

587
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,990
I'll put them here.

588
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,760
We'll leave.

589
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
Thank Prince Ying for me.

590
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,510
Yes, sir.

591
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,680
Your Highness.

592
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,680
You may leave.

593
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,510
Yes, sir.

594
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,430
Prince Ying.

595
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,950
I've been good to Zhang Jinran over the years.

596
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,720
And I did my best to promote him.

597
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,640
But he didn't care about it.

598
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,760
Not only did he arrest Zheng Shiyuan,

599
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,430
but he also said that he confessed

600
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,760
and released him.

601
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,070
He's doing it again.

602
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,840
It's just Zheng Shiyuan.

603
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,950
He dealt with money transactions.

604
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,800
He didn't know what was going on.

605
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,320
Even if he turns us in,

606
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,950
he has no proof.

607
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,640
Prince Ying, why are you so worried?

608
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,430
I'm not worried about Zheng Shiyuan.

609
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,030
It was all right that Su Muzhe didn't die.

610
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,550
She smashed the blood-stained pearl

611
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,070
to lure Zheng Shiyuan to show up.

612
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,320
I didn't expect

613
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,950
Su Muzhe to incite merchants in the jewelry guild

614
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:26,880
to dismiss Zheng Shiyuan as the guild head.

615
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,070
And she smashed the blood-stained pearl.

616
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,510
Su Muzhe knew

617
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,430
that there was a treasure map

618
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,680
in the pearl.

619
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,680
How could she smash it so easily?

620
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,280
I think it's fake.

621
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,390
We thought the same.

622
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,720
It's fake that she smashed the blood-stained pearl.

623
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,430
She wanted to declare that she knew our weakness.

624
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,110
The two pearls

625
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,160
are about the treasure map.

626
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,360
Who would smash them?

627
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,280
Yeah.

628
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,110
They have the blood-stained pearl.

629
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,840
For safety's sake,

630
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,110
could you give your pearl to me

631
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,320
for safekeeping?

632
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,590
Prince Ying, you know I'm suspicious.

633
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,390
I don't carry it around.

634
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,590
You know

635
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,110
it's about the Gulistan treasure.

636
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,910
It's the most precious treasure in the world.

637
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,240
You are a prince.

638
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,030
You grew up in the Central Plains.

639
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,550
You don't know as much about the Western Regions as I do.

640
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,640
If you don't have me,

641
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,880
it will be very difficult for you to find the treasure.

642
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,320
Prince Ying, don't worry.

643
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:45,360
As long as I

644
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,950
live here in peace,

645
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:49,470
and no matter what Zhang Jinran

646
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,680
and Zheng Shiyuan do,

647
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,640
the pearl will be safe.

648
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,470
All right.

649
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,800
It's better to keep still than move.

650
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,910
Let's see

651
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,240
what he will do.

652
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,030
Prince Ying, you're brilliant.

653
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,030
The only thing I told you

654
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,990
was to keep an eye on Lady Yu.

655
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,390
How could she disappear?

656
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,590
I fell asleep.

657
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,910
When I woke up, she was gone.

658
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,160
Did she hear me

659
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,070
talking to Garuda?

660
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,840
She knew Zheng Shiyuan...

661
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:43,070
No.

662
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,220
[Ledger]

663
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,030
Prince Ying.

664
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,280
If you don't protect me,

665
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,760
I'll hand it over.

666
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:13,950
Let's die together.

667
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,510
Who's that?

668
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,880
It's Yu.

669
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,880
Master, I came back to serve you.

670
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,200
Master.

671
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,640
Master.

672
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,910
Why are you back?

673
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,240
I figured it out.

674
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,800
Our son is dead.

675
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,990
I only have you now.

676
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,430
Master...

677
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:07,910
Well.

678
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,320
Tomorrow, I'll put you...

679
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,030
I'll let you die with our son.

680
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,030
How dare you do this?

681
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,470
Get out!

682
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:19,840
What do you want?

683
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,640
What do you want?

684
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,840
Out of the way!

685
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,360
Out of the way!

686
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,950
Even if I die, my ghost will haunt you down.

687
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,360
I'll give you a lift.

688
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Die.

689
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,110
Die!

690
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,880
You evil woman.

691
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,390
Do you want to kill me?

692
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,390
I'll kill you first.
