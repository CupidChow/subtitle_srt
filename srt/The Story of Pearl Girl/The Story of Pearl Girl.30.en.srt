12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,230
Shrimp was like a brother to Duanwu.

13
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,480
Loud,

14
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,870
Cao Da, and Wei Yan

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,120
were her best friends

16
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,760
after she fled to Hepu.

17
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,040
They were like my family.

18
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,600
But they died because of me.

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,280
You took care of their funerals

20
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,830
and comforted their families.

21
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,200
It was not you who killed them.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,110
It was the Black Dragon Bandits.

23
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,830
But they are dead.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
Even if I give their family more pensions,

25
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,600
I can't make it up to them.

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,600
It has already happened.

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,350
It's useless

28
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,630
to indulge in sadness.

29
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,480
I believe Duanwu suffered more pain

30
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,320
than I did.

31
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,440
Time heals all wounds.

32
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,550
Maybe.

33
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,320
I was looking for Supervisor Kang to send it to you.

34
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,230
Take the medicine.

35
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,920
Thank you.

36
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,110
Isn't it hot?

37
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,230
No.

38
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,790
Well...

39
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,720
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,190
I'll leave Clear Mind right away.

42
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,280
Just get better here.

43
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,280
I'll make you noodle soup.

44
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,040
It's delicious.

45
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,600
Thank you.

46
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,280
Have you ever thought

47
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,920
about what would happen to them

48
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,550
if you disappeared in Yangzhou?

49
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,670
What do you mean?

50
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,870
I am willing to be your ally

51
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
rather than your enemy.

52
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,960
Do you mean

53
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,080
that I can stay at the Clear Mind?

54
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,160
Just eat it.

Mr. Zheng.

61
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,190
I invited you here

62
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,110
to explain ourselves to you.

63
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,400
Lady Bai

64
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,720
went to the Governor's Office to admit that she had made false accusations

65
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,190
because she was threatened by Yan Zijing.

66
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,870
How did Yan Zijing

67
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,960
threaten you?

68
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,870
Yan Zijing realized

69
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,190
that Lady Bai and Baicaojing House were working together.

70
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,110
He wanted to discredit me.

71
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,280
Lady Bai had no choice...

72
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,550
Lady Bai, speaking of that,

73
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,600
I must toast you.

74
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,310
Thank you for proving my innocence.

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,960
Cheers.

76
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,310
But I'm not interested

77
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,790
in

78
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,080
dealing with your matter.

79
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Mr. Zheng,

80
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,350
Lady Huan is dead.

81
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,040
Lady Bai will definitely win the top beauty title next year.

82
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,110
Baicaojing House will do our best to support her.

83
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,310
Baicaojing House has long since lost its reputation.

84
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,190
Mr. Qin.

85
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,550
Are you not self-aware?

86
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,190
Mr. Zheng, I was an underdog

87
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,110
before I won my first top beauty title.

88
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,110
But I won it.

89
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:31,230
Baicaojing House is famous in Yangzhou.

90
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,520
We just have to start all over again.

91
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,240
Lady Bai,

92
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,120
I wish you all the best.

93
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,430
Garuda.

94
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,190
I don't like the wine here.

95
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,520
Let's go to another wine shop.

96
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,190
Mr. Zheng.

97
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,160
Walk them out.

98
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,880
What did I say?

99
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,360
We should please him.

100
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,310
But you got on a high horse.

101
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,710
The Zheng family is also a merchant.

102
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,240
Will they give their customers to you?

103
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,710
Maybe he could make a guild director.

104
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,120
Are you qualified, Mu?

105
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm satisfied

106
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
that we own Baicaojing House

107
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,310
in Yangzhou.

108
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,430
Just take care of the shop.

109
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,880
You saw his attitude.

110
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,710
He looked down

111
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,710
on our Baicaojing House.

112
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,040
It doesn't matter.

113
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,790
It would be nice if he likes you.

114
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,950
Si is dead.

115
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,160
Wu will be the master of the Zheng family.

116
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,360
Niao.

117
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,950
If you marry the Zheng family,

118
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,520
I will be the Zheng family's brother-in-law.

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,160
Will Xu Nanying

120
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,790
make you his concubine?

121
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,670
You can't be his concubine.

122
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,670
You're like...

123
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,070
Like what?

124
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Like a whore?

125
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,760
No, that's not what I meant.

126
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,590
Niao.

127
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,830
You have to think for yourself.

128
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,190
I'm doing it for your own good.

129
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,830
Why did you come back so late?

130
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,950
Where is Garuda?

131
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,280
Why isn't he holding you?

132
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,040
He's not holding me.

133
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,880
You'll be happy if I fall to my death.

134
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,710
You're with me

135
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,000
to kill Yan Zijing.

136
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,590
What are you talking about?

137
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,360
Stop drinking.

138
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,280
Leave me alone.

139
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,470
Okay.

140
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,880
Lady Shijiu.

141
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,790
You've endured humiliation

142
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,880
for so long.

143
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,950
You suffered.

144
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,430
I didn't kill Yan Zijing.

145
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,590
You must be disappointed in me.

146
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,070
I'm not the heir of the Zheng family.

147
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,550
I'm useless.

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,830
I'm a useless concubine's son.

149
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm not good enough for you, Lady Shijiu of the Cui family.

150
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,830
Cui Shijiu.

151
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,470
Cui Shijiu.

152
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,360
Let me ask you something.

153
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
Do you hate me

154
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,520
for stopping you from going to Chang'an?

155
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,280
There are many dignitaries in Chang'an.

156
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,880
As long as you give yourself to them...

157
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,360
As long as you give yourself to them,

158
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,070
they will kill Yan Zijing for you.

159
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,070
Yeah.

160
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,760
It's too late for you to go to Chang'an now.

161
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,520
The door is right there.

162
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
You can leave whenever you want.

163
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,430
I won't stop you.

164
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Zheng Zhiheng.

165
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,790
What do you make of me?

166
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,760
My father is lying to me.

167
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,000
Su Muzhe

168
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,830
is lying to me.

169
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,760
Why are you also lying to me, Cui Shijiu?

170
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,400
Su Muzhe, come out.

171
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,180
[Clear Mind]

172
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,590
Let's talk outside.

173
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,040
The ten-day deadline is up.

174
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,470
We're here to get our money.

175
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,310
It's not easy for us to make money for retirement.

176
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,310
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,550
You can withdraw your money.

178
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,340
But Clear Mind

179
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,160
has no money right now.

180
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,160
We had a deal.

181
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,160
There has always been a deadline for withdrawal.

182
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,640
You withdrew without warning.

183
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,950
And this is Clear Mind's

184
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,000
most difficult period.

185
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,400
We don't want to talk to you.

186
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,710
Where is Ms. Su?

187
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,790
Call her out.

188
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,470
Su Muzhe, come out.

189
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,280
Let us talk to Ms. Su.

190
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,040
- Su Muzhe, come out. - Keep it down.

191
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,310
Come out.

192
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,830
- Su Muzhe. - Ms. Su, come out.

193
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,470
Shiqi.

194
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,240
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,040
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,950
I know

197
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,190
the deadline is up.

198
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,790
But Clear Mind is out of money.

199
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,310
We have some mother-of-pearl jewelry left.

200
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,000
If you don't mind,

201
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,280
you can take them all.

202
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,550
Here are the IOUs.

203
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,190
Verbal statements are no guarantee.

204
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,590
I'll repay you every three months.

205
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,310
I'll pay you off in six months. The interest is three percent.

206
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:22,760
I won't let you suffer losses.

207
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,920
If you want the money now,

208
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,830
I'm sorry

209
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,430
I don't have it.

210
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,830
Now that

211
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,710
Clear Mind can't come up with the money,

212
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,000
let's give Ms. Su

213
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,430
some more time.

214
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,360
Ms. Su won't break her words.

215
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,590
Ms. Su.

216
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,040
Show us the withdrawal document and IOUs.

217
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,830
We'll sign it.

218
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,760
There's no other way.

219
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,950
Ms. Su.

220
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:00,550
Please keep your promise.

221
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,590
I will.

222
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,160
Thank you.

223
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,230
Here's your withdrawal document and IOUs.

224
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,580
[Signature]

225
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:21,980
[Signature]

226
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,100
[Signature]

227
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:36,800
Duanwu.

228
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,120
Ms. Su.

229
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,470
The goods are arriving. Come and unload.

230
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,430
Ms. Su.

231
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,510
- Lady Wu from Guangzhou - The goods have arrived.

232
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,640
lend us a lot of gold and raw stones.

233
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,600
[Clear Mind]
We don't have to worry about it.

234
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,190
Ladies, don't withdraw.

235
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,880
Careful.

236
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,880
Ms. Su, get more people.

237
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,670
There's a lot of goods here.

238
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:00,950
I can't unload everything myself.

239
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,860
- Yunxiu. - Lady Xue.

240
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,710
Yingtao.

241
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,230
What's going on?

242
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,360
These are all our raw materials.

243
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,800
Look. All these boxes.

244
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,270
There are many in the back.

245
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,190
You won't believe

246
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,270
it's a coincidence.

247
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,880
Ladies,

248
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,600
you've signed IOUs.

249
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,800
It's settled.

250
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,920
I don't know

251
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
what will happen to Clear Mind.

252
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,320
From now on,

253
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,670
you don't have to worry about Clear Mind.

254
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,510
We'll repay you on time.

255
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,990
Thank you.

256
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,640
- Wait, Ms. Su... - Stop it.

257
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,670
We wanted to withdraw.

258
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,080
We shouldn't talk about it.

259
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,510
Ms. Su didn't treat us badly.

260
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:42,920
Come on, Yingtao.

261
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,360
Come on.

262
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,320
Let me.

263
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,400
Let's get out of here.

264
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,710
Yingtao.

265
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,320
Yeah. Let me.

266
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,270
Ms. Su, here's a letter from Lady Wu.

267
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,880
Hurry.

268
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,510
She asked me to bring all the money back.

269
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,430
Duanwu.

270
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,360
I hope this letter finds you well.

271
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,710
I heard Clear Mind is having difficulties.

272
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,030
I'm worried.

273
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,400
Here are gold and raw stones.

274
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,080
I hope this helps you.

275
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,950
As for the money,

276
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,430
don't worry about it.

277
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,080
You said

278
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,170
gold always shines.

279
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,540
[Onyx stones from Sijiao Mountain]

280
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,950
Are you going to make glass?

281
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:14,990
Yes.

282
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,800
But I didn't find out

283
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,950
the specific process

284
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,190
of making glass,

285
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,670
not to mention the ratios.

286
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,990
If there are no ratios,

287
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,670
I can't make glass.

288
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,920
Take it easy.

289
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,080
If everyone knows how to make it,

290
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,430
it won't be Clear Mind's featured product.

291
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,600
You're right.

292
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm rushing.

293
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,710
Look.

294
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:57,990
I'll copy down the contents

295
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
of these books for you.

296
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,800
Don't you have some work to do?

297
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,750
I don't have work to do today.

298
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,670
Then, thank you.

299
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,080
Zhang Jinran.

300
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,120
You're idle as an inspector.

301
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,880
I happened to have no work today.

302
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,400
Duanwu just said the same thing.

303
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,710
What are you doing?

304
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,950
Do you want to make glass?

305
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,430
Clear Mind has no foundation.

306
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,990
Maybe I can gain a foothold by making glass.

307
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,230
You know

308
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,640
the Zheng family is in the glass business.

309
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,320
Are you going against the Zheng family?

310
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,120
I know.

311
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:47,750
The Zheng family makes Persian glassware.

312
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,640
I want to make Clear Mind glass.

313
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,360
It's different.

314
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,320
What are you drawing?

315
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,920
I'm copying down the contents

316
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,230
of these books for Duanwu.

317
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,880
It's wrong.

318
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,160
It's right.

319
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,430
Master Yan.

320
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,510
I've been drawing since I was three years old.

321
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,640
What's wrong with my painting?

322
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,360
It doesn't matter when you start drawing.

323
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,800
The drawing scale is wrong.

324
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,400
There's a stool there.

325
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,360
Come on.

326
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,190
Get up.

327
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:22,600
You...

328
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,510
The ratio of a kiln to its entrance is important.

329
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,030
The change in the ratio will affect the heat

330
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,710
and, thus, the finished product.

331
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,160
Today's incense is a little choking.

332
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,230
If I want to make this kiln,

333
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,640
how long will it take?

334
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,160
First...

335
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,950
Are you done? Do you need to see a doctor?

336
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:22,950
I'm all right.

337
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,560
Go on.

338
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,320
It's not easy

339
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,030
to make a new kiln.

340
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,400
You need to find

341
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,670
some professional craftsmen...

342
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,600
Mr. Zhang, do you need some water?

343
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,880
It's okay.

344
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,120
I'll move it outside.

345
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,360
Where were we?

346
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
You can

347
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,160
make a new kiln.

348
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,430
But you need to find some professional craftsmen.

349
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,360
It took your father

350
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,880
a few years

351
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,160
to make the colorful glass.

352
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
You have the formula.

353
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,510
But you don't know the ratios, heat,

354
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,840
or a kiln.

355
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,990
And

356
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,190
you need a lot of professional laborers and craftsmen.

357
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,430
You need to do it step by step.

358
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,510
Well.

359
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,750
There was Qin's Glass Workshop in Yangzhou.

360
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,600
I heard that Mr. Qin is still in Yangzhou.

361
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,950
I've sent Yingtao to ask around.

362
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,190
I'll hear from her soon.

363
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,120
It's a good start

364
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,230
if you can find him.

365
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,750
Yes.

366
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,400
Zhang Jinran.

367
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,880
Well.

368
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,160
Are you hungry?

369
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,880
I'm not hungry.

370
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,880
If you're hungry, you can eat first.

371
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,510
I'm busy.

372
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,470
Duanwu hasn't eaten yet.

373
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,190
Why don't you go to the kitchen and cook something?

374
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,470
I want to go.

375
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,990
But I can't cook.

376
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,600
Du Ming usually cooks for me.

377
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,080

a man named Qin

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,400
opened Qin's Glass Workshop in Yangzhou.

But they couldn't

00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,430
Zhenlang Pavilion sold fakes.

569
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,080
Yan Zijing is missing.

570
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,920
If you convict him and auction the shop,

571
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,030
maybe Yan Zijing will show up.

572
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,080
Master Yan usually

573
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,160
respects me.

574
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,470
If you auction Zhenlang Pavilion,

575
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,920
I'm willing to give you

576
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,640
all the jewelry in it.

577
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,110
I only want Zhenlang Pavilion.

578
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,550
Zheng Wu, what do you say?

579
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,760
I agree with Lady Shijiu.

580
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:28,840
Here's to you.

581
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,360
Lady Shijiu, you're generous.

582
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,590
Take the medicine.

583
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,680
Be careful. It's hot.

584
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,360
Thank you.

585
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,990
How do you have time

586
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,240
to study Go?

587
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,320
What?

588
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,630
Is the show over?

589
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,240
Yes.

590
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,150
Zhenlang Pavilion is sealed.

591
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,400
You're the owner.

592
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,070
But you don't seem to care at all.

593
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,470
Are you thinking of setting someone up?

594
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,030
What are you talking about?

595
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,950
Look what the Zheng family did to me.

596
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:20,800
Can I set someone up?

597
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,280
Don't pretend to be pathetic.

598
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,360
You've always been like that.

599
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,630
You value profits.

600
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,400
You plan ahead every time.

601
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,320
Am I that good?

602
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,630
You don't have to tell me.

603
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,320
I know all the people who are interested

604
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,200
in Zhenlang Pavilion.

605
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Don't forget

606
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,800
that there is one person who is very calm.

607
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,280
Who is it?

608
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,720
What do you think?

609
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,150
Yeah.

610
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,720
Mr. Zhang didn't act.

611
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,150
Tell me.

612
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,150
Who's next?

613
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,550
Xu Nanying

614
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,280
is next.

615
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,110
Collusion between government and businessmen.

616
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,110
Xu Nanying is an official.

617
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,840
The matter in Yangzhou is hard to solve.

618
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,030
You don't want Zhenlang Pavilion.

619
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,240
You might as well burn it

620
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,150
like you burned the Cui's Pearl Farm.

621
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,200
The things that the Cui family get their hands on

622
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,070
are dirty.

623
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,030
I don't understand

624
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,470
why Prince Ying trusted Xu Nanying

625
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,030
and appointed him

626
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,470
as the Governor of Yangzhou.

627
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,840
Xu Nanying was a man of Prince Tan.

628
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,630
Later, he went to Prince Ying.

629
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,430
It's weird.

630
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,150
If Prince Ying wanted money,

631
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,030
he didn't have to trust Xu Nanying.

632
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,880
Maybe...

633
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,110
Maybe Xu Nanying has something on him.

634
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,590
Xu Lin didn't follow Xu Nanying

635
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,030
to Yangzhou.

636
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,920
It's your turn.

637
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,280
You're in a good mood these days.

638
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,990
You're really generous.

639
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,070
If I didn't do it,

640
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,840
Xu Nanying wouldn't have agreed.

641
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,430
Even if you succeed,

642
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,510
you can only get an empty Zhenlang Pavilion.

643
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,760
What's the point of that?

644
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,880
I can change the Black Dragon Bandits' stolen goods

645
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,550
and sell them at Zhenlang Pavilion.

646
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,150
It's also to help the Zheng family.

647
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,110
Have you forgotten

648
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,920
that Zheng Si died on this?

649
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,920
Are you scared?

650
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,550
Zheng Zhixing was stupid.

651
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,280
Lady Huan was noble.

652
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,920
What could they do?

653
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,840
Stop.

[Baicaojing House]

655
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,150
You should learn how to be a woman

656
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,360
instead of a businesswoman.

657
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,200
Zheng Zhiheng and Cui Shijiu went to Xu Nanying.

658
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,760
Xu Nanying intervened in the case of Zhenlang Pavilion.

659
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,680
Steward Zhao pretended to betray.

660
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,550
Zhenlang Pavilion

661
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,150
will soon be auctioned.

662
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:27,110
The more greedy you are,

663
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
the sooner you fail.

664
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,680
Cui Shijiu,

665
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,240
Zhenlang Pavilion

666
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,880
is yours now.

Wait.

670
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,990
We don't know where Yan Zijing is.

671
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,360
I want to see him alive and dead.

672
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,360
Is he really dead?

673
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,680
Or

674
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,030
he's just hiding.

675
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,200
Wait.

676
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,560
It went so smoothly for me

677
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,840
to get Zhenlang Pavilion back.

678
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,070
He went through a lot to get Zhenlang Pavilion.

679
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,950
Why did he give it up?

680
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,430
Is this a trap?

681
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,680
Are we being deceived?

682
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,070
Shijiu, you care too much about Yan Zijing.

683
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,800
No one in Yangzhou can threaten the Zheng family.

684
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,320
And no one can threaten us.

685
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,240
Be happy.

686
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:15,110
You got Zhenlang Pavilion back.

687
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,590
Zhenlang Pavilion is one of the important shops of the Cui family.

688
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,720
I took back Zhenlang Pavilion.

689

What are you going to do after that?

692
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,550
Mr. Zheng.

693
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,070

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,400
Okay.

Qin Mu is unthoughtful.

He wants to depend on the Zheng family.

704
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,280
But the Zheng family won't really help him.
