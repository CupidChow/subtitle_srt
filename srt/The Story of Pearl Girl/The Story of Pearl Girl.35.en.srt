12
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,790
Come again soon.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,640
Thank you.

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,280
Have you seen him?

15
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,230
Sir, two buns, please.

16
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,000
Sure thing.

17
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,240
Here you go.

18
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:43,780
Thank you.

19
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,790
Buns! Hot and fresh buns!

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,280
Buns!

21
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,430
Two buns, please.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,950
Sure, our buns have thin skins and big fillings.

23
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,350
They taste amazing!

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,120
Here you go.

25
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,790
Sir, you've given me too much money!

26
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,910
Zheng Wu...

27
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,560
It's me.

28
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,400
Wu...

29
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,870
What are you wearing?

30
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,200
Where did you get these clothes?

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,920
- Why are you dressed like this? - Sit down.

32
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,910
My old clothes caught too much attention,

33
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,870
so I changed into these.

34
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,470
But you can't just run around like this.

35
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,560
The whole city is after us right now.

36
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,520
It's really dangerous.

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,960
I thought you were caught. I was scared to death.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,750
Hurry, eat them.

39
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,840
Where did you get the money?

40
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,150
I sold my ring. Now eat.

41
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,310
You didn't need to sell it.

42
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,910
I've got some jewelry here too.

43
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,240
Use it for travel expenses.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,190
We just need to get through tonight.

45
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,750
The city gates will open tomorrow.

46
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,800
Eat now. We need to conserve our strength.

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,870
You eat some too.

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,240
I already ate on my way here.

49
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,070
I saw him hide inside.

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,510
Go report it right now!

51
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,000
Got it.

52
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,920
Inspector Zhang, there's movement at the Zheng household.

53
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,120
Two carriages left the Zheng house.

54
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,270
One wandered around the city.

55
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,560
The other went into Lotus Lane.

56
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,510
Quickly, gather the troops and follow me!

57
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,600
Yes, sir!

58
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,870
Inspector Zhang, something happened in the prison.

59
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,390
What happened?

60
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,800
Mr. Wang forcibly took away Mr. Xu.

61
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,830
He had an imperial token.

62
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,870
What?

63
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,120
Mr. Wang, where are you heading?

64
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,630
Zhang Jinran, what are you trying to do?

65
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,830
I was ordered to summon Xu Nanying,

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,040
yet you've privately mobilized soldiers to stop me.

67
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,190
Do you still respect the imperial laws?

68
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,920
His Majesty has granted me the authority to command troops.

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,000
I should be asking you.

70
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,000
Where did you get the nerve to privately use guards

71
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,600
and oppress me, the Inspector of Huainandao?

72
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,190
Insolence!

73
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,240
Let's see who dares to act!

74
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,390
You've trespassed into the Grand Governor's Office.

75
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,720
Why wouldn't I dare?

76
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,750
Open your eyes.

77
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,160
The seal of the Court of Judicial Review is here!

78
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,560
Who dares make a move?

79
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,510
The Court of Judicial Review does not oversee me.

80
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,720
I won't question where you got that seal from.

81
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,920
Leave now, and I'll let this slide.

82
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,390
Otherwise,

83
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,070
we won't just detain Xu Nanying!

84
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,160
Today, I must take Xu Nanying away.

85
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,240
Kill anyone who stops me!

86
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,000
An imperial decree has arrived!

87
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,800
The Emperor decrees:

88
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,720
To Zhang Jinran, Inspector of Huainandao, tasked with overseeing Yangzhou,

89
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,160
correcting misconduct, and removing corruption.

90
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,270
Previously, you reported Xu Nanying of Yangzhou's Governor's Office

91
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,360
for bribery and abuse of power.

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,510
This weighs heavily on my heart.

93
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,040
Despite Xu's high position,

94
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,070
the grievances of the people cannot be ignored.

95
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,830
I hereby grant you the authority to preside over this case.

96
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,800
I, Zhang Jinran, accept the decree!

97
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,310
What's wrong, Mr. Wang?

98
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,950
Do you feel dissatisfied with this imperial decree?

99
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,040
I wouldn't dare.

100
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,430
Inspector Zhang,

101
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:30,750
His Majesty's decree only permits you to preside over Xu Nanying's case.

102
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,160
Don't think you can act recklessly.

103
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,270
Let me tell you this:

104
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,000
If I can impeach Xu Nanying,

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,160
I can impeach you too.

106
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,390
Take Xu Nanying back!

107
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,310
Shijiu!

108
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,950
Shijiu!

109
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,270
Father.

110
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,600
You still dare to call me Father?

111
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,950
Where is it?

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,750
Father,

113
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,430
I'll give you the beryl stone.

114
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,030
Just let us go.

115
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,790
So, this was your plan all along?

116
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,240
To steal the funds and run away?

117
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,550
Zheng Wu,

118
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,240
I raised you as the family heir

119
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,200
and planned everything for you.

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,200
Yet for this woman,

121
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,000
you heartlessly betrayed me!

122
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,670
Are you being fair to me,

123
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,600
fair to the Zheng family?

124
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,270
This has nothing to do with Cui Shijiu.

125
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,870
Let her go.

126
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,320
I'll take full responsibility for everything.

127
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,240
Can you even bear the consequences?

128
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,960
When you did this,

129
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,120
did you think about your mother?

130
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,120
Mother?

131
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,270
Where is Mother?

132
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,790
If your mother saw you like this,

133
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,320
how heartbroken would she be?

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,870
You know very well,

135
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,270
her greatest wish was for you to lead the Zheng family!

136
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,720
You're wrong.

137
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,910
All she ever wanted was for me to be safe and happy.

138
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,630
Foolish child!

139
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,870
Zheng Wu,

140
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,510
come with me.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,150
I will arrange your escape route.

142
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,080
Father,

143
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,910
what are you planning to do with me?

144
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,150
Well...

145
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,320
isn't this a ready-made fall guy?

146
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,200
When Prince Ying arrives,

147
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,600
I'll find a way to clear your name.

148
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,440
Zheng Wu, at this critical moment,

149
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,510
don't let emotions cloud your judgment. Act!

150
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,600
Father,

151
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,790
I would rather die

152
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,790
than let anyone hurt Cui Shijiu.

153
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Zheng Wu, I know you can't do it,

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
so I'll do it for you.

155
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:44,960
Master!

156
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,670
You dare hurt your father?

157
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,670
You've lost your mind!

158
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,600
I told you,

159
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,840
no one touches Cui Shijiu today!

160
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,910
Zheng Wu,

161
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,390
you are now the Zheng family's only heir,

162
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,240
the future of this family.

163
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,510
Are you going to destroy yourself

164
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,000
over this woman?

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,270
Zheng Si was also the family heir.

166
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,750
How did he die?

167
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,510
We were nothing but pawns in your game!

168
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,790
- Pawns! - What nonsense are you spouting?

169
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,840
You and Zheng Si are my sons!

170
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,360
I am your father!

171
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,270
We're family!

172
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,510
How could I harm you?

173
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,790
A family like this is not worth keeping!

174
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,720
I am Zheng Zhiheng,

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,030
and I will no longer live for this family.

176
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,030
This time,

177
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,790
I will live for myself.

178
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,200
How could you be so selfish?

179
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,630
You disobey me,

180
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,440
just to carry the label of a criminal

181
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,390
and run forever?

182
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,600
Do you think you can escape Yangzhou?

183
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,910
If I can't escape,

184
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,390
then I won't run.

185
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,720
You're the one who's committed countless crimes.

186
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:07,030
You're the one who colluded with bandits.

187
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,630
You're the one who sold stolen goods.

188
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,390
Why don't you confess to your crimes?

189
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,320
Why do you always make your son take the blame?

190
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,720
Father, what exactly does a son

191
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,670
mean to you?

192
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,360

How will I live?

The officers are here. We must leave, master!

Mr. Zheng, please come with me to the Grand Governor's Office.

279
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,310
Why?

280
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,640
Zheng Wu was found dead

281
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
in an old residence on Lotus Lane.

282
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,030
Our people saw your carriage entering the scene.

283
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,590
Mr. Zheng.

284
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,640
Zheng Wu committed a mistake and was chased by Inspector Zhang.

285
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,310
I tried to persuade him to surrender,

286
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,510
to explain everything clearly.

287
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,310
But he wouldn't listen,

288
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,240
and instead, he injured me.

289
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,720
I was planning to report this to the authorities tomorrow morning...

290
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,550
Regardless,

291
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,480
since you were present at the crime scene,

292
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,240
you must be involved in this case.

293
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,030
Take him away.

294
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,350
Change me into formal attire.

295
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,900
[Time is precious]

296
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:21,960
Zheng Shiyuan,

297
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,750
how did your son Zheng Zhiheng die?

298
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I tried to persuade him to confess and face the law,

299
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,240
but he stabbed me with a knife.

300
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,920
A guard of mine, in protecting me,

301
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,550
accidentally killed him.

302
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,640
And where is the guard now?

303
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,110
He has committed suicide.

304
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,110
Committed suicide?

305
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Zheng Wu was the only heir of the Zheng family.

306
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,200
He was filled with guilt,

307
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,640
and I couldn't stop him.

308
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,640
Now I must ask you, Inspector Zhang,

309
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,000
why did you issue a warrant for my son,

310
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,640
forcing him to a desperate end?

311
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,510
How dare you!

312
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,270
Merchant Kang Ming

313
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,070
reported that some goods at Jubao House were stolen property.

314
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,160
Your son Zheng Zhiheng was involved in fencing them.

315
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,880
And in his residence and carriages,

316
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,550
we found a large amount of evidence.

317
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,270
I know nothing about this.

318
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,070
Where did the stolen goods come from?

319
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,000
I believe someone will know.

320
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,160
Bring her in.

321
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,160
Cui Shijiu.

322
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,880
Just now, Zheng Shiyuan claimed

323
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,720
that Zheng Zhiheng stabbed him,

324
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,590
and his guard, in protecting him,

325
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,400
accidentally killed Zheng Zhiheng.

326
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,960
You were there at the scene.

327
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,030
Is Zheng Shiyuan telling the truth?

328
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,480
Yes.

329
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,920
Then, were you aware that Zheng Zhiheng

330
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,880
was involved in fencing stolen goods?

331
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I wasn't aware.

332
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,750
Inspector Zhang,

333
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,240
Zheng Wu acted rashly

334
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,640
and handled goods of unknown origin.

335
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,240
We truly knew nothing about it.

336
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,310
Please, Inspector Zhang, discern the truth.

337
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,830
However, he stole seals

338
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,790
and misused the Zheng family's private assets, which were not stolen.

339
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,510
Please return them to us.

340
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,310
Otherwise, the entire Zheng family,

341
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,790
the hundreds of craftsmen employed at Jubao House,

342
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,160
and the numerous merchants relying on our trade network

343
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,000
will all be ruined.

344
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,640
Yangzhou's jewelry industry will fall into chaos.

345
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,110
The law is strict.

346
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,440
Stolen goods are stolen goods,

347
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,510
and private assets are private assets.

348
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,400
Once the case is thoroughly investigated,

349
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,030
they will be returned to the Zheng family.

350
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,070
Inspector Zhang,

351
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,270
the Zheng family might last three to five more days,

352
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,880
but these hundreds or thousands of people

353
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,590
who rely on us for their livelihoods

354
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,830
cannot afford any delays.

355
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,350
Could you kindly allow me to return

356
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,350
and handle these affairs?

357
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,880
Whenever you need me,

358
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,830
I will be at your service.

359
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,750
The case is not yet resolved,

360
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,960
and you are still a suspect.

361
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,160
But considering the many craftsmen in your employ,

362
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,830
you may return to handle your affairs.

363
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,000
However, listen carefully,

364
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,440
you are not allowed to step outside your private residence.

365
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,240
Thank you, Inspector Zhang.

366
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,160
You were there at the scene.

367
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,200
What exactly happened?

368
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,240
Master!

369
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,270
Where is my Zheng Wu?

370
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Where is Zheng Wu?

371
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,510
Master, tell me,

372
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,510
they were lying to me.

373
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,720
Everything they said is false.

374
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:07,510
Say something!

375
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,310
Take Lady Yu back to rest.

376
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,960
It's you!

377
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,680
You're the one who harmed him!

378
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,960
You committed these crimes.

379
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,640
Why did you take my son's life?

380
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,590
How could you be so heartless?

381
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,960
Give me back my son!

382
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,440
Bring back my son!

383
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,270
Zheng Wu is gone.

384
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,240
I feel the same pain as you.

385
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,110
But if you dare spout nonsense again,

386
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,270
don't blame me for being ruthless.

387
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,400
Take her away!

388
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,310
Zheng Zhiheng is dead?

389
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,550
People often say "Blood is thicker than water".

390
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,350
I never expected Zheng Shiyuan to be this cruel.

391
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,200
Back then, Zheng Zhixing

392
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,310
also died mysteriously in prison.

393
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,030
For some people,

394
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,830
profit matters more than anything,

395
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,590
even more than family.

396
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,830
Truly, the human heart is unpredictable.

397
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,680
But Cui Shijiu escaped the flames.

398
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,750
She must know something,

399
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,750
yet she refuses to reveal it.

400
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,070
Zheng Zhiheng is dead.

401
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,030
As for Cui Shijiu...

[Zhenlang Pavilion]

404
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,590
Still awake?

405
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm just thinking about something.

406
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,590
What are you thinking about?

407
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,030
I'm thinking about the past.

408
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,030
You know what?

409
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,160
That shop on the street corner,

410
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,510
Zhang's Fabric Store,

411
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,550
was once owned by the Yan family.

412
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,680
Back in the day, Yan family thrived in Yangzhou

413
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,960
through business.

414
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,240
We owned seven stores at one point.

415
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,400
People even came all the way from Chang'an because of our reputation.

416
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,240
Although those stores look different now,

417
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,880
I can recognize them at a glance.

418
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,240
And that street in front of Clear Mind,

419
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,550
when I was a child,

420
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,270
my mother always took me there to play.

421
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:54,200
My father would carry me on his shoulders.

422
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,110
Back then, my mother

423
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,590
never let me eat sweet things.

424
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,400
I never understood why.

425
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,720
But as I grew older,

426
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,160
I understood even less.

427
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,960
Why are you suddenly recalling

428
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,400
the happy times of childhood?

429
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,240
Because I'm not done with revenge yet.

430
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,070
But now,

431
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,270
you are also something that makes me happy.

432
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,030
What about you?

433
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,720
Would you risk everything

434
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,960
to avenge Shrimp and the others?

435
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,070
I would.

436
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,000
If given the chance, I would never let Li Kui go.

437
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,480
But people aren't meant to live for hatred.

438
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,750
I know I shouldn't tell you to let go of your hatred,

439
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,270
but life goes on.

440
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,590
Still,

441
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,590
you should live your own life.

442
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,200
Have you thought about what you'd do

443
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,830
if your revenge is fulfilled?

444
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,310
Have you thought about making a home here in Yangzhou,

445
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,000
strolling through its streets,

446
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,000
and watching the lights of homes?

447
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,790
My whole life, honestly,

448
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,720
has been focused solely on revenge.

449
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,440
I've lived just to avenge.

450
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,750
So,

451
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,510
could I really live that kind of life?

452
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,880
I'll be with you.

453
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,510
Alright.

454
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,830
Don't catch a cold, silly.

455
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:11,400
Don't go...

456
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,280
What's wrong with you?

457
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,320
Where am I going?

458
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:21,800
Oh, right...

459
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,550
I'm really going to take you somewhere,

460
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:29,360
a place just for the two of us.

461
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,230
Once we get there,

462
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,320
there will no longer be Zheng Wu,

463
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,400
and no longer Cui Shijiu.

464
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:41,590
We can live a life of our own.

465
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,070
By then,

466
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,360
you'll have to give me a big, healthy boy.

but only half a million was used to repair the ancestral shrine.

faked the inventory records,

533

and pocketed all the seized gold,

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,280
if you want a reduced sentence,

560
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,510
confess what you know as soon as possible.

561
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,110
Keep dreaming.

562
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,480
I know nothing,

563
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,590
and I'll say nothing.

564
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,590
Senior,

565
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,960
I truly wanted to help you,

566
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,400
but since you're like this, so be it.

567
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,800
Duanwu, we're not opening today?

568
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,960
An important guest is coming, no business today.

569
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:24,670
Important guest? Who?

570
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,630
You'll know when they arrive.

571
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,920
I have big news to share.

572
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,670
[Property Transfer Document]
The deal is finalized!

573
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,670
From now on, we'll own four shops in Yangzhou!

574
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,070
Really? Let me see!

575
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,110
Starting today,

576
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,400
the two of you should start thinking

577
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,880
about which shop you'd like to manage.

578
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,190
Of course, I'll stay at Clear Mind.

579
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,550
I get to be a manager now?

580
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,320
Then you'll be working under me from now on.

581
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,400
Duanwu!

582
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,710
Mr. Zhang!

583
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,840
I'll handle this...

584
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,670
Congratulations!

585
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,480
Back in Hepu,

586
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,190
you told me you wanted to be a peddler.

587
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,110
Now, you've finally achieved your dream.

588
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,440
And you've created a new world of your own.

589
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,320
Whether a peddler or a shopkeeper,

590
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,760
it's all the best.

591
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:10,880
Mr. Zhang, please.

592
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,800
Alright.

593
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,960
The broader the world,

594
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,760
the greater the freedom.

595
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,030
Of course, I also believe

596
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,920
your ambitions won't stop at Yangzhou.

597
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,510
I'll take that as a blessing from you.

598
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,280
Thank you!

599
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,760
You've thanked him already.

600
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,360
What about me?

601
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,880
Of course, I need to thank you properly.

602
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,670
As for the money from the beryl deal,

603
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,230
I'll hand it over as soon as I have it all together.

604
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,400
But I have an idea.

605
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,110
Do you want to hear it?

606
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:44,920
Sure.

607
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,190
How about the beryl money

608
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,630
becomes an investment in Clear Mind?

609
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,150
You won't lose.

610
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:59,030
So, not only do you refuse to repay the money,

611
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,190
but you also want to be my boss?

612
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,510
I see you've got nowhere to go,

613
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,920
so why not stay at Clear Mind?

614
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:09,550
The money's gone, the goods are gone,

615
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,110
and now I'm stuck doing chores for you?

616
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,360
You really know how to work the angles.

617
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,440
It's up to you.

618
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,880
Alright, I'll think about it.

619
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,280
Ms. Su!

620
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:25,070
The guest has arrived.

621
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,110
He's here.

622
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,800
