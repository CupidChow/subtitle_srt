12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,200
Useless thing!

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,560
Where has he been?

14
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,790
How did he end up so drunk?

15
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,000
Lady Bai, don't blame him.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,150
Today, he invited Master Zheng and asked me to join,

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,150
but Master Zheng didn't show.

18
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,760
He felt bad about it,

19
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,000
that's why he drank too much.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,760
Yuanxiang,

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,560
we're from the same hometown.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Since coming to Yangzhou,

23
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,430
I've helped you quite a bit.

24
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,430
From now on,

25
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,310
if Mu takes you out on tasks again,

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,030
let me know in advance.

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,870
I understand, Lady Bai.

28
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,120
It's late. You should head back early.

29
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,400
Then, I'll take my leave.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
Rest well.

31
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,560
It hurts!

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
You're hitting me hard.

33
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,870
Yuanxiang only performs. She doesn't sell herself.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,080
Sending her to pour drinks,

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,360
you're putting her at risk!

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,630
A songstress shouldn't only perform.

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,310
She even dreams of marrying me,

38
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,280
but does she know her place?

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
Such a hassle.

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,630
Stop making indirect jabs at me.

41
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,030
My dear sister,

42
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,800
I didn't mean it like that.

43
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
Don't overthink, alright?

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
You have no sense of manners.

45
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,000
Even though Master Zheng didn't come today,

46
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,190
I still picked up some news.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
Zheng Wu seized the Zhenlang Pavilion back

48
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,080
and gifted it to his lover, Cui Shijiu.

49
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Working with the Zhengs is like trying to get blood from a stone?

50
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,870
Well, the blood has been taken!

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,590
The Zheng family is too complex.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
Take Zheng Si,

53
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
he's a legitimate son,

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,870
and yet they just cast him aside.

55
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,240
So, what do you suggest?

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,310
Given the current situation,

57
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,870
if we want to make a fortune, we can't be too cautious.

58
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,630
The Zheng family is vast and wealthy.

59
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,190
Whatever slips through their fingers

60
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,400
would be enough to secure my future.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
For me to rise as a guild director,

62
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,310
who else would I rely on but the Zhengs?

63
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,520
Depend on your boyfriend?

64
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,310
You're rambling nonsense again.

65
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,430
Father, Mother.

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,000
You're so generous,

67
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,000
spending a fortune to buy Zhenlang Pavilion

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,360
just to give it to Cui Shijiu.

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,870
Do you even care about the Zheng family?

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
Father, calm down.

71
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,240
I did this for the Zheng family,

72
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,720
by entrusting Zhenlang Pavilion to Cui Shijiu.

73
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,360
Zheng Wu,

74
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,800
stop keeping secrets from your father.

75
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,310
Just say what you need to say.

76
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,600
Cui Shijiu has been exposed to jewels since childhood.

77
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,680
Transforming jewels

78
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,920
is her specialty.

79
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,630
Yu,

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,830
you two, step outside for a moment.

81
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,160
Father.

82
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,680
Continue.

83
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,830
Now that Zhang Jinran keeps investigating,

84
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,600
if we hold onto that batch of goods,

85
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,310
it's bound to bring trouble eventually.

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,480
But if we

87
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,870
let Cui Shijiu manage Zhenlang Pavilion,

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,750
she can disguise that batch of goods and sell them off.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,480
By that time,

90
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,160
you can truly rest easy.

91
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,270
If any slip-up occurs,

92
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,120
Zhenlang Pavilion belongs to the Cui family...

93
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,310
It has nothing to do with the Zhengs.

94
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,190

95
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:10,950
Come with me.

96
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,430
Are you saying you're using Cui Shijiu?

97
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,830
Is this for real?

98
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,680
Of course it's real.

99
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,360
Mother, you know full well

100
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,430
Cui Shijiu has looked down on me since childhood.

101
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
If I didn't need to use her,

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560
why would I keep her by my side?

103
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,830
You might fool your father, but you can't fool me.

104
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,750
I'm not lying to you.

105
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,190
You have feelings for her,

106
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,750

108
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,510
But her?

109
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,360
She has no genuine feelings for you.

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,870
Her loyalty lies entirely with the Cui family.

I have everything under control.

113
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,430
Besides, as for Shijiu...

114
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,040
Don't bring up Cui Shijiu to me.

115
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't want to hear about her.

116
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,070
I just feel sorry for you.

117
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,630
You've given so much to her,

118
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,950

when Clear Mind was struggling,

176

Order a full set of glassware for me,

188
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,600
and don't give me any discounts.

189
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,030
I wouldn't feel right about it.

190
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,870
Alright, I'll bring it to you in a bit!

191
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,510
- I want a set too. - Yes!

192
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,550
- I want the same style as yours. - Me too!

193
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,000
This set?

194
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
- Yes. - I want one set too!

195
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,750
Alright.

196
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,480
A perfect shot every time.

197
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,600
Boring.

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,780
[Solid as Gold]

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,590
At this range, it's hard to miss.

200
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,510
Even more boring.

201
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,680
Let's go.

202
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,160
Mr. Zhang, you're teaming up with Ms. Su.

203
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,110
It's your turn.

204
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,200
Alright, my turn.

205
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,110
Nice!

206
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,230
Master Yan, you really are a good teacher.

207
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,750
Tonight, you should have a few extra drinks.

208
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,110
Gaoshou, go ahead.

209
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,510
Alright, I'm teaming up with Master Yan.

210
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,120
Master Yan, I'll go first then.

211
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,560
Sure.

212
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:55,920
Please.

213
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,680
Playing this?

214
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,870
[Solid as Gold]
We used to play this a lot as kids.

215
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,080
You're so useless.

216
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,320
Master Yan's team lost.

217
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,830
A drink as punishment.

218
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,040
We'll accept the penalty.

219
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,470
Pour me a drink.

220
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,800
I'll drink in his place.

221
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,990
- Give it to me. - No need. It's fine.

222
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,160
Enough, you two.

223
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,510
It's time for my second shot.

224
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,800
I drink less?

225
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,990
Fine, go ahead.

226
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,590
Mr. Zhang,

227
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,830
today was Clear Mind's grand opening.

228
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,870
Why are so many young ladies

229
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,560
asking you to paint their miniatures?

230
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,920
Gaoshou's up to no good again.

231
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,590
You just love

232
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,110
painting miniatures for young ladies, huh?

233
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,680
You really enjoy drawing...

234
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,160
Such a shame!

235
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,470
Aren't you cheating?

236
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm not!

237
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
Get back here and drink.

238
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,800
Your turn.

239
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,960
Drink up, Mr. Zhang!

240
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,320
You just wait, Gaoshou

241
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,470
Listen, a true master

242
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
won't be disturbed no matter what.

243
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,990
At this distance,

244
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,870
even being disturbed, I can still make the shot.

245
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,960
I trust Master Yan. I'll fetch you an arrow!

246
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,960
Catch, please.

247
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,680
Alright, I'll shoot from right here.

248
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,080
If Master Yan's playing,

249
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,710
the rules of the game should change,

250
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,830
or it won't be fair, right?

251
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,080
- Here, grab the arrow. - So, how should it be fair?

252
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,320
You shoot with your eyes covered by me.

253
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,110
That's a good idea!

254
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,470
- I agree. - Yes, indeed.

255
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,920
- I agree! - So this is your idea of fairness?

256
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,870
Is that fair?

257
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,710
Of course it's fair.

258
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,560
Get ready.

259
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,040
Ready?

260
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,350
Aim a bit to the left.

261
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,110
I won't listen to you. You're giving bad directions.

262
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,990
Trust me.

263
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,990
I don't trust you.

264
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,510
Fine, then go ahead.

Impressive!

270
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,960
Just a small feat.

271
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,870
- Come on. - Drink up, Master Yan.

272
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,750
Sure, come on!

Father...

287
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,560
Mr. Xu is one of us. Speak freely.

288
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,960
It's merely some business trifles,

289
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,110
but I feared it might disrupt Mr. Xu's leisure.

No bother.

291
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,750

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,320
Su Muzhe of Clear Mind has started selling glass as well.

293
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,960
The same batch from the old Qin's Glass Workshop.

294
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,960
Qin?

295
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,800
He hasn't left Yangzhou yet?

296
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,560
Not yet.

297
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,960
And what's this about the glass?

298
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
That Qin

299
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,710
once dared to produce substandard glass

300
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,990
and tried to challenge my Jubao House,

301
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,560
disrupting the operations of Yangzhou's jewelry shops.

302
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,160
So, I teach him a small lesson.

303
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,920
If it's defective, it should be expelled from Yangzhou.

304
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,630
Yes.

305
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,400
And now, Su Muzhe from Clear Mind

306
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,320
is bringing out that batch of defective glass

307
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,510
to stir up trouble.

308
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,160
Stir up trouble?

309
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,510
Just some glass,

310
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,710
how could it trouble our Mr. Zheng?

311
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,880
Go buy the land deed of Clear Mind

312
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,070
and drive them out of Yangzhou.

313
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,070
Father,

314
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,990
that land deed for Clear Mind

315
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,790
has already been purchased by Su Muzhe.

316
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,510
Then make sure they can't stay in business.

317
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,310
With Mr. Xu backing us,

318
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,790
what is there to worry about?

319
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,920
Yes, Father.

320
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,880
In the future,

321
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,750
we hope Mr. Xu will uphold justice for us.

322
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,510
A mere shop like Clear Mind

323
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,400
is hardly an issue.

What's wrong?

329
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,200
Tell me,

330
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,920
do you hate me?

331
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,360
Why are you laughing?

332
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,680
If I say I've never hated you,

333
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,120
would you believe me?

334
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,030
I wouldn't.

335
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,440
I don't hate you.

336
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,070
I only hate myself.

337
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,030
If only I hadn't insisted on following you,

338
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,550
they'd all still be alive.

339
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,600
What reason do I have to hate you?

340
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,750
In the end,

341
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,600
it's all my fault.

342
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,750
I have been consumed by vengeance.

343
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,550
It's not your fault.

344
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,750
You did nothing wrong.

345
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,160
The mistake lies in our birth.

346
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,600
The mistake is in the things we can't change.

347
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,070
That's why I wonder...

348
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,750
If we hadn't gone through this,

349
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,710
would the outcome be different?

350
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,750
Would you and me...

351
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,680
be different as well?

352
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,680
If you could do it all over again,

353
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,880
would you still want to know me?

00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,440
Clear Mind is selling toxic glassware!

372
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,240
Songstress Yuanxiang wore it for barely two days,

373
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,720
and now she's on the brink.

374
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,510
So, who's the heartless one?

375
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,110
Who's playing with people's lives?

376
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,640
Now you can't face the consequences, huh?

377
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,110
You're too scared to come out, huh?

378
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,310
Get out here!

379
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,240
So noisy.

380
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,750
It's not your place to speak.

381
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,310
Bring out the one responsible!

382
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,250
- Are you too ashamed - How can you stay so calm?

383
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,130
to show your face, huh?

384
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,830
Shut up already. That's enough.

385
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,680
You're not worthy of speaking to me.

386
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,920
Call out the one in charge!

387
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,590
Come out!

388
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,960
- I wasn't talking to you. - What's the problem?

389
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,440
Why are you even here, Qin?

390
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,750
Why am I here?

391
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,640
Even if Lady Yuanxiang

392
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
has a health problem,

393
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,350
what does it matter to you?

394
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,030
I'm here to fight injustice!

395
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,680
But you,

396
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,030
you took my money to smash Clear Mind,

397
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
and now you're working here?

398
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
Aren't you ashamed?

399
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,720
Double-dealing coward.

400
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,110
How dare you stand here?

401
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,960
You're unworthy! Get out of my way!

402
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,270
That's right!

403
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,680
I took your money

404
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,110
and smashed Clear Mind.

405
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,350
I admit it!

406
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
I'm a man who takes responsibility

407
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,030
for his actions.

408
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,030
I accept my fault,

409
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,000
and I correct my it.

410
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,550
What's the problem?

411
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,750
But you, foolish as you are,

412
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,480
I knew you wouldn't let this go.

413
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,880
I didn't think you'd actually dare to come here!

414
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,310
Why wouldn't I?

415
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,160
Where did you get the nerve?

416
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,480
I'm telling you, I'm doing what's right!

417
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,070
Don't...

418
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,590
Gaoshou.

419
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,440
So, Mr. Qin, you're finally admitting

420
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,270
that you once paid people to smash our Clear Mind?

421
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,680
If it weren't for Gaoshou's insight,

422
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
Clear Mind would have long fallen

423
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,510
to your disgraceful tactics.

424
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,830
What's this new stunt?

425
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,550
I'm leaving.

426
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,480
Trying to slander Clear Mind again?

427
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,070
Slander?

428
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,750
You've always resented Clear Mind.

429
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,590
Who would believe you?

430
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,350
Who would?

431
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,640
[Clear Mind]
Competitors are rivals,

432
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,240
stirring up trouble every other day.

433
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,000
Exactly.

434
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,680
But are you just going to let them

435
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,880
smear Clear Mind's name?

436
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,240
Sometimes things have to break to be rebuilt.

437
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,750
Sooner or later, Clear Mind would face this.

438
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,160
The one who should come isn't here yet.

439
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,640
Since you're free,

440
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
why not help me settle some accounts?

441
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,720
Fine.

442
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,640
On the sixth of March,

443
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,070
old jewels, nineteen taels.

444
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,400
Lady, these jewels are beautiful.

445
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,750
- Yes, indeed. - Trouble's come!

446
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,790
Qin Mu brought Yuanxiang

447
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,240
to Clear Mind, causing a scene.

448
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,640
He said Clear Mind's glass jewelry is toxic.

449
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,000
I heard Yuanxiang's face is covered in red rashes,

450
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,960
completely disfigured!

451
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,030
Are there any on my face?

452
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:21,830
No, there aren't.

453
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,590
Don't jump to conclusions.

454
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,070
Let's go see for ourselves first.

455
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,070
- Alright, let's go. - Okay.

456
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,160
[Clear Mind]
Don't you believe it?

457
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,590
Everyone, take a look!

458
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,200
The evidence is right here!

459
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,310
Sh's covered in red rashes.

460
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,160
- More breaths going out than coming in. - Move aside.

461
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,590
- Move aside. - It's all because

462
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,550
- of Clear Mind's toxic glass! - Move aside.

463
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,550
Look, she's barely hanging on!

464
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,030
So pitiful, isn't she?

465
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,880
Yuanxiang is in bad health,

466
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,960
- and still hasn't seen a doctor? - Shout it out!

467
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,680
- Something seems off. - Clear Mind sells toxic glassware!

468
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,030
Su Muzhe, come out!

469
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,960
Shout it, Clear Mind sells toxic glassware!

470
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,510
Su Muzhe, get out here!

471
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,920
Clear Mind sells toxic glassware!

472
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,680
Su Muzhe, come out here!

473
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,590
Not coming out, huh?

474
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,960
Hiding like a coward, huh?

475
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,510
Then don't blame me

476
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,240
if I have to come in and smash up your store!

477
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,830
Get out of my way!

478
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,240
What are you doing?

479
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,200
- Move aside. - What are you going to do?

480
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,550
- Don't touch me! I don't want to... - You're daring to smash our store?

481
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,830
This is too much!

482
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,920
If Yuanxiang's poisoned, report it to the authorities.

483
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,030
Causing a fuss here without any proof,

484
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,110
what's the point?

485
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,310
Don't block my way,

486
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,550
or I'll hit you too!

487
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,510
- I'm warning you... - You dare?

488
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,680
Go ahead, hit us and see!

489
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,830
If you attack innocent citizens,

490
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,830
we'll report it to the authorities right now!

491
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,270
- Exactly! - Go on, hit us and see!

492
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,200
With all these people watching,

493
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,310
hit me first, go ahead!

494
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:23,980
- Try it! - Hit us!

495
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,680
- Go ahead! - All together now!

496
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,110
Do it, hit us!

497
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,070
Go on, hit us!

498
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,000
Hey, you have no ties to Clear Mind anymore.

499
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,200
You have no shares here.

500
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,550
So why are you meddling in this?

501
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,030
Things need to be made clear.

502
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,790
Ms. Su would never do something like this!

503
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,200
I... I don't want to argue with you all.

504
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,480
Step aside!

505
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,270
What are you doing?

506
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:39,970
Step back!

507
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,300
Get out of the way!

508
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,440
Move aside!

509
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,240
Someone reported to the authorities,

510
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,830
claiming there's

511
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,240
a murder case at Clear Mind.

512
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,400
Did you file the report?

513
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,720
The main party has arrived.

514
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,240
Then we must go meet them.

515
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,680
What about April?

516
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,510
April,

517
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,310
old jewels, seven taels and five.

518
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
That fool!

519
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,510
He's no good on his own,

520
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,350
always trying these underhanded tricks.

521
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,880
Could the Zheng family be easy to deal with?

522
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,720
He's obsessed with becoming an guild director,

523
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,030
and doesn't even realize he's being played.

524
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,750
I heard Mr. Xu went over too.

525
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,440
With Mr. Xu backing him, it should be fine.

526
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,790
No, I still need to go check.

527
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:39,510
Oh...

528
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,790
Quick, go notify Mr. Xu immediately.

529
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,830
Or else, it'll be the end of everything.

530
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,030
Greetings, Inspector Zhang.

531
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,070
Baicaojing House has always obeyed the law.

532
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,830
You suddenly bring people here,

533
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
may I ask for what reason?

534
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,000
Let's go!

535
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,310
Inspector Zhang has ordered

536
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,350
that no one is to leave.

537
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,400
Qin Mu tried to frame Clear Mind with a poison box.

538
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,960
Is that what you call obeying the law?

539
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,240
Search carefully!

540
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,160
Don't miss a single spot!

541
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,750
Yes, sir!

542
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,440
What do you mean, Lady Bai?

543
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:46,550
Inspector Zhang,

544
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,310
you came to Baicaojing House

545
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,030
to look for some poison box, didn't you?

546
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,440
So why are you

547
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,720
suddenly going through our jewelry?

548
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,590
Open it!

549
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,590
I came here to find the poison box,

550
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,030
but I didn't expect to be so astonished.

551
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,160
Lady Bai,

552
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,960
do you recognize this chest of jewels?

553
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,640
These are jewels from Zhenlang Pavilion.

554
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,030
So why are they here at Baicaojing House?

555
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,510
Perhaps...

556
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,680
Perhaps there's a traitor within.

557
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,680
Is it really an inside traitor,

558
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,720
or is there another reason?

559
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,880
Come with me, and we'll find out soon enough.

560
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,750
Mr. Xu, look.

561
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,310
Yuanxiang's life is in grave danger.

562
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,480
You must stand up for us, Mr. Xu!

563
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,790
What exactly is going on here?

564
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,110
They're selling toxic glassware at Clear Mind.

565
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,110
She fell ill two days after wearing it.

566
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,920
Please, see for yourself.

567
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,750
You must bring justice to us.

568
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,070
Clear Mind is suspected of selling toxic glassware,

569
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,270
endangering the citizens of Yangzhou.

570
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,960
I hereby order the store to be sealed and the toxic glassware seized.

571
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,880
Anyone resisting will be dealt with by the law.

572
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,400
Yes, arrest them according to the law!

573
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,880
Yes, sir!

574
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,070
Wait!

575
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,510
Oh...

576
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,790
What's going on?

577
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,830
What's happening?

578
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,000
Mr. Xu!

579
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,830
Greetings.

580
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,200
Ms. Su, long time no see.

581
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,160
You seem to be in good spirits lately.

582
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,200
It appears that tonics do benefit the health.

583
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,590
After today,

584
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,750
I may feel even better.

585
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
That remains to be seen.

586
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,720
[Clear Mind]
Mr. Xu, Lady Yuanxiang's condition is critical.

587
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,680
If it turns out to be a fault of Clear Mind,

588
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,790
I will take full responsibility.

589
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,400
However,

590
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,240
let's get her to the clinic first.

591
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,310
What do you say?

592
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,510
Ms. Su, you have a compassionate heart.

593
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,310
Let's proceed as you suggest.

594
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,200
I'll trouble you ladies with the task.

595
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,510
Rest assured.

596
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,400
We've clarified the matter!

597
00:29:59,400 --> 00:29:59,830
Move aside!

598
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,640
No one is allowed to leave!

599
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:00,960
No!

600
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,830
Once Lady Yuanxiang is taken to the clinic,

601
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,750
we'll soon find out

602
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:09,200
the source of this poison.

603
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,750
Mr. Xu, Clear Mind is so malicious,

604
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,590
treating lives as nothing.

605
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,880
You must stand up for us!

606
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,720
Clear Mind has sold

607
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,310
hundreds of glass hairpins,

608
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,880
and I've carefully examined each one.

609
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,110
I've never heard of anyone being poisoned.

610
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,400
You claim Yuanxiang was poisoned

611
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,200
by a glass hairpin from Clear Mind.

612
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,200
Then where is this toxic glassware now?

613
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,640
Show it!

614
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,440
This is indeed from Clear Mind,

615
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,790
it has our mark on the base.

616
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,400
So, it's all come to light, hasn't it?

617
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,200
Mr. Xu, the evidence is clear.

618
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,960
Since that's the case,

619
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I'll trouble Ms. Su and everyone from Clear Mind

620
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,550
to come to my office for questioning.

621
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,160
Mr. Xu,

622
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,350
even in the court of law,

623
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,440
I should be allowed to defend myself, shouldn't I?

624
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,270
At this point,

625
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,240
what is there left to argue, Ms. Su?

626
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,550
The show's just begun.

627
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,570
Okay.

628
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,240
Mr. Qin...

629
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,920
What is that?

630
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,960
Poison pollen!

631
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,920
Help!

632
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,240
- Mr. Xu. - What's wrong with you?

633
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,200
Look,

634
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,110
Poison pollen! Bring water, quickly!

635
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,310
How did you know

636
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,920
there was poison pollen inside this box?

637
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,480
Can't I just take a guess?

638
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,110
Mr. Xu, instead of hastily searching our shop,

639
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,680
why not ask Mr. Qin

640
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,070
how he so quickly identified

641
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,270
this as poison pollen?

642
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,640
First, he said our glass is toxic.

643
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,960
Now, he says the powder in this box is poisonous.

644
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,310
Mr. Qin,

645
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,550
what's really going on here?

646
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,400
Mr. Xu,

647
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,400
it seems

648
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,200
this was all a misunderstanding.

649
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,880
You jumped to conclusions,

650
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,440
claiming there's a murder case tied to Clear Mind.

651
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,880
Is that something to joke about?

652
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,070
Now, shouldn't you apologize to Ms. Su?

653
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,240
Well...

654
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,280
- This is slander! - Indeed!

655
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,550
Ms. Su, this was a misunderstanding.

656
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,000
Please be forgiving.

657
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,350
Mr. Xu,

658
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,720
it's no easy task for us to run a business.

659
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,160
Especially,

660
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,440
since Lady Yuanxiang's life is at stake.

661
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Calling this a "misunderstanding"

662
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,200
isn't too light?

663
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,830
Moreover,

664
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,550
the citizens of this city

665
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,590
now believe Clear Mind sells toxic glassware.

666
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,440
How am I supposed to do business from now on?

667
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,110
If you ask me,

668
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,590
I won't stand for it.

669
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,240
Let's settle today's matter

670
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,640
right here and now.

671
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,440
Yes!

672
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,440
Recently, Clear Mind ordered

673
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,440
five hundred decorative boxes.

674
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,920
It turns out these boxes

675
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,480
were laced with oleander pollen.

676
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,030
Ms. Su has that batch sealed up long ago,

677
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,790
not a single one leaking out.

678
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,830
What's in these boxes now

679
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,510
is merely our specially crafted fragrance powder,

680
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,160
completely harmless.

681
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,960
And the box merchant confessed

682
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,270
it was Qin Mu who paid people to do it.

683
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,400
You're telling lies!

684
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,070
Where's the proof?

685
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,110
We have it!

686
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,790
Please have a look.

687
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,830
Mr. Xu.

688
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,960
Mr. Xu.

689
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,550
It appears

690
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,440
there's quite a story between Mr. Qin

691
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,400
and this box merchant.

692
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,830
Guards, take Mr. Qin into custody!

693
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
Mr. Xu, I...

694
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,880
Take him away!

695
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,240
Move!

696
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,360
Ms. Su, today's events were purely a misunderstanding.

697
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,280
Sorry for the disturbance.

698
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,670
I have other pressing matters, so I'll take my leave.

699
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,070
Mr. Xu, it's rare for you to visit Clear Mind,

700
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,280
and I also have important matters to discuss with you.

701
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,840
Ms. Su, feel free to speak plainly.

702
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,550
This fool Qin Mu

703
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,630
is Bai Niao's younger brother.

704
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,760
Given the relationship between Bai Niao and you,

705
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,590
protecting her foolish brother

706
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,710
must have been taxing.

707
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,800
My connection with Lady Bai is merely a passing affair.

708
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,480
If you have nothing further to say,

709
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,320
then I shall take my leave.

710
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,440
Whatever Baicaojing House can do for you,

711
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,070
Clear Mind can assist with as well.

712
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,360
It seems you start understanding

713
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,400
the challenges of doing business in Yangzhou.

714
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,760
Looking for new support?

715
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,110
Conducting business in Yangzhou

716
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,920
naturally requires some protection.

717
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,670
Providing protection isn't an issue.

718
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,280
I only care

719
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,400
about your token of loyalty.

720
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,110
Yingtao,

721
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,110
prepare the tea.

722
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,550
Xu Nanying!

723
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,480
Seems we won't need to talk at all.

724
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,620
[Clear Mind]

725
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,760
When you took office, you came with little attention.

726
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,070
In less than half a year,

727
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:04,070
how did you accumulate a fortune at Baicaojing House?

728
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,000
You've been investigating me secretly?

729
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,480
I have the authority to inspect anyone.

730
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,670
Take him away!

731
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,800
No need.

732
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,510
You've schemed for so long.

733
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,590
Jinran,

734
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,280
wherever you're taking me,

735
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,840
I will follow you.

736
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,400
Duanwu.

737
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,030
That's wonderful!

738
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,670
Seventeen thousand...

739
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,400
It's like this.

740
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,030
Ladies.

741
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,230
Ms. Su!

742
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:02,670
Ms. Su,

743
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,710
the ladies have been waiting outside for a while,

744
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
so I invited them in.

745
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,920
That scoundrel Qin Mu

746
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,590
tricked Yuanxiang into thinking he'd marry her,

747
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,030
just to use her to frame you.

748
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,440
Today, it nearly cost you everything.

749
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,000
Thankfully, you held no grudges,

750
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,670
sent Yuanxiang for treatment in time,

751
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,230
and even covered her medical fees.

752
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,710
Yes, she's lucky to be alive.

753
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,710
She's filled with regret now,

754
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,030
and sent us to thank you personally.

755
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,840
We all live in this world

756
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,590
with no parents to pamper us,

757
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,440
no brothers to protect us,

758
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,510
like floating duckweed.

759
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,280
But when duckweed gathers together,

760
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,630
supporting each other,

761
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,630
it won't drift aimlessly.

762
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,230
Regarding the toxic glassware affair,

763
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,440
I never imagined you all would come to my aid.

764
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:56,760
Thank you.

765
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,840
Ms. Su,

766
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,110
we were timid and fool before

767
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,000
and backed out of our shares.

768
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,280
Later, when you were framed,

769
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,400
we stayed on the sidelines,

770
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,030
watching indifferently.

771
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,320
But after what happened with Yuanxiang,

772
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,110
we finally understand the good and evil in people's hearts.

773
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,670
In short,

774
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,590
we now see clearly that you are someone

775
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,110
who's kindhearted, loyal, and righteous.

776
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,480
Today, we came not just to thank you,

777
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,670
but to apologize too.

778
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,920
Then...

779
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,590
we'll take our leave.

780
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,110
Wait.

781
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,590
In truth, we're all the same,

782
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,230
without any support in this world.

783
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,190
But I've been thinking,

784
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,480
if women could rely

785
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,630
on one another,

786
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,070
then perhaps there wouldn't be another Yuanxiang.

787
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,710
There's something

788
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,030
I need the opinion of you on.

789
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,110
I want to establish the Duckweed Society within Clear Mind.

790
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:25,070
From now on, we'll set aside ten percent of our profits

791
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,110
and add

792
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,800
Lady Huan's former shares to it,

793
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,800
to help women in Yangzhou

794
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,590
who, like us,

795
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,920
have no one to rely on.

796
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:39,710
How about it?

797
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,280
With the Duckweed Society,

798
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,710
our hearts and efforts

799
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,840
will be united.

800
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,190
We'll finally have a place to call home.

801
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,000
So,

802
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,760

803
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,960
Yes.

804
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,710
This time, no more backing out!

805
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,880
Absolutely not.

806
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,230

Alright, take a seat, everyone.

00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,400
you harmed the people,

then framed Clear Mind.

00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,110
I'm innocent, Inspector Zhang!

I don't know anything.

She made me do it!

824
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,510
She's envious of Clear Mind's business,

825
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,320
so she wants to take it over herself!

Inspector Zhang, I was orphaned at a young age.

827
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,000
I fought my way up from nothing to get here.

828
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,480
I would never do something so despicable.

Reporting to Inspector Zhang,

what Qin Mu said is true.

834
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,920
The poisoning was my doing alone,

835

and has nothing to do with anyone else.

Exactly, it has nothing to do with me!

requesting that Inspector Zhang punish the evildoer severely,

Restore justice for Yuanxiang!

I, Yuanxiang, accuse Qin Mu of poisoning me,

and deliberately delaying

851

when my life was at risk,

852
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,630
solely to ruin Clear Mind's reputation.
