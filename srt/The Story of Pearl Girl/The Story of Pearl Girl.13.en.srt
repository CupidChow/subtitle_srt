12
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,070
Who's so bold

13
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,870
to dare deceive Master Yan?

14
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,690
You.

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,510
Me?

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Master Yan, you must be joking.

17
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,920
I obtained a batch of fine jade

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,310
from Master Zhou,

19
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,920
thinking it was foolproof.

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
But unexpectedly,

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,350
it turned out to be fake jade.

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,840
He told me this jade came from the Yue family,

23
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,430
and if I want compensation, I should come to you.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,560
He was also deceived by you.

25
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,310
Nonsense! He knew perfectly well...

26
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,150
Knew what?

27
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,630
In any case, this receipt from Master Zhou

28
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,750
clearly states it's from the Yue family.

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,590
So, you need to compensate me.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,280
I have no money.

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,280
If you're broke, then I'll have no choice but to report you.

32
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,840
You...

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,310
Oh, right!

34
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,680
In that dowry you gave me,

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
there were also several boxes of jade.

36
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,720
I honestly can't tell if they're real or fake.

37
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,120
How about we send them all to the Prefect's Office?

38
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,700
But who knows

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,280
if the governor will trust his own young master

40
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,470
or stand for your Yue family's justice?

41
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,350
If this ruins your family's reputation,

42
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,720
you'll have no place left in Shaozhou.

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,120
Yan Zijing,

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,280
I have no past grievances nor recent enmity with you.

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,880
Why are you scheming against me?

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,140
Clearly, you made the fake jade.

47
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,750
Why accuse me of scheming against you?

48
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,820
Master Yan,

49
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,620
whatever the case,

50
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,030
we'll be family soon, won't we?

51
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,560
Aren't you going to marry Yunxiu?

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,750
As for the price,

53
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,590
we can negotiate.

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,530
Master!

55
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,750
Did you find the back door?

56
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,520
Yes, it's over there.

57
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,680
Let's go, quickly!

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Duanwu,

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,380
I just saw the Master

60
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,970
bring a lot of men to the Yue residence.

61
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,360
Loud,

62
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,100
find a safe place to settle Lady Shiqi,

63
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,680
and find the best doctor in Shaozhou to treat her hand.

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,150
Let's go.

65
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,500
Don't be afraid, they'll take good care of you.

66
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,800
I'll handle things with your father.

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,140
Go now.

68
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,160
Let's go.

69
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:10,610
Duanwu...

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,030
Let's go, Shrimp.

71
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,360
Go, quickly!

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,320
Take good care of her!

73
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,500
I...

74
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,870
I can give you Yunxiu.

75
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,270
No payment needed.

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,160
She's my blood sister,

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,070
and it's not your place to offer her.

78
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
Master Yan...

79
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,870
Master Yan...

80
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,950
Please, have mercy on me!

81
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,310
Master Yan...

82
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,040
I ask you,

83
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,950
how did Yue Yunxiu come to the Yue family?

84
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,390
How is she your blood sister?

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
She's my elder brother's illegitimate daughter.

86
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,800
Your elder brother?

87
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,480
Yes.

88
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,630
After my elder brother died,

89
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,070
his mistress brought Shiqi to Shaozhou,

90
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,390
seeking my protection.

91
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,750
Later, I saw she had a talent for carving jade,

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,160
so I kept her by my side.

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
Where did that jade pendant come from?

94
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,630
The jade pendant...

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
I picked it up.

96
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Back then,

97
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,870
I thought it was quite interesting.

98
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,040
Quite interesting?

99
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,720
Then,

100
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,830
where is the girl with the jade pendant?

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,680
I'm asking you, where is the girl with the jade pendant?

102
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,680
She... she's dead.

103
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,390
How did she die?

104
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
I'm asking you, how did she die?

105
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,680
She fell from a horse.

106
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,920
Cui Ding had me guard outside the Yan family villa,

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,430
but then,

108
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,800
her nanny took her and ran.

109
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,480
So I chased after them...

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,510
chased after them...

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,920
And then?

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,680
Master,

113
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,920
let's not ask anymore.

114
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,270
Let's not ask.

115
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,120
I'm asking you, what happened next?

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,750
She... she...

117
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,560
Then she fell from the horse

118
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,510
and died.

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
He told me

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,070
my sister was dead.

121
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,510
Do you believe him?

122
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,000

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,080
What about your health?

191
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,790
What if your old illness returns?

192
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,360
Don't worry about me.

193
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,360
Stop drinking!

194
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,790
I'll drink with him.

195
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,720
They say

196
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,960
this is the best wine in Shaozhou.

197
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:10,910
Let me pour you a taste.

198
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,910
If you can't drink, then don't.

199
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,030
If it makes you feel better, drink.

200
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,080
When I escaped from the pearl farm,

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,320
I realized Lady Eight was my mother.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,270
The moment she died before me...

203
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,200
perhaps that's exactly how you feel now.

204
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,390
Whether she's with us or not,

205
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,910
I know she'd hope

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that I live well.

207
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,150
So your mother, your father, and sister

208
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,580
would wish the same.

209
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,930
Right.

210
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,140
Here.

211
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,320
[Shaozhou Inn]

212
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I have a younger sister.

213
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,030
She's my adoptive parents' child.

214
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,790
I don't know where she is now,

215
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,440
or if she's doing well.

216
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,030
I have a sister too.

217
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,720
I remember back then,

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,440
she was so very small,

219
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,670
and her cheeks always rosy.

220
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,120
She was always smiling at me,

221
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,080
and always nagging me to take her out.

222
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,550
I feel sorry for you.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
What's there to feel sorry about?

224
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,000
What was the pearl farm like before?

225
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,670
Back then,

226
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,080
though pearl diving was tough,

227
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,390
it was voluntary for those able and willing.

228
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,790
And my father was so kind back then.

229
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,080
He never forced anyone.

230
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,550
So later,

231
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,910
our whole family went to the Western Regions for trade,

232
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
and we gained a foothold in Yangzhou.

233
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,150
That's wonderful.

234
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,270
They say we all live in darkness.

235
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,150
But look,

236
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,750
if you look up, there's light.

237
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,760
You're such a kind soul!

238
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,970
Thank you!

239
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,980
Please, have mercy.

240
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,810
I have no money.

241
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,680
Please, pity us.

242
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,380
Thank you!

243
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,790
It's terrifying!

244
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:48,690
Give us some food.

245
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,440
Please, give us some food.

246
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,790
A bit of food, please.

247
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,140
Thank you!

248
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,510
Isn't Wuling known for its Wuling stones?

249
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,390
Each piece is worth a fortune.

250
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,360
Why are the townsfolk here living in such misery?

251
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,750
Is Master Eight truly wealthy?

252
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,310
The price of Wuling stones has never gone down.

253
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,270
How could Master Eight not have money?

254
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,070
He hasn't become the family head

255
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,960
because he's too selfish.

256
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,270
I just didn't expect him to be so selfish.

257
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,680
Show some mercy, two hundred mace.

258
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,920
- Get lost! - Two hundred mace and take her away!

259
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,550
Get lost!

260
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,400
Master,

261
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,440
please, take her with you.

262
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
- I'm hungry... - Please, Master!

263
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,000
- I'm starving... - I beg you.

264
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,510
Thank you, Master!

265
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,130
Thank you, Master!

266
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,120
Thank you, Master!

267
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,440
- Thank you! - Thank you, Master!

268
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,610
Thank you!

269
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,690
Thank you!

270
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,400
Thank you!

271
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,250
Here...

272
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Take it and go home.

273
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,960
Hurry, thank the Master.

274
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,090
Dear, thank the Master.

275
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,350
- Thank you! - Thank you, Master!

276
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,070
- Thank you - Now, get going!

277
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,980
Prepare some herbal brews to guard against miasma.

278
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:53,920
We all need to drink it.

279
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,920
Also,

280
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
get some lantana flowers ready.

281
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,680
Yes, sir.

282
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,200
My apologies, my dear niece,

283
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,680
for making you wait so long.

284
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,160
I heard you were here,

285
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,070
so I spurred my horse,

286
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,880
rushing back from the mines.

287
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,920
Greetings, Master Eight.

288
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,550
Shijiu, no need for formalities.

289
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,400
What guidance do you have for us this time?

290
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,030
I can't offer guidance.

291
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
I've come with a message from my father.

292
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,270
My father is gravely ill,

293
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,440
and the Cui family elders have sent me here

294
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,350
to request your return to Yangzhou.

295
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,880
The Cui family elders?

296
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,790
Since when did they remember me?

297
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,680
Shijiu, you should know

298
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,680
I am a disgraced man,

299
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,400
banished to Wuling in defeat.

300
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,880
But ever since I was a child, my father would tell me

301
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,830
how you and he overcame

302
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,270
the poisonous miasma here in Wuling,

303
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,200
how you built the mines and stone quarries,

304
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,830
and how, using Wuling stone,

305
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,240
you opened the stone-carving market.

306
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,400
You followed him through thick and thin,

307
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,550
expanding territories,

308
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,030
even at the cost of your own health.

309
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,270
All these years,

310
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,030
he's only ever

311
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,830
spoken well of you.

312
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
you truly have a silver tongue.

313
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
If he remembered me so fondly,

314
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,980
then why, after all these years,

315
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,920
has he never set foot in Wuling

316
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,440
or called me back to the ancestral home in Yangzhou?

317
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,790
Back then, when you fought for the family head position,

318
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,590
it caused quite a stir,

319
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,440
and the Cui family elders held a grudge.

320
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,550
My father felt he wronged you,

321
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,090
and has spent all these years trying to mediate.

322
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,720
So this time, taking advantage of his illness,

323
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,790
he persuaded the elders

324
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,350
and specifically sent me to bring you back.

325
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:31,920
Truly?

326
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

327
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,440
It's the absolute truth!

328
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,480
Very well.

329
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,640
Then I shall arrange a banquet

330
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,550
to welcome you.

331
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,310
During the feast,

332
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,070
I will inform the stewards

333
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,790
of the family head's directive.

334
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,680
Please rest assured.

335
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,510
Master,

336
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,680
the family head truly is in poor health this time.

337
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,550
It seems

338
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,550
she hasn't lied to me.

339
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,680
But I still find Lady Shijiu's visit

340
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,550
rather suspicious.

341
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,480
Perhaps we should place her under house arrest first.

342
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,880
No rush.

343
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,030
Let her bring out

344
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,640
the family head's token at the banquet,

345
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,830
and we'll act after that.

346
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,310
A young woman

347
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,270
can't stir up much trouble.

348
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,680
Understood.

349
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,960
Master Shijiu,

350
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,070
this place looks like a den of bandits.

351
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,550
Every guard has a fierce look

352
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,160
and carries such a long blade.

353
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,920
We'd better leave quickly.

354
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,960
Besides,

355
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,310
we don't actually have the family head's decree.

356
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,350
If I say we do, then we do.

357
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,350
But...

358
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,550
No "but".

359
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,270
If we don't see each of the stewards,

360
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,030
how can we reclaim control over Wuling?

361
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,590
Wuling has long been out of the Cui family's hands.

362
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
With Master Eight here,

363
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,790
I fear

364
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,480
those stewards won't listen to us.

365
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,960
Then we'll make him disappear.

366
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,960
Where are the items I asked you to prepare?

367
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,240
They're all ready.

368
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,720
Good.

369
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Now tell me,

370
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,720
everything you've done,

371
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,160
and everything you know.

372
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,720
The Cui family commissioned me

373
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,110
to make a replica of the Apsaras statue.

374
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,240
They promised that once it was done,

375
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,750
I'd get to keep the original,

376
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,550
and they even offered me

377
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,270
ten taels of pearls annually as hush money.

378
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,310
I...

379
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,590
I really didn't know that the Apsaras statue

380
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,960
was a tribute gift to the court.

381
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,030
Otherwise,

382
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,270
no matter how much you threaten me,

383
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,790
I wouldn't have dared to forge it!

384
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,240
You said the Cui and Yue families have no connection,

385
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,480
so how did he find you?

386
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,270
Just by chance.

387
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,720
I'll talk.

388
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,860
I'll talk.

389
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,830
It was

390
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,240
Master Eight who introduced me to the Cui family.

391
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,880
That's all...

392
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,350
Speak!

393
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,070
It was...

394
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:19,960
it was Black Dragon Bandits.

395
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,110
They were the intermediaries.

396
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Black Dragon Bandits?

397
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,350
If Master Eight was so powerful,

398
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,550
why would he stay hidden in Wuling?

399
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,070
He's been helping the Cui family trade along the Western route,

400
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,110
and incidentally helping me get goods.

401
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,270
He thought that this would give him control over the Cui family.

402
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,750
but in the end,

403
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,790
he still couldn't beat Cui Jingchu,

404
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,070
so he retreated to Wuling.

405
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,070
Then...

406
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,350
There's been a complaint against the Yue family for selling fake jade,

407
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,960
and I am here by order to investigate!

408
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,310
Search!

409
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,790
Mr. Zhang, you truly are an upright man,

410
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,200
with a keen eye for detail.

411
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,240
You've come at just the right time.

412
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,030
The Yue family

413
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,270
also deceived me of my money.

414
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,030
How will they compensate me?

415
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,550
After we liquidate the Yue family's assets,

416
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,880
all claimants will be compensated.

417
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,510
But with so many victims,

418
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,350
can one Yue family really afford it?

419
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,480
However, I have an idea.

420
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,240
I've heard

421
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,830
that you're an old friend of Master Eight.

422
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,000
I wonder

423
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,510
if he'd be willing to help you.

424
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,480
Lady Shiqi.

425
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,790
Duanwu!

426
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,720
What's wrong?

427
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,200
Duanwu, I've waited for you for so long.

428
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,400
I heard my father was involved in jade forgery.

429
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,550
Is there hope for him and the Yue family?

430
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,160
Don't worry.

431
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,000
Is there?

432
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,590
No.

433
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,480
I...

434
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,920
I also heard

435
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,240
that my hand issue...

436
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,240
was caused by my father.

437
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,480
Why...

438
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,030
why would he do this to me?

439
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,440
He took me in as his daughter,

440
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,030
treated me as his own.

441
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,270
Why would he do this to me?

442
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,750
What did I do wrong to deserve this?

443
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,160
You did nothing wrong.

444
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,350
None of this is your fault.

445
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,790
I always thought, despite my unfortunate origins,

446
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,310
that I have found someone

447
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,440
who understood me,

448
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,270
who taught me to carve jade,

449
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,720
who passed on his skills.

450
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,720
He said he's the light on my path, shaping me into jade.

451
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,030
He also said I was his finest work.

452
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,480
But I never imagined

453
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,920
he would destroy me to achieve his own success.

454
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,240
Yes,

455
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,830
I was always an unwanted,

456
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,790
unloved orphan.

457
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,590
You are not an orphan,

458
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,270
nor anyone's "work".

459
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,790
You are Yue Yunxiu,

460
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,790
the Jade Goddess of Shaozhou.

461
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
No, I'm not.

462
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,250
My hands are ruined,

463
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,880
and I can't do anything now.

464
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,420
I'm nothing but a useless wreck.

465
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,640
The doctor said,

466
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
if you take care of them properly,

467
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,200
there's a chance of recovery.

468
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,070
Believe me.

469
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,720
Duanwu.

470
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,200
Yu Shi's Apsaras statue?

471
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,920
The original?

472
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,440
Yes.

473
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,240
Give me the blood-stained pearl.

474
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,590
The blood-stained pearl.

475
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,550
There were originally two of them.

476
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,830
Where is the other one?

477
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,720
It could be lost in the desert,

478
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,200
or maybe someone else has it.

479
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,550
I don't know.

480
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,210
The blood-stained pearl,

481
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,940
the Apsaras statue.

482
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,590
What does all this mean?

483
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,040
Haven't you figured it out?

484
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,640
Yu Shi was my father?

485
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,750
Yu Shi is in the Western Regions,

486
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,680
so I can find him there,

487
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,680
right?

488
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,510
Your father's...

489
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,030
already dead.

490
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,590
It was related to the Apsaras statue?

491
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,030
Yes.

492
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,750
And also to the Cui and Yue families?

493
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,310
Yes.

494
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,720
And the Yan family of Yangzhou.

495
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,030
Yes.

496
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,790
What happened?

497
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,030
At this point,

498
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,550
why carry this burden?

499
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,880
I just want to know.

500
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,750
Yu Shi

501
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,270
was the chief jade carver of the Yan family in Yangzhou.

502
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
Lady Eight

503
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,270
was originally Lady Yan of the Liu family,

504
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,960
the matriarch of the Yan family,

505
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,880
and my mother's personal maid.

506
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,000
They grew up together as friends.

507
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,790
Your father died

508
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,030
because of the Yan family.

509
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,880
Have you avenged all your grudges?

510
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,550
The Cui and Yue families are merely merchants.

511
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,480
Escorting tribute gifts

512
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,480
is a critical task.

513
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,640
How could a few merchants accomplish it alone?

514
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,030
There were others,

515
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,270
weren't there?

516
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,590
You don't have to tell me.

517
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,030
I can investigate on my own.

518
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,690
It was the Black Dragon Bandits.

519
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,550
Black Dragon Bandits?

520
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,780
They're desert bandits from the Western Regions.

521
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,270
Then why would they do this?

522
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,750
Power, greed, human nature.

523
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,790
These things

524
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,610
are more vicious than the whips

525
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,200
you endured at the pearl farm.

526
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,650
So, you're going to the Western Regions

527
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,720
to find the Black Dragon Bandits?

528
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:07,860
Yes.

529
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,530
I'll go with you.

530
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,830
Alright.

531
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,070
I'll take you with me.

532
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,590
This was left by your dad.

533
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,640
Keep it safe, and find him in the Western Regions.

534
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,350
Remember, find him in the Western Regions.

535
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,000
Mom...

536
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
I'm sorry.

537
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,400
I can't find Father.

538
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,510
I thought that once I found him,

539
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,680
I'd no longer be alone.

540
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,880
But in the end, I must keep walking this path alone.

541
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,920
Mom...

542
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,000
have you seen Dad?

543
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,590
Are you both watching me from above,

544
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:07,030
worried I'll never find a home?

545
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,670
Yan Zijing,

546
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,230
now I understand

547
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,670
why you feel there's nothing left to hold onto

548
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,190
in this miserable world.

He told you everything?

Don't resent him.

560
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,110
When he saw the blood-stained pearl,

561
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,030
he recognized you right away.

562
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,030
You only know the cruelty of the pearl farm,

563
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,070
but not the dangers of the world.

564
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,190
He's been protecting you in his own way.

565
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,000
That's the only way he knows,

566
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,590
because that's how he survived.

567
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,440
From the moment I boarded that ship, I was prepared.

568
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
I have no regrets.

569
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,190
I don't resent him either.

570
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,000
I'm sorry.

571
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,710
I overthought things.

572
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,550
Actually...

573
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,030
I think you two are very similar.

574
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,440
Yes.

575
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
We both live only for hate,

576
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,480
consumed by vengeance.

577
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,030
He is,

578
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,840
but I believe you are not.

579
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,030
Miss Duanwu,

580
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,510
what's wrong?

581
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,190
Why are you here?

582
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,880
Are your hands hurting again?

583
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,110
I heard...

584
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
you are leaving here soon.

585
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,800
Merchants are like that,

586
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,280
never staying in one place too long.

587
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,880
We're preparing to leave Shaozhou.

588
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,400
I know what you're worried about,

589
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,000
but the Master has arranged everything for you.

590
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,800
He's found a good family in Shaozhou for you.

591
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,280
You can stay there in peace.

592
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,280
Can I go with you?

593
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,550
I don't want to live with strangers.

594
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,710
But we're heading to the Western Regions.

595
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,960
I'm not afraid.

596
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,480
If my hands recover,

597
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,000
I can help you carve jade.

598
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,760
If they don't,

599
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,760
I can learn and do anything.

600
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,030
Esteemed stewards,

601
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,440
tonight's banquet

602
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,630
is to welcome Lady Shijiu.

603
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,030
This is her.

604
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,630
Cui Shijiu, the direct daughter of the Cui family head.

605
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,110
Greetings, everyone.

606
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,630
Honored stewards,

607
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,710
you've all worked alongside my father here in Wuling,

608
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,760
giving your all for the Cui family.

609
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,960
On behalf of my father, I thank each of you.

610
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,720
And of course,

611
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,360
my deepest gratitude goes to Master Eight.

612
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,710
He has fought alongside my father,

613
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,030
and is the elder I respect most.

614
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,440
This is fine wine I brought from Yangzhou.

615
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,030
A toast to all of you.

616
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,440
And a special toast to Master Eight.

617
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,030
I'll drink first to show my respect.

618
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:02,630
Honored stewards,

619
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,630
I toast you all.

620
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,230
To Master Eight!

621
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,280
Shijiu,

622
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,360
didn't you have a decree from the family head

623
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,480
to convey to the stewards?

624
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,370
Yes.

625
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,190
The Cui family head decrees...

626
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,460
[Cui]

627
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,000
Seeing the family head's token is as if seeing the family head!

628
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,250
Seeing the family head's token is as if seeing the family head!

629
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,150
The Cui family head decrees

630
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,440
I am to take over Wuling.

631
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,580
- Master Eight! - Master Eight!

632
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,220
Master Eight!

633
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,360
- Master Eight! - Master Eight!

634
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,230
Someone,

635
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:41,190
help him back to his room to rest!

636
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,400
Go call the doctor!

637
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,760
How did he collapse all of a sudden?

638
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,760
Indeed.

639
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,280
Be careful with him.

640
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,020
How did he suddenly collapse?

641
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,840
With Master Eight unwell,

642
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,150
it's fortunate the family head had foresight,

643
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,650
and arranged for me

644
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,190
to come here and manage the Wuling mines.

645
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,190
Take over the mines?

646
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,190
How can this be?

647
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,840
Hasn't Master Eight cut ties with Yangzhou?

648
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,630
But he just acknowledged the family head's token,

649
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,110
so perhaps he had this planned all along.

650
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:11,710
Indeed.

651
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,800
As you all saw just now,

652
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,000
even Master Eight respects the family head's token.

653
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,760
I hope each of you

654
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,960
understands the situation.

655
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,110
Otherwise,

656
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,360
the Wuling mines belong to the Cui family,

657
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,280
and the Cui family can reclaim them at any time.

658
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,880
The Cui family is willing to stand with you all,

659
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,880
but if anyone has other intentions,

660
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,840
hand over everything given by the Cui family

661
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,030
and just leave.

662
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,030
I, Cui Shijiu,

663
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,480
will not stand in your way.

664
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,030
What should we do?

665
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,510
Even Master Eight bowed to the family head's token.

666
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:48,840
The Cui family has already sent someone here.

667
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,710
We'll follow Master Shijiu's instructions!
