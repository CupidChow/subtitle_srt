That's why no one can match me.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,310
The gold bullion is fake!

52
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,470
Yeah. You asked me to melt them down.

53
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,960
Turns out, they're all fake.

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,030
You have to take me with you.

63
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,150
I've been loyal to you.

64
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,120

Leaving you now

67
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,400
would make me helpless.

68
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,590
Go quickly and come back!

69
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,190
Thank you, Steward.

70
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,120
Take you along?

71
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,870
No one will know if you kill and loot.

72
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,560
So it was truly that lowly slave,
Duanwu, who started the fire?

73
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,800
It certainly was.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,520
Useless fools!

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,120
It's our fault.

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,520
We failed.

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,400
Don't be angry, Master.

78
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,360
She's a mere pearl diver.

79
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,400

the pearl farm like this?

Everyone in Hepu knows him.

87
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,400
He can't escape.

88
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,710
Making such a mess
and still trying to run?

89
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,870
He can't get out of Hepu.

90
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,270
Search for him.

91
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,240
Alive or dead,

92
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
bring him to me!

93
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,510
Yes, sir!

94
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,310
Duanwu,

95
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,270
are you feeling any better?

96
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,240
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

97
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,600
You saved me again.

98
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,510
It was nothing.

99
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,630
What are you looking at?

100
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,310
It's so beautiful.

101
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,680
Yes.

102
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,630
On this trip to Hepu,

103
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,480
I've seen many grand sights,

104
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,310
things I'd never seen before.

105
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,160
The sunrise, the sunset...

106
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,160
But the most fascinating

107
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,830
was when I passed
by the pearl oyster sea.

108
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,310
There was a group of pearl divers

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,750
jumping in and out of the water.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,830
Mr. Zhang,

111
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,190
mermaids must dive deep
to retrieve pearls,

112
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,750
splitting shells to find them.

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,950
There's actually nothing on the surface,

114
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,390
and mermaids wouldn't waste energy
leaping out.

115
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,870
Then...

116
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,360
why are they doing it?

117
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,000
Mr. Zhang, you want to know?

118
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,120
Maybe they're avoiding
man-eating sharks,

119
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,040
or maybe...

120
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,430
they're fighting among themselves.

121
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,750
I see...

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
they're avoiding the sharks.

123
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,600
How could they still turn on each other?

124
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,120
Without pearls from your farm,

125
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
would they not survive?

126
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,870
People only see

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,600
the brilliance of mermaids' tears,

128
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,070
but they don't know how many pearl divers
lie buried beneath that glow.

129
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,390
Duanwu,

130
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,800
you must hate pearls, don't you?

131
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,390
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,390
There's no need to apologize.

133
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,270
None of this concerns you.

134
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,720
This night is too long.

135
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,390
The world has been turned upside down,

136
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,430
yet after waking from sleep,

137
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
everything remains the same.

138
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,950
How could it all stay the same?

139
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,480
After all,

140
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,800
you got the freedom you wanted,
didn't you?

141
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,240
In this fleeting life like grass,

142
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,720
everything will pass,

143
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,560
and everything will get better.

144
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
Cherish it while you have it,

145
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,600
and remember the beauty of what's lost.

146
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,830
That way, in our hearts,
maybe we can keep

147
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,720
a little something unique.

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,270
Then all of this...

149
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,160
can pass like that.

150
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,270
Mr. Zhang, you're a poet.

151
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,720
When you have a moment,

152
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,920
could you write a poem on pearl diving

153
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,950
and let the world know
the hardship of it?

154
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,720
Alright.

155
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,630
I'll put my all into it

156
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,830
and write a good poem.

157
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,560
Thank you for your help, Mr. Zhang.

158
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,310
I'll take my leave now.

159
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,870
If you haven't decided where to go,

160
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,000
why not stay with me for a while?

161
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,480
I still have unfinished business.

162
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,600
If I stayed with you,

163
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,720
it wouldn't be the freedom I seek.

164
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,960
True.

165
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,270
I hope your unfinished business

166
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,390
is just to be a little seller.

167
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,750
A little seller.

168
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,330
Shrimp!

169
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,970
Any news?

170
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,400
Duanwu, Cui Ding escaped!

171
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,970
Everyone's searching for him now.

172
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,880
He escaped?

173
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,400
Let's go.

174
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,970
Duanwu, where are we going?

175
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,400
Look!

176
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,920
Give it to me!

177
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,010
Hurry up!

178
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,560
Line up.

179
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,800
Don't rush. One at a time!

180
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:29,730
Watch your step!

181
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,520
Come on, up!

182
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,090
Head that way.

183
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,040
You go over there.

184
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:35,970
Let's go!

185
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,640
Now that Cui Ding has escaped,

186
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,680
Hepu is in chaos.

187
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,730
Although Cui Shijiu
is trying to control the situation,

188
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,730
she still couldn't suppress

189
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,010
The news about the burning
of the Pearl Tower.

190
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,250
What about the tribute pearls?

191
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,280
Cui Shijiu announced publicly

192
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,210
that the tribute pearls are intact.

193
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,280
That Cui Shijiu...

194
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,400
stays calm amid chaos.

195
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,010
She truly has some skill.

196
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,730
She's now ordered a full-scale hunt
for Cui Ding,

197
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,680
dead or alive.

198
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,400
Whether Cui Ding
set the Pearl Tower fire or not,

199
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,010
the Cui family must answer to the court.

200
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,520
Someone must bear the wrath

201
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,450
of the Emperor.

202
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,610
Master Kang, all the merchants on board

203
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,730
have been transferred
to other ships, only...

204
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,970
I haven't served the Cui family
all these years for nothing,

205
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,330
just missing that box of gold.

206
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,850
Yan Zijing,

207
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,040
don't let me see you again!

208
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,970
The Cui family...

209
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,400
you can all wait for death!

210
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,520
Steward Cui,

211
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,680
we meet again.

212
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,090
Yan Zijing!

213
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,490
As chief steward of the Cui family,

214
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,040
shouldn't you be staying put in Hepu?

215
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,040
Where are you going, huh?

216
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm handling some business
for my master.

217
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,400
The Pearl Tower was burned,

218
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,680
Peng Wu was killed,

219
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,490
but as chief steward of the pearl farm,

220
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,680
you sold the tribute pearls privately

221
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,680
and ran off with the money.

222
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,490
Yan Zijing,

223
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
you tricked me with fake gold bullion!

224
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,880
I was helping you, Cui Ding.

225
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,400
No...

226
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,520
I should call you... Yan Ding.

227
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,160
Who... who are you?

228
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm from the Yan family of Yangzhou.

229
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:38,720
[Yan]

230
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,050
[Yan]

231
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,520
So you're still alive!

232
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,370
I'll go have a look outside.

233
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,880
Duanwu, I'll go with you.

234
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,490
No.

235
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,280
No matter what happens out there,

236
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,040
stay here and wait for me.

237
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,610
If I don't return for a while,

238
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,640
take the first chance you get

239
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,400
and escape immediately.

240
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,850
Be careful, Duanwu.

241
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:27,640
Master Yan,

242
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,610
I was only following orders back then.

243
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,040
Spare me, please.

244
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,970
Killing my mother
was "following orders" too?

245
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,450
The Cui family forced me to do it!

246
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,610
All my family was in their hands!

247
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,800
You're still spouting nonsense.

248
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,760
Spare me, Master Yan!

249
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,210
I have proof of the Cui family's
illicit tribute pearl sales.

250
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,610
I'll give it all to you!

251
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,400
Now that the Pearl Tower is destroyed,

252
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,250
Cui Shijiu is busy
saving the tribute pearls.

253
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,800
If they can't deliver,

254
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,730
the entire Cui family
won't escape execution.

255
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,130
The Cui family is already beyond saving.

256
00:15:59,210 --> 00:15:59,850
Yan Ding,

257
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,090
you should worry more about yourself.

258
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,250
Yan Zijing,

259
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,330
so you planned all of this!

260
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,520
Today,

261
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,450
I'll use your life

262
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,610
to honor the fallen souls
of the Yan family.

263
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,730
Duanwu!

264
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,090
Return my blood-stained pearl,
and my mother's life!

265
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,520
Give it back!

266
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,210
Move aside! Give it to me!

267
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,610
Why do you say it's yours?

268
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,850
It was left to me by my mother.

269
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,560
Your mother?

270
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,040
Lady Eight of the pearl farm...

271
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,130
Lady Eight of the pearl farm
was my mother!

272
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,400
Give it to me!

273
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,970
Then have your mother come take it.

274
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,730
She's dead...

275
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,850
How can she take it if she's dead?

276
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
Give it to me!

277
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,320
Give it to me!

278
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,170
It's mine!

279
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,970
It's mine!

280
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,730
It's in my hands now,

281
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
so it's mine.

282
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,560
Still trying to run?

283
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,120
Your mother was always merciful...

284
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,320
Please, spare me for her sake!

285
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,930
How dare you mention my mother!

286
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,800
Mom...

287
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,320
Mom, don't go!

288
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,890
Open the door!

289
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,410
Mom...

290
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,490
Stay here.

291
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,040
Open the door!

292
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,040
Yan Ding, you betrayed the Yan family.
May you die a miserable death!

293
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,210
Let's go.

294
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,520
Yes, sir.

295
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,450
You're right.

296
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,730
My mother was always merciful.

297
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,410
Fine.

298
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,650
I won't kill you.

299
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,600
I'll let you go.

300
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,690
Thank you, Master Yan!

301
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,120
Thank you!

302
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,930
Master Yan,

303
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,650
would you lend me a small boat?

304
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,080
I said go, so go! Stop babbling.

305
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,690
What are you doing?

306
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,930
What are you doing?

307
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,040
This is the place you know best.

308
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,650
And it's filled with creatures
you know well.

309
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,490
Yan Zijing, I know another secret!

310
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,970
If you kill me now,

311
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,170
you'll regret it!

312
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,080
What secret?

313
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,490
Go on, let's hear it.

314
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,890
Your younger sister is still alive.

315
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,210
Where is she?

316
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,250
Let me go, and I'll tell you.

317
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,930
Steward Cui, you're so full of tricks.

318
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,450
Do you think
I'd believe anything you say?

319
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,560
Then you'll never know the truth.

320
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,490
Then I'll shatter your bones

321
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,410
piece by piece.

322
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,800
Let's see if your bones are stronger,

323
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,890
or your will.

324
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,360
Drag him away.

325
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,210
What's the punishment for theft
on a merchant ship?

326
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,410
Toss her overboard.

327
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,280
Is that girl, Duanwu, still alive?

328
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,080
Yes, she is.

329
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,450
But she's on the brink of death.

330
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,930
What's wrong?

331
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,320
Nothing, just curious.

332
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Let her go.

333
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,080
Shouldn't we punish her
for a full day and a night?

334
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,210
If she dies,

335
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,800
who'll help me uncover
the blood-stained pearl's secret?

336
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,120
If she dares speak rudely again,

337
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,250
tie her up.

338
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,930
Alright.

339
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,930
Who goes there?

340
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,600
Stop!

341
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,760
Grab her!

342
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,320
Stop!

343
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,840
Don't run!

344
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,170
Stop!

345
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:07,210
Don't run!

346
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,170
Grab her!

347
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,600
Don't run!

348
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,080
Stop!

349
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,730
Don't run!

350
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,930
Stop!

351
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,930
Grab her!

352
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,520
Stop!

353
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,490
Don't run!

354
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,730
Stop!

355
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Don't run!

356
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,520
Stop!

357
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,410
Stop!

358
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,080
Don't run!

359
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,280
Chase her!

360
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,930
Don't run! Stop!

361
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,410
Don't run!

362
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,040
Stop!

363
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,730
Where you'll run to!

364
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,490
Stop!

365
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,490
Quick!

366
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,800
It's mine...

367
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,840
It's my blood-stained pearl...

368
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,170
I avenged your mother's death,

369
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,210
and this is how you repay me?

370
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,840
I'm begging you...

371
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Give it back to me.

372
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,520
What did you say?

373
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,730
I'm begging you... give it back to me!

374
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,320
It's in my hands now,

375
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,690
so it's mine.

376
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,210
If you want it back,

377
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,120
then you'll have to earn it yourself.

378
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,040
Let her go.

379
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,170
Duanwu, you're back!

380
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,170
Duanwu...

381
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:20,650
what happened to you?

382
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,930
Duanwu...

383
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,490
The blood-stained pearl was taken.

384
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,320
Cui Ding was captured by Yan Zijing.

385
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,080
They look like enemies.

386
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,600
Yan Zijing probably won't
let Cui Ding go.

387
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,250
Who is Yan Zijing?

388
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,930
Yan Zijing is the owner of this ship.

389
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,800
He owns a ship this big...

390
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,560
He must be powerful.

391
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,080
Duanwu,

392
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,520
what should we do?

393
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,110
Are you cold?

394
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,490
Let's get out of here. Come on.

395
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,320
Duanwu...

396
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,200
How can I
get my blood-stained pearl back?

397
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,390
What, have you thought it over?

398
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,720
No stealing, no robbing.

399
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,720
That pearl is mine.

400
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,200
You're too weak right now.

401
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,390
That's why you can't protect
what you want.

402
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,350
No matter how angry or hateful you feel,

403
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,720
swallow it down.

404
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,720
Alright.

405
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,150
Alright.

406
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,000
Then tell me,

407
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,590
how can I get back what's mine?

408
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,550
First of all,

409
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,550
that pearl isn't yours.

410
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,000
It's in my hands now,

411
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,830
so it's mine.

412
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,830
Second, I'm a businessman.

413
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,760
I'll sell it for the right price.

414
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,590
Besides, this pearl is priceless.

415
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,590
An ordinary person could
work their entire life

416
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,630
and not earn a tenth of its worth.

417
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,350
I could redeem it.

418
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,550
With what?

419
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:08,870
I can work for you.

420
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,150
I'll keep your accounts,

421
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,630
or...

422
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,680
I can dive for pearls.

423
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,590
I'll do anything,

424
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,720
as long as you return
my blood-stained pearl.

425
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,200
Alright,

426
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,040
one million,

427
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,350
and you can redeem it.

428
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,720
Five hundred thousand.

429
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,830
Two million.

430
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,760
Then one million.

431
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,720
Three million!

432
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
Three million...

433
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
Three million, deal.

434
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,440
You have three months,

435
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,070
no extensions.

436
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,520
Wait...

437
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,590
Three million is no small amount.

438
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,720
Let me join your merchant team.

439
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll earn three million as fast as I can

440
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,390
and disappear from your sight.

441
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,350
You?

442
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,350
I don't keep idlers on my ship,

443
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,630
nor useless people.

444
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
Right now,

445
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,960
you're only fit to be a servant
in the lower deck.

446
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,830
When you manage
to climb up to the main deck,

447
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,350
then come talk to me.

448
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,760
How can I reach the main deck?

449
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,680
Figure it out yourself.

450
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:51,140
[Yan]

451
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,830
Careful.

452
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:01,590
Let's go.

453
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,790
Careful.

454
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,720
Hurry up.

455
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,480
These two beds are yours.

456
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,830
Remember,

457
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,200
the master likes cleanliness.

458
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,280
That's your servant uniform.

459
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,240
Wait.

460
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:20,480
Mister,

461
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,760
how can I get to the main deck?

462
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,870
I don't know.

463
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,830
But I can tell you this:

464
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,240
the master decides based on his mood.

465
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,230
Is there room for two beds?

466
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,000
Here's one.

467
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,440
And then...

468
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,230
This is...?

469
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:26,000
We can finally get a good night's sleep.

470
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,850
We've received news.

471
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,680
Ever since Cui Ding disappeared
from the pearl farm,

472
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,330
Zhang Jinran has set out for Guangzhou.

473
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,010
So giving him all those clues
wasn't for nothing.

474
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,330
In a few days,
we'll surely meet in Guangzhou.

475
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,970
By then, let's see how skilled

476
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,160
this young scholar really is.

477
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,410
And that girl?

478
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,850
Are you planning to keep her with you?

479
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,530
What do you mean by "keep her with me"?

480
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,080
Servants stay in the lower deck.

481
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,890
That little girl is quite interesting.

482
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,530
I rather like her.

483
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,850
You're taking this seriously?

484
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,600
Well, it makes sense...

485
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,890
You're of the age to marry, after all.

486
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,120
I get it.

487
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:18,850
No, it's not that.

488
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,600
You see, she usually argues with you,

489
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,330
even scolds you. It's quite amusing.

490
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,160
This ship is always so lifeless.

491
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,760
Sometimes being overly stubborn

492
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,080
isn't a good thing.

493
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,680
You want to help her?

494
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,760
Help her? Why?

495
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,490
In this world,

496
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:46,160
you have to rely on yourself to survive.

497
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,640
And that's what you call not helping?

498
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,930
Kang Ju...

499
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:01,160
well, have you checked
today's new goods?

500
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:03,850
Yes, I have.

501
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,640
If you're really that idle,

502
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,160
go check them ten more times.

503
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,680
Duanwu.

504
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,310
Both of you...

505
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:54,750
Shrimp.

506
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,080
You're new here, right?

507
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,000
Why didn't you go eat earlier?

508
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,040
We're bringing some food for you.

509
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,080
Here.

510
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,390
Duanwu, big bread!

511
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,350
Thanks.

512
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,480
And you are...?

513
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,270
This is Duanwu.

514
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,830
And I'm called Shrimp.

515
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,600
We're new here,

516
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,750
and don't know the rules.

517
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,680
Please look after us.

518
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,830
I'm Hu.

519
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
I'm Xiu.

520
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,160
I'm Loud.

521
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,710
What did you say?

522
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,870
I'm Loud.

523
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,910
He says his name is Loud.

524
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,480
With that tiny voice,
he calls himself "Loud"?

525
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,230
He was frightened as a child,

526
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,080
so his family gave him this name,

527
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,830
hoping he'd get better soon.

528
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,560
Don't worry. You'll be alright!

529
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,830
On a ship this big,

530
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,230
we're the only servants here?

531
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,680
We're just the servants
responsible for cleaning.

532
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,600
There are also boatmen,

533
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,790
washers, cooks...

534
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:01,710
all in different rooms.

535
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:02,600
There're plenty of people here.

536
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,270
Dear Hu,

537
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,830
Dear Xiu,

538
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,830
and Loud.

539
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,910
So, what do my younger partner and I

540
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,270
need to do?

541
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,710
Just stick with us

542
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,350
and keep this ship clean.

543
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:15,830
One thing to remember:

544
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,350
the master likes cleanliness.

545
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,790
At all times, in all places,

546
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:20,600
keep everything clean and tidy.

547
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,270
Does the master ever come down
to the lower deck?

548
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,560
No, he doesn't.

549
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,120
Then why do we clean so thoroughly?

550
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,310
It still has to be clean.

551
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,390
Hurry up and eat.

552
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:31,080
Eat quickly, then let's get to work.

553
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,040
Let's go.

554
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,680
Thank you.

555
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,560
Get a move on!

556
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,790
Shrimp,

557
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,230
there are too many eyes on this ship.

558
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,790
Go find out

559
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,680
what those three do exactly.

560
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,640
Who's on the lower deck, middle deck,

561
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,160
and main deck?

562
