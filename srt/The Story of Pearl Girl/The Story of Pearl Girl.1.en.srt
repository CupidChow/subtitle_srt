During the Tang Dynasty,

13
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,900
the Cui family of Yangzhou established
a pearl farm in Hepu,

14
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,750

However, due to the fierce waves,

17
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,470
the pearl divers seldom return alive.

18
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,340
The captors seize the divers,
ruthlessly forcing them

19
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,160

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,630
such a stubborn girl.

Why don't you sleep with her now?

68
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,790
She has to go
to the maternity shed someday.

Let me go home!

79
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
In the pearl farm,
there's only one way to survive:

80
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,550
you must collect pearls.

81
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,110
I can't do it. I'm dying.

If you don't train well now,

86
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,740
you won't survive in the sea.

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,700
No!

88
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,390

I suggest you

90
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,150
train as much as you can,

91
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,150
or your only option will be death.

92

I won't do it!

I want to go home! Let me go!

100

To survive here,

101
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,510
you must learn
to hold your breath underwater.

102
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,910
Go!

103
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,070

112

and swallow them.

How many does he want?

123
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,840
As many as possible.

To find large pearls over 15mm,

we need to seek out
giant Tridacna clams.

I heard that giant Tridacna clams
can crush a person to death!

No wonder we have to go
to Despairing Cove.

- I can't go.

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,270
I've brought you what you wanted.

192
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,030
Why do you need the arrowheads?

193
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,150
Did they bully you?

194
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,670
It's okay.

195
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,480
My third uncle was drunk.

196
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,960
Duanwu, don't worry.

197
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,480
I'm pretty tough.

198
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,790
Take it to eat.

199
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,270
Thank you.

200
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,670
Duanwu.

201
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Take care.

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,990
I'm not sure when we'll meet again.

203
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,750
My third uncle will take me away
from the pearl farm.

204
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,970
Step aside.

205
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,840
Move!

206
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,320
Hurry!

207
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,960
Go!

208
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,240
Go.

209
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,940
Duanwu.

210
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,030
You want to earn
the Manumission Document?

211
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,190
But Despairing Cove
is a dangerous place.

212
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,550
And giant Tridacna clams
primarily reside on the ocean floor.

213
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,460
It's full of undercurrents.

214
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,510
You may not survive

215
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,790
if you dive there.

216
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,860
Don't worry.

217
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,790
I know what to do.

218
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,630
Duanwu.

219
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,430
If...

220
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,100
If you leave,

221
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,860
how will I manage to live here alone?

222
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,510
If I can get the Tridacna pearl,

223
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,100
I will try

224
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,460
to take you away from here.

225
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,300
800 thousand maces.

226
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,170
Thank you.

227
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,090
Mister,

228
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,790
This golden hairpin

229
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,030
is adorned with dozens
of Hepu South Sea pearls,

230
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,140
each perfectly round.

231
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,550
The rubies are equally vibrant in color.

232
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:37,900
The quotation is 500,000 maces;
please accept this.

233
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,790
How dare you present such a thing?

234
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,270
Get lost.

235
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,790
Our things

236
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,030
are much better than these.

237
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,030
Please be patient.

238
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,510
Mister, please check my bracelet.

239
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,820
This bracelet is crafted
from three strands of Hetian jade,

240
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,420
featuring a delicate texture

241
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,900
and a lustrous sheen.

242
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:03,420
My quotation is 800,000 maces.

243
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,140
It's valued at over 800,000.

244
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,380
Accountant Wei,

245
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,310
two million maces.

246
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,660
This Western Region merchant
is quite wealthy!

247
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,790
It's like throwing money around!

248
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,860
Why didn't I bring
some goods to sell as well?

249
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,230
In our Western Regions,

250
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,550
selling counterfeit goods means

251
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,620
losing your tongue and hands.

252
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,420
No!

253
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,820
Losing his tongue and hands?

254
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,180
Wait!

255
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,550
According to the laws
of the Tang Dynasty,

256
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,180
selling counterfeit goods
only results in 80 lashes.

257
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,820
How can you be so cruel?

258
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,270
Who are you?

259
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,510
I'm just a wandering scholar.

260
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,660
As merchants, we have our rules.

261
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,310
Based on your rules,

262
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,100
how can I save him?

263
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,660
As merchants,
our only concern is business.

264
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,420
Master is here.

265
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,750
Master.

266
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,270
It's all about the money.

267
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,310
Master.

268
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,180
Wait, we are going to Despairing Cove.

269
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,550
Take more

270
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,420
to dive deeper.

271
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,140
Easy.

272
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,620
Take more.

273
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,310
Put it down.

274
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,660
You also want to go to Despairing Cove?

275
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,100
Don't you know your capability?

276
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,270
I told you to put it down!

277
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,950
Do you want to die
before you earn enough for the pearl farm?

278
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,860
The pearl farm has always
traded lives for pearls.

279
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,820
Stop being hypocritical.

280
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,790
How dare you talk back?

281
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,030
Drag her away!

282
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,420
Stop!

283
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,580
Release her!

284
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,990
Steward Cui...

285
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,750
Steward Cui...

286
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,180
Steward Cui issued the order!

287
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,900
Steward Cui ordered us
to go to Despairing Cove.

288
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,790
Who dares to disobey him?

289
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,270
Mr. Peng.

290
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,550
Master Yan.

291
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Since this gentleman wants
to be accommodating,

292
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,870
please tell me your offer.

293
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,260
I have a priceless pearl

294
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,910
that has been treasured
for three generations.

295
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,980
Three generations?

296
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,020
I wonder if it's worth his life.

297
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,360
Do they know each other?

298
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,390
Such a precious pearl!

299
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,260
A pearl that has been treasured
for three generations?

300
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,630
Are you kidding me?

301
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,540
The pearls come
from the rivers and seas,

302
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,630
hidden within oysters.

303
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,700
My pearl was obtained from the deep sea.

304
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,020
So it's extremely precious.

305
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,630
It's quite different
from the ordinary pearls.

306
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,700
It's lustrous and smooth.

307
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,780
My grandpa treasures it highly.

308
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,260
This box is pretty delicate.

309
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,830
I'd like to offer 500,000 maces
for the box.

310
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,430
But you may keep the pearl.

311
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,780
It's a pearl.

312
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,830
So what?

313
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,590
As a jeweler, you don't
recognize its true worth!

314
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,220
Though it's better than ordinary pearls,

315
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,870
basically speaking,

316
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,430
it's still an inferior pearl.

317
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:57,830
So, it's not valuable at all.

318
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,150
Don't try to deceive me.

319
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,590
I've seen pearls of good quality.

320
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,190
Besides the emperor's pearls
in Chang'an,

321
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,150
mine is the finest available

322
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,190
in the market.

323
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,780
How about this?

324
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,630
Are you willing to make a bet with me?

325
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,150
I'll show you a place.

326
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,430
If the pearls there
are inferior to this one,

327
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,430
I will pay five million maces for it.

328
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,910
Besides,

329
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,220
I will spare his life.

330
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,110
Master,

331
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,460
please spare me.

332
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,780
Otherwise, you'll have to
give it to me for free.

333
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,830
A real man never

334
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,070
goes back on his words.

335
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,460
Sure.

336
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,980
What? Mr. Peng is unhappy with it?

337
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,740
Not at all.

338
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,910
Master Yan is a distinguished guest
of the pearl farm.

339
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,590
Five million is not a small amount.

340
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,590
Duanwu.

341
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,910
Do take care.

342
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,110
I will, you too.

343
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,150
Take care!

344
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,740
Despairing Cove is just ahead!

345
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,110
Are you okay?

346
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,630
Duanwu, it's too dangerous here.

347
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,220
What if I can't return alive?

348
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,590
Duanwu.

349
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,260
What to do?

350
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,110
Stay here and wait for me.

351
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,020
Wait for me.

352
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,190
Give me your sandbag, hurry.

353
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,300
Be careful!

354
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,110
I'll be waiting for you, Duanwu!

355
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,830
Why did they venture into the deep sea?

356
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,870
They're diving to collect pearls.

357
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,740
Wide seas where fish and dragons cross.

358
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,830
High skies echo with the cries of gulls.

359
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,870
Amidst the shimmering waves,

360
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,910
the merman holds pearls in his palm.

361
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,110
Wonderful poem!

362
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,110
I'd like to show you

363
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,670
something interesting.

364
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,980
Bring me some fish blood.

365
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,940
Yes.

366
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,980
Watch carefully.

367
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,740
What's this for?

368
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,260
Sharks love blood.

369
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,830
How could you do that?

370
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,190
Since they are diving into the deep sea,

371
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,940
they are risking their lives.

372
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,630
Just for collecting the pearls?

373
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,350
Of course.

374
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,020
Pearls are valuable indeed.

375
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,070
But how can they be worth a human life?

376
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,980
If you can't accept this,

377
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,910
I suggest you go home early

378
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,020
to enjoy your calm life.

379
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,500
Where is Duanwu?

380
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,590
Where is Duanwu?

381
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,910
Duanwu!

382
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,740
Sharks are nearby. Let's go now!

383
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,630
Why hasn't Duanwu come back?

384
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,780
Duanwu!

385
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,460
If you keep shouting,

386
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
I will toss you into the sea
to feed the sharks.

387
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,620
Let's go.

388
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,750
Duanwu is alive! She's still alive!

389
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,070
Hurry, pick her up!

390
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,580
Hurry!

391
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,140
One superior pearl.

392
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,750
Four small pearls.

393
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,860
Three superior pearls.

394
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,030
Good-for-nothing! Drag him away.

395
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,990
One large pearl at 15mm.

396
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,660
It's collected by Duanwu.

397
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,470
There is one even bigger!

398
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,990
Look, this one is the largest.

399
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,030
This is collected by Gou.

400
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,750
This is the largest pearl at over 15mm.

401
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,750
Thank you!

402
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,660
Please grant me
the Manumission Document.

403
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,340
Okay.

404
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,420
Thank you!

405
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,990
I collected the largest pearl!

406
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,100
Did you make a mistake?

407
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,310
Nonsense!

408
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,100
How could I make a mistake?

409
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,140
No way!

410
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,100
This was collected by me!

411
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,820
I collected it!

412
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,380
Go away!

413
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,140
Lady Eight!

414
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,990
Go away!

415
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,900
Or I will lash you to death.

416
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,750
You changed it.

417
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Steward Cui.

418
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,140
Go away!

419
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,050
- Drag her away!
- I collected this.

420
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,100
Steward Cui!

421
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,750
Lady Eight!

422
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:23,750
Go away!

423
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,230
Drag her away!

424
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,340
I collected it!

425
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,310
I collected it!

426
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,510
I collected it!

427
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,380
Steward Cui!

428
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,310
Steward Cui.

429
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,950
After all, she collected
one large pearl at 15mm.

430
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,470
How about letting Duanwu

431
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,620
be a pearl hostess at the pearl auction?

432
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,100
She has a pretty face.

433
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,470
Let her be a pearl hostess then.

434
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,140
Thank you.

435
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,270
You are lucky to come back alive.

436
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,710
Have the medicine.

437
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,750
I don't understand.

438
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,900
Why did you do that?

439
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,660
No reason.

440
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,100
Do you think you can
really escape from here?

441
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,750
There is only one way
to get rid of the pearl farm:

442
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,230
death.

443
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,140
Being a pearl hostess

444
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,420
is your only option.

445
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,070
Let Lala be the pearl hostess too.

446
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,230
Check the account books.

447
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,270
What do you think of the scenery?

448
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,750
Compared to the Western Regions,

449
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,180
it's not very satisfying.

450
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,550
It's been a while.

451
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,580
Mr. Peng is doing well.

452
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,100
Thank you.

453
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,310
Since we are following the right master,

454
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,950
I believe your pearl farm

455
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,580
will surely thrive.

456
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,580
Yeah.

457
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,710
And this is...

458
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,470
This is the distinguished guest

459
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,620
from the State of Kang,
here to purchase the 15mm large pearls.

460
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,580
Nice to meet you.

461
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,350
Nice to meet you.

462
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,180
I'm Cui Ding.

463
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,180
May I have your name?

464
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,030
I'm surnamed

465
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,990
Yan.

466
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,950
You look quite familiar to me.

467
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,990
Unfortunately, I don't remember
if we've met before.

468
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:31,910
You have no idea.

469
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,660
The previous master of this pearl farm

470
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:36,390
is also a Yan.

471
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:40,700
Maybe you are distant relatives?

472
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,030
Mind your words.

473
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,040
I heard that the Yan family
was executed in full.

474
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,350
Are you living in the Western Region?

475
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,780
His foundation
is in the Western Regions,

476
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,990
but he also conducts business
in Quanzhou and Yangzhou.

477
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,430
Just do business.

478
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,140
I pay for the goods and I will leave.

479
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,780
Is it really necessary
to ask so many questions?

480
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,470
Sorry.

481
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,700
I will show you the best pearls.

482
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,030
I want the large pearls at 15mm.

483
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:12,620
I have all kinds of pearls.

484
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,580
But I heard

485
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,870
a batch of Persian pearls
was brought in from Persia recently,

486
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:17,870
and they are also quite good.

487
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,740
It seems that South Sea pearls

488
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,100
are devalued.

489
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,430
Hepu South Sea pearls

490
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,740
have been designated as royal tributes
for three consecutive years.

491
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,990
How can Persian pearls
be compared to them?

492
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,550
Please.

493
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,390
- Please. - Please.

494
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:40,940
[Pearl Tower]

495
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,030
Can I make it?

496
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,430
I'm also worried about it.

497
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:01,070
How can you sell the pearls
with your long faces?

498
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,740
I'm telling you,

499
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,990
all the guests here are distinguished!

500
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,900
If any of them are fond of you,

501
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,740
you'll have a wealthy life.

502
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,150
Understood?

503
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,220
Yes.

504
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,670
Duanwu, what are you doing?

505
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,420
Come on!

506
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,070
My brother thinks
the Hepu tribute pearls are fishy.

507
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,820
That's why he sent me here
to investigate it.

508
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,700
This is the best chance.

509
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,470
So lively.

510
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,550
No matter why Master Yan

511
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,150
took us here,

512
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,300
let's just observe the situation.

513
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,700
The Cui family's South Sea Pearls
have been tribute pearls for three years,

514
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,780
gaining great fame.

515
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:25,470
It's reasonable that they are wealthy.

516
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,030
Indeed.

517
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,340
They have a thriving business,

518
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,300
but the amount
of tribute pearls is decreasing.

519
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,070
That's unreasonable.

520
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,110
Are you saying that the Cui family
is selling tribute pearls privately?

521
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,780
Or what?

522
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,510
They make the auction so mysterious.

523
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:42,990
Let's go have a look.

524
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,550
She looks nice.

525
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,300
Buzzkill!

526
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,590
Let's go.

527
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,380
Thank you.

528
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,110
Not a big deal.

529
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,420
Duanwu, come on!

530
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,150
Steward.

531
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,050
For this auction,

532
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,460
all the pearls
have already been allocated.

533
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,260
Only this most precious
giant pearl remains.

534
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,950
Who do you think should be
the final pearl hostess?

535
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,630
When choosing a pearl hostess,
it's not about looks or figures.

536
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,630
It's about their sales skills.

537
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,380
Who wants to be the final pearl hostess?

538
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:45,810
Me!

539
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,400
Let me.

540
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,220
Me!

541
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,110
The price of this pearl
is five million maces.

542
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,080
Who can sell it?

543
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,640
Well...

544
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,120
Five million...

545
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,550
Steward Cui, I'd like to have a try.

546
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,780
All of them dare not to do it.

547
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,030
Why do you think you can make it?

548
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,990
This giant Tridacna pearl

549
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,070
was collected by me in person.

550
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,780
I want it to showcase its true value.

551
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,740
Do you know

552
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,220
what the highest price for pearls
has been in recent years?

553
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:17,950
Yes,

554
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,390
four million maces.

555
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,260
But since Steward Cui

556
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,550
said it's worth five million maces,

557
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,070
that's its true value.

558
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,430
What a silver tongue!

559
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,990
Want to be rewarded again?

560
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,100
Steward Cui,

561
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,620
if I can sell it for five million maces,

562
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,780
I only want two Manumission Documents.

563
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,830
One for me,

564
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,470
the other for Lala.

565
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,030
What a clever girl!

566
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,660
You are so clever

567
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,070
that I almost forgot
that you were a pearl diver.

568
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,580
Seven million maces.

569
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,990
You will have the Manumission Documents.

570
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
Sell it for seven million,
and you're free.

571
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,140
If you fail, you will die.

572
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,260
Still confident?

573
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,470
Steward Cui.

574
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,030
Steward...

575
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,700
So eager to show off?

576
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:09,390
Duanwu.

577
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,390
Does she think some wealthy guest
will be fond of her?

578
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,700
Who will pay so much for her?

579
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,390
Duanwu.

580
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,260
Seven million!

581
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,260
Who can pay seven million maces?

582
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,550
Seven million?

583
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,830
Isn't it easy
to buy her freedom as well?

584
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,300
This pearl is so pretty.

585
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,220
Indeed.

586
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,300
I think mine is also beautiful.

587
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,620
Look at her dazed face.

588
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,550
I wonder how she will sell it later.

589
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,620
Seven million? She won't make it.

590
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Yes.

591
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,620
I wonder

592
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,510
how she will sell it.

593
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,910
She's not capable at all.

594
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,620
She knows some tricks only.

595
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,550
Later,

596
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,100
let's dance well.

597
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,880
Of course.

598
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,780
Rest assured.

599
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,030
Here comes the next batch

600
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,100
of pearl hostesses.

601
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,440
That pearl.

602
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,110
That one.

603
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,530
That one.

604
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,690
I like that one.
