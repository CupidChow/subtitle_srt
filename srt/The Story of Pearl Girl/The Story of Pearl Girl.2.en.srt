[Episode 2]

12
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,890
Not bad at all.

13
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,840
In the rising tower,
jade pendants sway in the breeze,

14
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,470
while pearls glisten

15
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,700
under the stars.

16
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,100
Wonderful!

17
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
Bravo!

18
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,990
Presenting today's highlight:

19
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,660
a blood-stained Tridacna pearl.

20
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,190
It wards off all evil

21
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,340
and weighs five maces.

22
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,590
Its starting bid is three million maces.

23
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,500
Tridacna pearls are precious.

24
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
What does she mean by "blood-stained"?

25
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,190
This pearl hostess

26
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,430
speaks not a word of truth.

27
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,430
Pearl hunting is tough,

28
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,870
and so is selling them.

29
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,940
Mr. Zhang, you're truly a kind soul.

30
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,750
Mr. Peng, with your confidence
and grandeur,

31
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,030
this treasure should go to you.

32
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,780
Mr. Peng, are you interested in bidding?

33
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,030
A blood-stained Tridacna pearl
is indeed rare.

34
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,340
I'll offer two million maces.

35
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,310
The starting bid is three million maces.

36
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,660
Surely you jest, Mr. Peng.

37
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,910
Steward Cui,

38
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,270
what Mr. Peng means

39
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,220
is that this pearl is flawless,

40
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,060
and he's willing to raise the bid
by two million.

41
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,380
Isn't that right, Mr. Peng?

42
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,620
I see.

43
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,100
Thank you, Mr. Peng.

44
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Thank you, Master Yan.

45
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,540
However, this pearl isn't flawless.

46
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,660
Are you talking down your own item?

47
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,270
It has an extraordinary flaw,

48
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,430
the blood from a living person.

49
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,820
I obtained this pearl myself,

50
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,750
and the wound from gathering it
won't heal.

51
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,070
As I said,

52
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,710
a Tridacna pearl, tainted with blood,

53
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,630
wards off all evil.

54
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,100
That's what makes
this pearl so precious.

55
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,910
Tridacna pearls are rare for sure,

56
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,710
but can they really ward off evil
after being tainted with blood?

57
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,540
Exactly.

58
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,150
It sounds made up.

59
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,070
I've brought you here

60
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,710
to see this pearl auction as promised.

61
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,100
Now, about our wager...

62
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,950
I was indeed overconfident.

63
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,950
Mr. Zhang, you're truly
a man of your word.

64
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,220
I'm not really keen on this pearl,

65
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,340
but this box

66
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,390
isn't something ordinary folks own.

67
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,150
Thanks a lot.

68
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,540
Since you're so gracious,

69
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,740
in return,

70
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,710
I'll help you lend a hand
to that pearl hostess.

71
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,180
The Tridacna pearl is one
of the seven treasures of Buddhism.

72
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,660
An ordinary Tridacna pearl is ominous.

73
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,270
Gathering it brings misfortune.

74
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,340
But if it bears human blood,

75
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,540
it gains the power to ward off evil

76
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,070
and can truly be called
a talisman pearl.

77
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,860
I am willing to bid

78
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,890
six million maces.

79
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,420
Six million maces?

80
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,830
However rare it is,
it can't be worth that much.

81
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,660
Exactly.

82
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,180
No one's ever bid this high before.

83
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,980
What,

84
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,340
can it really ward off evil?

85
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,350
Can it really repel all harm?

86
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,310
- Can it?
- Really?

87
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,990
Even if it could,
it's still not worth six million maces.

88
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,710
Take the offer while you can.

89
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,470
Thank you for your kindness, sir.

90
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,180
But I'm wagering my life here,

91
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,590
not just a pearl.

92
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,710
Only six million maces?

93
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,030
Master Yan, such a price hardly honors

94
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,180
this one-of-a-kind treasure,

95
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,300
the Mermaid's Tear.

96
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,470
Steward Cui,

97
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,660
this pearl hostess of yours
is full of lies.

98
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,150
One moment it's a talisman pearl,

99
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,910
and now it becomes the Mermaid's Tear?

100
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,660
In "In Search of the Supernatural,"

101
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,980
it's said there are merfolk
beyond the South Sea,

102
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,860
living like fish in the water

103
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,030
and weaving tirelessly.

104
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,780
When they cry,

105
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,710
their tears become pearls.

106
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,100
Everyone,

107
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,420
Master Yan is an esteemed guest
from the State of Kang.

108
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,630
Since he has bid six million maces,

109
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,590
this pearl should go

110
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:31,830
to Yan...

111
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,780
Steward Cui!

112
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,340
When the mermaid cries,
her tears turn into pearls.

113
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,030
A Mermaid's Tear is worth a life.

114
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,470
Mr. Zhang,

115
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,590
I ask you to appraise it.

116
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,590
Sell it for seven million,
and you're free.

117
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,740
If you fail, you will die.

118
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,980
If this pearl is so precious,

119
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,790
then I bid

120
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,950
seven million maces.

121
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,980
Seven million?

122
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,610
Even if it wards off all evil,
that's too high!

123
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,510
Mr. Zhang,

124
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,710
seven million maces is no small sum.

125
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,630
Thank you, sir!

126
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,830
This pearl, bid at seven million
by Mr. Zhang,

127
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,150
now belongs to him!

128
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,580
This gold willow leaf isn't something
an ordinary person can possess.

129
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,300
It seems I was presumptuous.

130
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,870
Steward Cui,

131
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:27,870
I hope

132
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,390
you'll keep your word.

133
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,300
Revealing his identity so easily,

134
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,060
he's unfit for bigger responsibilities.

135
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,630
It's precisely his sincerity
and kindness

136
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,780
that makes him

137
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,580
trustworthy for this task.

138
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,750
Shall we continue
with the original plan, then?

139
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,150
Yes.

140
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,540
By the way,

141
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,540
just now, I saw a woman

142
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,460
with a scar on her face.

143
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,270
Find her for me.

144
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,110
An old acquaintance?

145
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,660
Yes.

146
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,780
Mr. Zhang.

147
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,420
Greetings, sir.
I'm Duanwu, a pearl diver.

148
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,460
Thank you, sir.

149
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,230
Duanwu?

150
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,270
As in early midsummer.

151
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,940
It's a fine name.

152
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,940
In early midsummer,

153
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,390
the Seven Mansions of the Azure Dragon
rise to the southern sky

154
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,700
reaching the centermost position.

155
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,630
I didn't know that.

156
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:35,230
Mr. Zhang, I came here

157
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,630
to thank you

158
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,060
and express my gratitude.

159
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,630
Your kindness means the world to me.

160
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,150
It was just a small gesture.

161
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,990
To you, sir,

162
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,540
it may have been,

163
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,270
but to me,

164
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,510
it's of great significance.

165
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,230
Please don't misunderstand me.

166
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,940
I only want to say

167
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,870
that if you ever need my help,

168
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,390
I'll be there,

169
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,420
no matter what it takes.

170
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,060
Then I'll look forward
to your assistance someday.

171
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,540
Until we meet again.

172
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,510
Until we meet again.

173
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,540
By the way,

174
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,510
this is actually my first time here.

175
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,420
Would you mind showing me around Hepu?

176
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,060
If it's an inconvenience, never mind.

177
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,150
That's not what I mean.

178
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,990
But to be honest, Mr. Zhang,

179
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,420
I've never been to Hepu myself.

180
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,060
As a pearl diver, I wasn't allowed
to leave the pearl farm.

181
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,060
You've never left the pearl farm?

182
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,870
Well, in that case,

183
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,270
why don't you
show me around the pearl farm instead?

184
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,700
Already getting cozy, those two.

185
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,350
Are you happy about winning the bet?

186
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,910
Of course.

187
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,270
Now I can finally leave the pearl farm.

188
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,580
So, what are your plans for the future?

189
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,420
I plan to take a close friend with me,
leave Hepu,

190
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,870
and sell goods while traveling.

191
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,540
Just a small-time peddler?

192
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,420
No, a free and unrestrained

193
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,870
grand merchant.

194
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,270
Will Steward Cui give you a hard time?

195
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,420
I'll be careful.

196
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,820
By the way, Mr. Zhang,

197
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,940
where are you from?

198
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,540
Me?

199
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,870
Chang'an.

200
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,750
The faraway Chang'an?

201
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,060
Three thousand li

202
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,910
from here.

203
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,750
What's it like in Chang'an?

204
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,060
You've asked the right person.

205
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,110
In Banzheng Ward,

206
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,150
shops are filled
with countless books and ancient texts.

207
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,540
And in Fuxing Ward,

208
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,350
you'll find the best-baked flatbread.

209
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,300
Baked flatbread?

210
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,780
If you ever go to Chang'an,

211
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,780
you must try
the water basin mutton there.

212
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,300
In the West Market, you'll see Hu people

213
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,300
with high noses and deep-set eyes,

214
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,420
and Hu women are all skilled
at singing and dancing.

215
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,780
Oh,

216
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,630
there's also this local custom.

217
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,810
We write our wishes on a wooden plaque

218
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,510
and hang it on a blessing tree.
This way, the wishes will come true.

219
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,420
What does a blessing tree look like?

220
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,990
Unfortunately, there isn't one here.

221
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,630
Of course not.

222
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,990
No worries.

223
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,030
Sincerity is all that matters.

224
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,700
How about

225
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,910
we use this tree right here?

226
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,910
Come on. What's your wish?

227
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,510
Freedom.

228
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,750
I want freedom.

229
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,820
Alright.

230
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:05,630
"Freedom."

231
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,060
Is that all?

232
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,030
Make your wish first.

233
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,660
Then I'll put
the plaque up there for you.

234
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,940
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

235
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,940
[Freedom]

236
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,270
May your heart stay
as clear as a mirror,

237
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,420
and may all your wishes come true.

238
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,540
Steward Cui.

239
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Master Yan?

240
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,630
What brings you here so late at night?

241
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,420
I'm here for my 15-millimeter pearls,
of course.

242
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,870
You may go.

243
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,630
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,270
The goods are ready.

245
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,660
But didn't we agree
to complete the deal tomorrow?

246
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,300
I need to leave tonight.

247
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,820
So,

248
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,820
let's settle it now.

249
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,510
Why the sudden rush?

250
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,820
Steward Cui, don't play dumb.

251
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,460
Gold willow leaves aren't something
ordinary folks can possess.

252
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,580
You should know that.

253
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,060
Otherwise, you wouldn't

254
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,390
still be here at this hour,
waiting for news.

255
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,540
I can also tell you

256
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,630
that Prince Ying's sworn brother left
the capital and headed south recently.

257
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,810
Although he's just
a scholar at Xiuwen Pavilion,

258
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,910
it's said he's highly trusted
by both Prince Ying

259
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,180
and the Emperor.

260
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,270
What's more,

261
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,470
his surname is Zhang.

262
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,910
Is he the man from today's...?

263
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,300
I didn't say anything.

264
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,300
I'm just a businessman.

265
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,270
To me, what matters most
are money and safety.

266
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,910
But you brought him here.

267
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,270
What are you talking about?

268
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,660
Mr. Peng was on that ship too.

269
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,300
I only found out
about this myself recently.

270
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,700
I've also heard

271
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,630
that Prince Ying

272
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:32,300
and Prince Tan
are in fierce conflict these days.

273
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,510
Your family has always
served Prince Tan, hasn't it?

274
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,780
Besides the 15-millimeter pearls,
I'll also take

275
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,940
all the remaining pearls

276
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,270
from the pearl auction.

277
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,630
You think you can buy

278
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,110
all the pearls in the Pearl Tower
with just this bit of gold?

279
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,420
Steward Cui,

280
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,820
who else but I

281
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,580
would dare buy your pearls now?

282
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,780
The quantity of the tribute pearls
has already been submitted.

283
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,990
Yet Cui's Pearl Farm still has
this much stock.

284
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,780
Does that seem reasonable?

285
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,300
Besides,

286
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,390
selling tribute pearls privately

287
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,390
is a capital offense.

288
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Moreover,

289
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,460
I know more about what's happening
in Chang'an than you do.

290
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:41,590
Recently, many unfamiliar faces
have shown up in Hepu.

291
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,420
You know that, right?

292
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,460
As for their identities,

293
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,790
they're easy to find out.

294
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,310
If Prince Ying is really
looking into this,

295
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,350
I'm not sure if Prince Tan
will be implicated,

296
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,260
but the Cui family will probably
end up as the scapegoat.

297
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,830
Come with me to get the goods.

298
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,980
You actually sold the pearls
at such a low price?

299
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,740
How dare you!

300
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,020
Mr. Peng, given the current situation,

301
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,390
it's wise to trade pearls for gold.

302
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,870
I know

303
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,630
the profits from the pearl auction
are meant for Prince Tan's big plans,

304
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,910
but safety comes first.

305
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,220
We control the entire sea around Hepu,

306
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,660
and we'll have pearl divers

307
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,150
for generations to come.

308
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,460
We can collect

309
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,460
as many pearls as we want in the future.

310
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,500
Mr. Peng,

311
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,550
you're an invaluable aide to Prince Tan.

312
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,220
Caution is what keeps us thriving.

313
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,940
It's an honor for my family

314
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,740
to have Prince Tan's trust.

315
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,020
As long as the court doesn't question
the quantity of the tribute pearls,

316
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,870
we'll still be able to make a fortune.

317
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,980
Please don't be upset, Mr. Peng.

318
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,980
Shall I send over
that pearl hostess from the auction?

319
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,070
I'll make the arrangements.

320
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,310
Have Lady Eight dress up Duanwu

321
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,110
and bring her here.

322
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
But that Mr. Zhang said...

323
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,110
I agreed to let her go,

324
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,150
but what Mr. Peng does
is out of my hands.

325
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,830
By the way, tell her

326
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,150
Mr. Zhang is here waiting for her.

327
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,980
Duanwu!

328
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,740
Listen,

329
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,180
I got the Manumission Documents.

330
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,310
We'll leave in two...

331
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,830
No, tomorrow.

332
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,110
We'll leave tomorrow.

333
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,350
Alright.

334
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,110
Duanwu.

335
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,660
Come with me.

336
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,870
I promise I'll get you out of here.

337
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,630
What's this about?

338
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,830
Mr. Zhang and his people
are leaving tomorrow.

339
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,350
He said he needed to talk to you.

340
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,980
I've seen Mr. Zhang.

341
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,150
He didn't mention anything about this.

342
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,460
Don't ask questions when you shouldn't!

343
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,250
You must always be fully prepared.

344
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,500
Some things can be useful

345
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,790
when the time is right.

346
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,590
That Mr. Zhang
is obviously a well-read man.

347
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,460
He's gentle, polite,

348
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,420
and poised.

349
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,680
You'd better

350
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,530
keep your temper in check
in front of him.

351
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,870
Don't offend this important guest.

352
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,350
Understood.

353
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,110
Go on.

354
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,460
Go up there on your own.

355
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,420
Lala,

356
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,150
serve me well,

357
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,700
and there'll be
plenty of rewards for you.

358
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,180
Lala!

359
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,630
You're finally here.

360
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,630
Duan... Duanwu.

361
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,290
- Duanwu, don't blame me!
- Let's go.

362
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,110
- Let's go!
- I didn't want this to happen!

363
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,740
Come with me!

364
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,980
The man who got
the Manumission Document is dead.

365
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,700
There's no way out for us.

366
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,390
Come with me.

367
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,220
Lala,

368
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,660
convince her to join us,

369
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:00,070
and I'll take both of you to Chang'an.

370
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,350
Let's go!

371
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,980
Little pearl hostess,
you do have some charm.

372
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,740
Serve me, and you'll have a good life.

373
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,940
Come on. Stop resisting.

374
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,110
You cheap slave!

375
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,220
How dare you, a harlot,

376
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,390
hit me?

377
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,590
Die!

378
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,910
Quick, kill this insolent slave!

379
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,660
You wretch, how dare you
offend Mr. Peng!

380
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,590
Someone's killed!

381
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,700
Someone's killed!

382
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,700
Hurry. Come with me.

383
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,070
Come on. Let's go!

384
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,590
Let's go, now!

385
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,940
Help!

386
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,390
Someone's dead!

387
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,460
Hurry.

388
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,870
What happened? Why the panic?

389
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:38,590
Sir, Peng... Peng Wu is dead.

390
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,350
What?

391
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,180
Duanwu killed him.

392
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,350
Lady Eight is helping her escape!

393
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,150
Go after them!

394
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:42,740
Yes, sir!

395
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,350
Hold on.

396
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,500
Kill them on sight.

397
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,790
Understood.

398
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,660
I'm coming with you.

399
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,550
Let's go that way!

400
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,220
Don't let them get away!

401
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,700
Hurry.

402
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,420
Get over here!

403
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,940
There's movement here!

404
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,910
Duanwu!

405
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,870
No one's here.

406
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,830
Let's check over there.

407
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,460
Come on.

408
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,700
Everything is set.

409
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,070
They're waiting for your command.

410
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,310
Have you found her?

411
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,350
Yes.

412
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,150
She's a Accountant on the farm

413
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,070
and also keeps the books.

414
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,740
Her name is Lady Eight.

415
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,940
Bring back a ledger,

416
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,790
and bring her back too.

417
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,940
Father!

418
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,700
Father!

419
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,530
[Pearl Tower]

420
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,980
Fire!

421
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,270
Come put out the fire!

422
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,660
Come on. This way.

423
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,700
Come put out the fire!

424
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,510
Hurry and put out the fire!

425
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,380
Over here!

426
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,310
Let's go that way!

427
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,700
Stop right there!

428
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,310
Stop running!

429
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,660
Hurry.

430
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:23,030
I didn't kill him.

431
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,790
Duanwu did!

432
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,620
Everyone's just looking out
for themselves.

433
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,420
- Duanwu, you're no different!
- Let's go.

434
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,270
Come on!

435
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,110
If you don't leave, you'll die here too!

436
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,220
It was a nice building.

437
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,180
[Pearl Tower]
It's a shame to see it burn.

438
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,350
Everything the Cui family has touched

439
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,660
is tainted.

440
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:06,820
[Pearl Tower]

441
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,380
Stop right there!

442
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,110
Stop running!

443
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,880
Stop!

444
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,490
Over there!

445
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,070
Come back!

446
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,660
They're over there!

447
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,460
Go after them!

448
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,420
Let's go!

449
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:20,930
Hurry.

450
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,030
Freeze!

451
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:23,660
Come on!

452
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,180
Stop right there!

453
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,700
- Freeze!
- Don't run!

454
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,420
Stop running!

455
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,510
Stop right there!

456
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,480
Freeze!

457
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,660
Stop!

458
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,710
Stop!

459
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:32,700
Stop running!

460
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,380
Stop!

461
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,310
Stop running!

462
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,700
Freeze!

463
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,270
Come on.

464
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,380
That way. Let's go!

465
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,180
Stop running!

466
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,980
Hurry!

467
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,830
Stop them!

468
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,310
This way!

469
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,620
- Stop!
- Come on!

470
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,790
Don't let them escape!

471
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,140
This way!

472
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,420
Freeze!

473
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,350
Hurry!

474
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,380
Stop her!

475
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,790
Hurry up!

476
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,660
Faster!

477
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,070
The boat's here. Get on!

478
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,180
Why are you helping me?

479
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,310
Because I'm your mother!

480
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,420
Now go. Hurry!

481
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,110
Wait. What did you say?

482
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,180
I don't understand.

483
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,070
- Wait!
- Get on the boat, now!

484
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,460
Just do as I say!

485
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,180
What trick are you trying to pull?

486
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,660
Sweetheart,

487
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,940
I really am your mother.

488
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,660
Your adoptive father's surname is Wei.

489
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,590
He later had a daughter named Xiazhi.

490
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,110
Before you were taken to the pearl farm,

491
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,940
you were supposed to leave with them.

492
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:37,590
I arranged everything

493
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,940
so they could take you away,

494
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,070
but you were still captured
and brought to the farm.

495
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,700
It's an honor to be a pearl diver.

496
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,660
You'll have food, drink,
and a comfortable life.

497
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,790
What more do you want?

498
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,830
Take her away!

499
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,380
I tried everything I could

500
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,830
to help you escape,

501
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,420
but nothing worked.

502
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,310
My dear daughter,

503
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,110
it's my fault.

504
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,180
This was the only way
I could protect you.

505
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,660
Sweetheart,

506
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,660
I'm so sorry.

507
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,070
My dear daughter...

508
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,870
Stop there!

509
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,590
Come on!

510
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,420
Don't leave!

511
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,180
Stop right there!

512
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,870
Hurry!

513
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,590
Hurry!

514
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:37,590
This was left by your father.

515
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,460
Keep it safe, and go find him
in the Western Regions.

516
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,380
Remember, sweetheart,

517
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,750
go to the Western Regions to find him.

518
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,030
- Shrimp, hurry.
- Duanwu.

519
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,420
Get your sister out of here.

520
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,140
- Duanwu.
- I'll hold them off.

521
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,160
- Let's go, Duanwu!
- Wait!

522
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,030
Wait, hold on!

523
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Come with me.

524
00:29:54,790 --> 00:30:00,180
Come with me!

525
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,590
I'll hold them off.

526
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,140
Come with me!

527
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,030
I'll hold them off!

528
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,310
Come with me.

529
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,700
Come with me.

530
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,590
Come with me.

531
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,590
If you don't go now, it'll be too late.

532
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,830
Come with me, please.

533
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:21,870
Alright,

534
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,030
I'll go with you.

535
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,660
I'll go with you.

536
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,510
- Let's go.
- Hurry!

537
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,590
They're up ahead!

538
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,700
Stop them!

539
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:29,980
Hurry!

540
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,110
Stop them!

541
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,900
Stop right there!

542
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,460
Duanwu, hurry!

543
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,180
Duanwu!

544
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,270
Come on!

545
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:35,900
Stop them!

546
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,420
Hurry!

547
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,110
Catch her!

548
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,220
Over there!

549
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,110
Stop right there!

550
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:42,660
Hurry!

551
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,550
Stop!

552
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,350
Hurry, Shrimp!

553
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,590
Row the boat!

554
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,460
Hurry!

555
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,350
Hurry!

556
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
Hurry!

557
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,380
Row the boat, Shrimp!

558
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,420

00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,510
Stay away!

742
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,780
[Cui]

743
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,190
Help!

744
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,630
Is anyone there?

745
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,400
Someone's fallen overboard.

746
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,400
- Du Ming, rescue them!

747
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,990
Yes, sir.

748
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,990
Greetings, Lady Shijiu.

749
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,990
Outrageous!

750
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,590
How dare you
keep Master Shijiu waiting this long?

751
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:36,880
Master Shijiu, welcome to Hepu.

752
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,630
Please forgive me

753
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,720
for being late.

754
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,440
I heard you'd be getting married soon.

755
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,470
Have you come to prepare your dowry?

756
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,400
I see that you're here
on behalf of the master, Master Shijiu.

757
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,470
Are this year's tribute pearls ready?

758
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,280
They were all prepared

759
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,840
and stored in the Pearl Tower.

760
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,880
But there was a terrible fire today,

761
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,400
and now the Pearl Tower
is nothing but rubble.

762
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,110
It was truly a man-made disaster.

763
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,840
There was a defiant slave
on the pearl farm named Duanwu.

764
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,960
She secretly seduced Peng Wu,

765
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,510
and somehow,

766
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,840
she not only killed him

767
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,920
but also colluded with Lady Eight

768
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,190
to burn down the entire Pearl Tower!

769
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,920
May I ask, Steward Cui,

770
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,280
have you caught them?

771
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,150
We're working on it.

772
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,470
Once Duanwu is caught,

773
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,920
everything will come to light.

774
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,110
I don't care about the truth.

775
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,150
Not a single pearl

776
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,320
can be missing.

777
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,760
But how could I possibly
get so many pearls now?

778
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:41,110
Even if we have to cut you up
and sell the pieces,

779
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,070
the job must be done.

780
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,320
Otherwise,

781
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,280
I'll throw you into the ocean
to feed the sharks.

782
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,280
Would you prefer that, Steward Cui?

783
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,030
Sir,

784
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,920
there's a problem with the gold leaf.

785
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,110
It's fake.

786
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,800
This was left by your father.

787
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,080
Go find him in the Western Regions.

788
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,090
Duanwu,

789
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:13,060
you're awake!

790
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,250
You finally woke up!

791
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,250
Duanwu, we've made it.

792
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,730
Mr. Zhang saved us.

793
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,610
We're on his ship now.

794
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,200
He said he knew you.

795
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:25,050
Duanwu,

796
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:25,900
come on.

797
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,820
Drink this.

798
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,340
By the way, Duanwu,

799
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,320
Lady Eight left this for you.

800
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,460
She was the one who told me
to wait for you by the shore.
