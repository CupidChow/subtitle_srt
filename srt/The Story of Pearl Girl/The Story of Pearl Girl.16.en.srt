If you'd looked into it,

156
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,910
Wuling wouldn't be like this.

157
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,150
I'm telling you.

158
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,480
If you mess with me,

imprisoned the innocent,

183
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,240
forced good girls to become prostitutes,

184
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,240
and used lynching to kill people.

185
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,480
No.

186
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,270
They are my slaves.

187
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,510
They signed contracts to sell themselves.

188
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,630
They sold themselves to me.

189
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,630
- No. - That's not true.

190

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,320
They took our money and delivered us here.

195
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,120
Duanwu.

196
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,360
You go back first.

197
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,750
The witnesses are here.

198
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,550
As for physical evidence,

199
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,390
I think they are all over the Bafang Tower.

200
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,510
The murderer will be beheaded.

201
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,720
The looters will be hanged.

202
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,360
Besides, you colluded with the Black Dragon Bandits.

203
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,750
You're doubly guilty.

204
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,550
Governor Sun.

205
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,510
Governor Sun.

206
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,000
We caught him red-handed with robbed goods.

207
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,910
Come on.

208
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,630
Arrest him for interrogation.

209
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:45,870
Wait.

210
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,870
Governor Sun, I'm innocent.

211
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:48,910
The head of the Cui family

212
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,360
did all this.

213
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I was ordered.

214
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,030
Cui Shijiu.

215
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,000
You can't get away with this.

216
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,240
Nonsense.

217
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,480
How dare you slander the head?

218
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
The Cui family didn't know

219
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,600
you did all this.

220
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,000
It's all your fault.

221
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,720
To cover up your crimes,

222
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,720
you sent me to the mine and became a miner.

223
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,840
Everybody knows that.

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,960
That's right.

225
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,510
She's the Cui family's legitimate daughter.

226
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,480
She was sent to the mine.

227
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,120
She took out the Cui family head's token

228
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,200
and set us free.

229
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,080
Punish Master Eight severely.

230
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,630
Punish Master Eight severely.

231
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,480
That's right.

232
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,840
The Wuling Mine belongs to the Cui family.

233
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,030
I didn't expect it

234
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,480
to become Master Eight's prison.

235
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,480
He's unforgivable.

236
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,240
Fortunately, I banished him from the Cui family

237
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,030
with the family head's token

238
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,200
and set everyone free.

239
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,480
We're willing to cooperate with you

240
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,240
to find all the evidence of Master Eight's crimes.

241
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,000
Cui Shijiu.

242
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,240
You're just a dirty billet.

243
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,610
Enough. Take him away.

244
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,750
- Go. - Go.

245
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,080
Cui Jingchu, you're evil.

246
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,240
The Cui family is doomed.

247
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,680
You're all evil.

248
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,240
Governor Sun.

249
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,480
Won't you go back to try the case?

250
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,870
Yes.

251
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,240
I'll the case as soon as I get back.

252
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,960
Let's go.

253
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,480
Are you going with me?

254
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,750
I'm a witness. I have to go.

255
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,270
Let's go.

256
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,150
Chancellor Zhang, thank you for saving our lives.

257
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,790

Are you feeling better?

272
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,590
Yes.

273

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,790
Are you all right?

275
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,550
Great.

276
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,350
You want to ask me

277
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,790
what was going on,

278
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,110
right?

279
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,350
Did you plan this?

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes

281
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:23,880
and no.

282
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,830
I knew

283
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,310
that the Black Dragon Bandits robbed money and sold people.

284
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,550
But I didn't know where they sold people.

285
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,480
Mr. Yue told me

286
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,640
that Master Eight

287
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,920
introduced the Black Dragon Bandits to the Cui family.

288
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,960
I thought

289
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,640
there must be something wrong

290
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
with Master Eight

291
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,110
and the Bafang Tower.

292
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,310
Then what?

293
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,680
When we arrived in Wuling,

294
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,640
I discovered

295
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,350
that the mine was secretive.

296
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,240
So, I thought

297
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,830
that the people sold by the Black Dragon Bandits

298
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,400
had something to do with Master Eight

299
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,830
and that they were most likely

300
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,480
hidden in the Wuling Mine by Master Eight.

301
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,270
Master Eight took the Bafang Tower seriously.

302
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,160
I thought the Bafang Tower was the key.

303
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,880
So, I asked Kang Ju to look into it.

304
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,310
He investigated for a long time

305
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,350
but could not find the entrance to the mine.

306
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,960
You asked Supervisor Kang

307
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,640
to transfer the jewelry.

308
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,070
I wanted to take advantage

309
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,110
of Master Eight's greed

310
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,310
to lure him to attack Cui's Jewelry

311
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,480
and me.

312
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,310
You put yourself at risk.

313
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,200
Yes.

314
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,200
You lured Master Eight to take you away

315
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,070
so you could find the mine entrance

316
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,640
and rescue all miners.

317
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,480
What's wrong?

318
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
If you had made

319
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,110
one wrong move

320
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,110
in your plan,

321
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,350
you would have died.

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,910
But they were involved.

383
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:26,190
Their family was ruined.

384
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,670
And they became court criminals.

385
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,280
Mr. Zhang, what are you trying to say?

386
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:35,710
From Hepu to Guangzhou,

387
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,840
from Shaozhou to Wuling,

388
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,150
you used me as a pawn and got me involved.

389
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,430
You should

390
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,190
let me know the truth.

391
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,470
Don't you already know the truth?

392
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,840
The Yan's national tribute case was suspicious.

393
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,320
I want to look into it.

394
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,470
It's been so many years.

395
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,080
Is it necessary to find out the truth?

396
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,190
I don't care how many years have passed.

397
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,760
I want to find out the truth.

398
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,910
Master Yan, don't worry.

399
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,710
I

400
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,520
will investigate this case

401
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,230
with justice.

402
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,320
Mr. Zhang, I thank you

403
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
for those who died unjustly.

404
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,430
There's one more thing.

405
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,430
Master Yan,

406
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,950
would you help me?

407
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,320
How?

408
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,760
Hexi Black Dragon Bandits has been raging for many years.

409
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,800
They robbed countless people.

410
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,990
I want to request troops to eliminate the Black Dragon Bandits.

411
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,800
The Black Dragon Bandits disappeared for a while.

412
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,990
They've been rampant in recent years.

413
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,470
The government couldn't deal with the desert.

414
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,840
That's why they became a bully in Hexi.

415
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,600
Many people died on the business road.

416
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,950
If you want to do this,

417
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,630
I'm afraid you will encounter a lot of difficulties.

418
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Pei Shijie, the inspector of Hexi, is my friend.

419
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,040
I'm sure

420
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,150
he will help us.

421
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,630
Okay.

422
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,390
I'll work with you

423
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,320
on this.

424
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,840
May we

425
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,230
succeed

426
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,800
in our common goal.

427
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,990
You're doing much better than before.

428
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,880
Come on.

429
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,520
Watch your hands.

430
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,430
Mr. Zhang.

431
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,320
Duanwu.

432
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,760
He...

433
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,320
He's taking a rest.

434
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Ms. Yue,

435
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,630
aren't your hands all right?

436
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,830
In my friend Pei Shijie's army,

437
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,210
there's a military physician

438
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,550
who's good at treating hands.

439
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,270
Maybe you can go to him.

440
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,070
Really?

441
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,560
I'm going to the Hexi Army.

442
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,230
If you trust me,

443
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,630
I can take Ms. Yue

444
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,230
to see the military physician.

445
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,840
All right. Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

446
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,840
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

447
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,760
Not at all.

448
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,520
Are you also going to the Western Regions?

449
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,230
Yes.

450
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,150
I know the truth.

451
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,320
I can't let it go.

452
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,910
Mr. Zhang.

453
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,670
Would you like to play with us?

454
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,390
Okay, wait for me.

455
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,040
Okay.

456
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,150
Mr. Zhang.

457
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,560
Thank you.

458
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,470
Duanwu.

459
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,910
Could you give me an orange?

460
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,910
Catch it.

461
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:13,990
It's sweet.

462
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,360
Cao Da, eat one.

463
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,190
Sit down, everybody.

464
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Come here, Shrimp.

465
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:32,670
Come on. Sit down.

466
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,430
In Wuling,

467
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,190
our trading convoy encountered a disaster.

468
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,470
Thank you for not leaving.

469
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,630
I've been in business for years.

470
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,880
I have always acted freely.

471
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,230
I have enemies everywhere.

472
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,150
So, sometimes, I don't do things

473
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,760
according to common sense.

474
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,470
This

475
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,800
will happen a lot

476
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,520
in the future.

477
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,230
I'm going to Hexi next.

478
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,670
If you have scruples

479
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,760
or want to do something else,

480
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,470
you can leave.

481
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,230
I won't force you to stay.

482
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,840
I prepared

483
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,530
a year's salary

484
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,390
for those who want to leave

485
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:21,990
as compensation.

486
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,230
So much money.

487
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,230
I'll follow you, Master.

488
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,190
Take it.

489
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,520
Take it.

490
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,470
The trading convoy

491
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,230
has a tough road ahead.

492
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,560
Take the money.

493
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,150
Go home and start a small business.

494
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,910
Listen to me.

495
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,150
I'll follow you, leader.

496
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,360
I, Cao Da, am absolutely loyal

497
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,520
to the trading convoy.

498
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,360
I'm willing to give my all till...

499
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,320
Till...

500
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,800
Till your heart ceases to beat.

501
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,360
I'm not leaving.

502
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,190
Yes.

503
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,800
Don't beat me.

504
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,150
I'm not leaving either.

505
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,190
Master, we're not leaving.

506
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,230
- Yeah, we're not leaving. - We're not leaving.

507
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,800
We're not leaving.

508
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,390
I was surprised

509
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,190
when everyone said

510
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,080
they wouldn't leave.

511
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,230
Yeah.

512
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,430
I didn't expect them

513
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,990
to be willing to go on an adventure with me.

514
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,880
That's because you're nice.

515
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,760
They didn't want to leave because you treated them well.

516
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,670
I'll have

517
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,470
to treat them better.

518
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,630
Come on.

519
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,230
Eat something.

520
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,320
Let me ask you something.

521
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,910
You said you were poisoned by the Black Dragon Bandits.

522
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,230
How's it going?

523
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,910
I'm all right.

524
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,230
Really?

525
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,080
Don't worry. I'm Yan Zijing.

526
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,470
The poison can't hurt me.

527
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,190
- I'm worried... - I'm all right. Don't worry.

528
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,470
Let's eat.

529
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,880
Don't worry.

530
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,360
Taste this.

531
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,150
You're erudite and informed.

532
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,520
You're proficient in poetry, calligraphy, and painting.

533
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,520
I thought you were a scholar.

534
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,470
But on your trip

535
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,120
to the South Sea,

536
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,360
you found out the truth about pearl diving

537
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,880
and sympathized with the pearl divers.

538
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,800
In your letter of expostulation, I found your love for the people.

539
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,150
Now, there's an opening for a secretariat drafter.

540
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,360
I hope you will return to Chang'an soon.

541
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,570
I look forward to your return.

542
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,120
Prince Ying values you.

543
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,470
Are you going to write him back?

544
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,080
I need to write him back.

545
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,430
But...

546
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,470
About the secretariat drafter,

547
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,190
I'll put it off.

548
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,230
I haven't thought about it yet.

549
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,560
It's a good thing.

550
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,390
What are your concerns?

551
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,630
Besides,

552
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,560
Prince Ying kept the position for you.

553
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,520
It's not appropriate for you to refuse him.

554
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,600
I have no credit.

555
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,910
I can't hold such an important position.

556
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,630
I'll look into the old case

557
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,280
and wipe out the Black Dragon Bandits first.

558
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,320
Then, I won't fail his trust.

559
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,910
Prepare the ink.

560
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,280
You're doing this for Duanwu.

561
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,040
Dear brother,

562
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,120
I'm going to Hexi...

563
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,560
Yunxiu.

564
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,320
I'll take Shrimp to you

565
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,600
as soon as I finish the important thing.

566
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,520
We'll find you.

567
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:28,800
Wait for me.

568
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:30,560
Do you remember?

569
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
[Peach blossom and running water]
I told you

570
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,470
that we would open a shop.

571
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,670
You'll carve jade. I'll sell them.

572
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,630
Remember?

573
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,280
Yes.

574
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,390
Can we have our own shop,

575
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,230
Duanwu?

576
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,150
Duanwu, are we going to open a shop?

577
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,430
You have a good ear.

578
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,630
It's great.

579
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,390
Duanwu.

580
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,860
What do we

581
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,910
name our shop?

582
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,080
Name our shop?

583
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,320
May my heart be as bright as the moon.

584
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,520
So I can see through people.

585
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,150
Is it good?

586
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,320
Let's name it

587
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,910
Clear Mind, okay?

588
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,710
Clear Mind.

589
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:19,710
How about it?

590
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:20,760
Okay.

591
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,880
Duanwu.

592
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,760
Let's go to Yangzhou then.

593
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,190
Why?

594
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,710
Yangzhou is prosperous. There are many jewelry shops.

595
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,760
We can make a difference.

596
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:59,060
[Cui]

597
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,300
[Yan]

598
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:37,380
[Bianzhou]

599
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:39,070
It's delicious. Have some.

600
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,950
No, thanks.

601
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,160
Stop eating.

602
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,800
Shrimp.

603
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,240
There's a flowerpot there.

604
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,910
Let's see who gets there first.

605
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,240
This is the starting line.

606
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,070
Three, two...

607
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Wait.

608
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,550
Excuse me.

609
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,390
Wait. This line...

610
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,910
Three, two, one, start.

611
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,030
I got there first.

612
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,880
I'm the first.

613
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,070
Call Duanwu.

614
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,240
Duanwu.

615
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,590
Duanwu!

616
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,160
- Come here. These flowers are beautiful. - Duanwu, come here.

617
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,990
Duanwu.

618
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,430
Coming.

619
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,950
Mine looks better.

620
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,200
Can you keep up with her?

621
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,550
Could you be positive?

622
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,160
She's shy.

623
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,030
This one looks better.

624
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,640
Are you also shy?

625
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,520
- This one is beautiful. - I'm not shy.

626
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,280
- I should consider her feelings. - What kind of flower is this?

627
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,910
Look at that.

628
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,430
I've never seen this flower.

629
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,640
What kind of flower is this? It's so big.

630
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,550
Miss.

631
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:27,800
It's a peony.

632
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,030
As a line of poetry goes,

633
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,840
Peonies are the most beautiful flowers;

634
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,470
when the peonies bloom, people from all over the capital will go to watch them.

635
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,590
Duanwu, we haven't been to the capital yet.

636
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,550
We'll go there sooner or later.

637
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,200
Yes.

638
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,760
We'll get a chance to go together.

639
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,110
She said she would go to the capital.

640
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,060
- Duanwu, look at this flower. - I'll keep that in mind.

641
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,040
It looks beautiful.

642
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,800
The purple flowers are beautiful, too.

643
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,510
What?

644
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,070
What's wrong?

645
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,720
Shrimp. Look at this flower.

646
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,430
Duanwu.

647
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,360
The Master is acting weird.

648
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,760
He's staring at you all the time.

649
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,880
Look at him.

650
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,320
Look at his eyes.

651
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:30,070
I've been watching him for a long time.

652
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,440
Is he...?

653
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,110
Shrimp, here's the thing.

654
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,030
Is he trying to kill you?

655
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,110
Why would you say that?

656
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,880
Is he trying to kill you again?

657
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,360
What have you done lately?

658
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,280
Does he look like he wants to kill me?

659
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,880
I don't think so.

660
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,320
What do you think?

661
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,880
Let me see.

662
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,110
He wants to kill you?

663
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,840
Don't look at him. It's dangerous.

664
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,860
Accountant Wei, what has Duanwu done lately?

665
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,300
She hasn't done anything wrong.

666
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:11,990
You're also acting weird.

667
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,640
What's wrong with me?

668
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,160
Duanwu.

669
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,200
Come here. This flower is beautiful.

670
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:22,800
It would

671
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
look great on you.

672
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,390
Come here. I'll put it on for you.

673
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,110
Wait. Accountant Wei.

674
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,430
Why did you take it off?

675
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,430
It's okay.

676
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:29,160
We have to pay for it.

677
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,030
Never mind.

678
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,880
I can't put it on for you.

679
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,110
Who knows how to wear this?

680
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:34,840
I'll do it.

681
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,800
What does it have to do with you?

682
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,800
Put it back.

683
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,880
I've taken it down.

684
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,680
I'll put it on for you.

685
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,640
Do you know how to put it on?

686
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,470
Of course.

687
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,200
Really?

688
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,840
Yes.

689
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,680
You can try.

690
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Are you done?

691
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,720
So soon.

692
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,910
It's beautiful.

693
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,070
Probably because the flower is beautiful.

694
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,760
The flower is beautiful.

695
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,030
Well...

696
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,510
I think I smelled

697
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,510
Cao Da's chicken feet.

698
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,360
Did you smell it?

699
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,160
Yes.

700
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,680
It smells good.

701
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,430
Where is he?

702
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,800
- Why didn't I smell it? - Let me see what he's eating.

703
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,360
Okay.

704
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,320
Good job. Thank you.

705
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,950
You're welcome.

706
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,990
Let's go together.

707
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,390
Go.

708
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,160
Duanwu.

709
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,640
Nice.

710
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,240
Good for you.

711
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:03,950
Take notes.

712
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,590
Come on. That's all for your dishes.

713
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,450
Are you leaving?

714
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,600
Take care.

715
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,160
This is our specialty wine,

716
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,030
Museles.

717
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:13,880
I know this wine.

718
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,110
It's a nice grape wine.

719
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:15,800
It's great.

720
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,680
Smell it.

721
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,240
It smells like grapes.

722
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,280
Let's toast

723
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,030
to our arrival in Bianzhou.

724
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,640
A cup of Muse...

725
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,550
Museles.

726
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,550
Museles.

727
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,800
Let's make a toast.

728
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,410
Cheers.

729
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,840
Cheers.

730
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,280
You only eat bones.

731
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Can I have a bone?

732
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,110
Don't use your hands.

733
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,160
That's all for your dishes.

734
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,910
Thank you, Kang.

735
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,590
What are you looking at?

736
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,510
Let me toast you.

737
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,390
It's delicious.

738
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,620
- I'm looking at the owner. - Save some for me.

739
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,550
This is a big restaurant.

740
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,020
There are three floors here.

741
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,430
Shrimp, this is your favorite.

742
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,060
- It's good for a woman to own such a restaurant. - Okay.

743
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,770
Cao Da.

744
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,580
Give it to me.

745
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,320
What's good about it?

746
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,430
Isn't it good?

747
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,760
A woman does what she wants.

748
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,140
Cao Da.

749
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,320
And she's doing it well.

750
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,200
I envy her.

751
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Shrimp, eat more.

752
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,110
You can do it, too.

753
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,280
Cao Da, you eat more.

754
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,030
Me?

755
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,280
I just want to be a peddler.

756
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,340
Being a boss...

757
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,910
How about this?

758
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,320
You'll be the boss.

759
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,880
And I will rely on you.

760
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:25,910
What?

761
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,430
You'll be the boss. I'll rely on you.

762
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,760
You rely on me?

763
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,070
I'll be the boss?

764
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,910
You rely on me?

765
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:33,590
I rely on you.

766
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,610
You rely on me?

767
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,110
Yes.

768
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,510
You rely on me?

769
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,950
Yes.

770
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,320
We were just talking about my itchiness.

771
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,360
Leader.

772
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,320
Have you and the Master...?

773
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,360
Is it that obvious?

774
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,840
You're strong.

775
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,360
Well.

776
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,160
In that case,

777
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
I won't hide it from you.

778
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,700
I wish you happiness.

779
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,690
I wish you all the best.

780
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,030
I wish...

781
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,030
Duanwu and her boyfriend...

782
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:29,840
Boyfriend?

783
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,990
I wish you a bright future,

784
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,360
a happy life,

785
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,730
every success,

786
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,760
good fortune,

787
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,160
and all the best.

788
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,430
Good.

789
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,370
I wish you a long life together.

790
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,200
Good.

791
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,550
I hope you

792
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,590
raise your cups and get what you want,

793
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,590
clink your cups and make a lot of money,

794
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,590
and drink it up and live a rich life.

795
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,160
Come on.

796
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,200
You'll get rich.

797
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,110
We'll get rich.

798
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,840
- Come on. - Come on.

799
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,030
Master Yan, I have a request.

800
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,510
I want Duanwu to be happy forever.

801
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,510
Don't bully her.

802
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,240
Don't worry. I can do that.

803
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,640
But,

804
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,070
she's bullying me.

805
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,430
Duanwu, don't bully him.

806
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,720
- Wait. Who are you defending? - Yeah.

807
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,520
Don't bully me.

808
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,110
Duanwu.

809
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,110
Supervisor Kang.

810
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,470
I haven't seen Zijing this happy

811
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,550
in a long time.

812
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,280
I sincerely wish you

813
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,390
happiness forever.

814
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,070
I'll take good care of him.

815
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,770
Here's to you.

816
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:35,680
Thank you, Supervisor Kang.

817
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,030
Don't be sentimental.

818
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,550
Don't be sentimental.

819
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,160
- Come on. - Cheers.

820
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,800
Cheers.
