11
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,870
[Episode 4]

12
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,260
What's the situation there?

13
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,260
Duanwu,

14
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,660
apart from the Master

15
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,130
and his two guards,

16
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,290
there are three others
in the upper deck.

17
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,450
Two of them are older,

18
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,860
one is Steward Zhao,

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,220
and the other is Assistant Pang.

20
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,900
And the third one is a woman,
Accountant Wei.

21
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,450
They say Assistant Pang always sides
with Overseer Cao.

22
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,220
That means Assistant Pang

23
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,490
is Overseer Cao's backup
on the upper deck.

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,890
Also,

25
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,490
most of those in the middle deck
are warriors,

26
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,620
led by a man called Kang Ju.

27
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,250
Kang Ju?

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,450
I remember him.
What about the lower deck?

29
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,700
In the lower deck,
Loud is strong and eats a lot.

30
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,980
Dear Xiu is very nimble,

31
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,340
usually handling the finer work.

32
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,940
And there's Dear Hu.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,700
She's knowledgeable.

34
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,250
always telling us what not to do.

35
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,620
And you know what?

36
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,100
Dear Hu even gave me a treat.

37
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,170
Quick, hide it!

38
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,410
Dear Hu!

39
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,020
Dear Xiu!

40
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,500
Hello, Dear Hu!

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:43,940
Thank you.

42
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,410
Hello, Dear Xiu!

43
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,100
No problem at all.

44
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,740
Here, let me help you.

45
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,530
No need.

46
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,170
I'll carry it for you.

47
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,810
No need.

48
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,250
It's fine.

49
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:50,810
I'll help, too.

50
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,970
We're new here,
so it's natural to do more.

51
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,740
Let me take it.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,660
We still need
to deliver the waste material.

53
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,170
This is waste material?

54
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,330
If my third uncle saw this,

55
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,660
he'd surely say we're striking it rich!

56
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,820
Our convoy handles a lot of jewelry,

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,260
so naturally, there's a lot of waste.

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,660
How much does this waste sell
for per jin?

59
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,010
I heard from Overseer Cao,
about 18 cash per jin.

60
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,180
Right.

61
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,930
We're off to get busy.

62
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,060
Alright, thank you.

63
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,540
Mr. Cao!

64
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,460
Duanwu, Shrimp,

65
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,820
this is Mr. Cao.

66
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,490
So, you're the two newcomers, huh?

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,460
I'm Duanwu, the new one here.

68
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,060
This is my younger partner, Shrimp.

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,260
Greetings, Mr. Cao.

70
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,060
Please look out for us.

71
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,290
"Look out" might be too much.

72
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,060
Just do as you're told.

73
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,260
Mr. Cao, we'll head out
to deliver the waste now.

74
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,180
Go ahead.

75
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,850
Sure.

76
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,980
You're Shrimp, right?

77
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,010
Here.

78
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,060
No, please. You can keep it.

79
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:39,650
How cute.

80
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,090
Listen up, everyone!

81
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,300
It's payday!

82
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:44,370
Alright!

83
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,140
Wages are being handed out!

84
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,970
Come on, let's go!

85
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,370
You all are pretty lucky.

86
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,490
the Master added 100 cash
for each of you this time.

87
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,530
Thanks, Mr. Cao!

88
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,020
Why do even the servants get wages?

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,860
Stop there.

90
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,370
Come over, what are you afraid of?

91
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,370
Last time, we had you polish
those jewelry boxes,

92
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,460
and now Assistant Pang
pays you for them.

93
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,970
Afraid I'm going to eat you? Off you go.

94
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,650
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

95
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,370
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

96
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,060
Everyone got your pay?

97
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,300
Now get back to work.

98
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,810
Let's go, get to work.

99
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,460
Mr. Cao,

100
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,740
that pair of shoes
you got for me last time is great.

101
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,300
Could you get me another pair?

102
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,180
Well...

103
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,650
And some cured meat.

104
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,930
Cured meat.

105
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,370
He wants cured meat.

106
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:35,930
Mr. Cao,

107
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,530
next time we dock,
could you get us some rice wine?

108
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,180
Alright, you always need something,

109
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,690
but only I don't mind helping you out.

110
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:45,930
Here's the deal:

111
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,340
cured meat on shore
costs 110 cash per strip,

112
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,650
I'll charge you 100 cash.

113
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,210
Shoes are 200 cash per pair,

114
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,900
and rice wine is 300 cash per jar.

115
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,770
If you want to buy...

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,580
Here.

117
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,060
Thanks, Mr. Cao!

118
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,930
Thanks, Mr. Cao.

119
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,860
Get back to work now.

120
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,210
Shrimp, let's go.

121
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,300
Duanwu!

122
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,460
What's wrong?

123
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,460
Overseer Cao is so rotten,

124
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,740
he's taking more than half
from everyone.

125
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,770
What do you mean?

126
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,810
Duanwu, you haven't been outside,

127
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,970
so you don't know...

128
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,370
Cured meat outside

129
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,930
costs only 50 cash per jin.

130
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,490
And cloth shoes cost
just 100 cash per pair.

131
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,460
I thought he was kind,

132
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,300
but he's actually like this.

133
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,490
No way, I have to tell everyone.

134
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,300
Come back here.

135
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,740
We're new here,

136
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,900
and haven't even left the ship.

137
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,300
How would they believe us?

138
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,140
No way.

139
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,650
Listen to me, Shrimp.

140
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,300
We can't rush this.

141
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,690
Did you see it just now?

142
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,100
That waste material...

143
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,010
It's actually valuable.

144
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,740
Some can be used as medicine,

145
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,740
and some

146
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,220
can be melted and reshaped.

147
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,620
So, if that's the case,

148
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,620
you know how to?

149
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,740
Of course!

150
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,330
My third uncle does this kind of work.

151
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,220
We could consider

152
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,890
dealing in waste material.

153
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,690
We could!

154
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,180
But we're on this ship,

155
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,490
and can't get off.

156
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,810
Who would we sell it to here?

157
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,060
Naturally, we can sell it on this ship.

158
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,100
So we have to find a way to get off.

159
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,100
Cui Ding took his own life.

160
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,980
Before he died, he confessed,

161
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,370
and said your younger sister
is in Shaozhou.

162
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,370
Wonderful.

163
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,220
Once we're done in Guangzhou,

164
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,450
we'll go straight to Shaozhou.

165
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,300
Alright.

166
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,660
Has Zhang Jinran arrived in Guangzhou?

167
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,740
At their pace,

168
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,330
he should be half a day behind us.

169
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,370
Then Zhang Jinran will have

170
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,100
to accept this big gift.

171
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,930
What if he traces it back to you?

172
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,450
He won't.

173
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,180
The ones who want
Cui Ding dead the most now

174
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,570
are the Cui family.

175
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,980
You want Zhang Jinran to believe

176
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,540
that the Cui family killed
to silence him,

177
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
linking the pearl farm
to the Cui family?

178
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,220
Destroying the Cui's Pearl Farm

179
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,810
isn't enough
to bring the Cui family down.

180
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,740
With their wealth, they could soon
gather enough tribute pearls.

181
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,890
But if Zhang Jinran follows up on this,

182
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,010
proving the Cui family
sold tribute pearls secretly

183
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,100
and deceived the Emperor,

184
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,620
then it's a crime punishable
by total extermination.

185
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,450
Once they arrive in Guangzhou,

186
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,660
they'll receive this generous gift.

187
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,490
Master, you called for me?

188
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,810
I'm planning to host a poetry gathering
in Guangzhou.

189
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,890
The prize is ten taels of pearls.

190
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,780
Ten taels of pearls?

191
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,540
Master,

192
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,860
isn't that

193
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,890
a bit extravagant?

194
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,740
Special Envoy of Treasures
Xu Nanying, Cui Shijiu,

195
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,780
and Zhang Jinran,

196
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,330
together, are they not worth

197
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,300
ten taels of pearls?

198
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,780
Yes, Master.

199
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,780
Peng Wu is Xu Nanying's man,

200
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,330
and Xu Nanying serves Prince Tan.

201
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,330
Cui Shijiu will definitely turn
to Xu Nanying for help.

202
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,490
You'll involve Zhang Jinran in,

203
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,220
hoping he sees this, right?

204
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,330
After all, he's his senior brother,

205
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,890
Aren't you afraid
Zhang Jinran might hesitate?

206
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,620
He won't.

207
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,100
Sister Hu.

208
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,220
Duanwu, still awake?

209
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:42,620
I can't sleep.

210
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,330
I'll help you with it.

211
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,180
I'm going up to clean the upper deck.

212
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,620
We're only permitted there at midnight.

213
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,890
The upper deck?

214
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,330
I'll go for you.

215
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,890
You're new here,
and there's much you don't know.

216
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,330
Don't anger the Master.

217
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,490
I know. I will...

218
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,490
I'll be careful.

219
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,980
I promise I'll be careful.

220
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,980
When I'm not here,

221
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,540
please look after my younger partner,
Shrimp.

222
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,330
Thank you.

223
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,220
Alright...

224
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,130
Now go get some rest.

225
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:15,660
Remember,

226
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,890
be very gentle,

227
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,010
and don't miss a single spot.

228
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,100
Be very gentle.

229
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,780
Go rest.

230
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,010
Off you go.

231
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,620
Three million cash...

232
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,450
As a servant,
that's impossible in a lifetime.

233
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,220
As a seller,

234
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,860
how much would I have to sell?

235
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,490
I must find a way off this ship.

236
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,890
But how...

237
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,890
do I convince him?

238
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,570
Remember,

239
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,850
be very gentle.

240
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,660
Oh, here goes nothing!

241
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,570
Duanwu, lower deck servant,
reporting to the Master.

242
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,780
Has no one taught you the rules?

243
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,570
They have.

244
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,900
Clean the upper deck,

245
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,690
no dust allowed.

246
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,780
Seems they didn't teach you well enough.

247
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,780
Tomorrow, I'll sell them all off.

248
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,810
Master,

249
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,330
it's my fault,

250
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,020
I asked to come up here.

251
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,260
It has nothing to do with them.

252
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,690
So you accept punishment
for you mistake?

253
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,380
I accept.

254
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,930
But, Master, may I ask...

255
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,780
could I have a chance to leave the ship?

256
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,020
The three million needed
to buy back my pearl

257
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,300
is more than a servant could earn
in a lifetime.

258
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,540
So, I want to leave

259
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,570
to see if there's a way.

260
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,570
Fine. We'll arrive
in Guangzhou tomorrow.

261
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,260
Before sunrise,

262
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,900
clean the entire ship by yourself,

263
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,450
and I'll let you leave the ship.

264
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,970
Deal.

265
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,660
Not a single word more.

266

270
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,330
Duanwu, why are you sleeping here?

271
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:20,930
What's wrong?

272
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,500
We've arrived in Guangzhou!

273
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,330
Shrimp,

274
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,380
today, we can get off the ship.

275
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,450
Really?

276
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,850
In a bit, we'll go down
and look for opportunities,

277
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,140
see if there's anything we can do.

278
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,730
Alright.

279
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,500
Once we find a chance,

280
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,780
we can earn some money.

281
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,690
With money,
we can buy all sorts of treats.

282
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,850
Alright, when we've earned enough,

283
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,930
I'll get you whatever you want.

284
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:47,810
Alright.

285
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,450
All servants...

286
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:49,850
Gather our things.

287
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,330
Off the ship!

288
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,730
We're getting off the ship!

289
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,260
Let's go!

290
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,850
Finally, we're getting off the ship!

291
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:56,420
Exactly.

292
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:56,930
Let's go!

293
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,690
Hurry!

294
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,690
All servants?

295
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,730
Duanwu, did you get everyone

296
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,540
the chance to get off?

297
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:09,850
Not quite.

298
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,210
Sir.

299
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,140
What's going on?

300
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,970
They found Cui Ding's body on the shore.

301
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,180
He's dead?

302
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,020
When?

303
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,540
When I was filing a report
at the government office,

304
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,900
I heard the body
has already arrived there.

305
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
The coroner examined him and said

306
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,690
Cui Ding endured severe torture

307
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,930
and bit his tongue to end his life.

308
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,090
The tribute pearl case

309
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,970
couldn't have been done by Cui Ding.

310
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,140
Behind this...

311
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,260
apart from the Cui family...

312
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,500
Come in!

313
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,330
Sir, you have a letter.

00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,020
I'll take you somewhere.

321
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,420
If their pearls can't compare
to this one,

322
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,180
I'll gladly pay
five million cash for it.

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,570

Apologies from me.

326
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,450
Who sent this?

327
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
When the fire broke out,
we scrambled to leave.

328
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,300
Someone bumped into me,

329
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,260
and this ledger appeared in my bag.

330
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,850
Every detail seems tied to him.

331
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,090
What's his real intention?

332
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,540
This Pearl Poetry Gathering...

333
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,330
could it be a trap?

334
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,730
Should we go or not?

335
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,330
Go.

By the way, sir,

343
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,180
look at this...

344
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,020
Didn't I say no meetings?

345
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,020

346
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Originally,

00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,210
I wouldn't dare disturb you, sir,

348

but this is truly something remarkable.

349
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,660
Then tell me,

350
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,730
how remarkable is it?

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,900
"A burst of sacred light pierces
the heavens,

372
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,780
The divine dragon spreads rain
across the mountains."

373
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,180
Regarding this poem,

374
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,500
I recall I recited it offhand

375
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,020
before the temple.

376
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,850
You may not know this,

377
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,140
but your verse

378
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,140
has already spread
through every street in Lingnan,

379
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,460
becoming a popular tale.

380
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,130
Who knew

381
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,980
a casual verse from me

382
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,020
would turn into a legend!

383
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,850
Let's go have a look.

384
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,780
Although merchants can be crude
in their pursuits,

385
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,570
this one seems to have some refinement.

386
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,780
Alright, let's go see.

387
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,220
I'll take my leave.

388
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,740
It's here.

389
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,220
Watch your step.

390
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,370
Just place it here.

391
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,170
Careful.

392
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,060
Careful.

393
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,740
Be extra careful.

394
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,260
Duanwu, are your legs still hurting?

395
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,260
You've cleaned the ship all night

396
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,810
and worked all day.

397
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,330
Go and rest a bit.

398
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,890
Don't worry. I'm fine.

399
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,060
Alright, that's okay.

400
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,650
Alright.

401
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,570
It's done over here.

402
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,810
My dear Duanwu,

403
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,940
this kind of silk is very precious.

404
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,780
We must handle it with care.

405
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,850
If it gets damaged,

406
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,650
I'll be the one to get scolded for it.

407
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,410
Got it, Mr. Cao.

408
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,260
I was just checking if it was secure.

409
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,890
Pick up the pace!

410
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,780
Everyone, be careful.

411
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,410
I know.

412
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,810
Mr. Cao, don't worry.

413
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,060
Keep your spirits up,

414
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,170
and pick up the pace!

415
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,300
I'll show you how.

416
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:14,740
It took us so long to get here.

417
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,260
the Master, seriously,

418
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,810
promised we could get off,

419
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,260
but we ended up working instead.

420
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,810
How is it?

421
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,740
Just as you wished, right?

422
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:26,850
Just as I wished.

423
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,370
The view off the ship is nice indeed.

424
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,980
Why aren't you causing trouble today?

425
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,980
When did I ever cause trouble?

426
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,740
Who would dare in front of the Master?

427
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,130
Aren't you satisfied
now that you're off the ship?

428
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,130
No, I'm dissatisfied with myself.

429
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,130
Next time, I'll make sure
to speak more clearly.

430
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,540
Speaking clearly won't help.

431
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,650
I can change the rules anytime I want.

432
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,330
Still no change.

433
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,650
The Master is just too much...

434
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:01,460
Enough.

435
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:02,170
It's fine.

436
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,220
Stop dawdling. Hurry up!

437
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,060
Dear Hu,

438
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:06,890
let me do it.

439
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,650
Be careful!

440
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,130
Master Shijiu, are we too early?

441
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:14,980
No matter.

442
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,700
Chupu Silk...

443
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,940
Yan Zijing is quite extravagant.

444
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,980
Extravagant, indeed.

445
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,740
He even used
a chest of fake gold bullion

446
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,130
to trick the pearl farm
out of the pearls.

447
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,810
Causing all this fuss,

448
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,260
using our Cui family's pearls as prizes
for a poetry gathering.

449
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,020
he's truly crossed the line.

450
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,650
Master Shijiu,

451
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:34,170
that's the lowly slave
who set the Pearl Tower on fire,

452
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:34,650
Duanwu!

453
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,700
I'm better now. Look.

454
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:38,330
Isn't that right?

455
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,130
I'd best not show my face.

456
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,850
I'm exhausted.

457
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,650
Let's take a break.

458
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,260
Take a break.

459
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,130
Duanwu,

460
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,260
it's nice to get off the ship
and walk around...

461
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Duanwu.

462
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,780
Let's go.

463
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,300
Alright.

464
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,060
This is Master Cui Shijiu.

465
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,850
You little runaway slave,
why aren't you kneeling?

466
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,220
I'm not a slave of the Cui family.

467
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,170
I belong to the Yan trading convoy.

468
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,570
My household registration

469
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,780
is recorded at the government office.

470
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,850
Let's go.

471
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,980
If Master Shijiu says you are a slave,
then you are!

472
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,220
You wretched slave,

473
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,780
today, I'll...

474
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,130
Get lost!

475
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:17,780
Shrimp!

476
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,780
A registered household?

477
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,740
But what does that change?

478
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,610
It doesn't erase your lowly origins!

479
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,780
You forced people to dive for pearls,

480
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,500
and it was never my choice.

481
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,980
You tortured the innocent to death,

482
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,500
and every Cui pearl
is stained with blood.

483
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,650
My life...

484
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,890
I fought for it myself,

485
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,410
not given by your Cui family!

486
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,020
Let go!

487
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,740
How dare you
treat Master Shijiu like this!

488
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,330
Let go!

489
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,940
You dare touch me?

490
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,890
I'll end you!

491
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,540
Stop!

492
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,890
Master!

493
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,020
Master!

494
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,500
Just you wait.

495
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,890
Duanwu!

496
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,260
What happened?

497
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,260
Master,

498
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,650
I am now part of the Yan trading convoy.

499
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,410
During the Yan poetry gathering,

500
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,090
the Cui family struck at Yan's people.

501
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,090
How should this be handled?

502
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,260
Why show such disrespect
toward my people?

503
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,410
A lowly slave,

504
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,260
daring to stand above a guest...

505
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,500
is this how Yan entertains?

506
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,780
She's merely a servant
in the Yan convoy.

507
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,410
Why such anger, Lady Shijiu?

508
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,740
Oh, now I see.

509
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,410
No wonder a mere pearl diver

510
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:59,020
had the nerve
to turn my pearl farm upside down.

511
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
Someone must be helping her
from the outside.

512
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,850
I really don't understand
what you're saying.

513
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,020
First, you used fake gold bullion

514
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,540
to trick my pearl farm

515
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,460
out of priceless pearls.

516
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,370
Then, to destroy the evidence,

517
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,370
you had this wretched slave

518
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,500
set the Pearl Tower ablaze.

519
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,650
Afterward, you calmly absorbed her
into your convoy.

520
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:27,700
Such a clever scheme, Master Yan!

521
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,060
I didn't set the Pearl Tower on fire!

522
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,090
Whether it was you or not,

523
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,610
I know in my heart.

524
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,020
Special Envoy Xu has arrived!

525
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,260
Greetings, Special Envoy Xu.

526
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,850
Special Envoy Xu, this person
is named Duanwu.

527
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,980
She's the one
who burned Cui's Pearl Farm.

528
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,500
Not only did she kill and burn,

529
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,300
but she also fled to escape justice.

530
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,410
I ask Special Envoy Xu to detain her.

531
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,940
Questioning will reveal the truth.

532
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:55,610
She set the pearl farm ablaze?

533
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,130
Yes.

534
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,980
Arson and murder are grave crimes.

535
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,130
If it's true,

536
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,220
we can't take this lightly.

537
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,810
Guards, seize her!

538
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,090
I'll handle the matter personally.

539
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:06,780
Take her away!

540
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,610
Wait.

541
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,570
Senior Brother,

542
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,890
today is the Pearl Poetry Gathering.

543
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,650
Don't make it look like a trial.

544
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,540
But someone, in front of me,

545
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,060
accused her of murder and arson.

546
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,330
If I ignore it,

547
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,220
wouldn't that be defying the court

548
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,850
and abusing my power?

549
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,500
And you still need
to handle it yourself?

550
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,810
Rest assured, Junior Brother.

551
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,980
If there's any injustice,

552
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,020
I'll certainly ensure
she's treated fairly.

553
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,260
As the Special Envoy of Treasures,

554
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,810
questioning the Cui's Pearl Farm case

555
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,060
in front of everyone,

556
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,610
wouldn't it raise concerns

557
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,610
of overstepping your authority?

558
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,980
I think it's best
left to the Hepu officials.

559
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,500
Special Envoy Xu,

560
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,700
as the Special Envoy of Treasures

561
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,980
overseeing all pearl tributes,

562
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,330
the Cui's Pearl Farm
is under your jurisdiction.

563
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,610
Please, make the decision.

564
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,740
Your pearls fall under his authority,

565
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,500
the person does not.

566
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,540
Might I ask what you mean by that?

567
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,130
Junior Brother, you speak rightly.

568
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,260
Now that time allows,

569
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,780
it's best to indulge in elegance.

570
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,700
Regarding today's matter,

571
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,130
I'll leave it to Hepu local authorities
to handle.

572
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,060
Special Envoy Xu, this matter...

573
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,890
Master Shijiu,

574
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,460
the court won't wrong a good person,

575
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,090
nor will it spare a bad one.

576
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,170
Don't let a mere pearl diver

577
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,980
ruin your important affairs.

578
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,810
Yes.

579
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,300
Special Envoy Xu,

580
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,650
the Pearl Poetry Gathering
is about to begin.

581
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,460
This way, please.

582
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,740
Junior Brother,

583
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,890
please.

584
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:42,980
Senior Brother, please.

585
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,650
This way, please.

586
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,980
Much appreciated.

587
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,500
She can't stand the sight of you, right?

588
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,330
Then I'll make sure
she sees plenty of you.

589
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,370
Come with me to the gathering.

590
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,500
Are you alright from earlier?

591
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,410
I'm fine.

592
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,810
Duanwu, are you alright?

593
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,700
You head back first.

594
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,330
The landscapes are breathtaking,

595
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,260
and the talents are refined.

596
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,130
Today, the Yan convoy

597
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,740
warmly welcomes scholars from all over
to gather in Guangzhou,

598
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,030
[Radiant words paint silken scenes,
Depth profound, like pearls' gleams]

599
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:41,610
exchanging ideas through poetry

600
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,020
and celebrating the art.

601
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,700
Your presence, esteemed scholars,

602
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,370
graces the South Sea,

603
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,460
a true joy for all.

604
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,020
Gentlemen in the audience,

605
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,810
feel free to bring your words to life

606
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,220
on paper,

607
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,980
and join this grand event.

608
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:55,980
Everyone,

609
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,540
forgive my humble effort!

610
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,610
I'll go!

611
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,220
Me too!

612
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,330
I'll go!

613
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,020
Now, all scholars,
please compose a poem.

614
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,220
[Composing a poem...]

615
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,670
[Composing a poem...]

616
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,970
Mr. Zhang, we meet again.

617
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,200
What a fateful encounter!

618
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,640
My encounter with Master Yan

619
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,810
might have been planned.

620
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,680
But I do have a question

621
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,970
I'd like to ask you.

622
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,290
After this Pearl Poetry Gathering,

623
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:36,640
let's have a chat.

624
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,120
With Mr. Zhang's invitation,

625
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,360
how could I decline?

626
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,920
With an old friend to meet,

627
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,290
a familiar face to see,

628
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,810
but I arrived a step too late.

629
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:46,810
I might have missed some fun.

630
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,490
Mr. Zhang, you truly
are a charming poet.

631
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,400
Everyone, old and new, seeks
to share their thoughts with you.

632
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,810
But today, with pearls as the theme,

633
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,330
I host this Pearl Poetry Gathering.

634
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,770
I hope Mr. Zhang
will compose a masterpiece

635
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,290
that will be remembered for ages.

636
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,770
I won't disappoint Master Yan.

637
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,490
Mr. Jiang from Yangzhou offers a poem:

638
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,640
"A single star of wisdom lights
eight regions wide,

639
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,770
Five-colored clouds grace
the jade-bright autumn sky.

640
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,570
Surely Heaven pities
the lone scholar's plight,

641
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,770
Yet holds back pure light
from my tower at night."

642
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,570
This is a poem
by Mr. Jiang from Yangzhou.

643
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,400
It's a poem
expressing his unrecognized talent.

644
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
Isn't it a bit outdated?

645
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,290
Indeed!

646
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,160
"I once sought the laurels
of top scholar fame,

647
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,010
To gaze from the heavens
upon Penglai's domain.

648
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,880
Now, having claimed the peak
in life's grand race,

649
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,880
I finally believe
there's a tranquil place."

650
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,600
This is from Mr. Liu from Lianzhou,

651
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,680
It's utterly dull,

652
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,770
nothing special at all!

653
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,400
A merchant hosting a poetry gathering

654
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,920
is like an outsider in the field.

655
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,920
Perhaps they invited the wrong crowd?

656
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,160
"Jade blooms
and gem-like petals both delight,

657
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,880
Who says
spring's hand lacks thoughtful design?

658
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,200
It's not that the East Lord
has no hidden plan,

659
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,200
He opens peach and plum
to grace the land."

660
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,530
This is from Mr. Min from Fengzhou.

661
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:22,290
It's just a filler poem,

662
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,400
hardly worthy of a grand stage.

663
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,050
When will Special Envoy Xu's poem
be read?

664
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,330
Yes, when?

665
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,200
Let us witness
the Special Envoy's grace!

666
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,920
When will it be recited?

667
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,640
Surely, everyone has heard
of Special Envoy Xu.

668
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,770
Today he's here

669
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,160
to exchange poems with us.

670
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,360
"Jade-like purity,
with golden sands aglow,

671
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,570
A fragrant snow descends,
light as night's breath.

672
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,770
If not for treasures
born of this quiet place,

673
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,200
How could it gain a name
known to the world?"

674
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,770
A fine poem indeed!

675
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
Special Envoy Xu's work is unparalleled,

676
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,680
others could only

677
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,360
mimic poorly.

678
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,160
Master Shijiu, you're flattering me.

679
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,440
I've long heard
of Special Envoy Xu's poetic talent,

680
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,840
and seeing it today,

681
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,440
it truly is extraordinary.

682
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,970
Master Yan, you're overpraising me.

683
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,570
Senior Brother, such talent!

684
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,640
Junior Brother, I've also heard
that you have a flair for poetry.

685
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,290
Today, will the scholars of Guangzhou

686
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,360
be fortunate enough
to witness your talent?

687
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,810
Then, I won't hold back.

688
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,120
Today is the Pearl Poetry Gathering,

689
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,490
naturally, the theme is pearls.

690
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
People only see the beauty of pearls,

691
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,880
but they don't know
the pain behind them.

692
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,120
When I first traveled to Hepu,

693
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,330
a pearl diver told me her story.

694
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,200
Behind them
lies a tale of blood and tears,

695
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,570
sorrowful beyond words.

696
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,840
Pearl divers dive deep into the sea,

697
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,530
the icy cold pierces their bones.

698
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,770
They pry open shells for pearls,

699
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,640
and to evade the man-eating sharks,

700
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,770
they leap from the water like mermaids.

701
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,250
I'll title this poem,

702
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,050
"Tears of the Mermaid".

703
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,010
Mr. Zhang, you're a poet.

704
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,570
When you have a moment,

705
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,530
could you write a poem on pearl diving

706
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,770
and let the world know
the hardship of it?

707
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,490
Alright,

708
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,490
I'll put my all into it

709
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,810
to write a worthy poem.

710
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,010
"In the South Sea, the mermaids dwell,

711
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,330
Riding waves through depths so clear.

712
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,640
Their tears turn to pearls that swell,

713
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,360
While the Dragon's Palace
unveils the frost.

714
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,770
The mermaids drift with the tide's flow,

715
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,770
Endlessly bound to toil below..."

716
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,920
I can't do this anymore...

717
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
Get down there!

718
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,290
"At the ocean's floor,
they seek mother shells,

719
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,200
Sacred clams endure
the iron's cold edge.

720
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,920
In the furious sea,
as fierce winds swell,

721
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,400
Their strength wanes
under the burdens they dredge..."

722
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,250
These are my pearls!

723
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,840
I gathered them!

724
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,440
Hurry, go!

725
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,770
Go!

726
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,360
"One tear of a mermaid,
so rare and bright,

727
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:05,200
Is bought with the blood
of countless divers."

728
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,200
A magnificent poem indeed,

729
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,200
grand and vigorous,

730
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,810
full of life and vitality!

731
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,050
This is a true outcry against injustice,

732
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,330
a model for us scholars!

733
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,250
Bravo!

734
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,440
A fine poem!

735
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,490
Bravo!

736
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,880
Bravo!

737
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:36,530
A fine poem!

738
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,090
Bravo!

739
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:39,810
Bravo!

740
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:40,920
A fine poem!

741
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,530
A fine poem!

742
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,810
Bravo!

743
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,600
Bravo!

744
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
It seems the top honor
of this Pearl Poetry Gathering

745
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,970
must go to Mr. Zhang.

746
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,840
Junior Brother,
you're truly a peerless talent.

747
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,810
With this poem,

748
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,050
I must admit, mine pales in comparison.

749
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,090
Senior Brother, you're flattering me.

750
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,360
Actually, those last two lines
weren't mine.

751
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,880
If that's so,

752
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,330
then is Mr. Zhang's title
as top poet undeserved?

753
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,400
People know only the value
of the mermaid's tears,

754
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,050
but they don't realize behind them,

755
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,050
is the blood and flesh
of countless pearl divers.

756
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,640
People only want to witness its beauty,

757
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,010
yet ignore the bloodshed
of the pearl divers.

758
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,600
That pearl diver once told me,

759
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,610
"One tear of a mermaid,
so rare and bright,

760
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,330
Is bought with the
blood of countless lives."

761
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,120
Those last two lines

762
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,050
came from her own lips.

763
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,930
Mr. Zhang, your honesty is unmatched.

764
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,050
This poem, "Tears of the Mermaid",
will surely echo across the land!

765
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,410
Bravo!

766
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,720
Bravo!

767
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,680
Bravo!

768
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,640
Bravo!

769
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,370
Bravo!

770
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,490
Bravo!

771
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,010
A fine poem!

772
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:12,760
A fine poem!

773
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:15,760
Bravo!

774
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,280
Bravo!

775
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,490
A fine poem!

776
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,680
What's the point
of seizing that pearl diver?

777
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,450
Even if she paid with her life,

778
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,410
would it solve our immediate problem?

779
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,200
Do you know that Zhang Jinran
is Prince Ying's sworn brother?

780
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,160
Our words today
will certainly have alerted him.

781
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,890
The situation in Guangzhou
won't stay calm.

782
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,530
Remember from now on,

783
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,050
you must act with caution.

784
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,890
Thank you, Special Envoy Xu,
for the guidance.

785
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,930
But the fire at the pearl farm
must be linked to the Yan family,

786
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,240
proving this could resolve
the Cui family's crisis.

787
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,200
Special Envoy Xu,

788
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,240
please, you must help us...

789
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,160
Expedite matters
concerning the tribute pearls.

790
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,530
You traveled such a long way

791
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,680
just to see me, didn't you?

792
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,240
Master Yan, you really know how to joke.

793
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,930
You're no refined lady,

794
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,280
so who's trying to court you?

795
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,970
But Duanwu is clever and resilient,

796
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,760
yet she's suffered quite a bit.

797
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,600
She doesn't know the dangers outside,

798
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,890
and she's still inexperienced.

799
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:31,970
So, I hope you'll treat her well.

800
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,760
There are so many suffering people
in this world.

801
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,530
Can you care for them all?

802
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,120
Duanwu is a servant on my ship,

803
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,200
no need for you to worry about her.

804
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,720
Our acquaintance

805
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,090
is all because of pearls.

806
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,600
You bought out all of Cui's pearls
in one go,

807
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,760
quite a big move.

808
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,490
But you do realize tribute pearls
can't be traded privately?

809
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,720
Whether they're tribute pearls
is Cui's business.

810
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,240
I'm just a merchant.

811
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,280
I only know that payment is settled,

812
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,890
and we owe each other nothing.

813
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,370
Why get involved in all this trouble?

814
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,090
Well, naturally, it's profitable.

815
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,160
Nothing more?

816
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,010
But I did hear a tale:

817
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,720
The Pearl Tower was originally built
not by the Cui family,

818
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,280
but by the Yan family.

819
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,200
I've heard a bit of that too.

820
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,720
I heard that the Yan family of Yangzhou
was wiped out,

821
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,760
no one survived.

822
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,450
Where were you
when the Pearl Tower was set ablaze?

823
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,010
On my merchant ship,

824
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,320
heading to Guangzhou.

825
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,450
And when you arrived in Guangzhou,

826
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:45,970
Cui Ding ended up dead by the sea.

827
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:46,720
Why?

828
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,970
He deserved it.

829
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,050
His evil knew no bounds.

830
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,090
Before Cui Ding died,
he was clearly beaten,

831
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,410
and his death was brutal.

832
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,720
He was a vicious criminal,

833
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,200
unworthy of sympathy.

834
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,240
But someone told me

835
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,200
Cui Ding boarded your ship.

836
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,800
Now that's peculiar.

837
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,970
Cui Shijiu put out a bounty.

838
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,720
If someone saw him,

839
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,280
why not claim the reward?

840
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,240
The Mirage
was originally a Hepu merchant ship.

841
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,530
After Cui Ding boarded,

842
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,600
it flew your Yan family's flag.

843
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,680
I find this quite puzzling.

844
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,720
My surname is Yan.

845
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,050
Look at me, I forgot about that.

846
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:37,600
So.

847
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,410
I actually ran
into an old acquaintance that day.

848
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,600
She can confirm for me.

849
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:45,050
Kang Ju.

850
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,410
Duanwu,

851
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,450
let me ask you,

852
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,800
the day after the Pearl Tower burned,

853
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,160
did you board my merchant ship?

854
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,370
Yes.

855
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,530
And were you with me?

856
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,010
Yes.

857
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:15,160
And did you...

858
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,640
see Cui Ding?

859
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,640
I'm asking you to tell Mr. Zhang,

860
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,450
on that day, were you with me?

861
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,120
And did you see Cui Ding?

862
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,720
No, I did not see Cui Ding.

863
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,370
Duanwu.

864
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:14,530
Duanwu,

865
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,680
do you realize aiding a murderer

866
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,370
is a serious crime?

867
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,010
Master Yan,

868
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,600
some things you should know yourself.

869
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,970
No proof is needed.

870
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:33,570
The Cui's Pearl Farm

871
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,570
has shorted the annual tribute pearls
to the court,

872
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,570
and now, these pearls
are in your possession.

873
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:40,720
You can't possibly claim innocence.

874
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,800
I'll be keeping a close watch on you.

875
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:14,930
What's the matter?

876
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,450
Regretting it?

877
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,680
Regretting you didn't leave
with Mr. Zhang?

878
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,640
After all, he's the son
of the Minister of Personnel.

879
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,570
Even if you became his concubine,

880
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,050
I believe you'd live a life

881
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,680
of luxury and wealth.

882
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,240
What is it?

883
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,050
Is it because
of the blood-stained pearls

884
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,410
or something else?

885
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,050
Just now, I lied for you,

886
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,160
clearing your suspicion.

887
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,930
What reward do you have for me?

888
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,720
You did give false testimony for me,

889
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,160
but as for Mr. Zhang,

890
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,490
he no longer trusts you.

891
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,200
He won't listen to you anymore.

892
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,090
Before you bargain with me,

893
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,120
consider carefully

894
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,600
what value you hold,

895
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,530
and what leverage you have.

896
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,680
I have no leverage.

897
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,890
I'm merely a slave.
