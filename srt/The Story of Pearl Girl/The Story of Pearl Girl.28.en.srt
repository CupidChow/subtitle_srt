00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,940
[Episode 28]

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,150
Let's see who's pretending to be a ghost here.

13
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,900
Lady Xue. Lady Yan.

14
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,720
What are you doing here so late?

15
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,910
You scared us.

16
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,560
We thought it was Lady Huan's ghost.

17
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,910
We cleared Lady Huan's name.

18
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,120
She has gone to heaven.

19
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,960
She wouldn't come back and scare us.

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,910
Lady Bai.

21
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,590
If you want to apologize, do it during the day.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,430
I wanted to come here during the day.

23
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,240
But...

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,670
But I heard that the Huan family wants to take this place back.

25
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,230
And they will make trouble at Clear Mind tomorrow.

26
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:42,760
I thought it would be too late tomorrow.

27
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,000
So, I came to worship her tonight.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,070
Wait. They...

29
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,600
How dare they.

30
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,350
The Huan family dares to do anything.

31
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,630
Mr. Huan is an evil man.

32
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,630
They are despised in the jewelry guild.

33
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,440
They want to get every cash they can get.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,830
Zheng Wu is a shareholder of Clear Mind.

35
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,200
Isn't the Huan family afraid of the Zheng family?

36
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,000
Zheng Si is dead.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,630
Su Muzhe and Clear Mind

38
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,920
are the Zheng family's worst enemies.

39
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,110
Don't be fooled by her.

40
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,070
Let's pay our respects to Lady Huan.

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,550
Go away.

42
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,720
Go away.

43
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,670
Drop the act.

44
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,380
Lady Huan, we are here to see you.

45
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,440
Su Muzhe offended the Zheng family.

46
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,920
Clear Mind cannot establish a foothold in Yangzhou,

47
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,280
let alone do business.

48
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,480
No.

49
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,440
We have to leave.

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,630
Are you crazy? Is that what Lady Huan wants?

51
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,950
Lady Huan was loyal and kind.

52
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,720
She'll understand us.

53
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,440
Think about it.

54
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,310
What should we do if Clear Mind is closed?

55
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,520
We'll lose all those years of savings.

56
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,550
We'll disappoint our fellows.

57
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,190
Wine is not good for your health.

58
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,870
Stop drinking.

59
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,960
Look at my injuries.

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,640
You've lost your reputation.

61
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,400
No one will come to my Baicaojing House.

62
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,350
Su Muzhe. Yan Zijing.

63
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,670
I won't let them go.

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,870
Let's wait for the show tomorrow.

65
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,990
Do you like this mother-of-pearl hairpin?

66
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,160
The design is exquisite.

67
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,230
Can I try it on?

68
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:35,870
Okay.

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,280
Is it beautiful?

70
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,040
Yeah.

71
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,340
How about it?

72
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,920
It's beautiful.

73
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,160
Okay, keep it for me.

74
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,750
Do you have any other recommendations?

75
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,520
Look at these mother-of-pearl earrings.

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,640
They go well with this hairpin.

77
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,230
Any other recommendations?

78
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,230
Look at this one.

79
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,230
Or this one.

80
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,310
Let me see.

81
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,110
It's nice.

82
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
What can I do for you?

83
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,310
It's okay. We're looking around.

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,230
What do you want?

85
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,430
We're here to shop, too.

86
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
Gentlemen.

87
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,110
This lady took a fancy to this hairpin first.

88
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,870
Why don't you look at other hairpins?

89
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,040
Can't I take a fancy to it?

90
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,280
First come, first served.

91
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:19,920
Yeah.

92
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,280
First come, first served?

93
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,750
Since you like it,

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,520
here you go.

95
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,840
It fell.

96
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
What do you want?

97
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,350
Back off.

98
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,230
Miss.

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
What are you looking at?

100
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,160
Let me look at you.

101
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,840
Get away.

102
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,920
Let me look at you.

103
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,720
What do you want to do?

104
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,870
She stopped us.

105
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,110
She's bold.

106
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:44,400
I'll go to the officer.

107
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,600
I am an officer.

108

Come on.

Let go.

111

- Let go. - Let go.

[Clear Mind]
Who are you?

117

Go.

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,350
Take care.

119
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,990
Get out of here.

120
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,670
Look. Clear Mind's people hit me.

121
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,480
Clear Mind's people hit me.

122
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,750
- They hit me. - That's not true.

123
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,920
Nonsense. That's not true.

124
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,160
That's not true.

125
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,600
They bullied us.

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,280
Get out of here.

127
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,230
Shame on you.

128
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,820
It's a gangster shop.

129
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,250
They hit people in front of their shop.

130
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,540
Mr. Huan.

131
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,960
Stop hiding.

132
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,480
Come out and talk to us.

133
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,920
Why did you, Clear Mind,

134
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,040
take Lady Huan's property?

135
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,840
Ladies and gentlemen, Lady Huan is my daughter.

136
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,430
Now, she's dead.

137
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,920
But Clear Mind

138
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,110
hogs her shares.

139
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,280
Nonsense!

140
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,840
Is it legal?

141
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,790
What do they want?

142
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,960
They went too far.

143
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,350
Ladies and gentlemen, please listen to me.

144
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,380
Lady Huan disowned the Huan family

145
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,480
at the Qionghua Festival.

146
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,430
Everyone in Yangzhou knows about it.

147
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,920
How could he come and ask for Lady Huan's shares?

148
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,550
Lady Huan is my daughter.

149
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,430
It's a fact.

150
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,840
Yeah. That's true.

151
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,550
He's shameless.

152
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,600
You want to snatch Lady Huan's shares.

153
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,870
If you don't give me

154
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,790
Lady Huan's shares,

155
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,870
I'll kill myself here.

156
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,400
Stop messing around.

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Get up.

158
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,160
That's not what this is.

159
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,840
Clear Mind, give back his shares.

160
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,870
That's not what this is.

161
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
The Huan family is shameless.

162
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,520
Get up.

163
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,550
The Huan family is used by the Zheng family.

164
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,340
They're snobs.

165
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,120
Get up.

166
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,190
Should we do something?

167
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,880
The Zheng family will pay for it.

168
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,580
- Ms. Su. - Duanwu.

169
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,790
Mr. Huan, do you miss your daughter?

170
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,710
I'll send you to your daughter.

171
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Ms. Su is tough.

172
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,310
She took an axe.

173
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,310
They are tough.

174
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,950
Do you have the cheek to see Lady Huan?

175
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,120
Mr. Huan cheated Lady Huan

176
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,070
out of all her money

177
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,470
and kicked her when she was down.

178
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,670
Lady Huan disowned you a long time ago.

179
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,360
What qualifications do you have to come to Clear Mind for her shares?

180
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,120
I told you.

181
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,790
The Huan family's shop has long run out of business.

182
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,120
Lady Huan was unlucky

183
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,950
to have you as a father.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,280
But I'm not Lady Huan.

185
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,880
I won't put up with you.

186
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,950
I'm telling you.

187
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,950
Clear Mind is not afraid

188
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,590
of anything the Huan family do.

189
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,950
Whatever you want.

190
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,950
Everyone here

191
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,000
is sensible.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,400
Clear Mind didn't do anything wrong.

193
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,760
Lady Huan didn't do anything wrong.

194
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,430
Are you still going to stay here?

195
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,160
Get out of here, liar.

196
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,900
Mr. Huan is shameless.

197
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,360
The Huan family's shop is finished.

198
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,950
All right. I won't argue with you.

199
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,520
I'll take the money back.

200
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,240
Wait.

201
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,950
I'll take it back. We'll see.

202
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,400
Mr. Zheng, Clear Mind is in trouble.

203
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,950
Should we help them?

204
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:32,430
If this were the past,

205
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,470
Clear Mind could make me money.

206
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
But Zheng Si died because of her.

207
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,040
I have to avoid it.

208
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,670
She's so wild.

209
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,120
She should go through this.

210
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,640
Let's see what happens.

211
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,710
Ladies and gentlemen,

212
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,550
A lot has happened to Clear Mind lately.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm sorry

214
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,920
for the trouble.

215
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,310
If you want

216
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,830
to buy Clear Mind's jewelry,

217
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,310
I welcome you.

218
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,880
I'll give you a discount today.

219
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,670
We'll give you a discount.

220
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,550
Yeah.

221
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,280
We'll give you a discount.

222
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,880
Go in and have a look.

223
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,470
Have a look.

224
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,070
Miss.

225
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,640
Go in and have a look.

226
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,360
Thank you. Maybe next time.

227
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,670
- Sir, go in and have a look. - No.

228
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,880
The jewelry is beautiful. Have a look.

229
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,760
- Have a look. - Sir, we have new jewelry.

230
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,040
No, thanks.

231
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,280
Miss, would you like to go in and have a look?

232
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,000
Maybe next time.

233
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,360
- Go in and have a look. - Miss.

234
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,830
Go in and have a look.

235
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,250
Miss, go in and have a look.

236
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,770
Our jewelry is beautiful.

237
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,000
- Go in and have a look. - Go in and have a look.

238
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,920
Please go in.

239
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,640
- Ms. Su. - Miss.

240
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,790
Go in and have a look.

241
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,360
Miss.

242
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,640
Miss.

243
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:41,760
Have a look.

244
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,830
Go in and have a look.

245
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,550
Miss.

246
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,310
-We have new jewelry. -We have new jewelry.

247
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,310
Go in and have a look.

248
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:49,360
Let's talk inside.

249
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,040
Miss.

250
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,160
I'll be blunt.

251
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,590
Ms. Su.

252
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,160
What's going on?

253
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,430
We saw it.

254
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,160
There's always someone coming here to make trouble.

255
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,790
If it goes on like this,

256
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,070
we can't do business anymore.

257
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,360
It's our hard-earned money.

258
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,430
Lady Huan just died.

259
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,070
Give me some days to figure it out.

260
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,470
The Huan family insisted on getting Lady Huan's share.

261
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,830
What else can you do

262
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,310
but give him money?

263
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,240
- But just now... - Ms. Su.

264
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,190
We put all our money

265
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,920
into Clear Mind

266
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,520
because of Lady Huan.

267
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,000
Now, Lady Huan is dead.

268
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,040
Although we have found out the murderer,

269
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,710
we have a lot going on here.

270
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,950
Ms. Su.

271
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,520
We want the money we invested back.

272
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,000
Lady Yan...

273
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,120
Yingtao.

274
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,640
You're here to withdraw your shares.

275
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,310
You're here to withdraw your shares?

276
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,280
Do you think Clear Mind can't be sustained,

277
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,670
and I can't pay you back?

278
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,070
Miss, how can you do this?

279
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,790
Ms. Su is nice to us.

280
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,670
She gives us a lot of dividends every month.

281
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,280
Duanwu won't do that to you.

282
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,550
Please rest assured.

283
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,280
Lady Xue.

284
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,400
Yingtao.

285
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,760
Do you know who she offended?

286
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,430
Reasonably,

287
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,790
we shouldn't give you a hard time

288
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,950
as Lady Huan just died.

289
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,190
We want to have income

290
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,880
after retirement.

291
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,550
So we don't need to worry about making a living.

292
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,760
But Ms. Su...

293
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,470
The person you offended

294
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,240
is too powerful.

295
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,550
We're just songstresses.

296
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,550
We worry about our lives.

297
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,430
We can't afford to lose this money.

298
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,760
What if we don't get dividends?

299
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,590
What if we lose our lives for it?

300
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,000
I understand your situation.

301
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,310
I also understand the situation of Clear Mind.

302
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,430
But I don't understand

303
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
why you think that I would treat you badly.

304
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,670
We're lucky to know each other.

305
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,470
How about this?

306
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,550
We'll give you ten days.

307
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,430
Please give us a reply

308
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,790
within ten days.

309
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,710
Lady Yan.

310
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,670
Lady Yan.

311
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,070
Lady Yan.

312
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,760
We can't get the money

313
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,360
in ten days.

314
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,120
Miss.

315
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,160
- Please don't do this. - Lady Xue.

316
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Ms. Su.

317
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,310
You are a good girl.

318
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,670
I'm sorry

319
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,240
for this.

320
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,710
Lady Xue.

321
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,430
Come with me.

322
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,070
I'm not leaving.

323
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,950
It's not easy for Ms. Su

324
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,550
to run Clear Mind on her own.

325
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,590
I can't leave.

326
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,280
It's up to you.

327
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,920
Duanwu.

328
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,470
It's okay.

329
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,950
Let's close the shop first.

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,430
Mr. Zheng, what do you

331
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
want to see me about?

332
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm here to buy rubies.

333
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,920
Master Yan, name your price.

334
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,430
Kang Ju, bring all the rubies.

335
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,950
Here.

336
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,120
Here are all the rubies in Yangzhou.

337
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,760
They come in different sizes and grades.

338
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,280
But I don't sell them in retail.

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,880
It's

340
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,190
eighty million mace in total.

341
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,590
Master Yan...

342
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,190
Won't you reconsider?

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,120
No, I won't.

344
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,190
All right. The Zheng family will take them all.

345
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,230
Someone will come and trade later.

346
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,990
I will repay you later.

347
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,190
Excuse me.

348
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,600
Not too bad.

349
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,920
Not too bad.

350
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,710
Yingtao, are you okay?

351
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,840
Yingtao, talk to me.

352
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,360
I went out for something.

353
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,080
Please talk to me.

354
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,360
Where did you go?

355
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,160
My cousin

356
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,710
lost a cockfight today.

357
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,360
The other party cheated.

358
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,710
He called me over to help him.

359
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,430
I had a fight with them.

360
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,270
I fought against ten people.

361
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,360
There was an accident at the Clear Mind. But you fought.

362
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,320
What did you promise me?

363
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,840
What did you promise Ms. Su?

364
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
I swear

365
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,750
I'll never go out again.

366
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,750
Do you mean it?

367
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,400
Yes.

368
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
There was an incident at the Clear Mind.

369
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,990
Ms. Su took an axe.

370
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,230
But you were not there.

371
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,080
What if something had happened to Clear Mind?

372
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,030
What if something had happened to Ms. Su?

373
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,510
Don't say that, Yingtao.

374
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,800
I will guard Clear Mind.

375
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,360
I won't let it happen again.

376
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,430
Do you promise?

377
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,080
I promise you

378
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
it won't happen again.

379
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,640
Duanwu.

380
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,920
Duanwu.

381
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,270
You didn't sleep all night again.

382
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,710
Duanwu, I just came back from the Jade Ward.

383
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,920
They're having a jade competition tomorrow.

384
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,400
If I win, not only do I get money,

385
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,430
but I get publicity for Clear Mind.

386
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,950
I want to have a try.

387
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,430
Okay.

388
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,230
I'll go with you.

389
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,230
Duanwu.

390
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,030
I can do it myself.

391
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,470
Shiqi.

392
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,430
Am I useless?

393
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,270
Don't be so stressed.

394
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,840
I've always been there for you.

395
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,160
Get some rest.

396
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,640
It's of medium quality.

397
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,840
This one is good.

398
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,990
Its color is great.

399
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,640
It's a pity that it has a flaw.

400
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,160
Its flaw is on the surface.

401
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,840
Is there a flaw on the inside?

402
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,750
It's hard to tell.

403
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,880
Sir, can I have a look?

404
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,710
Who are you?

405
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,600
Yue Yunxiu, Master Artisan of Clear Mind.

406
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,400
Did you hear it?

407
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,990
Mr. Huan went to Su Muzhe and asked her for money.

408
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,270
Clear Mind is going out of business.

409
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,800
Of course, they are idle.

410
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,800
Yeah.

411
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,120
Miss.

412
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,950
You've been watching and touching it for a while.

413
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:59,270
Did you get anything?

414
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,030
Miss, what's your idea?

415
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,320
This jade is delicate in texture.

416
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,030
It can be made into a lotus crown.

417
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:07,160
Make the flaw into stamens and pistils.

418
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,920
It's a large piece of jade.

419
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,710
Who would wear such a heavy crown?

420
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,920
Hollow it

421
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,710
to make the carcass as thin as paper.

422
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,030
Then, polish it

423
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,400
to make it crystal clear.

424
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,320
The eggshell technique is difficult.

425
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,400
There should be no dead ends inside,

426
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,710
and the outside should be evenly thick.

427
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,950
You'll need ten of these materials

428
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,990
to make a round vessel,

429
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,950
not to mention this material.

430
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,190
You have to be careful every time you carve.

431
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,320
Not to mention, you want to make it into a lotus crown.

432
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,190
I can give it a try.

433
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,080
Do you really know how to carve jade?

434
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,510
I have been carving jade since I was a kid.

435
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,030
I cherish jade.

436
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,840
I'm sure I can make it.

437
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,160
Boss, you are so brave.

438
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
I can't believe you let her try.

439
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,990
Aren't you afraid that he will waste this piece of nice jade?

440
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,710
Yeah.

441
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,270
You don't know her.

442
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,990
You're being silly.

443
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,470
As long as Shiqi has jade in her hands,

444
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,710
she seems

445
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,800
to have no other thoughts.

446
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,470
That's what

447
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,080
makes her who she is.

448
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,470
We must stay in Yangzhou.

449
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,190
I'm waiting for you here

450
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,270
to tell you

451
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,160
that I will stay

452
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,670
in Yangzhou.

453
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:41,360
If you lose once,

454
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,400
you'll lose everything.

455
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,430
I've had nothing for a long time.

456
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,030
Lady Huan made Clear Mind famous

457
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,920
at the Qionghua Festival.

458
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,320
Since I'll open a shop,

459
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,430
I'll open it in a popular place.

460
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,880
Clear Mind is where it is today

461
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,270
because I thought too much

462
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,320
and rushed.

463
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,840
Osmanthus cake.

464
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,640
[Zhenlang Pavilion]
Sweet and tender osmanthus cake.

465
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,320
Have a look.

466
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,840
Osmanthus cake.

467
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,670
Sweet and tender osmanthus cake.

468
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,750
Is the Tanghulu delicious?

469
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,750
Yes.

470
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,880
Father.

471
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,400
I don't like it. You eat it.

472
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,560
You're good. I'll make you something delicious.

473
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,950
Osmanthus cake.

474
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,430
Osmanthus cake.

475
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,990
Sweet and tender osmanthus cake.

476
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,430
Have a look.

477
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,510
A merchant

478
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,840
is unrestrained and free.

479
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,270
Duanwu.

480
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,120
What do we

481
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,360
name our shop?

482
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,400
May my heart be as bright as the moon.

483
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,750
So I can see through people.

484
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,800
Clear Mind.

485
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
Ladies.

486
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,360
Don't you have any jewelry you like?

487
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,160
It's a big shop.

488
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,270
But there are very few things.

489
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,470
It's shabby.

490
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,080
This shop is about to close.

491
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,470
I wanted my heart to be as bright as the moon.

492
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,880
I wanted to see through people.

493
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,230
But I didn't see through myself.

494
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,430
I was so eager to prove myself.

495
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,430
I'm running out of money.

496
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,120
My jewelry is normal.

497
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,360
Clear Mind

498
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,270
can't stand the twists and turns now.

499
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,400
Duanwu.

500
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,920
Everything will be fine.

501
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,230
You've been looking at the files all night.

502
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,120
And you met so many people.

503
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,030
It's late.

504
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,230
Rest early.

505
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,950
There's something wrong with Zheng Zhixing's confession.

506
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,600
He put all the blame

507
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,270
on the Cui family.

508
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,560
We asked the servants

509
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,120
of the Cui family.

510
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,190
They all said that the Cui family was out of money.

511
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,030
If the Cui family had the Black Dragon Bandits' stolen goods,

512
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,120
Cui Jingchu would have taken a risk and sold them.

513
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,120
He wouldn't have mortgaged Zhenlang Pavilion to Yan Zijing

514
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,230
because of financial problems.

515
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,560
It was not the Cui family

516
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,670
who sold the Black Dragon Bandits' stolen goods.

517
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,320
It was the Zheng family.

518
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,270
Prince Ying told you

519
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,320
not to investigate this case.

520
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,710
Xu Nanying

521
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,990
was Prince Tan's faithful servant.

522
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,640
He returned to Chang'an with sin.

523
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,670
Then, he became

524
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,230
the official of the Yangzhou Governor's Office.

525
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,360
It's the most important position in the southeast.

526
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,360
He had nothing to do with the Zheng family.

527
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,990
But he spoke for them

528
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,990
at the interrogation.

529
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,160
We can't deal with Prince Ying.

530
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,560
And you are sworn brothers.

531
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,600
If this is what you think it is,

532
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,120
what should you do?

533
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,160
Looks like Clear Mind is going to close.

534
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,750
It's useless to pray to the Bodhisattva.

535
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,160
A Bodhisattva will not bless a wicked person.

536
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,510
You'd better

537
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,360
stay away from Wu.

538
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
Don't approach him.

539
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,160
About Si's matter,

540
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,430
my master didn't deal with you on the spot.

541
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,990
We were kind to you.

542
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,670
How can Wu be entangled with you?

543
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,560
You're smart.

544
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,270
You should know what to do.

545
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,400
Su Muzhe, are you dumb?

546
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,920
My lady is talking to you.

547
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,360
I'm here to mourn Lady Huan.

548
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,990
Lady Yu.

549
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,600
You'd better show some respect.

550
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,600
She was just a songstress.

551
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
You forgot

552
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,570
you used to be a songstress.

553
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,230
Su Muzhe.

554
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,510
Zheng Si

555
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,160
deserved

556
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,920
to die.

557
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,990
Lady Yu, you're happy.

558
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,800
Why did you pretend to be kind in front of the Bodhisattva?

559
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,600
Lady.

560
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,750
You've been away

561
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,950
for over a year.

562
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,160
Thank you for caring about me.

563
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,510
Here's some tea.

564
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:29,430
Drink it.

565
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,320
Thank you.

566
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Jinran, I had to do this.

567
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,190
I collected all the calligraphy, paintings,

568
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,080
and books in the room.

569
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,120
I'll give them to you.

570
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,320
Please forgive me.

571
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,430
Ms. Su.

572
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,750
Duanwu.

573
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,230
Come here.

574
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,840
Mr. Zhang, what are you doing here?

575
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,430
Have a seat.

576
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,030
I'm here

577
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,230
to listen to the bells and smell the incense.

578
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,560
It calms me.

579
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,600
What are you doing here?

580
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,640
I'm here to light incense for Lady Huan.

581
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,470
It's good to calm down.

582
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,880
Are you upset about Clear Mind?

583
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,470
How do you know that?

584
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,360
Did something happen

585
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,030
to Clear Mind?

586
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,600
Clear Mind has no foundation.

587
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,360
I don't know

588
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,670
what to do

589
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,360
to help Clear Mind to gain a foothold in Yangzhou.

590
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,400
Clear Mind

591
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,230
can't slowly accumulate resources

592
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,190
like other shops.

593
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,170
You can't expect

594
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,940
other jewelry shops to help you.

595
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,470
You should stay true to your original mission.

596
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,230
You should do the simplest thing.

597
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,080
Think about it.

598
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,670
What do you want to do most

599
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,120
for all this time?

600
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,840
What do I want to do most?

601
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,400
Do you have an idea?

602
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,230
Mr. Zhang.

603
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,880
Are you here to seek your original mission?

604
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,190
From investigating cases in Hepu

605
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,470
to now,

606
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,950
things are connected.

607
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,880
The case is getting clearer.

608
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,400
But I'm scared now.

609
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,240
Yan Zijing once asked me,

610
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,550
"If you find out the truth,

611
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,580
will you be able

612
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,880
to remain the same?"

613
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,070
I told him

614
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,720
that I would be fair

615
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,430
no matter what.

616
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,200
But now I'm in a dilemma.

617
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,630
Sometimes

618
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,920
I think about relationships,

619
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,030
and I can't do anything.

620
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,680
Mr. Zhang,

621
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,920
you seem

622
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,550
to be hesitating.

623
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,280
But it seems to me

624
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,990
that you have made your decision.

625
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,800
You went from Hepu to Hexi.

626
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,470
You went from Chang'an to Yangzhou.

627
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,840
You already have the answer.

628
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,720
Yes.

629
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,110
Thank you, Duanwu.

630
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,400
I have to go.

631
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,070
In Hepu,

632
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,030
you told me

633
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,070
that you want to be a free peddler.

634
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,550
Now, you opened Clear Mind in Yangzhou

635
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,990
and became Ms. Su.

636
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,840
I'm happy for you.

637
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,110
You are Su Muzhe in the eyes of others.

638
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,880
But I understand

639
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:55,470
how much Duanwu has suffered

640
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,680
along the way.

641
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,880
You must be tired.

642
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:07,280
I want to say that no matter what happens,

643
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,550
I'm there for you.

644
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,800
I can protect you.

645
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,470
I don't want to tie you down.

646
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,990
If you don't mind,

647
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,840
from today on,

648
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,990
you can think of me as your brother.

649
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,760
Father.

650
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:59,280
Although we made the Red Leaf Crown in time,

651
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,590
Yan Zijing asked

652
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,320
for 80 million mace.

653
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,070
Deliver the Red Leaf Crown to Chang'an in time.

654
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,510
We'll talk about it after that.

655
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,590
Yes.

656
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,880
Father, Yan Zijing is pressing us hard.

657
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,720
Is he really a remnant of the Yan family?

658
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,080
What was

659
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,320
the Yan's case about?

660
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,630
Father.

661
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,760
Zhang Jinran is investigating this old case.

662
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,680
I'm the only one in the Zheng family who can help you.

663
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,400
Why don't you tell me about it?

664
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,470
So I can be prepared

665
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,950
to deal with it later.

666
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,990
Where should I start?

667
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,990
The Yan family came from the West.

668
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,880
They have a lot of money and countless jewels.

669
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,590
They fought against local jewelry merchants.

670
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,680
The Yangzhou Jewelry Guild lost.

671
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,680
The Yan family became

672
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,920
the guild lead.

673
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,760
They were targeted by two nobles in the capital

674
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,760
for flaunting their wealth.

675
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,550
Since they were nobles in the capital,

676
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,840
it should have been easy for them to deal with the Yan family.

677
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,990
They didn't want to do it themselves.

678
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,760
The Yan family escorted Kang to present tributes.

679
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,880
The Cui family and the Zheng jointly hired the Black Dragon Bandits.

680
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,920
They almost wiped out the Yan family.

681
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,590
But they deliberately let the mission escape.

682
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,990
And they replaced

683
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,990
the tribute pearl.

684
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,070
The tribute pearl shattered in front of the Emperor.

685
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,280
The Kang's mission was expelled.

686
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,240
It is said that they were killed on their way back.

687
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,590
The Yan family, who was slaughtered by the Black Dragon Bandits,

688
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:07,200
was convicted

689
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,680
by the Imperial Court.

690
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,950
Their jewelry was confiscated. Their property was auctioned.

691
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,950
The property was given to the two nobles.

692
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,760
Then, the Cui family and the Zheng family divided the rest.

693
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:24,070
The Cui family and the Zheng family were partners.

694
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,470
But the Cui family

695
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,070
went the wrong way.

696
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,070
That's why they ended up where they are today.

697
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,680
Wu.

698
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,800
About Si's death,

699
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,680
you may think I'm cruel.

700
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,920
But the Zheng family can't afford

701
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,720
to make any mistakes.

702
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,880
I understand.

703
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,950
If he's a remnant of the Yan family,

704
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,200
we'll kill him.

705
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,280
Don't act rashly.

706
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,920
It's not easy to kill a man.

707
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,880
Don't forget Si.

708
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,680
Test him first.

709
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,360
Test him?

710
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:26,240
Test him with the Black Dragon Bandits.

711
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,400
Gaoshou, Yingtao.

712
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,280
I can't lose Clear Mind.

713
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,920
I have a favor to ask you.

714
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,240
Jewelry guild is working together to suppress our Clear Mind,

715
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,630
and cut off all our supplies.

716
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,680
If we want to get out of their grip,

717
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,800
we have to buy supplies from other cities.

718
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,990
So you have to go to Guangzhou.

719
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,360
I have a friend in Guangzhou.

720
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,550
I want to transfer goods from her.

721
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,760
We have glass.

722
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,430
But we don't have gold and raw stones.

723
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,240
We can't make jewelry.

724
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:08,760
It's important

725
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,840
to get gold and raw stones.

726
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,630
Here's all the money Clear Mind has left.

It's an IOU.
