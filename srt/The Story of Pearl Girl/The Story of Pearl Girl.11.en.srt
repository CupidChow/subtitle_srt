[The Story of Pearl Girl]

11
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,940
[Episode 11]

12
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,280
Mr. Zhang, you really have a warm heart.

13
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,390
You always personally escort
my convoy's assistant back.

14
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,870
So, I've prepared fine wine

15
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,110
to celebrate your brush with death.

16
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,360
Truly fine wine!

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,680
If I'm not mistaken,

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,040
it must be the famous
Yangzhou Qionghua Dew.

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,640
You're truly worthy
of an imperial scholar.

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,680
Your wine appreciation is impeccable.

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,510
As they say, "a pot of wine,
a legacy of timeless elegance."

22
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,750
Mr. Zhang, you
are indeed well-read and talented.

23
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,070
I don't deserve such praise.

24
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,320
No matter how knowledgeable,

25
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,880
in Master Yan's eyes,

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,560
I'm just another chess piece.

27
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,750
I never intended
to draw you into this game.

28
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,110
You walked into it yourself.

29
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,960
And on the ship at Hepu,

30
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,470
it was you who used tribute pearls
to lure me.

31
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,470
I never expected

32
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
I'd be countered by Master Yan's trick.

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,350
But you got something too,

34
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,830
the priceless Mermaid's Tear.

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,990
And perhaps the greatest gain

36
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,140
is meeting Duanwu, who was then

37
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,800
a pearl hostess.

38
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,960
You gave me the Cui family's ledger,
didn't you?

39
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,110
I'm not that generous.

40
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,110
But all this was part of your plan.

41
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,110
Ever since Cui's tribute pearls
were destroyed,

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,630
you've used poetry to gain fame,

43
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,160
then forced Cui Shijiu
to hunt treasure with you.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,260
Then, using the Feng family's hand,

45
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,830
you bought all the pearls in Guangzhou.

46
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,540
After that, you used South Sea merchants

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,350
to drain Cui Shijiu's wealth.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,990
Right here,

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,040
you and Accountant Wei staged
a fake death.

50
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,750
Now the Cui family's fortune is gone,

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,960
lacking the means to recover.

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,910
Mr. Zhang, you're truly insightful.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,070
Observing the details,

54
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,750
and calculating everything precisely.

55
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,350
Not as much as you,

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,750
useing any means necessary,

57
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,280
leaving no stone unturned.

58
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,590
All of this didn't need me.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,400
Why did you involve me?

60
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,680
Since you didn't want
to be someone else's weapon,

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,120
you must have your own motives

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,520
in this game.

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Why seek the ruin of the Cui family?

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Does the Cui family not deserve it?

65
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,800
Do you hold a grudge against them?

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,390
An irreconcilable one.

67
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,430
I told you before,

68
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,430
in business, it's like a battlefield.

69
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,920
It's either you or me.

70
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,750
Of course, it's a grudge to the death.

71
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,120
I've secretly sent Cui's ledger
to Chang'an.

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,480
Cui's downfall is inevitable.

73
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,000
Does this fulfill

74
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,240
your wish?

75
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,630
I've just entered Tang,

76
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,830
my grand ambitions yet to unfold.

77
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,310
How can my wish be fulfilled?

78
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,750
What else do you plan to do?

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,270
Are you concerned for me?

80
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,120
I have been acting on a whim.

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,630
I do whatever I want.

82
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,430
For now, I haven't decided.

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,120
Fine.

84
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,950
Then tell me,

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,560
where are you planning to go next?

86
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,270
Are you worried about me again?

87
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,800
Not worried about me,

88
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
just someone else.

89
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,720
Yan Zijing, let me warn you,

90
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,920
don't involve her in your revenge.

91
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,070
All of this is her own choice.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,800
Since we're parting today,

93
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,070
let me give you a gift.

94
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,950
Before the Yan's Trading Convoy
was seized for auction,

95
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,510
a man named Yue approached Cui Shijiu.

96
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,870
Since then, the Cui family has given him
ten taels of pearls annually.

97
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,800
Are you saying
the tribute pearl case has more to it?

98
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,720
I'll say no more.

99
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,600
The rest is up to you to investigate.

100
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,020
[Yu Shi]

101
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,070
Yu Shi?

102
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,310
Why would Mother keep his belongings?

103
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,570
Could he be my father?

104
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,930
Has the Zheng family in Yangzhou heard
about affairs in Guangzhou?

105
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,190
Yes, they have.

106
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
Fifth Master Zheng Zhiheng
from the Zheng family has already set out.

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,830
United by profit, separated by profit.

108
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,560
Back then, the Zheng
and Cui families conspired

109
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,680
against my Yan family for gain.

110
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,340
Now, once again for profit,

111
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,070
they're at each other's throats.

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,160
It's fitting.

113
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,870
Let the Zheng family
see the Cui family to their end.

114
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,480
We'll set out for Shaozhou tomorrow.

115
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,430
Isn't this

116
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,950
the same piece of jewelry

117
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,750
Cui Shijiu gave Shinawei?

118
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,430
These are Yan's hairpins from Yangzhou,

119
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,070
once popular among royal families,
highly fashionable at the time.

120
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,830
The design catalog now rests
with my family, the Cui.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,830
Why would Mother have
the Yangzhou Yan family's designs?

122
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,390
Mother worked at the Cui's Pearl Farm,

123
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,040
and Yan Zijing is determined
to destroy the Cui family.

124
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,510
What about the Yan family
in Yangzhou now?

125
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,720
What's the connection between them?

126
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,310
Why did the ship start moving?

127
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Why did we set sail all of a sudden?

128
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,870
Mr. Zhang and Sister Wu

129
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,240
have helped me so much,

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,510
and I didn't even get to say goodbye.

131
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,600
Life is like a journey by ship.

132
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,240
Sometimes, missing someone means
they're gone for good.

133
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,320
What you need to do

134
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,440
[Yan]
is to follow your heart firmly.

135
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,840
Move forward

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,600
without looking back, without lingering.

137
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,600
Mr. Zhang gave me a parchment yesterday,

138
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,840
said it belonged to my mother.

139
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,000
The hairpin designs on it

140
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,480
are identical to the seven hairpins

141
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,200
Cui Shijiu gave Shinawei.

142
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,670
Cui Shijiu said they're
from the Yan family in Yangzhou.

143
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,670
I don't know much
about the Yan family in Yangzhou.

144
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,390
Master, do you know?

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,720
They're all dead.

146
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,390
Then why would they
be with the Cui family?

147
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,000
Naturally, it's
because the Cui family are thieves.

148
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,910
What about Yu Shi?

149
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,600
Master, do you know who Yu Shi is?

150
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,610
I saw the name Yu Shi
signed on the parchment.

151
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,240
Do you know where Yu Shi is?

152
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,910
Yu Shi,

153
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,270
seems you won't reveal
the location of the blood-stained pearl.

154
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,150
Then, you can go die.

155
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,360
Yes, big brother.

156
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,390
How could I possibly know?

157
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,940
[Yan]

158
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,480
Master, do you truly have no ties

159
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,960
to the Yan family in Yangzhou?

160
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,300
[Yan]

161
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,120
The Yan family in Yangzhou
was completely executed,

162
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
not a single one survived.

163
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,120
How could I be related to them?

164
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,270
Where are we headed next?

165
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,910
First, we'll take a stretch by water,

166
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,960
then switch to land
and head to Shaozhou.

167
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,720
From there, we'll travel north to Hexi.

168
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,960
Hexi is in the west,

169
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,080
close to the Western Regions.

170
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,720
You want to visit the Western Regions?

171
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,330
Why?

172
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
There are Gobi's sands

173
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,510
and rare jewels.

174
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,480
Who wouldn't want to see?

175
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:17,720
Fine.

176
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,670
Then,

177
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,000
since we're going,

178
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,720
could you teach me the writing
of the Western Regions?

179
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,360
There are many small states
with various scripts.

180
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,320
Just for border crossings,
there are Han,

181

182
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,670
Could you take a look at this?

183
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
What script is this?

184
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,550
This is...

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,360
Kharosthi script.

186
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,790
Kharosthi?

187
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,670
Yes, it's been lost for a long time.

188
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,960
Then can you teach me?

189
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,600
So I can know what it says.

190
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,320
Work well for me,

191
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,390
and I'll surely teach you.

Get back to the cabin and get to work!

194
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,960
Master, take it slow.

Father.

196
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,670
Everything is prepared?

197
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,150
Yes.

198
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,510
Let's set off.

199
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,790
Father, let me go instead.

200
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,120
This matter is too important.

201
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,240
I need to take care of it myself.

202
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,720
Father.

203
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,790
Father!

204
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,840
Your health can't handle
the journey anymore.

205
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,720
Let me go, please.

206
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,600
Shijiu,

207
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,480
you're very clever.

208
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,150
I knew this from your childhood.

209
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,630
But you're still a woman,

210
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,720
and there are some burdens
you shouldn't have to bear.

211
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,510
But Father,

212
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,390
I'm a member of the Cui family.

213
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,360
This mistake was mine,

214
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,910
and I must do everything
to make it right!

215
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,150
Do you understand what you're facing?

216
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,080
Prince Tan once suggested
that I join his household.

217
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,150
Sometimes,
it's even better to be a woman.

218
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,480
Fine.

219
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,150
Since you've made up your mind...

220
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,390
go then.

221
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,270
Father.

222
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,390
I'm leaving now.

223
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,720
Thank you, Father.

224
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,870
It's not that I forbade you.

225
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,200
It's that the world doesn't allow.

226
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,140
[Fuxu Port]

227
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,120
Be careful.

228
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,120
The ship sailed off at dawn.

229
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,150
No one knows where it's headed.

230
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,000
At least we got a proper farewell.

231
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,840
The Guangzhou chapter has ended.

232
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,630
We can finally go home.

233
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,630
My sworn brother sent a message,

234
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,840
saying he'll continue investigating
the Cui's Pearl Farm case.

235
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,910
Now, Xu Nanying fled overnight,

236
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,840
probably seeking
Prince Tan's protection.

237
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,870
Yan Zijing told me

238
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,720
the Cui's Pearl Farm

239
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,700
gives ten taels of pearls
to the Yue family in Shaozhou each year.

240
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,360
The Yue family in Shaozhou?

241
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,080
They're renowned for jade carving.

242
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,460
So...

243
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,670
We're heading to Shaozhou as well.

244
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,030
Prince Ying tasked us to investigate.

245
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,830
We've finished the investigation.

246
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,000
But I intend to investigate Yan Zijing.

[Fuxu Port]

248
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,160
Are you truly after Yan Zijing

249
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,160
or can't you let go of Duanwu?

250
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,540
[Yan]

251
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,820

252
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,340
This way, please.

253
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,820
Okay.

254
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,160
- This way, please.
- It's all new designs.

255
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,370
Madam Tang, I've prepared
the jewelry you requested.

256
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,440
Duanwu,

257
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,790
you left without a word.

258
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,510
Was it because of some issue?

259
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,030
May you have fair winds
and smooth sailing.

260
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,830
When we meet again, don't forget me.

261
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,350
Sister Wu,

262
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,880
this farewell is rushed.

263
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,920
Who knows when we'll meet again?

264
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,880
May you stay safe and sound,

265
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,240
with wealth and abundance.

266
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,920
When we reunite,

267
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,880
let's rekindle our sisterhood.

268
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,820
[Yan]

269
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,160
I don't know why,

270
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,270
but seeing this makes me
think of that pearl diver.

271
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,920
How am I different from her?

272
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,600
Both of us struggling in this world,

273
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,900
just trying to grasp our own fate.

274
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,660
But this time,

275
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
I have no power to resist.

276
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,550
That pearl diver...

277
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,350
I almost envy her.

278
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,880
Master Shijiu, are you really joining
Prince Tan's household?

279
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,270
That would make you a concubine.

280
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,550
The Cui family has suffered
such a disaster.

281
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,960
If we need Prince Tan's mediation,

282
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
there will surely be a price.

283
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,270
This time, I fear
there's no easy way out.

284
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,070
Isn't this Cui Shijiu?

285
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,240
- How dare you!
- Master.

286
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,030
It's the fifth master
from the Zheng family.

287
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Pardon my boldness,

Dressed like this,

291
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,790
how will you marry into my Zheng family?

292
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,160
Do you think I care to marry
into your Zheng family?

293
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,240
A mere illegitimate son...

294
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,790
it's not your place to worry.

295

True.

296
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,790
But now, I'm afraid

297
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,830
it's not about whether you care or not.

298
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,920
With such trouble in the Cui family,

299
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,270
whether you can marry at all

300
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,920
is rather uncertain.

301
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,270
Oh, by the way,

302
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,880
I have a small villa
on the west outskirts.

303
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:21,830
Perhaps...

304
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,480
Reckless fool!

305
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,720
My master would never
be anyone's mistress!

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,070
Yes.

307
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,110
But after all,
I intend to marry Lady Shijiu.

308
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,070
Remember this,

309
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,680
there is no Lady Shijiu in this world.

310
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,960
Our Cui family's matters
are none of your concern.

311
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,480
Instead, worry about your Zheng family,

312
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,200
and how to weather this storm
in Guangzhou.

313
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,750
After all, your Zheng family

314
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,960
is much more entangled
with Xu Nanying's dealings.

315
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,000
That is beyond

The Western Regions
are thousands of miles away,

332

I wouldn't dare.

333
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,270
Besides, they aren't anything of value.

are you here at Guangjiang Inn

What does it matter to you?

You're still my fiancée on paper,

338

yet every day, you dress like a man.

339
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,240
It's truly...

340
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,960
an embarrassment for me.

Master Zheng,

342
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,110

Have you forgotten

344
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,160
I've already broken off the engagement?

345

Broken it off? I never agreed.

346
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,240

means nothing.

Your family provides you
with everything,

on running around, dressing as a man.

Besides, you don't even look the part.

If you'd visit Yangzhou more often,

355

I could teach you how to be a man.

Fine, go find a songstress now.

365
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,880
Let's see if she chooses Master Shijiu

366
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,790
or my servant Garuda.

367
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:14,960
You...

368
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Do you want pearls?

369
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,590
So, it's true.

370
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,400
Only pearls

371
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,080
can sway our Lady Shijiu now.

372
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,400
Come back to Yangzhou with me.

373
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,070
Afraid I'll poison it?

374
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,720
I'll drink first to put you at ease.

375
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,550
Why are you helping me?

376
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,400
You're my fiancée on paper.

377
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,880
How could I not help you?

378
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,920
Your filthy tricks from the brothels,

379
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,000
why bother using them on me?

380
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,200
So lowly.

381
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,030
Who would believe you?

382
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Truly Lady Shijiu,

383
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,200
my future, impressive wife.

384
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,790
Mere illegitimate son, foolish dreamer.

385
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,070
And what if you
are the legitimate daughter?

386
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,120
You still have to marry me,
an illegitimate son.

387
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,200
Your father's well into his years,

388
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,480
yet he's still marrying concubines,

389
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,440
bearing sons.

390
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,070
And you?

391
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,680
After all your hard work,

392
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,750
it'll end up benefiting
your little half-brothers.

393
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,400
They?

394
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:17,350
Why do you mention them, you wastrel!

395
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
When have they ever shown
the slightest concern

396
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,830
for the family's affairs?

397
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,920
And what if I am a woman?

398
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,480
As long as I succeed this time,

399
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,750
I'll bring change to the Cui family
and the Yangzhou jewelry industry!

400
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,510
Even if the Cui family
and the Yanghzou jewelry industry change,

401
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,920
what does that have to do
with you, Lady Shijiu?

402
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,100
[Guangjiang Inn]

403
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Master Shijiu!

404
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,270
Cui Jia! Tan!

405
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,440
Master Shijiu!

406
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,920
Tan!

407
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,350
Master Shijiu!

408
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,070
The Cui family is truly doomed.

409
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,030
They even sent such treasures
to Chang'an.

410
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,310
If Cui Jingchu knew

411
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,240
that the Pearl Lotus Terrace ended up
in my hands,

412
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,480
he'd probably be furious.

413
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,750
Just let Cui Shijiu go?

414
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,750
The Pearl Lotus Terrace is gone,

415
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,350
and the Cui family is doomed.

416
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,240
Let her live.

417
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,580
She already knows
you stole the Pearl Lotus Terrace.

418
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,550
Do you think she'll let you go?

419
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,480
Isn't it amusing to have a young lady

420
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,240
constantly thinking of me?

421
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,790
Besides,
without the Pearl Lotus Terrace,

422
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,750
she no longer needs to go to Chang'an.

423
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:28,400
She swore she'd rather die
than marry you.

424
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,680
Have you traced the source
of our informant?

425
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,590
Not yet.

426
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,720
Keep investigating.

427
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,590
Be careful not to become
someone else's pawn.

428
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,720
Yes, sir.

429
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,000
This time, we've helped
see the Cui family off.

430
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,400
In the future,
the Yangzhou jewelry industry

431
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,640
will be my Zheng family's domain.

432
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
Let's go back to Yangzhou.

433
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,920
How did it get so damaged?

434
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,440
What's over here?

435
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,400
This Kharosthi script...

436
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,590
I can't recognize a single word.

437
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,480
Perhaps I could...

438
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,540
[Yan]

439
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,440
His foot slipped.

440
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,070
Seems it's the same move as before.

441
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,110
What was that move called?

442
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,490
His strength isn't as great as mine.

443
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:39,250
Thank you for yielding.

444
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,290
Awesome!

445
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,070
This move...

446
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,020
Impressive!

447
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,680
Nice hit!

448
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:06,960
Thank you for yielding.

449
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,400
I'm heading back now.

450
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,680
Sister, don't leave!

451
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,830
Master said
whoever wins the contest today

452
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,310
will get that whole table of food.

453
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,920
Look, there's even
top-grade venison on it.

454
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,350
Just looking at it
makes me hungry.

455
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,270
Loud,

456
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,400
aren't you strong?

457
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,750
Give it a try.

458
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,400
Not today.

459
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,310
I have a stomach ache today.

460
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,920
Shrimp, can you do it?

461
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,920
I'm just a kid.

462
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,270
Can I even manage it?

463
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,000
I don't dare!

464
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,400
You two are both useless.

465
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,110
I'll go.

466
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,410
Duanwu...

467
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,070
Don't worry.

468
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,200
Be careful, Sister.

469
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,400
- Duanwu!
- Sister,

470
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,240
be careful!

471
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,440
Master,

472
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,510
I heard Shrimp say earlier

473
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,960
that whoever wins today's contest

474
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,830
gets this entire table of delicacies.

475
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,750
No joke.

476
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,070
Then I'll give it a try.

477
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,110
But if I win,

478
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:07,270
the delicacies on this table

479
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,400
should be shared with all the servants.

480
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,440
Sister, you're amazing!

481
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,110
Deal.

482
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,340
We're all counting on you!

483
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:13,920
Go for it!

484
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,280
Go, Duanwu!

485
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,280
- Please.
- Duanwu, you can do it!

486
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,680
Grab a suitable weapon!

487
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,920
The shorter, the closer the risk.

488
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,550
Wait a moment!

489
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,000
Hold on.

490
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,070
That's shorter.

491
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,480
Maybe you should use this one.

492
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,200
Thanks.

493
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,310
Sister, I want lamb hooves and venison!

494
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,920
Duanwu, be careful!

495
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,720
Be careful!

496
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,720
- Sister!
- Duanwu!

497
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,830
Duanwu!

498
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,030
She's so small,

499
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,070
yet so fierce.

500
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,550
Admirable courage.

501
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,510
But her moves
are completely unstructured.

502
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,720
To figure it out herself to this level

503
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,080
- is already impressive.
- Duanwu!

504
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,070
Careful, watch out!

505
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,110
Sister!

506
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,270
Truly the first time.

507
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,110
A first, indeed.

508
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,640
Find her a proper short sword later.

509
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,750
Right now, she's suited
to practice thrusts.

510
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,920
There's no time
to teach her proper technique.

511
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,310
You seem to want her
to learn everything.

512
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,550
She wants to stand on her own.

513
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,510
I'm simply helping her along.

514
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,200
Many people in this world
are stuck in misery,

515
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,960
yet don't want to lift a finger.

516
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,830
She wants to save herself,

517
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,510
so I'll give her a hand.

518
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,860
Watch out for sneak attacks!

519
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:09,880
Be careful!

520
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,070
Thank you for going easy on me.

521
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,880
Well done, Duanwu!

522
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,000
Duanwu, you're amazing!

523
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,360
He lost gracefully.

524
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,440
Master,

525
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,960
what do you say?

526
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:39,840
Very well.

527
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,880
I'll have the kitchen prepare more.

528
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,920
Please, enjoy.

529
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,480
Thank you, Master!

530
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,760
Thank you, Master!

531
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
Sister, you're incredible!

532
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,440
Lamb hooves!

533
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,300
[Yan]

534
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,550
Thank you, Duanwu!

535
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,110
It's my first time having such a feast!

536
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,140
Shrimp!

537
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,760
Shrimp!

538
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,920
Come have some lamb hooves!

539
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,360
I want lamb hooves!

540
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,840
[Yan]

541
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,630
You can't reach me.

542
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,480
Look over there!

543
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,540
It's beautiful over there.

544
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,550
- So beautiful.
- Yes, indeed.

545
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,500
Do you see it?

546
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,840
I've never felt the ocean like this.

547
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,440
The breeze feels so nice.

548
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,110
Duanwu!

549
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,320
Supervisor Kang,

550
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,110
Wait for me here.

551
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,150
Come on, Shrimp.

552
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,670
Thank you, Sister.

553
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,110
So comfortable!

554
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,030
Are you happy, Shrimp?

555
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,800
Supervisor Kang, what's the matter?

556
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,480
This is for you.

557
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,280
A nice short sword. Take a look.

558
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,360
Thank you, Supervisor Kang.

559
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,110
Wait a moment.

560
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,550
Hold on.

561
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,580
Look over there!

562
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,370
So beautiful!

563
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,070
Look at that!

564
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,710
Did you see that fish?

565
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Supervisor Kang!

566
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,000
Here.

567
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:18,800
Here you go!

568
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,920
This is a little crossbow I made myself.

569
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,030
Don't be fooled by its size.

570
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,630
It can save your life when it counts.

571
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,670
I'm giving it to you.

572
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,550
Let's trade.

573
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,550
Duanwu,

574
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,440
this is the Master's intention.

575
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,760
The Master gives this sword to me?

576
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,280
But this little crossbow
is quite interesting.

577
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,190
How should I use it?

578
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,710
Hold it, and I'll teach you.

579
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,230
First, put it on your wrist.

580
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,230
Tie it securely to your wrist.

581
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,110
Then look...

582
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,280
You can aim at any target.

583
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,480
Do you see?

584
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,880
Like there.

585
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,940
It's quite delicate and compact.

586
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,630
Duanwu,

587
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,400
practice close combat more.

588
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,220
It could save your life when needed.

589
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,920
Thank you for the short sword!

590
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,460
Shrimp!

591
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,070
Sit up. Be careful.

592
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,920
Well... that crossbow...

593
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,880
Here you go.

594
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,960
Could I borrow it for a few days?

595
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,460
Sure.

596
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,360
If you can't figure it out,

597
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,360
remember to come find me.

598
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:32,920
Okay.

599
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:55,740

Master.

614
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,230
Come in.

615
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,030
What's wrong?

616
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,710
Didn't you say
you would teach me Kharosthi?

617
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,070
Remember?

618
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,070
I have something to do now.
Let's postpone it.

619
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,800
Though you're not a gentleman,

620
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,550
in business, a promise should be kpet.

621
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,880
Fine.

622
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,550
Forget it. Maybe you can't read it.

623
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,920
Come here.

624
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,480
Let me see.

625
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,590
Thank you, Master.

626
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,150
Look...

627
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,440
Where are you going?

628
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,110
What does this mean?

629
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,880
This is...

630
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:31,630
the art of extraction.

631
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:36,840
The art of extraction?

632
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,320
And what about this?

633
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,360
Here.

634
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,360
This one...

635
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,150
This is...

636
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,840
Autumn Pomegranate.

637
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:53,230
What's wrong?

638
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,150
And this one?

639
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,760
Let me think.

640
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,630
This is...

641
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,360
Summer Lily.

642
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,070
You're just describing the shapes

643
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,670
and tricking me.

644
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,480
Come back!

645
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:26,540
I just haven't spoken Kharosthi
in a long time,

646
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,590
so I'm a bit rusty.

647
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:29,280
Still pretending!

648
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,280
If you don't understand, just admit it!

649
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,670
Just wait!

650
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,590
Come here.

651
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,670
Sit down.

652
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,630
I don't understand?

653
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,150
Look for yourself.

654
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,630
Identical!

655
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,920
A replica?

656
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,920
What replica?

657
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,400
I, Yan Zijing, use replicas?

658
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,070
It's the real thing!

659
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,000
Really?

660
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,710
Of course!

661
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,590
Why do you have items
from the parchment?

662
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,320
Isn't that normal?

663
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,440
A master's work ends up
in the hands of the common folk.

664
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,590
What's so strange about it?

665
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:34,230
Master?

666
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,070
You mean Yu Shi?

667
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,630
Yes. Regarding Yu Shi,

668
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,710
he's the chief craftsman
of the Yan family in Yangzhou,

669
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,400
exceptionally creative,

670
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,320
and skillful,

671
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,030
quite sought after.

672
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,370
When I asked you before,

673
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:49,400
you said you didn't know him!

674
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,000
I was just too lazy
to bother with you then.

675
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,030
If that's the case,

676
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,280
