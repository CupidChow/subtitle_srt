Well, perfect timing.

their alliance seems unbreakable,

If Prince Ying is the mastermind,

and Yuchi Wuyi appears as the Master of Langhuan Dockyard,

60
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,070
but is actually the leader of Black Dragon Bandits Li Kui,

raiding trading convoys for Prince Ying,

62
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,680
then what about Zheng Shiyuan?

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,430
He's not just fencing stolen goods.

To Prince Ying,

65
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,120
Zheng Shiyuan isn't essential.

66
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,390
That old fox is so cunning,

67
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,240
so he must have a backup plan.

Prince Ying, after these two lessons,

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,190
probably won't harm Zheng Shiyuan.

But Zheng Shiyuan

72
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,310
won't want to be our bait either.

73
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,160
So, he might

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,720
take the hidden evidence and flee,

then the flow of money doesn't add up.

it's not just about clearing Prince Ying's name.

Inspector Zhang, you're overstepping your bounds.

157
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,440
These past days, you rarely leave this residence

158
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,240
or see the light of day.

159
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,960
Are you unwell?

160
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,270
What did you do to me?

161
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,670
You poisoned me?

162
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,630
You're always so cautious,

163

eating only dry rations for every meal

164
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,840
and drinking only spring water you fetch yourself.

165
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,200
How could I possibly poison you?

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,790
You poisoned me with intoxicating incense.

167
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,240
You masked the scent with fruit fragrance.

168
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,320
Since your failed rescue of Xu Nanying,

169
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,790
returning injured and losing troops,

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200

Yuchi Wuyi must have infiltrated the villa,

178
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,670

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,550
Yuchi Wuyi,

189
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,630
you dared to assassinate Prince Ying!

190
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,200
Isn't it obvious?

191
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,670
We were just playing around?

192
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,630
Why make such a big scene?

193
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,320
I don't care if you two are joking around.

194
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,720
Today, I have a case involving the Black Dragon Bandits,

195
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,360
and it's tied to him.

196
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,360
I must take this man back.

197
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,550
Guards!

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Stop!

199
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,390
Zhang Jinran, how dare you!

200
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,390
I don't care about your big case.

201
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,480
I guarantee he is not Li Kui.

202
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,240
So, Prince Ying, you know who Li Kui really is?

203
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,670
What if I do?

204
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,910
I assure he is not Li Kui.

205
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,150
The one I'm arresting today isn't Li Kui,

206
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,080
but Yuchi Wuyi, the Master of Langhuan Dockyard,

207
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,550
who colluded with the Zheng family to fence goods

208
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,360
for the Black Dragon Bandits.

209
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,670
Take him away!

210
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,390
Yes, sir!

211
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,550
Get up!

212
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,720
Move!

213
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,510
Go!

214
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,550
Hand over the item.

215
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
- Give me the antidote! - Kang Ju!

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,600
Are you even human?

217
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,720
Kang Ju, calm down!

218
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,790
Hand it over!

219
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,600
Is it worth sacrificing yourself for someone like him?

220
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,910
- Give me the antidote! - Quickly, take him away!

221
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,840
Move!

222
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,720
- Hand over the antidote! - Hurry up!

223
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Kang Ju!

224
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,550
Kang Ju, what antidote?

225
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,080
Yan Zijing was poisoned.

226
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,720
He's the only one with the antidote.

227
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,750
Mr. Zhang.

228
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,390
What are you doing?

229
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,720
Mr. Zhang, I'm begging you.

230
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
Help me get the antidote.

231
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,870
I'll make sure to get it for you.

232
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,440
Thank you.

233
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,550
Not feeling well again?

234
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,000
It's fine.

235
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,790
Take a rest.

236
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,720
Take a rest.

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
How's it going?

238
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,840
How is it?

239
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,080
They've captured Yuchi Wuyi.

240
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,390
As long as he confesses, Prince Ying will have no escape.

241
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,960
And Zhang Jinran promised me.

242
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,480
He'll get you the antidote.

243
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,080
Who allowed you to tell him this?

244
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,600
If I didn't,

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
what would you do?

246
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,030
If Zhang Jinran gets played by Yuchi Wuyi

247
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,360
in his attempt to save me,

248
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,870
won't all our efforts be wasted?

249
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,390
Then what about you?

250
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,550
You can't go.

251
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,440
Kang Ju,

252
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,320
after all these years,

253
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,200
you should know

254
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,510
all I want is for him to die.

255
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,840
Yuchi Wuyi,

256
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,480
even now, you won't speak?

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,960
Then let me tell you this:

258
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,840
The Langhuan Dockyard you built

259
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,790
will be utterly destroyed.

260
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,750
Even the Black Dragon Bandits will be wiped out.

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,360
And at this very moment,

262
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,840
even Prince Ying would rather see you dead

263
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,720
so he can pin all the blame on you.

264
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm the only one who can save your life now.

265
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,640
And today, I happen to be in the mood

266
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,000
to give you a way out.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,030
What do you want?

268
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,000
Prove that the Yan family was framed

269
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,590
in the Kang State tribute case,

270
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,960
and that the real mastermind behind the Black Dragon Bandits is Prince Ying.

271
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,440
Confess to everything truthfully,

272
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,720
and I'll make sure you escape the death penalty.

273
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,830
You don't have time to think about it.

274
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,550
Fine.

275
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,110
I can testify against Prince Ying,

276
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,750
but you must let me go.

277
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,590
You want me to let you go?

278
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,070
That's impossible.

279
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,920
I can give you the antidote.

280
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,000
I know

281
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,830
you all want to save Yan Zijing.

282
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,350
He can't hold out any longer.

283
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,070
And you're running out of time too.

284
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,720
Give me the antidote,

285
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,640
then we can talk about conditions!

286
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:39,720
The water of Black Dragon Pool is the deadliest poisons,

287
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,270
and I'm the only one who can cure it.

288
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,070
If I give you the antidote now,

289
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
will I still have a way out?

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,830
Let me go,

291
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,880
and I'll agree to all your terms.

292
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,000
Let me go.

293
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,310
I don't care about your antidote!

294
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,240
You promised me

295
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,440
to clear the Yan family's name.

296
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,310
If you're letting him go to save me,

297
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
I'd rather kill him now,

298
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,440
and that'll count as bringing him to justice.

299
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,200
Yan Zijing!

300
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,000
Zhang Jinran,

301
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,030
the Black Dragon Bandits have been rampaging for years.

302
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
If you let him go,

303
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,900
how many more people

304
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,030
will have to endure

305
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,160
what I've suffered?

306
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,640
Just give me a little more time.

307
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,550
I'll get him to talk.

308
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,070
- Then you can do what you want... - I just want him dead!

309
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,000
There's no need to waste time.

310
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,750
He won't talk,

311
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,830
and I don't need it anyway.

312
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,000
How impressive!

313
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,790
Don't listen to him.

314
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,880
He's lying to you.

315
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
No one can withstand a poison this deadly.

316
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,790
First, he'll lose his sight,

317
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,830
and then he'll slowly die in torment.

318
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,310
Shut up!

319
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,030
Let me go!

320
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,550
Let me go!

321
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,750
I'll give you exactly what you need right now.

322
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,030
Yuchi Wuyi,

323
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,400
you're about to die, and you still don't see it.

324
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,880
Let me tell you,

325
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,030
your final fate is to become a pile of bones,

326
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,310
with no one to claim your remains.

327
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,310
And the Prince Ying you're protecting

328
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,830
will trample over your corpse

329
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,200
to maintain his wealth and glory.

330
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,920
Back in Black Dragon Cave,

331
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,590
you should've killed me.

332
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,750
Otherwise,

333
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,550
you wouldn't be in this situation.

334
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,920
I'll kill you right now!

335
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,830
You can die with me!

336
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,070
Yan Zijing!

337
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,270
Yan Zijing!

338
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,310
What poison did you take? I'll find the imperial doctor.

339
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,790
It's too late.

340
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,160
My body

341
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,510
is beyond saving.

342
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,790
But promise me,

343
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,110
don't let Duanwu know

344
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,590
about my condition.

345
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,920
She'll find out eventually.

346
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,240
Then let her find out when the time comes.

347
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,160
All I want with the little time I have left

348
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,110
is to be with her more

349
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,960
and look at her a bit longer.

350
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,110
That's enough for me.

351
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,640
Promise me.

352
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,350
Thank you.

353
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,920
Yingtao, you're making a mess everywhere.

354
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,830
I'm practicing my Iron Palm technique!

355
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,070
You're like a child.

356
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,920
I'm so tired.

357
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,160
Supervisor Kang, stop zoning out.

358
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,350
Have a longan. It's very sweet.

359
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,680
Here.

360
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Why are we preparing so many beans?

361
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,400
The Laba Festival is around the corner.

362
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,070
We're making steaming hot Laba Porridge

363
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,400
for every guest who comes in

364
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,000
to show Clear Mind's hospitality.

365
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,350
That's wonderful.

366
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,070
Indeed.

367
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,160
Why don't you show me some kindness too?

368
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,590
My mistake, Yingtao.

369
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,920
You've worked so hard.

370
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,270
Here, let me massage your shoulders.

371
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,440
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

372
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,480
I'll hit you!

373
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,200
I didn't mean it!

374
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,310
Sit down.

375
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,110
Alright then.

376
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,680
Have some longan. You've worked hard too.

377
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,510
Duanwu, look at the two of them.

378
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,270
They're not working properly, just flirting around.

379
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,200
Get back to work.

380
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,680
Duanwu, what are your plans with Master Yan?

381
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,590
She's too shy to say.

382
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,030
She feels embarrassed.

383
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,750
It's obvious.

384
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,440
Where did Master Yan go?

385
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:22,880
Yeah, where?

386
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,200
He was worried that Yuchi Wuyi wouldn't confess,

387
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,960
so he went to the Grand Governor's Office.

388
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,350
Yuchi Wuyi won't accept his fate quietly.

389
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,920
He's bound to give up Prince Ying.

390
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
Rest assured.

391
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:38,920
Exactly.

392
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,720
Let's hope so.

393
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,160
Don't worry, Supervisor Kang.

394
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,200
Supervisor Kang,

395
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,240
since Laba Porridge uses the same ingredients,

396
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,070
why make Longevity Porridge instead?

397
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,960
Every household makes Laba Porridge.

398
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,440
We're offering Longevity Porridge

399
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,000
for good blessings.

400
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,160
Great idea.

401
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,960
Supervisor Kang, your suggestion is brilliant.

402
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,960
It's meaningful.

403
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,480
Longevity and good health.

404
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,440
Peace and prosperity!

405
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,000
Exactly!

406
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,480
Supervisor Kang always thinks of everything.

407
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,110
Duanwu.

408
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,750
Master Yan.

409
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,270
What's all this?

410
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,960
It's Supervisor Kang's idea.

411
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,270
This year, we're making Longevity Porridge

412
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,200
instead of Laba Porridge

413
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,160
for good luck.

414
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,640
Make plenty.

415
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,510
Sure.

416
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,240
What about Yuchi Wuyi?

417
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,830
Zhang Jinran already took Yuchi Wuyi

418
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,790
to capture Prince Ying.

419
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,640
Don't worry.

420
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,160
Then...

421
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,440
we'll soon get what we've been working for.

422
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,750
Let's hope we get what we want soon.

423
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,030
We will.

424
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,750
Need help with anything?

425
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,920
What can I do?

426
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,110
Sure.

427
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,110
Help me pick the beans.

428
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,160
Here.

429
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,640
Gaoshou, make her stop.

430
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,200
I can't stop her.

431
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,070
Let's pick the beans from this.

432
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,750
Look...

433
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,240
Stop eating. Those are for the guests!

434
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,750
Supervisor Kang, why don't you have some too?

435
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,110
Just have some.

436
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,680
Let's all get some good luck.

437
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,550
Here, Supervisor Kang.

438
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,920
Your Highness, everything is packed,

439
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,550
and the contacts along the way are arranged.

440
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,750
We can leave Yangzhou at any time.

441
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,110
Your Highness, if we don't leave now, it'll be too late.

442
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,830
What about Yuchi Wuyi?

443
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,110
Zhang Jinran hasn't left the Grand Governor's Office.

444
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,680
If we leave now,

445
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,070
we can still make it to the northwest.

446
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,160
But if Yuchi Wuyi confesses,

447
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,310
it'll be too late by then.

448
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,480
Your Highness.

449
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,640
Your Highness...

450
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,590
Even if I leave,

451
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,590
I must take the blood-stained pearl with me.

452
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,750
Your Highness,

453
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,350
Zhang Jinran must be working

454
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,480
on forcing Yuchi Wuyi to talk.

455
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,550
Staying in Yangzhou is too dangerous, Your Highness!

456
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,070
Prince Ying, Yuchi Wuyi confessed

457
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,750
you're the mastermind behind the Black Dragon Bandits.

458
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,680
I'm the mastermind?

459
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,750
That's just a bandit's word.

460
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,720
How is that trustworthy?

461
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,920
Yuchi Wuyi did so much for you behind the scenes,

462
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,310
and yet you wanted to steal his pearl.

463
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,960
He won't just testify against you.

464
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,000
He also told me there's more correspondence proving your involvement

465
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,440
hidden in Langhuan Dockyard.

466
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,550
Guards,

467
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:38,790
throw them out...

468
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,350
Prince Ying,

469
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,270
for years, you've enjoyed the riches and privileges of your royal title,

470
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,310
yet you've been amassing wealth and raising troops,

471
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,110
colluding with bandits and oppressing the people.

472
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,310
How can you face the Emperor?

473
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,880
How can you face the taxpayers who sustain you?

474
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:57,000
Zhang Jinran, it's not your place to scold me!

475
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,110
I am a royal prince,

476
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,790
trusted by the Emperor and supported by the people.

477
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,000
That is how it should be!

478
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,160
How could you be so absurd now?

479
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,750
Those who harm the people must die.

480
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,830
Those who oppress the people face punishment.

481
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,310
The law is absolute, even kings are not exempt.

482
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,400
Don't you understand that?

483
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,440
Search all documents and belongings!

484
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,240
Yes, sir!

485
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,440
Take Prince Ying into custody.

486
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,350
Yes, sir!

487
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,350
- Don't move! - Don't move!

488
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,640
Dear guests,

489
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:37,070
Clear Mind is offering Longevity Porridge today!

490
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:38,720
- Come, have a bowl! - Peace and joy to you.

491
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,880
- Thank you! - Warming hearts and stomachs, peace and health!

492
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,830
Come take a look!

493
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,310
Everyone, join us to share the good fortune!

494
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,680
Blessings and prosperity!

495
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
Thank you, Ms. Su!

496
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,310
Come on!

497
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,550
Come have some porridge!

498
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,400
Come share the good fortune!

499
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Come on!

500
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:53,960
Blessings and prosperity!

501
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,270
Thank you, Ms. Su!

502
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,070
Have a bowl of Longevity Porridge,

503
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,440
wishing you peace and health every year!

504
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,400
Careful, it's hot!

505
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,070
Here you go. Be careful.

506
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,920
Thank you!

507
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,270
Blessings and prosperity!

508
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,680
- Thank you, Ms. Su. - Duanwu!

509
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,440
- Duanwu... - Come, have some porridge!

510
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,000
Master Yan.

511
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,440
Yingtao.

512
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,550
Mr. Zhang, please.

513
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,240
This way.

514
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,270
Put it down right here.

515
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,880
How did it go?

516
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,790
Last night...

517
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,070
Thank you.

518
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,000
I arrested Prince Ying.

519
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,680
Blessings and prosperity!

520
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,240
Clear Mind is serving porridge!

521
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,070
Longevity Porridge!

522
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,240
Wishing you peace and health every year!

523
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,750
Here's yours.

524
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,070
Share the good fortune!

525
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,640
So...

526
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,110
regarding the Yan family's wrongful case,

527
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,240
is it about to be cleared?

528
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,240
Yes.

529
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,480
That's why I'm here to bid farewell.

530
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,750
I plan to personally escort Prince Ying and Yuchi Wuyi

531
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,310
to Chang'an for trial

532
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,200
and clear the Yan family's name.

533
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,590
Master Yan,

534
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,000
wait for me to return.

535
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,110
Thank you.

536
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,640
Peace and health, Longevity Porridge!

537
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,590
Peace and health every year!

538
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,510
By the way...

539
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,350
Miss, your porridge is ready.

540
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,590
Though the blood-stained pearl is shattered.

541
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,510
Sir, here's yours.

542
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,030
The map on it has been drawn.

543
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:14,920
Duanwu and I believe

544
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,920
this doesn't belong to us.

545
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,400
So, please, present it to His Majesty.

546
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,880
Blessings and prosperity!

547
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,070
Don't worry.

548
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,110
Here's yours.

549
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,440
I'll take my leave now.

550
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,350
Mr. Zhang...

551
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,270
May everyone enjoy peace and health every year.

552
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,350
Gaoshou.

553
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,550
Serve the Longevity Porridge.

554
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,110
Thank you.

555
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,640
- Here, Mr. Zhang. - Come.

556
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,400
- Have this Longevity Porridge. Careful, it's hot. - Yours.

557
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,850
Thank you.

558
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,030
- Thank you so much! - Peace and health every year!

559
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:40,790
Try it.

560
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,480
Everyone, line up and get yours!

561
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,030
Here, Miss,

562
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,880
hold it steady.

563
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,590
It's so sweet.

564
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,680
After drinking this bowl of Longevity Porridge,

565
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,480
you're sure to have a safe journey.

566
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,720
But isn't today Laba Festival?

567
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,400
Why are we drinking Longevity Porridge?

568
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,510
Supervisor Kang decided

569
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,310
that this year's Laba Festival

570
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,440
should be different from usual.

571
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Hold it steady.

572
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,070
Longevity Porridge!

573
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,200
Longevity Porridge!

574
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,160
Here, Miss.

575
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,550
With Laba Festival and this added celebration,

576
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,750
why not...

577
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,440
Don't spill it.

578
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,550
- light the firecrackers? - Sir, here's yours.

579
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,720
Gaoshou.

580
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
- Grab the firecrackers. - Hold it steady.

581
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,030
Alright!

582
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,510
Longevity Porridge for blessings,

583
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,880
and firecrackers to ward off evil.

584
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,000
May everyone

585
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,830
be as happy

586
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,400
and healthy

587
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,510
as we are today.

588
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,510
[Clear Mind]

589
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:28,960
Wonderful!

590
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,160
Happy and healthy!

591
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,480
- Great! Health and peace! - Master Yan, peace and health every year.

592
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,110
Safe travels.

593
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,000
Thank you...

594
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,590
Good!

595
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,400
- Bravo! - Great!

596
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,070
- Oh... - Bravo!

597
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,750
I'll go check on the kitchen

598
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,270
- to see if there's anything I can help. - Alright.

599
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,070
Look after things here.

600
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,000
Thank you...

601
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,600
Thank you...

602
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,880
Share the good fortune!

603
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,030
Come! Have some porridge!

604
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,880
Thank you!

605
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,200
- Peace and health every year! - Health and happiness!

606
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,880
Thank you!

607
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,880
Here's yours.

608
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,400
I heard Clear Mind is serving Longevity Porridge today.

609
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,790
Can I get a bowl too?

610
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,880
Come, everyone gets a bowl.

611
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,070
There's none left. It's all gone!

612
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,710
It tasted great.

613
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,070
I'm glad you like it.

614
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,710
Having brushed past death's door,

615
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,150
I've come to realize how precious life is.

616
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,070
So, for today's Longevity Porridge,

617
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,590
you're the one who deserves it most.

618
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,630
At last, the era of the Cuis and Zhengs

619
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,550
has finally come to an end.

620
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,670
The jewelry guild also deserves a new beginning.

621
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,480
Indeed, the guild

622
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,760
needs a new head now.

623
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,710
What do you think?

624
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,400
Are you planning to take on the role?

625
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,800
Why not?

626
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
I've long wanted to break those outdated rules

627
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,960
about passing the guild to men, not women.

628
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,670
What I want is a thriving,

629
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,150
vibrant new jewelry guild.

630
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,360
What about you?

631
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,110
All I want for the future guild

632
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,030
is that for small merchants,

633
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,590
they'll have time not only to manage their little business,

634
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,440
but also to craft better jewelry.

635
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,760
For large merchants, they can carry grand ambitions,

636
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,480
heading beyond the borders,

637
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,280
beyond Huainandao,

638
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,670
to Chang'an and even further.

639
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,230
Amazing.

640
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Your ambitions are so grand.

641
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,000
Grand?

642
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,880
Traveling far shows how small you are.

643
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,800
The world is vast.

644
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,360
From the pearl farm to now,

645
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,880
traveling all the way from north to south,

646
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,630
this is all I've come to know.

647
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,070
Do you still wish to journey thousands of miles

648
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,110
with that person?

649
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,860
♪The pearl fades, lost in a vast crowd...♪

650
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,630

♪Dreams fade, fate ends, only the sorrow of parting remains♪

657
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,460

♪Ah, beyond words♪

659
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,030
Master Yan hasn't returned yet?

660
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,590
Not yet. I haven't seen him.

661
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,590
Duanwu, come look at this.

662
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,190
I feel like these designs

663
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,070
aren't good enough for the Jewel Exhibition.

664
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,590
But I think each one looks beautiful.

665
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,590
Ms. Su has high standards.

666
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,070
What if we make these necklaces into a complete set?

667
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,760
How about that?

668
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,590
Even then, it's just jewelry.

669
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,190
The champion of this Yangzhou Jewel Exhibition

670
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,400
will have their work sent to the palace,

671
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,710
personally selected by the Emperor as the state gift of Tang.

672
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,230
It can't be as simple as just jewelry.

673
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,510
Then how about this glass vase?

674
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,360
Our vase-making techniques are still underdeveloped.

675
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,590
They can't compare to Persian glass.

676
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,670
Yunxiu, I think you've already done an excellent job.

677
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:51,030
Exactly, Lady Shiqi.

678
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,440
Even Mr. Qin said

679
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,710
your control over the heat surpasses his now.

680
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,510
No rush, take it slow.

681
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,920
It's done!

682
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,510
Ms. Su, the colorful glass is complete!

683
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,710
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

684
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,280
Mr. Qin, you actually made it!

685
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,150
Then we can use the colorful glass

686
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,480
to participate in the Jewel Exhibition!

687
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,030
Duanwu,

688
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,320
what should we make with this colorful glass?

689
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,480
We need to think carefully about that.

690
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,190
Master Yan is here!

691
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,360
You're all here.

692
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,400
You've succeeded!

693
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,710
Yunxiu, take this.

694
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,320
How's the colorful glass?

695
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,510
Nice.

696
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,360
Does it look exactly like the one

697
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,510
my father made back then.

698
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,510
Even better than the one from back then.

699
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,110
Congratulations.

700
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,920
I didn't expect

701
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,190
Mr. Qin to achieve it so fast.

702
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,550
Come over here.

703
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,030
I just went out

704
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,590
to buy you some supper.

705
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
When I left, I saw the lights were still on.

706
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,800
I thought you must still be awake,

707
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,000
so I got your favorite wontons from the bridge stall.

708
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,510
Come, have a taste.

709
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,880
Thank you.

710
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,550
So, have you decided what to make with the colorful glass?

711
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,840
Not yet.

712
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,920
But I am thinking of making you a new coat,

713
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,840
something warmer.

714
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,670
Why do you suddenly want to make clothes for me?

715
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,760
New Year calls for new things.

716
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,360
It's a sign of good fortune.

717
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,400
I'll make you something every year,

718
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,480
then you won't find it so curious.
