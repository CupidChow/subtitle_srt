If you stray and don't marry,

171
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,680

187
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,680
to support you in your endeavors.

188
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,860
[Everlasting]

189
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,200
Mr. Yue.

190
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,200
My master has heard
of Jade Guanyin in Shaozhou,

191
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,680
so he asked me to bring a gift.

192
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,510
Would you like to see it?

193
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,160
What is it?

194
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,680
Very valuable and unique,

195
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,680
of course.

196
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,150
How old is your master?

197
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,790
You may want to...

198
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,760
Not important.

199
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,560
He's good at caring if he's
a few years older than her.

200
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,150
How many wives does your master have?

201
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,280
If his wife...

202
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,960
It doesn't matter.

203
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,280
If he has a big family, it'll be lively.

204
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,750
Does your Master have any ailments?

205
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,590
That

206
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,560
doesn't matter either.

207
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,280
May I ask what is important

208
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,470
when your daughter gets married?

209
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:23,230
That is your master's sincerity

210
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,920
in the bride price, of course.

211
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,320
This will fully show

212
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,110
his sincerity towards my daughter.

213
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
That is sincerity.

214
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,920
Lady Shiqi is Jade Guanyin.

215
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,630
It seems you are not
choosing a son-in-law

216
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,200
but selling your daughter.

217
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,320
You...

218
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,870
Good women are rare.

219
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,230
Put it away.

220
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,470
Master.

221
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Hello, Mr. Yue.

222
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,320
Master Yan, please take a seat.

223
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,830
Master Yan is such a good-looking

224
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,230
and talented man.

225
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,960
You're not only young and brilliant

226
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,920
but also rich.

227
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,990
Even in Shaozhou...

228
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,280
For the bride price,

229
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
you can name your price.

230
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:30,560
50,000 gold.

231
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,710
No problem.

232
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,280
50,000 gold?

233
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,560
Mr. Yue.

234
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,400
I agree.

235
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,200
Perfect match.

236
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,560
Perfect match.

237
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,330
- Master Yan.
- Mr. Yue.

238
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,040
I've heard that Miss Yue is an orphan

239
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
and was adopted by you as a child,

240
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,800
so where did you adopt her?

241
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,560
Someone gave her to me.

242
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,710
Does she

243
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,710
have any other relatives?

244
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,320
No.

245
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,400
This girl

246
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,680
had a terrible childhood.

247
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,710
She was uprooted and nearly killed.

248
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,230
Luckily,

249
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,230
I saved her

250
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,830
and raised her.

251
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,590
It wasn't easy.

252
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,440
Master Yan,

253
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,680
so about the bride price.

254
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,750
Do you think...

255
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,200
Master Yan, don't worry.

256
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,870
Although Lady Shiqi has no parents,

257
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,110
- her future happiness will be endless.
- That's enough.

258
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,960
I don't care about that.

259
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,680
Do you really want to marry Lady Shiqi?

260
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,030
Can't I?

261
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,070
Why?

262
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,640
Because of her skill?

263
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,160
I have no shortage of artisans.

264
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,640
Then why?

265
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,400
What's wrong?

266
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,030
What do you have against
the choice of my future wife?

267
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,710
What's it to me?

268
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,200
I'm just curious as to

269
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,270
why you want to get married so suddenly

270
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,710
and at such great expense.

271
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,400
In three days,

272
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,790
I'm taking her out of Shaozhou.

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,070
Do you know how much money
the Yue's family wants?

274
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,550
How can three days be enough?

275
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,920
Is that much?

276
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,510
I want more.

277
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,310
I've been out of Shaozhou
just for half a month

278
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,640
and you do this.

279
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,840
What do you mean?

280
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,550
Master Zhou, you've misunderstood.

281
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,360
Many people like my daughter,

282
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,680
and the matchmakers
are scrambling to introduce men to her,

283
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,510
so I have no choice.

284
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,790
I've already paid the bride price.

285
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,200
I want to see who is qualified

286
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,510
to compete with me.

287
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,710
Please wait at the door.

288
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,750
Just a moment.

289
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,840
Just a moment.

290
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,400
Come here.

291
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,880
Come here, please.

292
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,120
Mr. Yue.

293
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,470
I understand.

294
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,160
Lady Shiqi...

295
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,160
I know. I understand.

296
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,840
Now. Take the guest to Lady Shiqi.

297
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,980
Now.

298
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,960
Please.

299
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,050
Let's go.

300
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,710
Master Zhou.

301
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,440
Don't just sit there. Eat some fruit.

302
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Lady Shiqi.

303
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,070
I'm Duanwu from Yan's Trading Convoy.

304
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,640
Miss, please wait.

305
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,400
Lady Shiqi is soaking her hands.

306
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,070
That's all right.

307
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,550
Is that goat's milk?

308
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,030
Goat's milk?

309
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:02,600
Yes,

310
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,960
it is.

311
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,840
Poor people can't afford to drink it.

312
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,960
The master has prepared it

313
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,680
especially for Lady Shiqi.

314
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:13,960
Give it to me.

315
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,600
Lady Shiqi.

316
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,710
It's from my master.

317
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,270
Please choose well.

318
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,270
Lady Shiqi

319
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,470
doesn't like such gaudy things.

320
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,200
She has always worn only white jade.

321
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,990
I happen to

322
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,960
have white jade.

323
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,640
Please take a look.

324
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,600
Do you like it?

325
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,880
Thank your master for me.

326
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,750
Aren't you curious

327
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,640
about my master?

328
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,510
As long as he doesn't get in the way
of my jade carving.

329
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,310
Did you cave all the jade

330
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,200
in this room yourself?

331
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,750
Good jade doesn't need to be carved.

332
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,960
This room is full of good jade.

333
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,030
Whether it gets better or worse

334
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,070
depends on the mind of the carver

335
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,270
and the compatibility of the jade.

336
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,510
You deserve to be Jade Guanyin.

337
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,310
I've had

338
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,030
an eyeful today.

339
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,680
Feel free to look around if you like.

340
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,550
Really?

341
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,070
This is the Apsaras statue.

342
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,470
It's a replica,

343
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,200
a far cry from the real thing.

344
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,400
The real thing?

345
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,070
Where is the real one?

346
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,400
Can you show it to me?

347
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,880
With my father.

348
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,160
Lady Shiqi.

349
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,880
Master's gifts have been here.

350
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,920
Sorry to bother you. See you later.

351
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,510
Let's go.

352
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,270
The Cui family,

353
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,920
the Yan family, the Yue family,

354
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,070
my mom,

355
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:07,960
and Yu Shi.

356
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,120
What's the relationship between them?

357
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,310
Why does the Yue family
have the Apsaras statue?

358
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,680
Did Yan Zijing know about it?

359
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:17,510
Duanwu.

360
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,270
Did Lady Shiqi take the jewelry?

361
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,360
Did she like them?

362
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,880
From the Cui family to the Yue family,

363
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:28,550
what did he marry Lady Shiqi for?

364
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:29,600
Huh?

365
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,750
Master.

366
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,840
Lady Shiqi took all the jewelry,

367
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,310
but her favorite is white jade,

368
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,400
and she only cares about jade carving.

369
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,840
Go to Accountant Wei

370
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,460
and give her all the best white jade

371
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,160
from the trading convoy.

372
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,160
All the white jade?

373
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,750
Now. Go.

374
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,070
About Master Zhou,
I've made arrangements.

375
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,270
Good.

376
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,200
Let's go to Yue's Mansion.

377
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,840
Lady Shiqi.

378
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,990
Did you hurt your hand?

379
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,470
Recently,

380
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,710
my hand has been weak all of a sudden.

381
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,440
Weak?

382
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,990
It must be because you've been
working too hard lately.

383
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,070
The master has been reminding you

384
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,710
to have a rest

385
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,030
and not to carve jade day and night.

386
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,710
It hurts your hands.

387
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,840
Come on, Lady Shiqi.

388
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,310
Time to soak your hands.

389
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,680
What is this goat's milk for?

390
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,310
Why do my hands always
feel uncomfortable

391
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,710
after soaking them
in goat's milk these days?

392
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,790
This goat's milk

393
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,960
is to condition your skin

394
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,840
and relax

395
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,310
your hands.

396
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,230
Moreover, Master has prepared it
especially for you.

397
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,750
Lady Shiqi, don't you even believe
in the Master?

398
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,310
Don't worry.

399
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
How long have you
been using goat's milk?

400
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,750
A little over a month.

401
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,030
Over a month?

402
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:41,160
If Lady Shiqi was feeling sick,

403
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,680
why didn't you tell your father?

404
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,440
I told him,

405
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,400
but he said it was normal.

406
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,840
Lady Shiqi.

407
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,960
Look what I've brought you today.

408
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,750
Master has brought you two
of the finest pieces

409
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,920
of white jade on the ship.

410
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,710
I hope you will be happy.

411
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,120
If there's nothing else,
I'll see you later.

412
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,230
Let me take this for you.

413
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,200
Wait.

414
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,230
You...

415
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,360
What's going on?

416
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,270
How do you feel?

417
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,030
[Everlasting]
Master Yan.

418
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,360
Don't be angry.

419
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,120
Our master really doesn't know.

420
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,810
Master Yan.

421
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,550
- He...
- Mr. Yue.

422
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,610
Why didn't you tell me that Master Zhou

423
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,640
was also courting Lady Shiqi?

424
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,540
Master Yan.

425
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,070
He's just a despicable dude.

426
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,680
He's not courting Lady Shiqi

427
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,880
but bullying us.

428
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,160
But merchants
don't compete with officials.

429
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,360
About this marriage,
let's forget about it.

430
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,270
I'll stay out of your business

431
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,400
of selling your daughter.

432
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,710
Master Yan, wait.

433
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,990
You've paid the bride price,

434
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,070
and I've rebuffed the others.

435
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,360
Governor Zhou will not allow Master Zhou

436
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,160
to marry Lady Shiqi.

437
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
What will happen

438
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,880
to Lady Shiqi if you withdraw?

439
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,550
Of course,

440
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,470
I love Lady Shiqi.

441
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,550
Good.

442
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,920
If you say so,

443
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,400
we can talk about anything else.

444
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,470
OK.

445
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,550
You know

446
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,360
I've raised her for 16 years.

447
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,200
She's like my own daughter.

448
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,960
If she marries you,

449
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,400
we'll never see each other again.

450
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,750
Give me 50,000 gold and take her away,
as you said before.

451
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,270
You can bargain on the dowry
and bride price.

452
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,510
Don't go.

453
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,510
You can bargain.

454
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,680
If I give you 50,000 gold,

455
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,550
what will be your dowry?

456
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,960
We have a dowry.

457
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,510
Just a moment.

458
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,680
It's a fine piece of jade.

459
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,230
You do love Lady Shiqi.

460
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,120
I'll take these boxes of dowry.

461
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,510
Let's make a note.

462
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,790
A note for the dowry?

463
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,600
You really don't have to

464
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,990
worry about Master Zhou.

465
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,510
Governor Zhou will surely

466
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,360
teach him a good lesson these days.

467
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
We should take this opportunity
to finalize the marriage.

468
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,920
In three days, take Lady Shiqi away.

469
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,200
Where can he find you?

470
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,360
What if he comes to you

471
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,600
after I've taken her away?

472
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,510
Don't worry.

473
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,640
He has something on me.

474
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,310
Duanwu.

475
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,610
- Duanwu, let's...
- Come here.

476
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,990
Do you know where the clinic

477
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,400
that can test for drugs is?

478
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,160
Yes, I do.

479
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,840
Duanwu, you...

480
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,440
I'm fine.

481
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,270
I'll talk to you later.
Take me there. Let's go.

482
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,640
Duanwu, this way.

483
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,790
- Come again next time.
- OK.

484
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,740
[Shaozhou Inn]

485
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,440
Poison in the goat's milk?

486
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,030
Lady Shiqi and Mr. Yue...

487
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
Why did he poison her?

488
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,550
Jade Guanyin is more valuable

489
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,960
when she no longer carves jade.

490
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,960
After Lady Shiqi's marriage,

491
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,440
she will no longer bear the name Yue,

492
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,470
and Mr. Yue won't let others have that.

493
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,600
In this way,

494
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,990
all his jades

495
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,990
can appreciate in value.

496
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,680
He's so evil.

497
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,200
That's his daughter.

498
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,230
I have to save her.

499
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,400
Save her?

500
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,360
Shrimp.

501
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,640
Meet me in the backyard
with Loud tomorrow.

502
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,640
I'll find a way to bring Lady Shiqi out.

503
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,600
Do you understand me?

504
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,230
OK.

505
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,550

506
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,120
Come in.

507
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,310
What's going on?

508
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,960
I have a secret about the Yue family.

509
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,990
It concerns Lady Shiqi's safety.

510
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,840
Do you want to know?

511
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,920
Give me that.

512
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,640
If you want to know,

513
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,230
tell me what I want to know first.

514
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,160
What is the relationship
between the Cui's, Yue's, and Yan's?

515

What do they have to do with my mom?

don't you?

519
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,960
You dare to make a deal with me now.

520
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,880
Give it to me.

521
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,710
I know

522
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,200
the Apsaras statue in the Yue family.

523
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,920
The Apsaras statue in the Yue family?

524
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,310
How do you know that?

525
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,310
Please tell me
what I want to know first.

526
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,440
Give it to me.

527
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,160
Why are you looking up
the Lotus Terrace Apsaras statue?

528
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,160
Tell me.

529
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,200
You're fooling me with this.

530
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,440
What are you doing?

531
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,270
If you hate the Yue family so much,

532
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,120
why did you marry Yue Yunxiu?

533
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,360
What are you doing to the Yue family?

534
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,960
Whether it's the Cui family
or the Yue family,

535
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,990
they all have to die.

536
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,120
What about Yue Yunxiu?

537
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,310
It has nothing to do with her.

538
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,470
She knows nothing.

539
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,440
This has nothing to do with you.

540
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,790
Mr. Yue is poisoning her.

541
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,710
It's Muscle Weakening Powder.

542
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,840
Mr. Yue is going to destroy her hand.

543
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,400
Master.

544
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,990
There's a man from Jinyang
named Zhang Si wanting to see you.

545
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,840
Jinyang?

546
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,270
Has Lady Shiqi's reputation
spread this far?

547
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,680
But it makes sense.

548
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,400
Even the rich merchants
of the Western Regions are courting her.

549
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,070
Of course.

550
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,470
Everyone knows

551
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,750
you have a Jade Guanyin.

552
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,470
Let him in.

553
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,470
Yes, sir.

554
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,550
Come on.

555
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,310
Put the lid on.

556
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,990
Mr. Yue.

557
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,990
Mr. Zhang, what can I do for you?

558
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,640
Ten tael of pearls.

559
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,960
Ten tael of pearls?

560
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,160
What do you mean?

561
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,980
[Cui]

562
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,600
You're from the Cui family?

563
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,720
Go away.

564
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,920
I am asking them to find you.

565
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,150
You sent the pearls

566
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,880
so long after Cui Ding died.

567
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,280
It's too late.

568
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,190
I still have to go to Yangzhou

569
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,760
to talk to your patriarch.

570
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:26,470
That's enough.

571
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,190
Where are the pearls?

572
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,840
Where are the pearls?

573
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,190
Didn't you meet Lady Shijiu
in Guangzhou?

574
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,280
How dare you mention that?

575
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,760
You've hired a guy of unknown gender

576
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,510
to work there.

577
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,550
She knows nothing.

578
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,960
Then what should we know?

579
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,760
What do you know?

580
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,440
I know that Cui's Pearl Farm gives
you ten tael of pearls every year,

581
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
but you don't know

582
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,150
that Cui's Pearl Farm is suspected
of fraud in tribute pearls.

583
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,470
His Holiness has already sent people
to Hepu to investigate.

584
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,030
I don't know

585
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,670
if you are involved.

586
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,720
So you're not from the Cui family?

587
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,840
Of course not.

588
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,150
I'm here to investigate the Cui family.

589
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,280
Then who are you?

590
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,320
The Institute of Literary Studies'
bachelor, Zhang Jinran.

591
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
I've been ordered by Prince Ying

592
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,960
to investigate Cui's Pearl Farm
and tribute pearls.

593
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,440
Please.

594
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,550
You...

595
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,720
We have nothing to do
with Cui's Pearl Farm.

596
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,470
Then how do you explain
about ten tael of pearls?

597
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,240
It's all normal business.

598
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:46,630
We supply Cui's Pearl Farm
with fine jade every year,

599
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,960
and Cui's Pearl Farm gives
ten tael of pearls to us every year.

600
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,400
Normal business?

601
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,960
These pearls are tribute pearls.

602
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,840
When it comes to tribute pearls,

603
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,960
I must investigate properly.

604
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,550
It's...

605
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,630
I...

606
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,960
I really didn't know
they were tribute pearls.

607
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,070
How did I  know that Cui Jingchu

608
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,840
dared use these tribute pearls
to cover his debt?

609
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,110
You should investigate him.

610
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,400
I don't know the inside story.

611
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,920
Do you really not know

612
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,960
or are you pretending not to know?

613
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,470
Mr. Yue.

614
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,110
Think carefully before you answer me.

615
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,550
I really don't know.

616
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,470
This time, Cui's Pearl Farm is suspected
of tribute pearl fraud,

617
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,320
so the court's deficit from previous years
needs to be made up.

618
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,240
Since you receive ten tael of pearls
from Cui's Pearl Farm every year,

619
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,070
you need to pay this money.

620
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,670
How much?

621
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,360
Not much.

622
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:05,280
40,000,000 mace.

623
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,110
The government will give you

624
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,550
the official paperwork later.

625
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,590
It's...

626
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,990
It's going to wipe out

627
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,960
the Yue family.

628
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,150
They're killing me.

629
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,110
So it depends on whether you want

630
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,070
to keep your money or your life.

631
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,590
Tribute pearls can be made good,

632
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,760
but if they involve something else,

633
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,190
it's too late.

634
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,510
Mr. Yue.

635
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,630
You really need to think about

636
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,440
what fine jade you have to make

637
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,880
every year to make up

638
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,990
for this ten tael of pearls.

639
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,510
When you do, feel free to come to me.

640
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,320
Looks like Zhang Jinran
really is Prince Ying's man.

641
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,630
[Yue's Mansion]

642
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:07,030
Duanwu.

643
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:07,670
Mr. Zhang.

644
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,030
Why are you here?

645
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,550
I just came to Shaozhou

646
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,880
but didn't expect to run into you again.

647
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,670
Mr. Zhang,
I really have something to do today,

648
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,800
so let's talk about it some other time.

649
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,470
Why is Mr. Zhang at Yue's house?

650
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,070
I have something to ask Mr. Yue.

651
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,240
Is Mr. Zhang investigating
the Yue family?

652
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,800
What have you found out?

653
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,360
Did you know about the Yan family
in Yangzhou?

654
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
What did you find out?

655
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,720
The Yan family was the newest jeweler
in Yangzhou

656
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,400
and traded with the Western Regions

657
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,800
to bring in a lot of novelty jewelry.

658
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,030
Their unique styles
took Yangzhou by storm.

659
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,470
Within a few years,

660
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,590
they had made a name for themselves
in the Yangzhou jewelry market

661
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,440
and might overtake established jewelers
like the Cui and Zheng families.

662
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,960
They also helped the two countries
make friends

663
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,240
by trading with the Western Regions
and helping the State of Kang

664
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,510
to bring gifts to Tang.

665
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,840
[Yan]
The Yan family

666
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,150
would have become the hottest in Chang'an
if they had succeeded,

667
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,550
but the gift was shattered

668
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,400
in public during a ceremony

669
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,750
at the Imperial Palace.

670
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,760
After an investigation,

671
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,480
it was discovered
that even the tribute jade was a fake.

672
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,830
The Emperor was furious

673
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,150
and blamed the Yan family,

674
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,560
but at that time,
no one in the Yan family had survived.

675
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:21,720
The case...

676
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,030
The case became an open one.

677
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,800
Is the gift
the Lotus Terrace Apsaras statue?

678
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,760
Yes.

679
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,400
So

680
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,800
the Yan family is the former owner
of Cui's Pearl Farm?

681
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,030
That's right.

682
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,110
Please spare me for your wife's sake.

683
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,840
How dare you mention my mother?

684
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,670
I also know a secret.

685
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,190
Your sister is still alive.

686
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,510
I am Yan Zijing, from Western Regions,
and I ask your permission to marry her.

687
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,030
Do you really want to marry Lady Shiqi?

688
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,150
Can't I?

689
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
Why?

690
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,240
Do you really have nothing to do
with the Yan family in Yangzhou?

691
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,630
They've all been executed.

692
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,030
No one survived.

693
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,070
What do I have to do with them?

694
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,550
If you'd taken care of it last night,

695
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,550
it wouldn't be like this today,

696
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,800
and I'd have succeeded
with the merchants from South Sea.

697
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,320
It wasn't enough.

698
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,240
Wasn't enough?

699
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,190
Duanwu?

700
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,760
Duanwu?

701
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,590
Have you found something?

702
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,070
Mr. Zhang.

703
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,280
Thank you

704
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,670
for telling me so much,

705
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,240
but I'm really in a hurry.

706
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,240
Let's talk about it some other time.

707
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,400
Duanwu.

708
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,280
My hand.

709
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,400
My hand.

710
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,670
What's wrong with my hand?

711
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,470
Why can't I feel my hand?

712
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,320
My hand. Look at my hand.

713
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,990
Why can't I even hold a carving knife?

714
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,280
My hand.

715
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,030
My hand.

716
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,550
What's wrong with my hand?

717
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,920
- Does it hurt? Let me see.
- My hand.

718
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,760
Why can't I even

719
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,990
- hold a carving knife?
- Come with me.

720
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:19,150
- I'm going to my dad.
- Lady Shiqi.

721
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,440
- I'm going to my dad.
- Lady Shiqi.

722
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,550
- Lady Shiqi. Yue Yunxiu.
- Gonna go to my dad.

723
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,320
Look at me.

724
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,550
I'll take you to the best clinic
in Haozhou.

725
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,880
Don't be afraid.

726
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,510
Let's go.

727
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,150
Come on.

728
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,510
Master Zhou's jade has arrived.

729
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,150
It's all fake.

730
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,030
[Testimonial]
A coward.

731
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,510
He told us all about his work
with the Yue family

732
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,240
and easily wrote the testimonial

733
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,470
before we did anything.

734
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,150
Mr. Yue.

735
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,720
My good son-in-law.

736
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,670
You are flattering me.

737
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,960
I have come today

738
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,920
to ask you about one thing.

739
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,990
Please speak.
