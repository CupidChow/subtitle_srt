76
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,360
there's a purple star.

77
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,360
It was once a wandering star in the desert,

78
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,190
until it met another wandering star

79
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,160
above the Lake Zijing.

80
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,630
From then on, they stopped wandering.

81
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,510
The two stars stayed together every day.

82
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,630
They say that as long as two lovers

83
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,000
stand beneath Mount Zijing

84
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,190
and witness the meeting of the two stars,

85
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,750
they will be lifelong lovers.

86
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,200

Is that okay?

89
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,320

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000

91
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,030
they'll stay together?

102

No.

165
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:10,600
It's glass.

166
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,720
It's kiln-fired.

167
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,750
Kiln-fired glass?

168
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,000

you can see the traces from firing.

So beautiful.

175
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,720
The craft of kiln-firing glass is difficult.

176

But back in the day, our Yan family

177
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,320

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,030

180
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,000
You know how to make it?

181
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
I, of course...

182
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,910
don't know.

183
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,320
But I watched them make it when I was little.

184
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,150
Maybe

185
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,480
we can study it together sometime.

186
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,320

Not buying one?

188

No need. Why would we buy that?

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,240
Nuts!

193
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
Sir, buy some nuts!

194
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,720
Big, fragrant, and crunchy!

195
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,670
We just finished the nuts we bought last time.

196
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,200
I didn't expect to find them here too.

197
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,910
How abut we buy some here?

198
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,240
Get as many as you want.

199
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,390
After all, the Master is treating.

200
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,550
Yes, let's get them!

201
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,720
I'll take this bag.

202
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,600
This one's good.

203
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,390
This one's the best!

204
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,600
We'll take them all!

205
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,840
Got it! Thank you, sir!

206
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,720
How much?

207
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,600
A hundred and fifty cash.

208
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,320
A hundred...

209
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
A hundred and fifty cash.

210
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,480
That's not too pricey,

211
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,960
just a bit more than in Guangzhou.

212
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:46,240
Thank you, sir.

213
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Thank you, Accountant Wei.

214
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,150
Let's go enjoy some wine and meat.

215
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,600
With these nuts as a side,

216
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,720
it'll be perfect.

217
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,720
We just got here,

218
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,120
and there's still a lot of business to handle.

219
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,720
Let's move on.

220
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,480
Miss, the Master is treating!

221
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,910
Just listen to Accountant Wei.

222
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Trust her.

223
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,200
That's right.

224
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,120
Trusting her is always the right call.

225
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
Accountant Wei, try these nuts.

226
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,840
They're really good.

227
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,480
Look at these nuts,

228
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,670
full and crisp with every bite,

229
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,790
perfect for snacking while you're working

230
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,840
on the books.

231
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,080
Thank you.

232
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,550
And look at these walnuts,

233
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,320
good color, full meat.

234
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,600
When you're up late doing accounts,

235
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,240
they're perfect to fuel up with, right?

236
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
What's that supposed to mean?

237
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,910
Are you saying I'm slow at doing accounts?

238
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,080
Don't worry,

239
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,840
I remember your accounts very well.

240
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,840
You're the one who should boost your brain.

241
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,320
Well, I mean...

242
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,840
If I didn't owe the convoy money,

243
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,200
I wouldn't even bother with you!

244
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,460
[Wuyi Residence]

245
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,670
Yuchi!

246
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,510
Long time no see!

247
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,480
I hear you've made something of yourself,

248
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,840
got your own trading convoy now.

249
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,920
Hardly.

250
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,910
These are just small trades.

251
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,130
How could they compare

252
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,510
to the grand setup you have here?

253
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
And this is?

254
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,840
Come on, let me introduce you to each other.

255
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
This is Master Yuchi.

256
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,550
This is Duanwu.

257
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,360
Your girlfriend?

258
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,550
With you by his side,

259
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,910
I feel relieved.

260
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,720
If he ever bullies you,

261
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,600
just let me know,

262
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
and I'll set him straight!

263
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Greetings, Master Yuchi.

264
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,550
Miss Duanwu,

265
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,480
why do you look so familiar?

266
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,240
Have we met somewhere before?

267
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,030
We shouldn't have.

268
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,550
I was in Hepu before,

269
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,160
then I joined the convoy,

270
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,200
following him all the way.

271
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,270
We would've had no chance to meet...

272
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,200
Hepu?

273
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,590
Do you know the Cui's Pearl Farm?

274
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,590
Yuchi,

275
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
Duanwu

276
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,480
is Yu Shi's daughter.

277
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,680
Back then, I...

278
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,480
Pass down the order:

279
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,480
make sure every guest is well treated.

280
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,720
Yes, sir.

281
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,790
Miss Duanwu, please come with me.

282
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,310
Let me take you somewhere.

283
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,240
Don't worry. Let's go.

284
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,510
You guys settle in first.

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,750
Be careful.

286
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,070
Please, this way.

287
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,270
This is the room your father used to stay in.

288
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,030
Seeing it would bring back memories,

289
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,550
so I haven't opened this door for years.

290
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,480
Your father and I

291
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,830
were both apprentices in Gandhara jade carving.

292
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,510
Later, I injured my hand,

293
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,070
and couldn't continue refining my craft.

294
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,310
I could only assist our master

295
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,640
with odd jobs.

296
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,640
But your father was very gifted.

297
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,350
He went to Tang to showcase his talents,

298
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,240
and there he met your mother at the Yan family.

299
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,720
We parted ways

300
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,310
and hadn't seen each other for many years.

301
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:45,880
Until later,

302
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,270
when he accompanied the Master of the Yan family

303
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,160
on a treasure-guarding mission to Kang.

304
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,480
He fell ill along the way

305
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,960
and stayed here for a while.

306
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,640
It was then

307
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,960
that I found out your mother was expecting.

308
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,720
But I never imagined

309
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,720
that your father and the convoy

310
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,750
would be attacked by the Black Dragon Bandits, perishing in the desert.

311
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
Your mother also disappeared without a trace.

312
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,200
I never thought

313
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:09,880
that years later,

314
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,030
I'd see you here.

315
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,830
It seems fated.

316
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,720
This is the glasscraft technique of our Yan family.

317
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,720
Yan family glass?

318
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,830
Thank you, Master Yuchi,

319
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,200
for telling me all this.

320
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,070
It's all in the past now.

321
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:39,920
Let's not dwell on it.

322
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,200
Keep her company here.

323
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,310
I'll go make some preparations.

324
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Since you're here, stay a bit longer.

325
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,960
I'll take good care of you.

326
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,750
No need to bother.

327
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,240
We'll only be here for a few days.

328
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,440
It wasn't easy for you to come here.

329
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,480
Stay a bit longer.

330
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,920
We have urgent business in Kang.

331
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,350
You're going to Piti Spring?

332
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,350
Yes.

333
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,350
The Black Dragon Bandits are ruthless.

334
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,160
Do you know how many convoys

335
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,400
have gone mising in recent years?

336
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,200
We've already made up our minds.

337
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,400
Recently, the Black Dragon Bandits

338
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,920
have become even more violent, committing all kinds of evil.

339
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,680
They can block the Hexi route at will.

340
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,200
So many souls have perished by their blades,

341
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,200
and countless people have been left homeless,

342
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,070
families destroyed and torn apart.

343
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,830
The world isn't supposed to be this way.

344
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,960
But, Yuchi,

345
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
my mind is set.

346
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Keep her company.

347
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,350
These are your father's things from back then.

348
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,000
I never met him,

349
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,790
so I don't know

350
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,070
what he was like when he was alive.

351
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,750
But coming here today,

352
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
I understand now

353
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,590
why my mother taught me so much.

354
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,720
It was for this.

355
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,960
Your father

356
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,590
was a very gentle and refined man,

357
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,720
and also very talented.

358
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,440
When I was little,

359
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,720
I often went to his workshop to find him.

360
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,830
He would always

361
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,830
show me his proud creations.

362
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
And he was the only one

363
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,830
who didn't treat me like a child.

364
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,830
Later, when he was with your mother,

365
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,920
they lived very happily together.

366
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,680
So that means,

367
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,200
they fell in love at the Yan family in Yangzhou?

368
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,400
That's right.

369
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,240
Back then, I always saw this scene:

370
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,590
your father focusing on his jade work,

371
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,750
and your mother quietly sitting beside him,

372
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,480
sewing new clothes for him.

373
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,400
Perhaps my mother never imagined

374
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,200
that I would end up here.

375
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,240
If you hadn't been lucky enough to meet me back then,

376
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,030
by now,

377
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,270
you'd probably have been buried underground for years.

378
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,590
You're still so reckless,

379
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,590
knowing it's poisonous but still taking risks.

380
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,000
I think you

381
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,920
just don't want to live long.

382
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,400
You're too kind.

383
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
The water in Black Dragon Pool is toxic.

384
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,440
The medicine I gave you before

385
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,200
can only suppress the poison,

386
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,350
keeping it from flaring up.

387
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,960
But to cure it completely

388
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,030
is very difficult.

389
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,310
Controlling it is good enough.

390
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,920
But...

391
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,720
maybe there's a way.

392
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,960
What way?

393
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,480
A few years ago, when you treat the poison here,

394
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,750
I got curious about its properties.

395
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,880
As they say, everything in the world has its counter.

396
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,160
And now,

397
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,640
I believe I've found an antidote to neutralize the poison.

398
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,880
Give me a little more time,

399
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,750
and maybe the poison inside you

400
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,960
will gradually be dispelled.

401
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,110
Really?

402
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,480
Believe it or not.

403
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,880
Of course I believe you.

404
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,920
Only, the price...

405
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,030
Price is no issue.

406
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,110
I don't mind parting with my gold and silver.

407
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,480
A few years ago, when you came to me,

408
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,920
you looked like someone

409
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,920
ready to gamble with his life.

410
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,790
But now,

411
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,960
you actually value it.

412
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:11,740
[Jewelry Designs]

413
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Duanwu,

414
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,820
thank you for the hairpin you made for me.

415
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,640
I really like it.

416
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,790
If you like it, I can make you another.

417
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,480
Thank you!

418
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,200
Accountant Wei!

419
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,440
- Give it back to me! - Accountant Wei!

420
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,110
Mr. Cao went to great lengths

421
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,400
to bring you this pot plant.

422
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,200
Cao Da! You...

423
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,240
What are you fussing about?

424
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,680
I searched high and low for something this cute

425
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,550
to give to Accountant Wei.

426
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,480
Why make a fuss...

427
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,240
You're giving her a cactus?

428
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,720
Why?

429
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,480
Do you think I'm interested in her?

430
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
How could that be?

431
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,030
I'm not interested in you either.

432
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,110
By the way,

433
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,270
when will pay back what you owe the convoy?

434
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,790
Accountant Wei, I was wrong.

435
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,310
Please give me three more months.

436
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,240
Three months?

437
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,030
Can you pay it back in three months?

438
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,720
If I can't pay it back in three months,

439
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,030
I'll pledge myself to you.

440
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,470
Are you crazy?

441
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,080
What nonsense are you spouting?

442
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,150
No, I meant...

443
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,600
I'll find you a suitable groom,

444
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,150
so you can pledge yourself.

445
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,230
Thanks, but no thanks.

446
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:09,800
Cao Da,

447
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,080
with the people you know,

448
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,080
how could any of them be a match for our accountant?

449
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,360
Exactly!

450
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,600
Your friends are all good-for-nothings!

451
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,120
None of them are worthy of our accountant!

452
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,230
Hurry up, pay back the money!

453
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,600
Leader...

454
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
Don't give me that puppy-dog look.

455
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,910
Accountant Wei, rules are rules.

456
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,600
The convoy has its principles.

457
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,390
Hand it over.

458
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,710
You used convoy money to go drinking.

459
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,660
What's that about?

460
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,040
Hurry up, hand over the money!

461
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:34,840
- Yeah, pay up! - Well...

462
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,230
I really don't have any money on me.

463
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,390
If I had money, I would've paid you.

464
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,150
Shrimp.

465
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,360
Stop scratching me!

466
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,910
- I'm not scratching. Hold still! - Hurry up!

467
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,600
Alright, fine.

468
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,600
Forget it.

469
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,470
Master.

470
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:49,600
Master.

471
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,840
I just said,

472
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,150
forget it.

473
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,280
Forget what?

474
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Your debt to the convoy.

475
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,390
Thank you, Master!

476
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,000
I wish you and leader

477
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,160
harmony and happiness every day.

478
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,720
Are you cold?

479
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,480
I'm alright.

480
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,160
You're always together, never enough, huh?

481
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,030
Come on, let's go.

482
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,000
Time to eat!

483
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,750
My treat, let's go eat.

484
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,310
I'm not going with you guys.

485
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,270
What's wrong?

486
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,260
What's with you? You're acting strange.

487
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,790
Strange?

488
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,030
It's nothing. The Master said to forget it.

489
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,240
Something good's happening,

490
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,880
but I can't tell you today.

491
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,270
Why not?

492
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,960
Just can't tell you.

493
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,750
Tell me quietly.

494
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,030
Quietly tell you?

495
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,480
It's that now I have you.

496
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,400
Actually, there's something I wanted to discuss with you.

497
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,550
Why so serious? Discuss what?

498
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,960
What's it about?

499
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,720
Master Yuchi said

500
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,480
going to Piti Spring is extremely dangerous.

501
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,550
If we take Shrimp and the others,

502
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,200
I don't feel confident.

503
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,750
Could we leave them here

504
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,200
and pick them up when we return?

505
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,920
You're thoughtful as always.

506
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,200
But...

507
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,030
I've actually been wanting to ask you.

508
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,680
Will you agree

509
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
to stay here with them

510
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:35,690
and wait for my return?

511
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,640
I can't let you take this risk alone.

512
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
But this journey is full of danger,

513
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,380
even I'm not fully confident.

514
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,520
Precisely because it's dangerous,

515
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,030
that I want to face it with you

516
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,750
Just this once, can you...

517
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,880
Walk by your side.

518
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,880
I'll be right by your side.

519
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,480
Didn't I say before?

520
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,200
I can be your shield.

521
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,270
Alright then.

522
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,200
In that case,

523
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,110
I'll rely on you for protection.

524
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,240
If we leave Shrimp and the others here,

525
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,960
will Master Yuchi mind?

526
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,480
What are you thinking?

527
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,880
Don't worry.

528
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,720
Yuchi is a good man,

529
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,720
very kind.

530
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,030
And I can tell,

531
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,310
he seems to like Shrimp quite a bit.

532
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,350
Don't you like him too?

533
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,790
If he were a bit quieter,

534
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,350
I'd like him even more.

535
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:14,240
I'll go tell him.

536
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,400
[Duanwu]

537
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,200
Good!

538
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,750
Almost as good as mine.

539
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,750
Here,

540
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,960
I'll reward you with a glass bead.

541
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,790
Guess which hand it's in, and it's yours.

542
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,270
Which hand?

543
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,160
This one!

544
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,400
Nope.

545
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,400
Guess again.

546
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,960
Yuchi!

547
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,510
Oh, you're here!

548
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,350
Shrimp.

549
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,350
Duanwu, Master!

550
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,070
Look! I wrote this!

551
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,030
You wrote it?

552
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,480
The Master taught you?

553
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,590
Thank you, Master!

554
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,400
Shrimp has been with me for so long,

555
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,720
but he's never learned to write.

556
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,160
He's actually very smart.

557
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,480
Shrimp,

558
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,960
your writing is really good.

559
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,720
But I feel like Mr. Cao could write as well.

560
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,110
[Duanwu]
He can't write. I'll have to teach him.

561
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,720
Then go on.

562
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,640
Well then,

563
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,200
Master Yuchi, I'll take my leave.

564
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,160
Come, sit down and let's talk.

565
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,750
Come on.

566
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,880
- Sit. - sit.

567
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,110
Come on.

568
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:37,960
Yuchi,

569
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,790
I...

570
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,960
have a favor to ask.

571
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,920
Just tell me.

572
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,070
Duanwu and I were thinking

573
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,720
this journey will surely be dangerous.

574
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,720
So, we'd like

575
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,030
to leave Shrimp and the others

576
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,240
in your care.

577
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,000
We just wanted to check with you, Master.

578
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,510
If it's too much trouble,

579
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,270
we can find another way.

580
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,400
To be honest,

581
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,790
I've long grown tired

582
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,750
of these old faces here.

583
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Your arrival

584
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,590
has brought me so much joy and help.

585
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,880
As long as you're willing,

586
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,680
I'd be more than happy to help.

587
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,920
That's great.

588
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,960
Thank you.

589
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,720
Zijing,

590
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,960
don't think I'm nagging.

591
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,510
Your parents' spirits above

592
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,030
wouldn't want you risking your life either.

593
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,440
It's been so long already,

594
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,110
when does revenge end?

595
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,480
I understand everything you're saying.

596
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,550
But this vengeance

597
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,200
is not just for the Yan family.

598
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,240
Langhuan Dockyard may seem prosperous and peaceful,

599
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,960
but many here have been torn from their families.

600
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,110
All of this

601
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,960
is because of the Black Dragon Bandits.

602
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:02,240
So, the day the Black Dragon Bandits are gone,

603
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,030
life will improve.

604
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,680
Tang's tea, porcelain, and silk

605
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,880
will flow to the Western Regions,

606
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,160
and Western gemstones and jade

607
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,510
will reach Tang.

608
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,110
Then Hexi

609
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,680
will flourish like never before.

610
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,510
All these years,

611
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,680
you haven't changed a bit.

612
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,160
Alright.

613
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,110
Then I wish

614
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,400
you both a safe journey.

615
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,960
May you return soon.

616
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,200
I'm still waiting to drink your wedding wine.

617
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,750
Master,

618
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,550
it's best not to tell Shrimp and the others about this.

619
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,750
Understood.

620
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,000
Here,

621
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,110
to your safe return.

622
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,960
Duanwu!

623
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,960
Duanwu!

624
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,510
Were you trying to scare me?

625
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,110
No, I wasn't.

626
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,720
I just wanted you to try this candied fruit.

627
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,960
Thank you, Duanwu.

628
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,110
Take it with you.

629
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:52,400
By the way,

630
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,350
did you make this?

631
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,160
Why?

632
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,680
Isn't it beautiful?

633
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,640
Really beautiful.

634
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,960
You really made this?

635
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,000
Look,

636
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,790
there are two stars here, right?

637
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,790
If you wrap them like this,

638
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,680
they'll connect together.

639
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,510
What are you thinking?

640
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,550
They're just like you and my brother-in-law.

641
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,710
Shrimp,

642
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,190
you're a little adult now.

643
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,400
You have to look after Accountant Wei

644
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,920
with Loud, Cao Da, and the others.

645
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,550
By Master Yuchi's side,

646
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,710
you'll need to do everything,

647
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,960
and learn everything you can.

648
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,880
The more you learn, the better.

649
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,630
But,

650
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,660
writing is really hard.

651
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,760
When Master Yuchi plays with me,

652
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,840
he's really nice.

653
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,970
But when he teaches me writing, he's so strict.

654
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,570
If I make even one mistake, I get punished.

655
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,190
Shrimp, you're the smartest.

656
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I know

657
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,510
you'll learn a lot.

658
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,480
You need to learn all the things

659
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,960
you never learned before.

660
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,190
Then, when the time comes,

661
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
should we open a shop here?

662
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,110
You like it here?

663
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:07,960
Of course!

664
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,070
Then, Mr. Cao, Loud, and I

665
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,320
will work for you.

666
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,150
Lady Shiqi will carve jade for us,

667
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,130
and

668
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,920
Mr. Zhang will write the sign for our shop.

669
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,280
Accountant Wei will do the books,

670
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,960
and the Master will greet guests outside.

671
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,230
You'll draw the designs.

672
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,480
That lineup would be grand!

673
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,480
Let's do it your way.

674
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,480
That sounds great!

675
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,670
Shrimp,

676
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,000
no matter where I am,

677
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,960
I'll always find you.

678
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:05,480
Our supplies have to pass through this route.

679
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,440
Generals, you must guard it well.

680
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,230
Yes, sir!

681
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,550
General Pei, Mr. Zhang requests an audience.

682
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,320
Shijie!

683
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,480
Jinran!

684
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,710
What brings you to Hexi?

685
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
It's been so long,

686
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,590
you're still as mighty as ever!

687
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,710
I received a letter from Second Brother

688
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,880
saying you're defending Hexi,

689
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,280
so I came specially.

690
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,190
His Majesty has plans for Hexi,

691
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,120
and sent me here

692
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,800
to reopen the long-closed Daqi Road.

693
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,230
And this is?

694
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
This is my friend,

695
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,710
Lady Shiqi.

696
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,880
Greetings, General Pei.

697
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,960
She injured her hand earlier,

698
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,280
and I heard your army has a military doctor

699
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,550
skilled in treating hand injuries,

700
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
so I brought her here for help.

701
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,480
Conditions in the army are tough.

702
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,030
It's a lot to ask of you, Miss.

703
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,190
Guards!

704
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,800
Take the miss to Doctor Liu.

705
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,630
Yes, sir!

706
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,670
Thank you, General Pei.

707
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,670
This way, Miss.

708
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,150
Over here.

709
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,280
Jinran, this time you're here

710
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,760
not just for this young miss, right?

711
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,360
Of course not.

712
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,710
I came here

713
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,030
on behalf of Tang

714
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,760
and of the people along the Western trade routes,

715
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,360
to ask you to lend me troops

716
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,190
to wipe out the Black Dragon Bandits.

717
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,480
Wipe out the Black Dragon Bandits?

718
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:29,400
This matter

719
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,480
has always been a sore point for me.

720
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,550
The Black Dragon Bandits are elusive,

721
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,110
stationed beyond Tang's borders.

722
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,400
If we rashly deploy troops,

723
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,670
it could

724
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,480
easily stir up border disputes.

725
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,710
You're defending Hexi.

726
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,710
Fighting bandits is part of that duty.

727
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,550
The Black Dragon Bandits often stay outside our borders,

728
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,110
but they frequently raid our lands,

729
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,480
attacking the trade routes.

730
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,960
The people suffer greatly.

731
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,550
You can't just sit back.

732
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,030
I know all of this.

733
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,880
But there are rules in the military.

734
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,230
Shijie,

735
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,360
aren't rules made to be broken?

736
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,150
Jinran,

737
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,400
you must have another clever plan in mind.

738
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,630
It's not much of a clever plan, really.

739
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,590
If I can lure the Black Dragon Bandits out,

740
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,880
and it so happens

741
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,030
that you are fighting bandits at the border...

742
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,760
Now that we happen to cross paths,

743
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,320
you won't just stand by, will you?

744
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,190
Jinran,

745
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
you always have the craftiest ideas!

746
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,960
Come on, tell me your plan.

747
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,480
Come on.

748
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
Our men are assembled

749
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,960
and ready to move at any time.

750
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,110
Good.

751
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,550
What about Mr. Zhang?

752
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,190
There won't be any issues on his end, right?

753
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,590
He's already arrived at Pei Shijie's camp.

754
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,360
There shouldn't be any problems.

755
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,550
What about supplies and weapons?

756
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,070
Don't worry. Everything will be arranged.

757
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,630
I'll go make further preparations.

758
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,440
It's alright.

759
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,510
Don't worry.

760
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,960
With you here,

761
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,880
I have no worries.

762
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,150
By the way,

763
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,550
I wanted to discuss something with you.

764
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,070
Let me hold onto the blood-stained pearl.

765
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,510
The blood-stained pearl

766
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,190
is the very thing the Black Dragon Bandits covet.

767
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,880
Keeping it with you is dangerous.

768
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,760
Plus, this time,

769
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,800
we're using it to lure out them.

770
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,670
I don't know

771
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,110
what's so special about this blood-stained pearl.

772
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,800
Why is everyone so eager to possess it?

773
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,110
Inside the blood-stained pearl

774
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:02,000
is a map to the treasures of Gulistan.

775
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,800
Gulistan?

776
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,440
Yes.

777
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,760
Back then, Kang discovered this vein of ore,

778
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,150
intending to present it to Tang through the Apsaras statue.

779
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,150
But word got out unexpectedly.

780
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,110
So what the Black Dragon Bandits covet

781
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,030
is actually the treasure of Gulistan.

782
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,550
But if you keep the blood-stained pearl,

783
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,670
won't you be in danger too?

784
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,920
Don't worry.

785
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,510
I told you,

786
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,320
everything is arranged.

787
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,960
Here, Jinran.

788
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,880
I toast to you and Master Yan.

789
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,150
You two, full of courage and wisdom,

790
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,630
risk your lives for the peace

791
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,630
of our borders.

792
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,350
I truly admire you both!

793
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,630
We still need your strong support

794
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,750
to restore peace for the people at the frontier.

795
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,790
That's for sure.

796
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:05,600
Come, cheers!

797
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,600
I heard from Du Ming

798
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,150
that you and Master Yan

799
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,770
both fancy the same young lady.

800
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,700
But in the end,

801
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,520
she went with Master Yan.

802
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,480
Tell me, Fourth Brother,

803
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,630
how did you lose to him?

804
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,620
That Master Yan...

805
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,310
what's so remarkable about him?

806
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,230
That Master Yan...

807
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,630
he's actually quite ordinary.

808
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,920
It's just that...

809
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,270
she's truly unique.

810
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,230
In my whole life, I've never met

811
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,560
a woman so extraordinary.

812
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,230
I get it.

813
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,600
A good woman can't resist a persistent man.

814
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,330
You're just too reserved,

815
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,230
too worried about saving face.

816
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,960
If you like her, just tell her directly.

817
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,530
She definitely won't turn you down.

818
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,000
I did tell her,

819
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,520
and she rejected me.

820
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,310
Duanwu,

821
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,080
it's time to set off.

822
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,440
Duanwu?

823
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,670
