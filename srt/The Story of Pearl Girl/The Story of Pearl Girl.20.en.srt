The Zheng family will definitely take this opportunity

192
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,790
to hit the Cui family hard.

193
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,930
Have you ever thought

194
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,430
about today

195
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,040
when you were killing the Yangzhou Yan family?

196
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,040
You are the remnant of the Yan family.

197
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Why didn't you die?

198
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,430

Why didn't you die?

Yangzhou Yan's orphan

201
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,040
came to get revenge on you.

202
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,300
Even if I cut you to pieces,

203
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,670
I can't get rid of my hatred.

204
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,880
I've thought of a thousand ways to kill you.

205
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,400
But I won't kill you today.

206
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,430
I want you to watch

207
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,360

I will make you repay you a thousand times

for everything you have done to the Yan family.

211

I want the Cui family to be destroyed!

212
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,470
I'll make you, Cui Jingchu, wish you were dead!

213
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:13,920
Come on.

214
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,040
Don't worry.

215
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,120
I'll make the Zheng family

216

229
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,630
my Zheng family will rely on you.

230
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,080
Since you say so,

231
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,400
I'll make you drink.

232
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,710
I took office to benefit the people

233
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,320

234
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,440
which is to benefit the Zheng family.

235
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,560
Yes.

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,350
He just left,

237
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,680

238
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,510
I...

239
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,280
I'll drink.

240
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,830
Before I left Chang'an,

241
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,280
Prince Ying told me

242
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,160
that Yangzhou jewelry was famous.

243
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,310
The guild lead of the Yang Zhou jewelry guild

244
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,680
should be someone capable.

245
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Mr. Zheng,

246
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,160

247
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,510
With your words,

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,600

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,400
I heard

251
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,920
Cui Jingchu mortgaged his family's property.

252
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,640
I'm afraid the creditor has gone to him.

253
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,360
What a pity!

254
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,310
Mr. Zheng,

255
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,960
that's not what you think, right?

256
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Who are you?

257
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,600
I am the new owner of the Cui family's property.

258
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,550
I heard that the jewelry guild is going to have a regular meeting.

259
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,550
So, I came to meet you.

260
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,840
The jewelry guild has rules.

261
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,750
Even if you own the Cui family's property,

262
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,790
you're not qualified to say anything about the jewelry guild.

263
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,840
Money is nothing to me.

264
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,790
If I use all of Cui's property,

265
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,710
I can become the guild head.

266
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,070
If you want to do it,

267
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,310
you can surprise us at the jewelry guild's regular meeting.

268
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,360
You don't have to come to me.

269

Mr. Zheng, you're smart.

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,790
I'll get straight to the point.

Okay.

275
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,600
Guild director is just a title.

276
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,550
You can't run for the guild lead.

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,510
We've just arrived in Yangzhou.

382
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,310
Is she the most beautiful woman in Yangzhou?

383
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,070
Yes.

384
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,470
Where did she get her jewelry?

385
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,960
They are from Baicaojing House.

386
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,920
Lady Bai only wears jewelry from Baicaojing House.

387
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,550
Baicaojing House?

388
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,990
Is it owned by Lady Bai?

389
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:20,840
No, it's not.

390
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,510
Baicaojing House became popular

391
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,750
because of Lady Bai.

392
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,310
Lady Bai is beautiful.

393
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,680
Maybe she can be the second Lady Yu.

394
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,160
Mm.

395
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,840
Let's go.

396
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,600
Wait.

397
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,270
Who is Lady Yu?

398
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,030
Lady Yu

399
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,990
was the most popular and beautiful woman

400
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,470
in Yangzhou twenty years ago.

401
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,360
Why don't you know anything?

402
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,710
You're not locals, right?

403
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,200
Yeah, we're no locals.

404
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,550
We're curious about Yangzhou.

405
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,230
Could you tell us

406
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,510
about the most beautiful woman?

407
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,600
At the Qionghua Festival three years ago,

408
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,120
Lady Bai won the contest for the first time.

409
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,200
She made Baicaojing House

410
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,270
from mediocre to famous.

411
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,120
Got it?

412
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,920
Oh...

413
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,200
Is there anything else?

414
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,230
If nothing else,

415
00:26:59,230 --> 00:26:59,920
we'll leave.

416
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,920
-Thank you. -Thank you.

417
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,470
Let's go to Baicaojing House.

418
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,160
Okay.

419
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,360
Yunxiu.

420
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,510
It seems that the jewelry itself is not important

421
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,990
in Yangzhou.

422
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,440
What matters is the person who wears the jewelry.

423
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,750
The most beautiful woman in Yangzhou...

424
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,440
Here comes the imperial edict.

425
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,550
Zhang Jinran, the chancellor of the Institute of Literary Studies.

426
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,960
Zhang Jinran, the chancellor of the Institute of Literary Studies.

427
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,120
You're calm and ethical.

428
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,960
You're a fair man and an official.

429
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,960
You're praised for your fairness.

430
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,550
I'll make you the Inspector of Huainandao

431
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,600
to investigate the case and pacify the people.

432
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,230
Take the imperial edict.

433
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,270
I, Zhang Jinran, thank the Emperor.

434
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
[Imperial edict]

435
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,550
Jinran, you...

436
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,920
Ying.

437
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,310
I won't forget you taking care of me.

438
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,750
Before returning to Chang'an,

439
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,120
I sent a request to the Emperor.

440
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,470
I came back to take a break

441
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,790
and wait for the appointment.

442
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,230
That being the case,

443
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,030
I can't stop you.

444
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,960
You have an important mission

445
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,470
in Yangzhou.

446
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,360
If you need people or money,

447
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,360
you can go to the Zheng family.

448
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,270
They have been running a jewelry shop for many years.

449
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,070
They are the model of righteous businessmen.

450
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,400
I'll keep that in mind.

451
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,510
How are you going to Yangzhou?

452
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm going to go there by water.

453
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,600
It's good.

454
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,840
It's tiring by land.

455
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,440
Take care.

456
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
Take care.

457
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
If I hadn't sneaked into Prince Ying's Mansion

458
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,600
and sent your letter to the Emperor,

459
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,470
I don't know how long you would have stayed here.

460
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,750
I have

461
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,030
to let Ying down.

462
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,960
Well.

463
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,400
How are things out there?

464
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,640
Our people followed the clues all the way to Bianzhou.

465
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,230
We found a suspicious cargo ship.

466
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,600
It's said that the ship was filled with spices.

467
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,640
But it drafted deep.

468
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,070
It stayed in port for months

469
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,470
but didn't trade.

470
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,750
And it was well-guarded.

471
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,440
It left suddenly the night before last.

472
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,400
Where did it go?

473
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,440
It went south along the Bian River.

474
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,640
It should have gone to Yangzhou.

475
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,840
Yangzhou.

476
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,070
Did you find all the files

477
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,400
on the desert bandit robberies?

478
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,230
Yes.

479
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,200
There are two carriages of files.

480
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,920
Okay. Let's go to Yangzhou now.

481
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,790
Mr. Zhang.

482
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,600
On our way back to Chang'an,

483
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,270
someone became the official of the Governor's Office.

484
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,030
Xu Nanying?

485
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,710
He returned to the capital with guilt but was promoted.

486
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,550
Let's go.

That's the Zhenlang Pavilion.

It's magnificent.

491

492
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,200
I heard that the Zhenlang Pavilion...

Take care.

494
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,230
Is Mr. Yan here?

495
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,360
He's out.

496
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,470

Tell Duanwu the truth.

512
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,210
Otherwise, she'll hate you.

513

Let her hate me.

514
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,840
She'll be safe that way.

515

You didn't think I'd survive.

00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,720
Have some tea.

570
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,190
After a long journey,

571
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,070
we still have to ask the Zheng family for help.

572
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,840
I asked around.

573
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,190
Ms. Yu

574
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,190
is Zheng Zhiheng's mother.

575
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,320
At the Qionghua Festival three years ago,

576
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,720
Bai Niao won the contest.

577
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
Then, she won twice in a row.

578
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,400
She made the Baicaojing House famous

579
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,470
on her own.

580
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,030
I wonder...

581
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,590
If we could make a girl popular

582
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,840
like Baicaojing House.

583
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Then, we'll open a shop.

584
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,630
What does this have to do

585
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,440
with Lady Yu?

586
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,720
She was the most beautiful and popular woman

587
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,320
in Yangzhou 20 years ago.

588
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,280
Can she influence the beauty contest?

589
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,150
She is a concubine of the Zheng family.

590
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,070
She's welcomed by all the shops.

591
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,070
Everyone in the Baicaojing House

592
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,280
respects her,

593
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,760
including Bai Niao.

594
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,110
What do you think?

595
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,840
Maybe this shell

596
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,190
can help us.

597
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,490
This one.

598
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,040
Yes.

599
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,480
Umbrella.

600
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,090
Buy some cabbage.

601
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,760
Take a look.

602
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,130
Look at the umbrella.

603
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,400
Umbrella.

604
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,110
Miss,

605
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,150
these are newly arrived hairpins.

606
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,240
Umbrella.

607
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,990
These.

608
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,470
This pink one is beautiful.

609
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,070
How much is this?

610
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,030
Five hundred cash.

611
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,630
Five hundred cash?

612
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,760
Is one enough?

613
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,360
Fifty cash for one flower, right?

614
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,670
Yes.

615
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:38,990
Okay.

616
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,150
I want a pink flower.

617
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,590
Okay.

618
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,840
Do you need anything else?

619
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,740
That, and that.

620
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,150
Okay.

621
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,550
This pink flower is the most beautiful.

622
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,280
Here's your money.

623
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,280
How much is it?

624
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,070
Six cash.

625
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,330
- I will come again. - Thank you.

626
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,330
Miss, take care.

627
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,580
Vegetables.

628
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,470
Miss, have a look at the hairpins.

629
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,180
Fresh vegetables.

630
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,920
She likes pink.

631
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,840
She can't bear to buy expensive jewelry.

632
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,990
Shell inlay hairpins.

633
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,720
Shell inlay bracelets.

634
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,480
Shell inlay necklaces.

635
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,050
One thousand cash for three pieces.

636
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,630
Have a look.

637
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,700
- Yunxiu. - Those snobs.

638
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,320
They couldn't fix

639
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,150
a broken jade bracelet.

640
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,360
Come on.

641
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,630
Miss, I can fix it.

642
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,990
Can I see your broken jade bracelet?

643
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,110
It's the Zheng's place.

644
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,240
Who are you to set up a stall here?

645
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,590
Drive them away.

646
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,440
Miss.

647
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,990
We have the latest shell inlay hairpins and earrings.

648
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,280
Would you like to have a look?

649
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,590
Get out of here!

650
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,670
Okay, we'll leave.

651
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,880
Just leave!

652
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,440
Okay.

653
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,960
I'm sorry.

654
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,110
Go help her.

655
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,580
Look at this.

656
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,490
It's beautiful.

657
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,840
What are you whispering about?

658
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:09,880
Give it to me.

659
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,920
It's beautiful.

660
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,510
Here you go.

661
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:35,800
Miss, you're beautiful.

662
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,880
This ordinary earring

663
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,360
Ordinary earrings can't flatter your beauty.

664
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,840
Your skin is fair.

665
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,960
The pink shell

666
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,110
suits you well.

667
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:46,990
Stop it.

668
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:50,470
You said you could fix jewelry.

669
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,320
I have a broken jade bracelet.

670
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,550
Can you fix it?

671
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,960
Can we have a look?

672
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,880
Be careful.

673
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,030
It's Lady Yu's most precious thing.
