00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,360
Come out!

191
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,750
Where is he?

192
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,910
I... I don't know.

193
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,870
You don't know?

194
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,840
I really don't know!

195
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,240
Where is Zheng Shiyuan?

196
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,670
We don't know.

197
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,550
- We don't know! - We really don't!

198
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,030
Drag them all away.

199
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,480
Question them one by one.

200
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,630
If Zheng Shiyuan isn't caught today,

201
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,000
they'll join Su Muzhe in the afterlife!

202
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,960
Have mercy!

203
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,360
Move!

204
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,240
I really don't know!

205
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,030
- Greetings, Prince Ying. - Greetings, Prince Ying.

206
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,630
Thank you, Li Kui, for traveling so far to Yangzhou,

207
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,440
and even cleaning up the Zheng family's mess.

208
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,870
- Prince Ying... - Master Zheng,

209
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,270
over the years,

210
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,120
Prince Ying has gone to great lengths to help you.

211
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,750
He's eliminated countless competitors for you,

212
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,750
even wiping out the Cui family.

213
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
And yet you...

214
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,790
now you can't even return home.

215
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,120
Isn't this all thanks to your brilliant schemes?

216
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,150
If I hadn't cleaned up after you time and again,

217
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,790
Yan Zijing would've killed you long ago.

218
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,240
You've brought ruin to my Zheng family,

219
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,270
and you still dare claim you're helping me?

220
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,440
If I wanted to ruin the Zheng family, I would've ruined you first.

221
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,550
What use is keeping your sons?

222
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,000
You'd better worry about yourself.

223
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,960
After Su Muzhe's death,

224
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,720
Zhang Jinran and Yan Zijing

225
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,600
will surely go mad and seek revenge on you.

226
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,510
Enough.

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,870
We're all in the same boat now.

228
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,080
Let's focus on how to handle this mess.

229
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,080
What happens here should be resolved here.

230
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,550
The priority will be uniting the two pearls

231
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,270
to unveil the long-lost Gulistan treasure.

232
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,440
The next step is in your hands, Li Kui.

233
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,510
Your Highness, Zhang Jinran has sealed the city.

234
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,480
He's conducting a nighttime search.

235
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,240
Prince Ying.

236
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,380
[Clear Mind]

237
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,220
[Clear Mind]

238
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,670
Yingtao!

239
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
My lady,

240
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,720
everyone...

241
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,870
It's alright. I know everything now.

242
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,510
It's alright.

243
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,200
The news yesterday was true.

244
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,440
Su Muzhe has indeed been kidnapped,

245
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,000
and now she's dead.

246
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,270
Thank you, ladies.

247
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,630
Follow me inside.

248
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,140
[Clear Mind]

249
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,030
My lady, are you going to mourn Su Muzhe?

250
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,510
If I went to mourn her,

251
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,150
she might just come back to life out of spite.

252
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,300
[Clear Mind]

253
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,440
Zheng Shiyuan did it?

254
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,270
Yes.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,750
Inspector Zhang went to the Zheng family's house last night.

256
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,550
He didn't find him,

257
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,390
so he ordered a citywide search.

258
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,870
Keep watching the Zheng family closely.

259
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,440
Don't let anything slip.

260
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,960
Yes, madam.

261
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,200
My lady, have some water to cool down.

262
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,390
It's not me who's dead.

263
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,630
Why would I be angry?

264
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,310
Su Muzhe fought with the Zheng family for so long,

265
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,350
even Zheng Wu suffered many losses against her.

266
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,160
And now she's just gone?

267
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,350
Zheng Shiyuan has always been ruthless,

268
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,750
and he clearly has powerful allies backing him.

269
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,640
Su Muzhe was bound to lose against him.

270
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,590
Lose?

271
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,680
Su Muzhe,

272
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,960
once I send Zheng Shiyuan to the depths of hell,

273
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,750
I might come to offer you my condolences.

274
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,750
For this incident,

275
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
how does Clear Mind plan to respond?

276
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,880
Without Ms. Su,

277
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,590
there would be no Duckweed Society.

278
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,510
There's little else we can do,

279
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,830
but Let's make the funeral

280
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,240
as grand as possible!

281
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,110
We must let everyone know

282
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,960
how much Ms. Su suffered at the hands of the Zheng family.

283
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,310
In the past, we fought tooth and nail

284
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,550
to cling to the powerful.

285
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,240
Only Ms. Su

286
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,160
gave us

287
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,110
a wake-up call.

288
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,750
She united all us.

289
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,070
She told us we can achieve great things without pleasing others.

290
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,070
With Clear Mind,

291
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,200
Duckweed Society found its foundation.

292
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,510
But now...

293
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,880
Yingtao, pull yourself together.

294
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,000
Think about how much Ms. Su valued you

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,720
when she was still here.

296
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,350
Ms. Su!

297
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,510
Ms. Su!

298
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,440
Ms. Su!

299
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,440
Ms. Su!

300
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,310
How could you just leave like this, Ms. Su?

301
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Ladies,

302
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,680
thank you all for coming today.

303
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,640
Clear Mind was Ms. Su's labor of love,

304
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,640
and it's also the foundation for all of us.

305
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,070
I promise to protect it.

306
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,030
Ms. Su always shielded me.

307
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,880
In this world,

308
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,640
she's the closest and most important person to me.

309
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,830
I know you all share my grief.

310
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,270
But right now, what's most important

311
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,110
is doing something for Ms. Su!

312
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,000
- We must avenge her! - I want to avenge Ms. Su!

313
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,440
I ask you all, ladies,

314
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,920
to help us find Zheng Shiyuan's whereabouts.

315
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,590
Let's find him soon

316
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,550
and avenge Ms. Su.

317
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,350
Ladies, please help us.

318
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,000
Help us avenge Ms. Su.

319
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,510
Thank you, ladies.

320
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,590
Please, ladies, help us...

321
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,540
[Notice]

322
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,720
Inspector Zhang of Huainandao announces to the people of Yangzhou:

323
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,350
Former Official Xu Nanying of the Yangzhou Grand Governor's Office,

324
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,350
colluding with the Black Dragon Bandits and murdering innocents,

325
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,270
will be executed tomorrow for public display!

326
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,270
[Notice]
Execution for public display!

327
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,400
Justice served!

328
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,640
Has Zhang Jinran gone mad?

329
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,070
What nerve!

330
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,240
Xu Nanying, Official of Yangzhou, holds the rank of Third-Class Official.

331
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,400
Who gave him the authority

332
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,070
to publicly execute Xu Nanying?

333
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,160
The Zhang Jinran of the past would never act so impulsively.

334
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,270
But with Su Muzhe dead, he and Yan Zijing

335
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,510
are unpredictable now.

336
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,200
Cut off what needs to be cut off promptly.

337
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,030
Zheng Shiyuan is insignificant,

338
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,000
but Xu Nanying cannot die yet.

339
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,680
He's merely a pawn.

340
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,480
Why do you care?

341
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Your Highness, someone shot this letter into the courtyard with an arrow.

342
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,200
I took men to pursue him, but he vanished.

343
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,880
Leave.

344
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,680
Yes.

345
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,680
If Xu dies,

346
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,400
all past dealings will come to light.

347
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,880
Who sent this?

348
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,920
And why is he threatening you?

349
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:32,790
Xu Nanying intercepted

350
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,640
a letter exchanged between us

351
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,030
and entrusted it to his servant, Xu Lin.

352
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:43,350
Back then, he betrayed Prince Tan and joined me.

353
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,270
I reluctantly took him in.

354
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,720
This threatening letter must have been sent by Xu Lin.

355
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,000
If this letter is exposed, it'll be trouble.

356
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,750
I suspect Zhang Jinran

357
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,510
forced some information out of Xu Nanying,

358
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,110
so he plans to use executing him

359
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,440
to stage this trap.

360
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,830
But my men's every move

361
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,640
is under his control.

362
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,880
Li Kui, your Black Dragon Bandits

363
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,920
might not be as easy for him to track.

364
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,510
So, you already knew it was a trap.

365
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,720
You refused to jump in yourself, and now want me to?

366
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,790
Zhang Jinran has gone mad.

367
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,070
You admitted it yourself just now.

368
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,790
If we ignore this,

369
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,240
they might really kill Xu Nanying.

370
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,270
If you can save Xu Nanying,

371
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,680
I'll find a way

372
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,920
to intercept Xu Lin, who they're trying to lure out.

373
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,510
Then we'll be safe.

374
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,480
Didn't you also say just now

375
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,200
that your identity is no longer a secret?

376
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,550
Exposing it won't change the situation.

377
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,720
Aren't you afraid I'll fall into his hands too,

378
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,240
and you'll lose another round?

379
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,000
You're exceptionally skilled,

380
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,750
and your subordinates are all experts.

381
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,310
You'll surely escape unharmed.

382
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,920
Once Xu Lin is eliminated,

383
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,310
I'll report Zhang Jinran's illegal execution

384
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,160
to the Emperor.

385
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,920
He'll be finished.

386
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,880
At that point, you can return to the West

387
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,350
to seek your Gulistan treasure

388
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,750
and live openly and freely.

389
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,750
What do you think?

390
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
You've hidden in the shadows for twenty years.

391
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,550
Do you plan to hide for another twenty?

392
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,960
Fine.

393
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,310
I'll make one last move for you.

394
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,310
I toast you with tea instead of wine.

395
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,110
May you achieve swift success.

396
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,000
Last meal.

397
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,550
Eat quickly.

398
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,480
What do you mean?

399
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
Is this for me?

400
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,270
This can't be for me, right?

401
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,000
Eat your fill before you set off.

402
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,550
Zhang Jinran!

403
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,270
What are you going to do to me?

404
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,510
I'm Xu Nanying, Official of the Yangzhou Grand Governor's Office!

405
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,270
You can't treat me like this!

406
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,480
You can't do this to me!

407
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,000
Zhang Jinran, I demand to see the Emperor!

408
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,680
You're ruthless to your senior,

409
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,070
ignoring the bonds of our sect!

410
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,000
You pervert justice for personal gain!

411
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,110
You collude and persecute!

412
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,510
I want to see Xu Lin!

413
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,350
Xu Lin, save me!

414
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,720
Ambush!

415
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,440
Protect the prisoner!

416
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,960
Protect the prisoner!

417
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,550
Charge!

418
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,070
- Kill! - Kill!

419
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,030
Go!

420
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,550
Go!

421
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,640
Stay back!

422
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,200
What are you doing?

423
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,550
Do you think I care whether he lives or dies?

424
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,830
As long as he's dead,

425
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,480
the letter Xu Lin holds

426
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,270
will naturally be made public.

427
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,350
You can't kill me!

428
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,240
Weren't you sent here to save me?

429
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,790
You're Li Kui!

430
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,550
Father!

431
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,200
Yuchi, long time no see.

432
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Back then, you were only this tall.

433
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,440
Come here, let me hug you!

434
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,480
You're too heavy to lift now!

435
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,790
Yuchi Wuyi...

436
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,720
You're Li Kui?

437
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,070
I've been extra cautious,

438
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,000
and yet you still found out.

439
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,000
I should've killed you

440
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,400
along with your entire family back then.

441
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,310
I thought I could use you one day.

442
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,110
I was asking trouble.

443
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,640
You said that we shared the same pain,

444
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,070
that our fates were similar,

445
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,350
and you spared no effort to help me,

446
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,200
supporting me,

447
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,960
making me treat you like a brother.

448
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,750
It turns out you did all of this

449
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,350
just to win my trust,

450
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
to make me help you find the blood-stained pearl.

451
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,590
I was trapped in Black Dragon Cave for so many years,

452
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,400
and yet I never realized you were Li Kui.

453
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,830
I know

454
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,750
you hate me to the bone now,

455
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,920
and want to tear me to pieces.

456
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,640
But...

457
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,070
if I die,

458
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,640
no one can cure your poison.

459
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,880
The Black Dragon Cave has burned down.

460
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,510
The Black Dragon Spring has dried up.

461
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,480
In this entire world,

462
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,830
only I can make your antidote.

463
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,790
I don't want your antidote.

464
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,030
I only want you dead!

465
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Don't kill him yet.

466
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,750
Move aside!

467
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,790
He has the antidote. Don't you value your life?

468
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,790
Yan Zijing...

469
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,440
Zijing...

470
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,960
Kill him!

471
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,920
Kangju, kill him...

472
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,920
The antidote...

473
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,230
The antidote...

474
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,360
The antidote!

475
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,840
I'll pour you some water.

476
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,400
My poison keeps acting up these days.

477
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,960
My eyesight...

478
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,320
I often can't see things clearly.

479
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,280
It'll be fine.

480
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,920
Now that we know Yuchi Wuyi is Li Kui,

481
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,110
we'll definitely catch him.

482
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,480
We'll get the antidote for sure.

483
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,230
I really was blind.

484
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,150
All these years, I never realized he was Li Kui.

485
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,840
We must capture him.

486
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,590
I'll use his life

487
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,510
to honor the spirits of my Yan family.

488
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:24,070
We'll definitely catch him.

489
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,360
Liu, this is for your child.

490
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,920
Thank you.

491
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,230
Liu, Xu Nanying of the Grand Governor's Office...

492
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,880
Here are your buns.

493
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,510
Xu Nanying?

494
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,190
The one who colluded with the Black Dragon Bandits?

495
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,480
Wasn't he supposed to be executed today?

496
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,230
I heard someone assassinated him.

497
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:44,670
Really?

498
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,510
Prince Ying is pursuing suspicious bandits.

499
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,440
Move aside!

500
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:48,960
Out of the way!

501
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,190
Prince Ying is pursuing suspicious bandits?

502
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,960
Why are they heading toward the Grand Governor's Office?

503
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,070
Take care.

504
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,920
To Li Kui:

505
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,110
The Yan family colluded with Kang and the court's nobles.

506
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:15,630
They aimed to open commerce with the Western Regions,

507
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,590
seeking unprecedented achievements

508
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,880
and everlasting benefits.

509
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,960
If the Yan family succeeds,

510
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,920
both I and Prince Tan will lose His Majesty's favor,

511
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,280
you will lose your advantage,

512
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,070
and the Zheng and Cui families will have no foothold in Yangzhou.

513
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,320
Therefore, Prince Tan has sent the Cuis as the vanguard,

514
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,710
and I've ordered the Zhengs to handle the aftermath.

515
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,550
You can show us your full potential.

516
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,320
How did you know

517
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,590
I have evidence?

518
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,480
Xu Nanying didn't bring you to Yangzhou,

519
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,070
because he gave you the evidence of Prince Ying's crimes

520
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,190
as his lifeline.

521
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,280
I ordered Xu Nanying's execution

522
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,920
first, to draw out the Black Dragon Bandits,

523
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,510
and second, to lure you out.

524
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,880
With just a few words,

525
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,070
and they managed to brush off

526
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,880
you useless lot?

527
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,190
There was no execution ground,

528
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,150
no beheading.

529
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,230
What's wrong with you, Li Kui?

530
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,150
I failed.

531
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,000
Xu Nanying is dead.

532
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,920
Would you fail so easily?

533
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,230
Or was it just for show?

534
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,840
Are you doubting me?

535
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,670
You're overthinking it.

536
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,190
I'll find the best doctor to treat you,

537
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,840
so you can recover completely.

538
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:04,760
No need.

539
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,710
It's just a minor injury.

540
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,630
I can treat it myself.

541
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,110
By the way,

542
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,880
may I ask, Li Kui,

543
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,550
the treasured pearl,

544
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,800
is it safe?

545
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,800
So you was never interested in me,

546
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,360
but in the pearl all along.

547
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,030
All this time,

548
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,190
the Black Dragon Bandits were just pawns

549
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,190
on your chessboard.

550
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,280
Isn't that right?

551
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,230
You have always been the one I relied on most.

552
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,880
I'm just glad you returned safely.

553
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,710
Take your time recovering.

554
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,670
The future is bright.

555
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,030
The future is bright.

556
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,000
Li Kui, undefeated in the northwest,

557
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,800
has suffered a loss today.

558
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,800
It seems he won't rise again.

559
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,800
Second Master, Third Master, Lady Shijiu,

560
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,150
the Master isn't home.

561
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,030
If you have any business,

562
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,360
please come back another day.

563
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,030
Insolence!

564
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,000
Whether to receive guests

565
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,030
is not for mere servants like you to decide!

566
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,400
I'm just a servant.

567
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,800
Second Uncle, Third Uncle,

568
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,960
Uncle is involved in a major case.

569
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,880
You are esteemed elders of the family,

570
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,670
standing righteously by my side,

571
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,480
yet you can't even get past the door now.

572
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,280
What should we do?

573
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,510
Before the Master left,

574
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,150
he specifically instructed me not to let outsiders in.

575
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,590
Are we outsiders?

576
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:10,670
We brothers couldn't bear to see the Zheng family in chaos.

577
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,030
Exactly!

578
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,070
We came to help our elder brother.

579
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,510
Even though Zheng Si and Zheng Wu made grave mistakes before,

580
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,880
no proper funeral rites were held.

581
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,590
Their memorial tablets haven't even been placed in the ancestral hall.

582
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,960
If this spreads,

583
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,070
what will outsiders think of the Zheng family?

584
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,880
Those who understand may sympathize with our elder brother's grief.

585
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Those who don't

586
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,880
will think he's cold and heartless.

587
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,800
As brothers, how can we sit by and do nothing?

588
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,590
But...

589
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,590
Esteemed elders,

590
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,510
please take charge.

591
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,630
Please open the ancestral hall and place the memorial tablets.

592
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,030
Masters, this must not be done!

593
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,670
It mustn't!

594
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,590
Are you deaf?

595
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,000
Get out of the way!

596
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,710
Open the ancestral hall!

597
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,710
This...this mustn't be done!
