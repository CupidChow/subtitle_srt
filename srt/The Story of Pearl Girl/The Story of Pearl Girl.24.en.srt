00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,790
Have you heard

193
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
that Su Muzhe

194
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,790
opened a shop?

195
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,640
It's called Clear Mind, right?

196
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,950
It's inappropriate for a woman to open a shop.

197
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,160
It's a disgrace to the jewelry guild.

198
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,670
Anyway, she opened the shop.

199
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,190
And she's doing great.

200
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,310
Her customers lined up

201
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:52,760
all the way to my stop this morning.

202
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,920
Maybe she has a skill.

203
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,880
Mr. Zheng.

204
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,160
A woman

205
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,950
opened a shop in Yangzhou.

206
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,280
But she didn't inform us.

207
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,240
I don't think it's appropriate.

208
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,950
In my opinion,

209
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,830
we should cut off her gold and raw stones.

210
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,640
Let's see what she can do.

211
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
You have a point.

213
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,970
Yeah.

214
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,550
Clear Mind's shareholders are Zheng Wu

215
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,710
and some songstresses.

216
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,120
They can't resist the suppression of the jewelry guild.

217
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,160
When she opened her shop here,

218
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,640
she should have thought about that.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,070
Are you going to help her?

220
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,040
I won't help her this time.

221
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,120
She doesn't want me to help.

222
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,520
If she wants to get a foothold here,

223
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,710
she has to go through this.

224
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,190
So she can grow.

225
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,470
Let's get to business.

226
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,040
The Black Dragon Bandits have been dormant since the last time.

227
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,550
They robbed once last month.

228
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,880
We haven't found

229
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,400
their base yet.

230
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,400
They will sell

231
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,310
what they robbed.

232
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,040
Only the Zheng family can help them sell their robbed goods.

233
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,470
What are we going to do?

234
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,640
I heard that Prince Ying

235
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,280
ordered a birthday gift for the Empress Dowager at Jubao House.

236
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,670
Have you found the escorts?

237
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,550
Yes, Master.

238
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,430
I found the best escorts.

239
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,040
You must be cautious.

240
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,880
Send the Red Leaf Crown to Chang'an safely.

241
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,430
Yes.

242
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,040
Master, Hexi got some goods.

243
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,160
They informed us to pick it up.

244
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,430
Prince Ying told us not to trade recently.

245
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,360
Why did they ignore it?

246
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,550
What should we do?

247
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,240
The cargo ship is about to arrive in Yangzhou.

248
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,590
If we don't pick it up,

249
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,470
it would be more dangerous.

250
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,160
Those goods

251
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,190
are dangerous.

252
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,430
Why didn't you just play the pipa?

253
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,190
Why did you follow the Clear Mind and change your plan?

254
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,400
You lost the top beauty title.

255
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,590
Do you know

256
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,590
how much it affects Baicaojing House's business?

257
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,280
Mr. Qin, ease up.

258
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,520
Shut up.

259
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,280
Are you upset?

260
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,070
Okay, I won't blame you.

261
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,240
If you go to your patron,

262
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,400
won't he blame you?

263
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,760
What's wrong?

264
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,280
He didn't see you?

265
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,430
You ended up losing everything.

266
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,400
We can't rely on the Zheng family.

267
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,520
The patron doesn't want to see you.

268
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,040
Even Zhenlang Pavilion doesn't invest in you.

269
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,430
What should we do?

270
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,310
Don't forget

271
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,760
that I opened Baicaojing House for you.

272
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,470
Watch your attitude.

273
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,040
You're like my own sister.

274
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,520
You should support me.

275
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,240
Let me see.

276
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Let me see.

277
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,400
Does it still hurt?

278
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,120
Be careful.

279
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,550
Ask Xuanji to help you with your work.

280
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,920
Tomorrow,

281
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,790
I'll get you a good doctor to change the dressing.

282
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,590
You'll be able to play the pipa again in a few days.

283
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,000
As long as you can play the pipa,

284
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,920
Baicaojing House's business

285
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,160
will get better and better.

286
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,760
Don't be upset.

287
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,590
I didn't mean it.

288
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm doing it for your own good.

289
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,950
You're like my own sister.

290
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,160
I love you.

291
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,470
As long as you're good,

292
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,280
Baicaojing House will be good.

293
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,830
Speaking of business,

294
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,240
Niao, I need more money.

295
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,000
Why are you asking me for money again?

296
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,950
I just gave you money.

297
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,040
Mu, spend more time on business.

298
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,710
If you have time,

299
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,520
go to Clear Mind

300
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,280
and look at their designs.

301
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,190
Hire some skilled craftsmen.

302
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,070
Baicaojing House's jewelry

303
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,760
is out of date.

304
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,520
You have a point, Niao.

305
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,550
That's why I need new designs and new goods.

306
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,790
Do you think I'm asking you for money for yourself?

307
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,670
It's for business.

308
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,310
Give me some money. I can make more money.

309
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,040
Go.

310
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,160
Don't worry, Niao.

311
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,280
I have a plan.

312
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,070
About the new goods...

313
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:41,950
What are you thinking about?

314
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,710
I'm telling you.

315
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,670
One of our shareholders

316
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,190
is a Zheng.

317
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,920
Who are you trying to set up?

318
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,240
Think of a way to tell the Zheng family

319
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,040
that Zheng Wu invested in Clear Mind behind their back.

320
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,400
He supported Lady Huan

321
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,670
at the Qionghua Festival.

322
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,840
I knew Zheng Wu had money.

323
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,120
If you hooked him, the top beauty title...

324
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,470
I'll shut up.

325
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Don't be mad.

326
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
I'll do what you say.

327
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
Master.

328
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,220
Turn around!

329
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,120
Hero.

330
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,920
Please spare my life.

331
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,360
Don't move.

332
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,400
Please spare my life.

333
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,080
You...

334
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,950
I'll give you as much as you want.

335
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,190
Don't take that.

336
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,400
I'll be beheaded.

337
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,600
Please don't!

338
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,510
No!

339
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,190
Um...

340
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,470
Are you saying

341
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,470
that they didn't want to take it away?

342
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,600
Yes!

343
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,030
They smashed the Red Lead Crown

344
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,800
and left.

345
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,560
They wanted to ruin my big thing.

346
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,320
It's a birthday gift for the Empress Dowager.

347
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,950
It's trash now.

348
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,050
Master...

349
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,920
Master.

350
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,990
How many people know about this?

351
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,880
Only the escorts and me.

352
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Don't

353
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,080
get the word out!

354
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,400
Get the best craftsmen

355
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,800
and remake it as soon as possible!

356
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,510
Master.

357
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,670
These red leaves

358
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,670
are the finest rubies from Tazi.

359
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,670
Jubao House used all rubies on it.

360
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,430
We're out of stock.

361
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,230
What?

362
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,400
We're out of stock?

363
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,840
Then, go buy it!

364
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,030
If Prince Ying gets angry,

365
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,600
the Zheng family can't afford it.

366
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,470
These rubies are rare in Yangzhou.

367
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,340
Due to the rampant bandits in Hexi,

368
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,470
there are few merchants.

369
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,430
I'm afraid only Zhenlang Pavilion has them

370
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,990
in Yangzhou.

371
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,950
Zhenlang Pavilion?

372
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,920
Western Regions colored stones are colorful.

373
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,470
But they are kitsch.

374
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,950
They are no match for Central Plains jewelry.

375
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Mr. Zheng, you're right.

376
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:09,270
Go there.

377
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,080
Whatever his conditions,

378
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,120

I'm here to smash your shop. Get away.

384

I'll kill myself if you smash my shop.

Drop your hairpin.

Here's the thing.

397
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,030
I was asked to do this.

398
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,920
I took the money to smash your shop.

399
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,990
If I don't smash it,

400
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,270
I'll lose my credit and my face.

401
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,880
And someone else will mess with you.

402
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,430
Right?

403
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,320
How about this?

I'll smash that.

Since you cannot decide,

you can consider it.

465

In that case, I'll leave.

Su Muzhe.

568
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,950
If you're not capable

569
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,270
and depend on me for everything,

570
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,950
why should you take 40% of the shares?

571
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,120
Why are you standing here today?

572
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,270
You're right.

573
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,320
I finally opened Clear Mind.

574
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,270
I don't want it to be like this.

575
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,230
I'll think of a way.

576
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,800
I don't have the patience for this.

577
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,400
Give back my money. It's five million mace with interest.

578
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,160
I'll come to get the money later.

579
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,600
Master.

580
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,030
I didn't see Yan Zijing.

581
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,840
Steward Zhao asked for 70 million mace for it.

582
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,600
I can't decide it.

583
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,120
I asked around at other shops.

584
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,360
Some shops don't have it.

585
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:08,160
Some are not good enough for the Empress Dowager.

586
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,270
Prince Ying has told the Empress Dowager

587
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,600
about the Red Leave Crown.

588
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,400
We have to make it

589
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,600
at any cost.

590
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
We've spent a lot

591
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,190
on the Red Leave Crown.

592
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,360
We have financial difficulties...

593
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,160
Those goods...

594
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,750
No.

595
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,230
Prince Ying has warned us.

596
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,470
He must have a reason.

597
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,800
We shouldn't act recklessly.

598
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,030
It's too late to cook the books

599
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,710
like we used to.

600
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,230
I'll talk to Yan Zijing.

601
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,030
See if we can pay later.

602
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,560
Master, I heard a rumor today.

603
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,030
It's said that Fifth Young Master is a shareholder of Zhenlang Pavilion.

604
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,430
He helped Lady Huan

605
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,920
win the top beauty title at the Qionghua Festival.

606
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,470
I knew it.

607
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,160
Clear Mind wouldn't have so much money.

608
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,600
Zheng Wu is stupid.

609
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,430
All he knows is to enjoy life.

610
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,120
He doesn't understand business.

611
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,190
He must have been deceived by that girl.

612
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,360
Neither of my sons

613
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,560
would give me a break.

614
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,160
Mr. Zheng,

615
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,190
it's an honor to have you here.

616
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,510
Mr. Yan, I'm flattered.

617
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,670
What brings you here?

618
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,990
I urgently need some rubies.

619
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,030
I asked around

620
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
and came to you.

621
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
We are in the same ship.

622
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,190
If you help me today,

623
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,560
I'll repay you later.

624
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,270
Don't worry.

625
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,560
I'll see you right.

626
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,560
I'm sorry.

627
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,160
I don't get it.

628
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,800
You were not interested in Western Regions colored stones

629
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:05,270
at the guild meeting the other day.

630
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,840
Why do you want so many rubies today?

631
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,320
Mr. Yan.

632
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,920
Do you want me to apologize to you?

633
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,320
No.

634
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,950
Do me a favor.

635
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,800
I'll pay you 50 million mace in three months.

636
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,160
Mr. Zheng, don't make fun of me.

637
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,920
You know the industry rule:

638
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,270
cash on delivery.

639
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,750
You're the guild lead.

640
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,710
You won't break the rules, right?

641
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,800
To be honest,

642
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,230
someone booked my rubies.

643
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,990
We have agreed on the price.

644
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,400
It's just that we didn't sign a contract.

645
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,950
Who booked them?

646
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,710
Forget it.

647
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,230
Since you're here,

648
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,510
I'll please you.

649
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,990
I'll break my contract.

650
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,190
I'll sell these goods to you.

651
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,160
But the price remains the same.

652
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,600
Seventy million mace in three days.

653
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,470
Cash on delivery.

654
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,120
If you can't pay me in three days,

655
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,560
I'll sign a contract with them.

656
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,230
They pretended it.

657
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,710
That man was foolish.

658
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,230
If he had been ordered to smash my shop,

659
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,920
he wouldn't have left so easily.

660
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,270
Yunxiu.

661
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,510
If I'm going out,

662
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,670
I'll leave Yingtao with you.

663
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,430
You should be careful.

664
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,800
If he comes again,

665
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
I won't let him go.

666
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,030
Duanwu.

667
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,920
If you're not in the shop,

668
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,430
I'll guard it for you.

669
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,030
I'm relieved to have you there.

670
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,880
Well.

671
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,080
These are the materials

672
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,560
damaged in transit.

673
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,560
It's a waste to throw them away.

674
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,430
Can we use them?

675
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,950
Look at this broken gold jewelry.

676
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,990
We can smelt it,

677
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,080
make a design,

678
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,280
and make it into new jewelry.

679
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,990
We can take off the jewelry on it and use it elsewhere.

680
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,320
This one is slightly damaged.

681
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,150
We can fix it.

682
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,550
Look.

683
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,200
Fill it...

684
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,240
There must be a lot of girls in Yangzhou

685
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,590
who have jewelry

686
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,880
that needs to be repaired.

687
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,510
We can

688
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,590
recycle their old jewelry and transform it.

689
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,800
Yingtao, put out a new sign tomorrow

690
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,070
saying that we recycle jewelry and reinvent the style.

691
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,920
By the way, buy some old jewelry.

692
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,400
We can use it as a raw material.

693
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
We can get through this.

694
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,920
Will it work?

695
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,950
Duanwu is always right.

696
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,990
Okay, I'll make the sign tomorrow.

697
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,590
Father.

698
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,200
Si.

699
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,920
It's late.

700
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,510
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

701
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,280
I heard that our treasure was ruined.

702
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,680
I have an idea.

703
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,510
Master Si.

704
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,150
How did you know about that?

705
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,430
Father.

706
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,150
I heard

707
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:41,800
you shut down a business

708
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,150
you had been running for a long time.

709
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,840
I'm worried that we have financial problems.

710
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,590
In my opinion,

711
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:46,630
we can ask others...

712
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,280
- Master Si, don't talk nonsense. - Come on in.

713
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,760
Father.

714
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:55,510
Yuqing.

715
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,720
Guard outside.

716
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,470
Yes.

717
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,240
Why are you here again?

718
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,320
Do you want to smash our shop again?

719
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,550
Yes.

720
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,400
I'll smash this shop

721
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,590
again.

722
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,680
Who is that?

723
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,950
I dare you to smash...

724
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:36,510
my shop.

725
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,240
Put down the broom.

726
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:39,920
Careful.

727
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,760
Your broom.

728
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,400
Duanwu.

729
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,720
He is the number one martial arts master in the world.

730
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,840
He came to smash our shop again.

731
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,840
You smashed my shop, right?

732
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,030
Nice to meet you.

733
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,470
Nice to meet you.

734
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,720
Smash it.

735
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,800
Well.

736
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:31,030
Don't smash gift boxes today. Thank you.

737
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,150
Smash it.

738
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,680
Shou.

739
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,550
Go out and close the door.

740
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,550
I'll smash the shop

741
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,200
again.

742
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,320
Okay.

743
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,280
I can't do this.

744
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,990
It's not good to hit people.

745
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,630
Are you going to make a living from this for the rest of your life?

746
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,070
You don't have a wife or children, right?

747
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,920
My boss said

748
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,840
a man must have ambition.

749
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,800
Yingtao, I have a lot of work to do back there.

750
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,110
I'll get to work.

751
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,760
I'll leave him to you.

752
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,150
Okay, Yunxiu.

753
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,510
Miss...

754
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,510
My name is Yingtao.

755
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,680
Ms. Yingtao.

756
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,030
To be honest,

757
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,470
my cousin committed a crime.

758
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,470
I need money urgently.

759
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:51,360
But I don't have money.

760
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,430
I had no choice

761
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,070
but to agree with Mr. Qin

762
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,400
to do this kind of thing.

763
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,800
I...

764
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,840
How about this?

765
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,470
You hang out on the streets.

766
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,200
You must know a lot of news.

767
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,920
Help us to find out

768
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,240
who has jewelry that they don't want.

769
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,990
I'll ask my boss to give you a commission.

770
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,880
Miss, what do you mean?

771
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:14,030
Do you want me...

772
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,400
to become a good person?

773
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,680
I didn't mean it.

774
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,200
Then...

775
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,240
Let's go.

776
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,950
Where are we going?

777
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,880
Smash the shop.

778
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:24,990
Smash the shop?

779
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,470
There is a lot of waste wood in the backyard. You can smash it.

780
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,800
Ms. Yingtao, it's not good.

781
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,200
What do you tell your employer

782
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,150
if you don't smash it?

783
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,400
Yingtao.

784
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:56,880
Yingtao.

785
00:39:58,990 --> 00:39:59,840
Yingtao!

786
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:04,070
Lady Xue, you're here.

787
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,880
What are you happy about?

788
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,990
Tell me about it.

789
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,470
Nothing.

790
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,200
Are you here to buy jewelry?

791
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,720
We have new ones.

792
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,510
I looked at the jewelry

793
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,680
I bought last time.

794
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,680
It doesn't compliment my complexion.

795
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,720
Do you want to return it?

796
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:29,150
You can return it.

797
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,430
Ms. Su told us

798
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,510
that the songstresses should wear the latest jewelry.

799
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,030
If you don't like it anymore,

800
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,200
you can return it.

801
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,630
We only charge a thirty percent depreciation fee.

802
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,800
Thirty percent?

803
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,920
That's too much.

804
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,030
If I put the jewelry I wore

805
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,950
in your shop,

806
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,680
there would be a lot of people rushing to buy it.

807
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,630
You want to charge me a depreciation fee.

808
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,070
If you think the depreciation fee is too much,

809
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,800
you can trade it for a new one.

810
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,590
It's worth 80% of its price.

811
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,240
In that way, you can buy new jewelry

812
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,200
for very little money.

813
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,240
Trade in old for new.

814
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,550
It's a good deal.

815
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,240
You mention Ms. Su

816
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,360
in every sentence.

817
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,800
Have you become an employee of Clear Mind?

818
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,840
Lady Xue, I came to Clear Mind.

819
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,400
I have to make a living from it.

820
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,280
Do you want me

821
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,030
to depend on you for the rest of my life?

822
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,240
All right. You're thinking about me.

823
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,400
Take a 20% depreciation fee.

824
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,840
Ten percent.

825
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,400
Lady Xue, I can't.

826
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,880
I think about you.

827
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,840
But there are rules in the shop.

828
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,950
I can't decide it.

829
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:42,800
How about this?

830
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,360
If you have any outdated jewelry,

831
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,840
you can trade it for a new one.

832
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,990
But you need to promote Clear Mind

833
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:49,630
among the songstresses.

834
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,150
With your reputation,

835
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,720
everyone will respond to your call.

836
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,880
If the price is good,

837
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,240
we'll give you a commission.

838
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,150
Yingtao.

839
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,950
You're so right not to be a songstress.

840
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,070
Forget it.

841
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:07,470
I'll think of it as supporting my own business.

842
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,070
However.

843
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,720
How much is the commission?

844
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,240
It depends on the price.

845
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,110
Okay. It's a good thing to wear new jewelry.

846
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,510
I'll handle it.

847
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,840
Thank you, Lady Xue.

848
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,400
Show me the jewelry.

849
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,630
Come here.

850
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,110
