12
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,710
How did you become like this?

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,790
That's what I am.

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,280
I've never changed.

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,000
It means nothing to you.

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,460
But for us,
it's a matter of life and death.

17
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,310
If it weren't for them
who are tied here today,

18
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,560
it would have been us.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,310
I understand.

20
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,080
You're a man on top.

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,030
You don't understand how we are.

22
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,450
I...

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,430
I understand.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,680
You've suffered a lot.

25
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,590
You'll never understand.

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,470
We're not the same.

27
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,080
Someone.

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,150
Beat them.

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,000
Tomorrow...

30
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,680
I'll find another place
to stay tomorrow.

31
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,560
Let's go.

32
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,030
Hurry.

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Hurry.

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,360
This way.

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,760
Where are we?

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,720
There is a secret room.

37
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,320
So many treasures.

38
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,000
The master never miscalculates.

39
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,430
He left a way out.

40
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,800
Great.

41
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,280
The trading convoy is saved.

42
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,080
With cash,

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,590
we can participate
in the official auction.

44
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,150
Yes.

45
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
We must take back

46
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,430
all the trading convoy's belongings.

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,750
But everyone knows
what's going on with the trading convoy.

48
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,520
I think they will try every means

49
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,360
to undercut us.

50
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:09,870
Yeah.

51
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,470
Steward Zhao, go to Zhuobao House.

52
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470
I don't think

53
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,070
they'll underpay us.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,240
But we need
to surrender part of our profits. Okay?

55
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,430
But...

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
I don't think Zhuobao House

57
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,000
can buy all these things.

58
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,480
Yeah, they can't.

59
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,510
You and Wei Yan go bid.

60
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,270
Remember,

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,840
I want

62
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,070
all those pearls.

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,070
If you'd handled it last night,

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,830
it wouldn't be like this today.

65
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,070
I could have made a deal
with the merchants from the South Sea.

66
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,960
It's not enough.

67
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,390
They don't have to buy them all.

68
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,760
As long as we can get enough money
to participate in the official auction.

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,720
Just have a look?

70
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
What to see?

71
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,360
See how the merchants in Guangzhou

72
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,480
divide the Yan's assets?

73
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,190
Use the Yan's money

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,430
to buy
the Yan's Trading Convoy's things.

75
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Is it reasonable?

76
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,070
Um...

77
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,750
Isn't that how it is now?

78
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,310
I don't accept it.

79
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,360
Wait.

80
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,650
I gave the blood-stained pearl to Duanwu

81
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,870
and urged her
to leave the trading convoy.

82
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,390
But she wouldn't leave.

83
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,160
She also found out
that Pang Song and Overseer Cao

84
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,430
stole the trading convoy's jewelry.

85
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,480
She lured them out.

86
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,870
I've kicked them
out of the trading convoy.

87
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,480
Good.

88
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,240
She learned to be patient.

89
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,070
The Cui family raised money
all over Yangzhou.

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,390
They even sold their stores.

91
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,560
They are determined
to get the jewels sold by the government.

92
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,390
The delivery date for the tribute pearls
is less than ten days.

93
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,240
They will do anything for that.

94
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,800
Duanwu wants
to sell the treasures in the secret room

95
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,950
to participate in the official auction.

96
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,040
Do you want me to remind her?

97
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,360
No need.

98
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,870
Are we

99
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,600
betting too much this time?

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,830
Remember to take your medicine.

101
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,390
Master, careful.

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,800
Father.

103
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,040
Father.

104
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
It's all my fault.

105
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,000
See what you've done in Guangzhou.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a big deal
that the tribute pearls were destroyed.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,360
But you hid it from me.

108
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,190
Father, I wrote a letter to my brother.

109
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,600
If you want to die,

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,150
don't take the whole Cui family
down with you.

111
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,310
Father, it's all my fault.

112
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,630
I thought we could replenish

113
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,740
the destroyed tribute pearls

114
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,190
to get the Cui family out of trouble.

115
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,240
But I didn't expect Yan Zijing
to chase us.

116
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,710
Father.

117
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,120
I...

118
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
He's just a merchant
in the Western Regions.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,040
He's arrested, isn't he?

120
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,710
Yes.

121
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,240
Is there going to be an auction

122
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,390
of Yan's Trading Convoy's
property tomorrow?

123
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,270
Yes.

124
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,680
- I...
- From Hepu to Guangzhou,

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,930
he purchased pearls all the way,

126
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,100
but he didn't sell them.

127
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,390
Yes.

128
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,070
Okay.

129
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,680
Buy the pearls at all costs.

130
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,190
Father.

131
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,890
I've dealt with Yan Zijing
so many times.

132
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,440
He wouldn't get arrested easily.

133
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,930
Now, all his property will be auctioned.

134
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,710
There is something fishy about it.

135
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,510
It has nothing to do with you anymore.

136
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,680
Look at what you're wearing.

137
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,240
You're a girl.

138
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,340
You should do what girls do.

139
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,600
Go home.

140
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,440
Change your clothes.

141
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,000
So what if I'm a girl?

142
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:20,950
Father.

143
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,390
Can't a girl do business?

144
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,000
A girl does business?

145
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,750
All you can do for the Cui family

146
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,440
is to go back to Yangzhou
and marry the Zheng family.

147
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
If I marry the Zheng family,

148
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,840
who will help you?

149
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,170
Are you counting on your loser sons?

150
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,480
You.

151
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,320
Go change your clothes.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,750
Father.

153
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,510
I won't get changed.

154
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Change them.

155
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,840
I won't.

156
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,030
Change them.

157
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,000
I won't.

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,570
Master, please stop beating her.

159
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,890
Please stop.

160
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,240
Lady Shijiu, don't talk back.

161
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,250
Send Lady Shijiu back to her room.

162
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,550
Go.

163
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Lady Shijiu, let's go.

164
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,270
Get out of here.

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,240
Master.

166
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,840
Master, calm down.

167
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,920
I have rented a house.

168
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,600
Are we moving over now?

169
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay.

170
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,850
Are you still worried about Duanwu?

171
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,000
I never really understood her.

172
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,320
You are different.

173
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,600
She's right.

174
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,840
Everyone is different.

175
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,840
Don’t judge without suffering.

176
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,910
It's my fault.

177
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,600
Cui Jingchu has arrived in Guangzhou.

178
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,490
Let's get down to business.

179
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,520
Yan Zijing went from Hepu to Guangzhou.

180
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,510
From the Treasure Hunt

181
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,790
to purchasing pearls
under the name of Feng.

182
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,050
Every move he made

183
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,140
was to force the Cui family
into a corner.

184
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,130
The official auction

185
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,600
is not that simple.

186
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,800
These are
all Yan's Trading Convoy's belongings

187
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,480
for this official auction.

188
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm Zhang Jinran, a chancellor
of the Institute for Advancement of Literature.

189
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,120
I put the seals

190
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,630
on these seized items myself.

191
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
But this official auction

192
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,840
is to raise money for the victims,

193
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,120
not a commercial auction.

194
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,270
So, we set it

195
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,790
as a blind auction.

196
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,280
Blind auction.

197
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,730
Blind auction.

198
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,770
Who dares to bid for it?

199
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,880
It's something
from the Yan's Trading Convoy.

200
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,090
- Blind auction.
- It's a bold auction.

201
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,320
We don't know

202
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,790
what's inside.

203
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,670
How can we bid?

204
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,030
Yan's Trading Convoy

205
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
is a merchant in the Western Regions.

206
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,750
There are a lot of rare treasures
on their boat.

207
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,200
Of course.

208
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,840
These items are sealed.

209
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,510
You can't know what's inside.

210
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,360
Please

211
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
have a guess

212
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,510
and make your offer.

213
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,150
All right.

214
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,150
Everyone knows

215
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,630
that the Yan's treasures are valuable.

216
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,670
If you get them at a low price,
you're lucky.

217
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,360
If you get them at a premium, accept it.

218
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,080
Let's make it easy.

219
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,320
We'll count everything

220
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,000
as one auction.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The highest bidder gets it.

222
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
All right.

223
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,200
Since it's a one-time deal,

224
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,880
I'll bid three million maces.

225
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,840
Three million maces.

226
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,610
There are good emeralds

227
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,510
and Nanyang pearls

228
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,510
of the trading convoy in these boxes.

229
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,510
It's worth
more than three million maces.

230
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,270
We bid nine million maces.

231
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,790
We bid 10 million maces.

232
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,600
Eighteen million maces.

233
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:02,240
Father.

234
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
We bid

235
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,720
twenty-three million maces.

236
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,630
Twenty-three million maces.

237
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,540
It can buy a boatload of jewelry.

238
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,120
The price is sky-high.

239
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,030
The Yan's treasures
are of extraordinary quality.

240
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,840
The Cui family raised 26 million maces.

241
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,330
How big the pearls are in there?

242
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,260
It's risky.

243
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,330
I'm not sure about it.

244
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,040
Right?

245
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,240
Yan's Trading Convoy.

246
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,550
Twenty million

247
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,750
and five and a half million maces.

248
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,600
Yan's Trading Convoy

249
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,630
is buying its own things.

250
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,290
The Yan's will lose a lot.

251
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,270
Their master killed a man.
They deserve it.

252
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,790
Father.

253
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,790
I've dealt with them many times.

254
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,270
They're not that simple.

255
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,510
We should think twice.

256
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,550
Father.

257
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,790
The Cui's.

258
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,700
Twenty-six million maces.

259
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,960
The price is sky-high.

260
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,510
The Cui's is determined to get it.

261
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,090
Okay.

262
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,960
Does anyone

263
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,840
want to bid
more than twenty-six million maces?

264
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,390
Duanwu.

265
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,550
Make a bid.

266
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Otherwise...

267
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,200
Yan's Trading Convoy.

268
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,360
Yan's Trading Convoy.

269
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,200
We abstain.

270
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
Congratulations to the Cui's

271
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,960
for winning all the items
at this official auction.

272
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,030
Wait.

273
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,200
Cui's.

274
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,750
You haven't signed the contract yet.

275
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,080
Father.

276
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,420
[Cui Jingchu]

277
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,750
Lady Shijiu, open them.

278
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:45,840
Yes.

279
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,880
Father.

280
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,000
Duanwu.

281
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,240
You are right.

282
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,080
The master was prepared.

283
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,000
Open them all.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,320
Yes.

285
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,130
Open them all.

286
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,670
Yes.

287
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,790
It's all junk.

288
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,820
Um...

289
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,270
The Yan's

290
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,840
is speciosity.

291
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,670
Good thing I didn't bid.

292
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,080
The Cui's lost a lot of money.

293
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,180
They spent twenty-six million maces

294
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,390
on junk.

295
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,050
What's the use of those?

296
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,180
It's all junk.

297
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,400
Look.

298
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:30,960
There's nothing good.

299
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,630
Master.

300
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,240
It's all worthless stuff.

301
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,600
Father.

302
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,420
Um...

303
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,340
Father.

304
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,240
Father.

305
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,570
Father.

306
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,360
Father.

307
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,720
Father.

308
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,270
Amazing.

309
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,720
Yan Zijing.

310
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,740
What are you doing here?

311
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,480
Master.

312
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,080
We came at the right time.

313
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,240
Accountant Wei.

314
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,630
Yan Zijing.

315
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,960
It's you.

316
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,870
I was arrested for killing Wei Yan.

317
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,960
But Wei Yan is not dead.

318
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,550
I was released.

319
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,120
I didn't expect you to auction my stuff

320
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,120
just after I was arrested.

321
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,390
However, Special Envoy Xu

322
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,600
confirmed the validity of the contract.

323
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,200
I'll

324
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,300
take the deal.

325
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
The contract is finalized.

326
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,850
Cui,

327
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,120
pay for it.

328
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,440
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

329
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,960
Not only did you have good luck,

330
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
but you also made a deal

331
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,020
by the way.

332
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,590
Special Envoy Xu, not at all.

333
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,030
My stuff

334
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,550
is worth a lot
more than twenty-six million maces.

335
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,920
But

336
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,480
I accept it.

337
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,720
Congratulations, the Cui's.

338
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,640
Lady Shijiu.

339
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,240
I'd like to introduce you to my friend.

340
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,920
Mr. Shinawei.

341
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,040
Isn't it Mr. Shinawei?

342
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,440
My dear friend.

343
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,460
Mr. Yan, good for you.

344
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,140
Now, even if

345
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,980
there are pearls in front of the Cuis,

346
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,180
they can't buy them.

347
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm flattered.

348
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,960
Mr. Zhang, thank you.

349
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,720
Are you satisfied

350
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,400
with this result?

351
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,830
The delivery date for the tribute pearls
is coming.

352
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,920
The Cuis

353
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,880
cannot escape this time.

354
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,240
Make good use

355
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,160
of this chance.

356
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,680
Mr. Yan.

357
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,960
You make full use

358
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,790
of your talents.

359
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,400
And you never miscalculate.

360
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,000
Thank you.

361
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,550
I'm afraid

362
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,270
someone will not be able to sleep.

363
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,750
Mr. Zhang, you'd better plan ahead.

364
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,030
In case someone becomes desperate

365
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,200
and hurts the innocent.

366
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:54,600
Mr. Yan, thank you for the heads up.

367
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,770
I had my plans

368
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,490
before I got involved.

369
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,630
You...

370
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,470
Take care of Duanwu.

371
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,250
She's my person.

372
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,630
I will take care of her.

373
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,800
Care more about yourself.

374
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,080
In that case,

375
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,430
we can't let Zhang Jinran
leave Guangzhou.

376
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,390
Yes.

377
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,190
Master.

378
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,230
Wei Yan is fine.

379
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,270
The matter has subsided.

380
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,830
Everything is back
to the way it was before.

381
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,680
Master,

382
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,830
you're brilliant.

383
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,480
Accountant Wei.

384
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,590
You kept it from everyone for so long.

385
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,510
You did a great job.

386
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,000
Reward her.

387
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,920
Thank you, master.

388
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,750
Master.

389
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,880
At the official auction,

390
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,240
Steward Zhao

391
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
did a great job.

392
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,110
Steward Zhao, what reward do you want?

393
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,750
Just say it.

394
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,110
Master, I'm old.

395
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,200
I hope you'll agree to let me retire.

396
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,240
Steward Zhao,
you've been traveling with me

397
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,640
all these years.

398
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,200
Even when the trading convoy
was in trouble,

399
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,550
you never left me.

400
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,550
I appreciate

401
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,680
your effort.

402
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,590
Master.

403
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,070
Kang Ju.

404
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,550
This is a store in Yangzhou.

405
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,160
Steward Zhao, I'll give it to you.

406
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,880
I hope you go home

407
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,590
and enjoy your retirement.

408
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,030
Thank you, master.

409
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,000
You're welcome.

410
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,800
- Great.
- Great.

411
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,730
- Great.
- Great.

412
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,080
Yan's Trading Convoy

413
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,110
is always fair
in meting out rewards and punishments.

414
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,310
This time,

415
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,830
Duanwu did a good job.

416
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,720
From now on,

417
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,160
Duanwu

418
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,110
will be the assistant
for our trading convoy.

419
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,410
- Great.
- Great.

420
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,590
Duanwu is amazing.

421
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,030
Thank you, master.

422
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,510
I'll do my best.

423
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,160
However,

424
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,960
we always value

425
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,000
the law of the jungle.

426
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,510
Tell me about it.

427
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,750
When did you discover it?

428
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,350
You're smart.

429
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:07,640
If you wanted to get rid of someone,

430
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,590
you wouldn't leave so many holes.

431
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,410
That's right.

432
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,330
But it's not enough.

433
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,200
What else?

434
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,590
It was not a Nanyang pearl
in Shinawei's hand.

435
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
It was a Hepu South Sea pearl.

436
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,110
I've been collecting pearls
and dividing pearls since childhood.

437
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,070
I know the differences

438
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,750
between Hepu South Sea pearls
and Nanyang pearls.

439
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,400
In Guangzhou,

440
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,480
you have the most Hepu South Sea pearls.

441
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,590
So, I guessed

442
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,400
you hired Shinawei.

443
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,880
You have a good eye

444
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,440
and a good brain.

445
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,070
Master, what do you mean?

446
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,790
I'm complimenting you.

447
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,440
Complimenting me?

448
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,440
What's wrong?

449
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,830
I was surprised

450
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,070
you trusted me so much.

451
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,350
If I had sold

452
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,680
all your property and your jewels

453
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,750
and left,

454
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,440
you would have lost everything.

455
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,110
I'm smart.

456
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,110
You have a good eye

457
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,830
and a good brain.

458
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,030
If you want to say I'm an old fox,

459
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,700
just say it.

460
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,960
However,

461
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,590
you can call me anything you want.

462
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,960
Business is war without swords.

463
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,640
Winner takes all.

464
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,160
Got it?

465
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,000
Master, you need to take your medicine.

466
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,750
Master...

467
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,310
You dishonored our family.

468
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,070
Special Envoy Xu.

469
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,110
Mr. Cui.

470
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,680
Special Envoy Xu.

471
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,270
Your Cui family

472
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,490
has had one accident after another.

473
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,830
But you haven't delivered
the tribute pearls.

474
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,640
What are you going to do with it?

475
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,200
The Cui family weathered bumps.

476
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,000
Business is war without swords.

477
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,640
No general wins all the time.

478
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,350
Not to mention businessmen.

479
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,550
Mr. Cui, it seems that you know

480
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,640
that no one can win all the time.

481
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
In that case,

482
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
why don't you admit

483
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,000
that you burned the Pearl Tower

484
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,890
and ruined the tribute pearls?

485
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,800
By the way,

486
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,060
pay the compensation
to the tribute pearls.

487
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,110
Most importantly,

488
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,550
handle the matter
of the Pearl Lotus Terrace quickly.

489
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,680
I'll give it to Prince Tan.

490
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,210
Prince Tan will intercede for you

491
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,590
so that the court
won't hold the Cui family accountable.

492
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,680
Our Cui family lost a lot.

493
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,030
To collect tribute pearls,

494
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,920
I sold some stores.

495
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm afraid

496
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,250
we can't afford the compensation.

497
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,160
Well.

498
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Mr. Cui.

499
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,240
You're in big trouble.

500
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,440
Why are you still thinking
about your money?

501
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,830
Zhang Jinran has got

502
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,200
your Cui family's ledgers.

503
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,110
He doesn't need to do anything else.

504
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:13,680
As long as
you can't hand over the tribute pearls,

505
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,920
he'll open a case.

506
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,920
By then,

507
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,440
your family's lives will be at stake,

508
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,830
not to mention your money.

509
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,000
Tribute pearls fraud is a serious crime.

510
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,440
It's not just about our Cui family.

511
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,960
The Cuis has no worthy successors.

512
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,510
I'll tell you again.

513
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,200
If something goes wrong,

514
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,060
only the Cui family will be blamed.

515
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,860
If you want to die,

516
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,110
I'll leave you alone.

517
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,350
A girl is a girl.

518
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,110
Think about it.

519
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,880
Go home.

520
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,580
Xu Nanying.

521
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,070
You...

522
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,890
Look what you've done.

523
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,110
Father, don't believe him.

524
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,350
He's on the same ship with us.

525
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,480
He won't report
the matter about the tribute pearls.

526
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,680
Even if he calmed it down
for his own safety,

527
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,350
would he

528
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,030
leave us alone?

529
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,720
Father, he...

530
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,280
Someone.

531
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,350
Send Lady Shijiu back to her room.

532
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,270
Don't let her go out.

533
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,100
Yes.

534
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,200
Shijiu, get up.

535
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,920
Your father forgave you.

536
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Did you beg him?

537
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,880
What did you give him?

538
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,510
The rest of your dowry?

539
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,750
Shijiu, don't worry about it.

540
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,480
I...

541
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,790
Why?

542
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,310
Mother, you're his main wife.

543
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Do we have to be humble

544
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,590
just because I'm a girl?

545
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,400
Even his concubine walks over you.

546
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,940
Mother.

547
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,920
Shijiu.

548
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,400
I know you've been through a lot.

549
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,240
It's not your father's fault.

550
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,680
It's not easy for him.

551
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,720
It's all for the Cui family.

552
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,480
I can't

553
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,960
let the Cui family be without a son.

554
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:30,920
Okay.

555
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,400
I don't blame my father.

556
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,200
It's all my fault.

557
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,310
Mother.

558
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,350
I'm telling you.

559
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,270
I, Cui Shijiu,

560
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,200
will let my father

561
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,030
think highly of us.

562
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,270
I, Master Shijiu, swear.

563
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,790
Mother.

564
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,030
Why?

565
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,920
I did everything I had to do.

566
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,830
I couldn't help my father.

567
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,640
I couldn't save you.

568
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,110
I couldn't save myself either.

569
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,030
Lady Shijiu.

570
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,550
Lady Shijiu.

571
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,350
You haven't had any water all day.

572
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,110
Don't drink wine.

573
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,590
Why don't you eat something?

574
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,310
I abandoned the stable mindset as a girl

575
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,160
a long time ago.

576
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,480
I worked hard

577
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,070
and fought my way

578
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,960
out of those sons.

579
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,480
I finally got some attention
from my father.

580
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,480
How could I accept
to marry the Zheng family?

581
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,920
How could I accept it?

582
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
Lady Shijiu.

583
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,920
Zheng Zhiheng is a rake.

584
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,880
I don't want
to live on the Zheng family.

585
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,790
I don't want
to live in a mansion forever.

586
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,350
After all, it's the Zheng family.

587
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,720
You can live a life
of abundance and comfort.

588
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,400
But I don't want to.

589
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,200
Tong.

590
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,000
I know.

591
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,550
I grew up in the Zhenlang Pavilion.

592
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,440
I can read the ledger.

593
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,270
I can identify jewelry.

594
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,350
I am better than my brothers
in every way.

595
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,240
Why can they do the wrong thing

596
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,400
again and again?

597
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,510
Now, I'm of the age to get married.

598
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,590
I have to hand over
the Zhenlang Pavilion to others

599
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,310
and stay in my room.

600
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,310
Why?

601
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,790
I don't want to be like my mother.

602
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't want to.

603
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,590
I'm going out.

604
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,070
Help me.

605
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,920
Help me.

606
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,310
Lady Shijiu.

607
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,710
I just heard outside the master's room

608
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,870
that he had
the Pearl Lotus Terrace delivered.

609
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:29,120
He was going to the capital
to give it to Prince Tan.

610
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,380
When the master goes to the dock

611
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,800
to pick up the Pearl Lotus Terrace,

612
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
I'll get you out of here, Lady Shijiu.

613
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:36,330
No.

614
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,300
Master Shijiu.

615
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,910
Pearl Lotus Terrace.

616
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,870
Then...

617
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,840
Then,

618
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,280
if Zhang Jinran
doesn't have our ledgers,

619
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,280
and we pay the compensation,

620
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,020
the Cui family will get through this,
right?

621
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,120
Yes.

622
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,280
Okay.

623
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,090
Okay.

624
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,300
Special Envoy Xu.

625
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,670
Our Cui family admits

626
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,040
that we ruined the tribute pearls.

627
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,000
We'll prepare
the Pearl Lotus Terrace for Prince Tan.

628
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,530
Special Envoy Xu,
please intercede for the Cui family.

629
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,960
We only need a few days.

630
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,010
I won't let Zhang Jinran
leave Guangzhou.

631
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:12,360
Now you know you have to fight hard.

632
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,590
Why should I trust you?

633
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,110
Because the Cui family
doesn't want to die.

634
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,970
Buns.

635
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,330
Freshly made buns.

636
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,190
Thank you.

637
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,450
Use this.

638
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,020
I want this.

639
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,760
Master, here she is.

640
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,630
Mr. Zhang.

641
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
What do you want to see me about?

642
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,630
You must be interested
in the Hu people's market.

643
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,030
I want to take you around.

644
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,670
Do you want

645
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,710
to see me about something?

646
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,710
I'm going back to Chang'an tomorrow.

647
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,110
I want to say goodbye to you.

648
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,590
Du Ming.

649
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,480
Go to the East Market

650
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,590
and get some of my favorite
osmanthus lotus root cakes.

651
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Osmanthus lotus root cakes?

652
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,360
Since when do you like
osmanthus lotus root cakes?

653
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,320
You have important things to do.

654
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,280
Don't worry about it.

655
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,490
Have a taste.

656
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,030
Here are some candied fruits.

657
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,110
They are tender and sweet. Have a taste.

658
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,000
Candied fruits?

659
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,400
It's like a Coral Pearl.

660
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,920
- I have something for you.
- Murder.

661
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,640
Run. Murder.

662
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,450
Out of the way.

663
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:53,930
What's going on?

664
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:54,810
Murder.

665
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,780
Don't run.

666
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,210
Chase.

667
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,040
Out of the way.

668
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,360
Help.

669
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,860
Murder.

670
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,760
Help.

671
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,710
Mr. Zhang.

672
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,030
Duanwu.

673
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:07,710
Run.

674
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,520
Duanwu.

675
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,320
Run if you can.

676
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,700
Out of the way.

677
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:14,670
Stop.

678
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,580
Out of the way.

679
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
Out of the way.

680
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,400
Stop.

681
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:20,960
Out of the way.

682
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,180
Out of the way.

683
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,490
- What are you doing?
- Stop.

684
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,400
Out of the way.

685
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,000
Out of the way.

686
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,960
Stop.

687
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,630
Duanwu, come on.

688
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,280
Go.

689
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,710
I didn't expect this

690
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,960
to happen.

691
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,150
I'm sorry.

692
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,440
Mr. Zhang, it's all right.

693
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,920
It was unexpected.

694
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,920
You told me

695
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,000
you had something for me.

696
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,190
I found this in Lady Eight's room...

697
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,230
Mr. Zhang, be careful.

698
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,230
You immoral couple.

699
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,230
Despicable pearl diver.

700
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,890
You started everything

701
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,230
at the pearl farm.

702
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,070
I should have sent you
to the maternity shed

703
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,920
and let you

704
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,000
suffer.

705
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,360
I should have put you
in the Despairing Cove

706
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,480
and let the sharks eat you alive.

707
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,800
Cui Jia.

708
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,920
And Lady Eight

709
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,440
betrayed the pearl farm

710
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,320
for you.

711
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,230
I shouldn't have killed her.

712
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,920
I should have caught her

713
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,920
and skinned her alive.

714
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,550
I should have

715
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,340
let her suffer.

716
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,280
Cui Jia.

717
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,150
Long time no see.

718
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,280
But I don't think

719
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,960
I'll ever see you again.

720
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,670
Duanwu.

721
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,650
I'll kill you.

722
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,100
I'll avenge my mother.

723
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,070
I'll kill you.

724
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,760
Duanwu.

725
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:35,940
Duanwu.

726
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,220
He will be punished for his evil deeds.

727
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,320
He killed my mother.

728
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,050
He killed my mother.

729
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,190
The Cui's Pearl Farm doesn't hand over
enough tribute pearls every year.

730
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,590
As long as it's exposed,

731
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,000
they will die. Listen to me.

732
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,100
Duanwu.

733
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,850
You have to believe there's justice.

734
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,480
Mr. Zhang.

735
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
There's no justice

736
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,280
in this world.

737
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,020
There's no justice in this world.

738
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,480
Trust me.

739
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,190
I'll catch him.

740
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,000
Trust me.

741
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,320
They won't get away with it.

742
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,400
Calm down, Master Shijiu.

743
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,670
I didn't expect her

744
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,440
to be so ruthless.

745
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,440
If I catch her,

746
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,920
I'll kill her myself.

747
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,880
Master Shijiu, don't worry.

748
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,550
I'll catch her myself.

749
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,590
I won't spare her.

750
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,110
Duanwu, trust me.

751
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,660
I'm sure I'll bring them all to justice.

752
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,600
The Cui's Pearl Farm doesn't hand over
enough tribute pearls every year.

753
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,700
They can't turn the situation around

754
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,030
this time in Guangzhou.

755
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:31,000

756
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,190
I went to Lady Eight's room

757
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,670
to gather evidence about the Cui's.

758
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,510
I found this.

759
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,110
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.
