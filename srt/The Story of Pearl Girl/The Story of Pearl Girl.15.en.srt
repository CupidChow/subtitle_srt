12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,400
Yan Zijing, you've arrived in Wuling too?

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,840
Master Yan, please wait a moment.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,150
He'll be here shortly.

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
He's coming.

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,030
Master Yue,

17
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,800
Master Eight isn't well. He'll see you later.

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh my...

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,710
What an unexpected surprise!

20
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,470
Why buy so many herbs to ward off toxic air?

21
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,310
Wuling is full of toxic air.

22
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,240
Better safe than sorry.

23
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,910
Mr. Cao.

24
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,360
Leader, I found out.

25
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,430
Have some water.

26
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,470
That guy's name is Lu Zhen.

27
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,750
He's really had a rough life.

28
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,240
Just like I did when I was young,

29
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,280
he's suffered a lot.

30
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,280
You don't know what my childhood was like.

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,870
Back in my childhood...

32
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,080
Alright, let's talk about him.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,800
Okay.

34
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,800
Originally,

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,560
his father opened a small restaurant.

36
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,430
Life was going well.

37
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,590
Then one day,

38
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,590
Heishan, one of Master Eight's men,

39
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,520
claimed he broke a tooth eating his baked flatbread.

40
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,560
Heishan forced his father to pay 100,000 mace.

41
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,190
That's outright extortion!

42
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,190
Indeed.

43
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,630
His father couldn't pay it,

44
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,590
and was driven to death over it.

45
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,400
But it didn't end there.

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,680
They even demanded Lu Zhen keep paying, with interest.

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,560
If he couldn't pay,

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,000
his descendants would have to keep paying.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,470
Unless he sold himself as a slave.

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,590
But Lu Zhen's got a backbone.

51
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,150
He told me he swore at his father's grave.

52
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,710
In this life...

53
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,240
Keep your voice down!

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,750
He would never be a slave.

55
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,150
That's about it.

56
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,560
But they're giving out food and medicine here. People are living well.

57
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,870
It doesn't seem like what Lu Zhen described.

58
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,160
He said in the past,

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,510
Wuling was nothing like this.

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,120
But for some reason,

61
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,600
about half a month ago,

62
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,040
things suddenly changed with all the aid being handed out.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,000
This place used to be like hell on earth.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,270
If you went to the mines, you'd never come back.

65
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,870
Master Eight's stone mines?

66
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,750
Wait, you just said, half a month ago...

67
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,870
Why the change?

68
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,720
I don't know.

69
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,870
He just advised us to leave Wuling quickly.

70
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,000
I've got a bad feeling about Bafang Tower.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,560
Remind everyone in the convoy

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,560
to be on high alert.

73
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,510
Don't worry.

74
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,120
I'll patrol at night.

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,830
I just took a look,

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,160
and it's not easy to leave Bafang Tower.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,750
I'll check every exit of Bafang Tower.

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,190
I won't even let a dog door slip by.

79
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,310
I'll ask the Master when he returns.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,310
Alright.

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,430
This way.

82
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,430
Master Eight!

83
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,600
Master Eight is unwell.

84
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
Say what you need to here.

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,750
I'm not feeling well,

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,190
and I'd hate to spread my illness to a guest.

87
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,040
May I ask who this esteemed guest is?

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,040
This is a wealthy merchant from the Western Regions,

89
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,950
Master Yan.

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,000
Greetings, Master Eight.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,160
My family has had some trouble,

92
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,830
and I'm grateful to Master Yan.

93
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,310
He's willing to help me.

94
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,750
Today, I brought him here to see you,

95
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,950
mainly to...

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:53,960
I...

97
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,160
Master Eight,

98
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,560
he owes me ten million mace.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,160
I hope you can lend him a hand.

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,830
With the friendship between us,

101
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:03,890
a mere million mace...

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,070
I'll lend it to you.

103
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Look at that.

104
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,960
Master Eight is really righteous and generous!

105
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,000
I've heard that Master Eight is immensely wealthy in Wuling.

106
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,560
I came here on business,

107
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,270
and I have a box of jewels.

108
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,920
I wonder if you'd be interested.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,070
Of course I am.

110
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,870
Master Yan and Master Yue are honored guests from afar.

111
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,510
Here,

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,240
have a taste of our Wuling hospitality wine.

113
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,720
Bring the wine!

114
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,630
This is indeed fine wine.

115
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,160
Master Yan, please enjoy.

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,630
Master Yan, you're so straightforward.

117
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,190
Name a price for that box of jewels.

118
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,310
I'll take them all.

119
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,830
Master Eight, you're truly bold.

120
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,600
But this box of jewels is already reserved.

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
If you still want it,

122
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,190
I can go back and prepare it,

123
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,800
and bring over some sketches and samples

124
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,480
for you to choose from.

125
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,630
Alright.

126
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,480
Is this poison reliable?

127
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,190
It's extremely potent.

128
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,920
Master Eight brought it from the Western Regions.

129
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,070
You saw it earlier.

130
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Yan Zijing has quite a few jewels on him.

131
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,040
Among those rare treasures he carries,

132
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,800
the most valuable are Lingnan pearls.

133
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,430
If you could get Yan Zijing's jewels,

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,870
why would you need to guard

135
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,360
these mines so diligently?

136
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,550
Alright.

137
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,630
The Bafang Tower guards will take your orders for now.

138
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,690
It's the poison of the Black Dragon Bandits.

139
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,550
Looks like Master Eight

140
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,080
has always been connected to the Black Dragon Bandits.

141
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,120
I don't care about their connections.

142
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,360
Don't you know the state of your own health?

143
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,200
Back when Li Kui poisoned you several times,

144
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,840
your body was already at its limit.

145
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,750
Now, knowing it's poison, you still drank it?

146
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,550
Enough.

147
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,840
Wuling is too strange.

148
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,600
If I hadn't drunk that wine,

149
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,670
they'd definitely get suspicious.

150
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,750
No one knows this poison better than you and me.

151
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,480
A few days and it'll be fine.

152
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,200
Don't worry.

153
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,750
It's still poison, though!

154
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,960
Nothing ventured,

155
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,790
nothing gained.

156
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,720
Let's get to business.

157
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,960
I need you to help me

158
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,670
with three things.

159
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:00,840
First,

160
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,790
you personally lead people

161
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,080
and find a place to hide my jewels.

162
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,030
Second,

163
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,150
look for an opportunity

164
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,750
to get everyone out.

165
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I have a feeling

166
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,670
that many things are already out of my control.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,240
In this Bafang Tower,

168
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,000
there should be another force at play.

169
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,000
Why do you think so?

170
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
We were given poisoned wine as soon as we arrived.

171
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,000
If there was no past grievance,

172
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,120
why would it be so strange?

173
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,790
You're using yourself as bait to draw them out?

174
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,000
What's the third thing?

175
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,360
We've always known the Black Dragon Bandits steal goods and people.

176
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,670
There's a trail of goods,

177
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,200
but we can never trace the people taken.

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,030
I've heard

179
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,840
the Wuling Mines are under tight watch.

180
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,810
And Master Eight has ties with the Black Dragon Bandits.

181
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,240
What do you think

182
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,960
they're trading?

183
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
People?

184
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,360
Master Eight,

185
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,870
I came here

186
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,390
because the Cui family is on the brink of ruin.

187
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,670
I have to gather the tribute pearls' value

188
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,030
to save the Cui family from disaster.

189
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,630
Rest assured.

190
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,150
You are also one of the Cui family.

191
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,390
I won't kill you.

192
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,150
But I need you to stay asleep.

193
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,910
Rest well.

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,790
Master.

195
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,550
Master.

196
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,670
Supervisor Kang,

197
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,120
I need to speak with the Master.

198
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,480
The Master is already resting.

199
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,750
Resting this early?

200
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,200
If it's not urgent, let's talk tomorrow.

201
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,270
I feel that Bafang Tower

202
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,000
isn't very safe.

203
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,540
- Why don't we... - It's nothing serious.

204
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,120
The Master has his own plans.

205
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,150
Then...

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Is Master Yan here?

207
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,240
The Master is already resting.

208
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Master Eight sent me to collect

209
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,480
the jewels Master Yan promised earlier.

210
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's discuss it tomorrow.

211
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,870
I'll be on my way, then.

212
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,630
Rest well.

213
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,240
Here's the thing.

214
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,440
Master Eight said

215
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,320
he'll buy all of Master Yan's jewels.

216
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,560
For such a big deal,

217
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,000
he still has time to rest?

218
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,670
Please let Master Eight know,

219
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,600
I miscalculated the accounts earlier.

220
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
All the jewels from this trip

221
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,960
have already been spoken for.

222
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,670
I'm afraid

223
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,790
there are no spare jewels left to sell him.

224
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,390
Then I'll let Master Yan rest,

225
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,600
and report back to Master Eight.

226
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,840
We'll await his decision.

227
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,670
Leader, something's wrong!

228
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,750
Thieves broke into the convoy.

229
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,360
All the jewels are gone!

230
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,670
Gone?

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,790
And the thief?

232
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
I have no idea.

233
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,440
Call the Master.

234
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,840
Master Shijiu,

235
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,150
Yan's Trading Convoy lost the jewels.

236
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,320
How did a thief get into Bafang Tower?

237
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,960
Bafang Tower is heavily guarded.

238
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,720
There's no way an outsider could enter.

239
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,720
Then how did they lose them?

240
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,840
Are you suggesting

241
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,670
it was their own doing?

242
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,670
Since Yan's Trading Convoy lost the jewels,

243
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,550
we're responsible.

244
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,720
Starting now,

245
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,510
seal off Bafang Tower. No one in or out.

246
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,840
Anyone who disobeys

247
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,840
will be killed.

248
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,440
Understood.

249
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,000
Master...

250
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,120
Master.

251
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,270
Continue.

252
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,600
All the most valuable jewels are missing.

253
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,840
Some of them were already paid for with deposits.

254
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,440
If we can't recover them,

255
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,320
we may face considerable compensation fees.

256
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,390
What should we do?

257
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,120
Once we leave Wuling,

258
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,750
we'll be in the Master's territory in the Western Regions.

259
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,600
There, things can be handled.

260
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,600
Yes.

261
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,790
The Master has faced far worse crises.

262
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,120
As long as he's here,

263
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,030
he'll turn misfortune into fortune.

264
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,150
Are you alright?

265
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,600
For no reason,

266
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,030
why did the Master suddenly fall ill?

267
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,790
It's nothing.

268
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,790
Where's Supervisor Kang?

269
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,960
Why isn't he here?

270
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,200
He went to find medicine for me.

271
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,600
It's alright.

272
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,960
Since Supervisor Kang isn't here,

273
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,550
I'll stay and look after him.

274
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,320
Let him rest.

275
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,480
You may go now.

276
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,120
You stayed back on purpose.

277
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,600
Do you have something to ask me?

278
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,480
What's wrong?

279
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
The convoy's jewels were stolen.

280
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,960
You have always been thorough.

281
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,670
How could something like this happen?

282
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,440
Local power holds sway.

283
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,670
Besides, I'm not feeling well.

284
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,670
It's fine.

285
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,320
I have medicine for the toxic air. I'll get it for you.

286
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,670
No need. Supervisor Kang went to get it.

287
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,080
Then I'll go find a doctor.

288
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,200
Come back!

289
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,320
You can't leave now.

290
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,750
What do you mean I can't leave?

291
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,200
Master Eight ordered

292
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,440
to seal off Bafang Tower immediately,

293
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,960
no one in or out.

294
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,510
We'll search everyone

295
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,510
until we catch this thief

296
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,910
and give Master Yan justice!

297
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,790
How did you know?

298
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,390
We were being watched as soon as we entered Bafang Tower.

299
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,200
Master Eight wants my jewels.

300
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,440
Now that the jewels are gone,

301
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,150
he won't let me leave.

302
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,910
It's that simple?

303
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,590
Search Yan's Trading Convoy

304
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,750
inside and out.

305
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,920
I want to see

306
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,720
where this petty thief could be hiding.

307
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,550
Yes, sir!

308
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,680
What are you doing?

309
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,030
All of you, stop!

310
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,070
Why aren't you chasing the thief?

311
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,590
Why are you searching the victim's place?

312
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,830
What kind of logic is this?

313
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
I am the logic.

314
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,960
It's up to the officials to handle this,

315
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,310
not you.

316
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,680
If something happens in Bafang Tower,

317
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,110
it's up to Bafang Tower's people to handle it.

318
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,750
You...

319
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,440
We searched everywhere.

320
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,550
It's all empty.

321
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,830
Where's the stuff?

322
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,000
How would we know where it is?

323
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,160
We should be asking you!

324
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,790
The stuff was lost here in your place.

325
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,200
We should be asking you!

326
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,960
Yeah.

327
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,160
Where are our things?

328
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,030
Hand it over!

329
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:12,790
Come on, speak up!

330
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,590
So, Yan Zijing,

331
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,830
a wealthy merchant from the West,

332
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,240
all your treasures

333
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,070
and Lingnan pearls are gone.

334
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,480
All of you, stay here

335
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,680
and protect Master Yan well.

336
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,720
Yes, sir!

337
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,110
Are you feeling better?

338
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,070
I'm fine.

339
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,640
The jewels probably weren't stolen by them.

340
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:48,920
Right.

341
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,270
And where's Supervisor Kang?

342
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,550
Is he

343
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,270
not coming back

344
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,830
until he catches the thief?

345
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,440
I sent him to hide the jewels.

346
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,030
You're unusually honest this time.

347
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,160
I know I can't hide things from you.

348
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,680
But...

349
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,790
Master Eight is connected with the Black Dragon Bandits.

350
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,830
I know.

351
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,590
You came to Wuling

352
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,880
just because of Master Eight.

353
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,200
And you brought Master Yue along

354
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,160
just to gain access to Bafang Tower.

355
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,480
But something unexpected happened.

356
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,480
But how would Master Eight know

357
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,960
there were colored jewels, Lingnan pearls,

358
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
among ours?

359
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,200
There's no way they could know that.

360
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,790
That's why I suspect

361
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,550
someone else

362
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,400
is behind Master Eight.

363
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,270
And it's well aware

364
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,920
of your trips to Hepu

365
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,680
and Guangzhou.

366
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,480
Could Wuling have already changed hands?

367
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,440
And the one behind this...

368
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,070
is Cui Shijiu?

369
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,350
Exactly.

370
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,680
Master.

371
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,070
Master.

372
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,550
How did it get this bad?

373
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,550
This doesn't seem like miasma poisoning.

374
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,550
Are you feeling better?

375
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,270
I was poisoned by the Black Dragon Bandits.

376
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,270
Poison from the Black Dragon Bandits?

377
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,790
When and how did it happen?

378
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,550
It's fine.

379
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,270
I'm used to it by now.

380
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,410
What do you mean?

381
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,680
I'll explain later.

382
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,550
Come here.

383
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,200
I'll tell you where the jewels are hidden.

384
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,110
When the time comes, take the jewels

385
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,550
and these people and leave first.

386
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,640
I've arranged for Zhang Jinran

387
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,750
to come and meet you.

388
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,110
And what about you?

389
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,680
Master Eight wants these jewels.

390
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,270
As long as he hasn't found them,

391
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,440
he won't harm me.

392
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
Heishan is watching me.

393
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:02,720
If I make a move,

394
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,480
it'll be hard for you all to leave.

395
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,160
Let's go!

396
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,110
Keep quiet.

397
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,880
Keep quiet!

398
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,440
Get down!

399
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,240
It's Supervisor Kang.

400
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,160
Go.

401
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,440
This way.

402
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,200
Supervisor Kang.

403
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,000
Move, quickly!

404
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,650
Hurry!

405
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,400
Mr. Zhang?

406
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,200
Mr. Zhang.

407
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,270
Duanwu!

408
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:00,880
Hurry!

409
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,110
Supervisor Kang.

410
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,200
- Quick! - Du Ming, move!

411
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,400
This way, hurry!

412
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,750
Let's go too, quickly!

413
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,440
Mr. Zhang,

414
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,440
I feel reassured with you here.

415
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,000
Yan Zijing is sick.

416
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
I can't leave him here alone.

417
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,110
Thank you.

418
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,400
Duanwu!

419
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,440
What's wrong?

420
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Why didn't you leave?

421
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,960
How did it get so bad?

422
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,640
I'm fine. You go first.

423
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
I've taken the antidote.

424
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,480
I'll be fine in two days.

425
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,410
If Master Eight finds out

426
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,240
that everyone's left

427
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,640
and you're alone here...

428
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Didn't I tell you?

429
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,850
Before he gets the jewels yet,

430
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,640
he can't kill me.

431
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,680
- And what about Cui Shijiu? - Listen to me...

432
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,310
Won't Cui Shijiu try to kill you?

433
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,110
She'd skin you alive if she could.

434
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,440
I told you,

435
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,510
I'll leave when Supervisor Kang returns.

436
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,240
You lie down first.

437
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,720
Duanwu.

438
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,880
Don't worry.

439
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,830
I'll find a way to buy us time.

440
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,920
You're burning up.

441
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,790
Master Yue!

442
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,090
- Master Yue... - Oh, Miss Duanwu!

443
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,350
Miss Duanwu.

444
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Something terrible has happened!

445
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,350
Miss Duanwu,

446
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,570
what's going on outside?

447
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,350
Why have they surrounded my room?

448
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,270
None of us can get out.

449
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,790
What's going on?

450
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,880
Master Eight has hidden motives.

451
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,440
He wants to seize the jewels from our convoy.

452
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,200
Oh...

453
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,790
Who's spreading such nonsense?

454
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,720
Since we arrived at Bafang Tower,

455
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,590
have you ever seen his true face?

456
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,920
You haven't, have you?

457
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,680
There's definitely something fishy going on.

458
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,030
Now we're at their mercy.

459
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,790
I came to tell you

460
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,440
that you and I are in the same boat.

461
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,350
You need to listen to me...

462
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,000
This has nothing to do with me!

463
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,720
We're not in the same boat.

464
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,380
Fine.

465
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,200
Then think about this, Master Yue.

466
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
If Master Eight truly kills and steals,

467
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,110
what value

468
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,750
would you have to him?

469
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,240
The only thing waiting for you is to be silenced.

470
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,590
I'm not like you all.

471
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,160
With the years of friendship between us,

472
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,550
- he'd never kill me. - Fine.

473
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,240
Then don't be so hasty.

474
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,030
Miss Duanwu, if there's nothing else, please leave.

475
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,960
I'd love to leave,

476
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,110
but it seems to me

477
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,920
you're not feeling well.

478
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,590
You have a burning sensation in your chest,

479
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,350
and your throat feels tight, doesn't it?

480
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,680
You...

481
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,830
What did you put in the tea?

482
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,200
Poison.

483
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:44,960
You...

484
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,240
I tried to reason with you.

485
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,350
This was my only choice.

486
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,440
You've harmed me!

487
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,200
I...

488
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,680
I'll kill you!

489
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
If you want the antidote,

490
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,920
you have to listen to me.

491
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,830
You...

492
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,000
Fine.

493
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,160
Master Eight, Master Yue requests to see you.

494
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,880
Let him in.

495
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,440
I must see Master Eight.

496
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Master Eight is resting. What's the matter?

497
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:41,240
I'd like to discuss a business deal with him.

498
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,440
It's about Yan Zijing's jewels.

499
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,790
Yan Zijing's jewels have been stolen.

500
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,590
Get out.

501
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,440
Who would be so bold

502
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,030
as to steal from Bafang Tower?

503
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,960
What's that supposed to mean?

504
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,160
Do you think it was us?

505
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,720
Of course not.

506
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,160
It was Yan Zijing himself.

507
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,350
His people couldn't have left.

508
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,790
You know where the jewels are?

509
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,880
Speak clearly.

510
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,920
Since it's business,

511
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,270
we should discuss the terms first.

512
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,270
You're asking for death.

513
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,440
Wait.

514
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,770
Cui Shijiu!

515
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,960
How...how are you here?

516
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,510
The Wuling Mines belong to my Cui family.

517
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,200
Why wouldn't I be here?

518
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,510
I'll do business with you,

519
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,110
but I need to know

520
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,920
how are you so certain

521
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,200
of where Yan Zijing's jewels are?

522
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,050
If I tell you where the jewels are,

523
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,480
will I still be alive afterward?

524
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,640
I, Cui Shijiu,

525
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,400
keep my word.

526
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,880
Then shouldn't we

527
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,160
first clarify the profit split on these jewels?

528
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,380
If I don't speak,

529
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,960
you won't get anything.

530
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,030
If you want me to lead the way,

531
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,000
then you'll have to pay for it.

532
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,160
Every inch of Wuling belongs to Master Eight,

533
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,480
especially those jewels.

534
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,550
Right.

535
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:36,830
The Cui family can dig up all of Wuling,

536
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,480
but how much time would that take?

537
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,200
The manpower, the resources...

538
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,510
With me, you won't need that.

539
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,110
Just give me enough people,

540
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,960
and I guarantee we'll find it tonight.

541
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,400
Eighty-twenty split.

542
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,000
You get twenty, I get eighty.

543
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,350
And that money

544
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,510
is what'll keep you alive out of here.

545
00:28:58,750 --> 00:28:59,720
Fine.

546
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,750
Give me more men.

547
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,680
Right away.

548
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,830
But Master Yue,

549
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,680
if you're deceiving me at this critical moment,

550
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,110
there won't be a trace of you left.

551
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,880
Of course.

552
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,110
Let's go, lead the way.

553
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,720
Is it here?

554
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,750
We found it!

555
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,880
I told you it was here,

556
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,880
and you didn't believe me.

557
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
Dig faster!

558
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,550
Quickly, keep digging!

559
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,070
Keep going! Faster!

560
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,590
Over there, dig faster!

561
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,200
Are the poison effects kicking in?

562
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,350
Are you still feeling unwell?

563
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,030
Much better.

564
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,200
How did you get poisoned by the Black Dragon Bandits before?

565
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,640
They once held me captive

566
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,110
for eight years.

567
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:56,790
You little brat,

568
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,350
dare to run again?

569
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,880
Let's go!

570
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,200
Every moment, I wanted to escape.

571
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,550
Even if it meant breaking my bones

572
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,160
or fighting dogs for scraps...

573
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,110
I just wanted to see the sun again.

574
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,510
Kid, you think you can escape?

575
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,920
Let's see if you can survive this beating!

576
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,110
I did everything I could to survive,

577
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,590
even if I had to struggle like an animal.

578
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,680
Eight years of captivity,

579
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,550
escaping,

580
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,550
getting beaten,

581
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,030
locked away.

582
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,110
Just like that.

583
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,750
I'm fine now.

584
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,960
Master Yue has deployed all of Bafang Tower's men.

585
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,160
Rest easy.

586
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,070
Yan Zijing's jewels aren't just these.

587
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,680
Anyway, their lives are in our hands,

588
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,680
and the jewels are still in Wuling.

589
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,240
No rush.

590
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,110
Alright.

591
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,440
Cui Jia!

592
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,030
Not a single drop of your medicine

593
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,110
entered my stomach.

594
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,760
It's actually fun

595
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,760
toying with you.

596
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,190
Look, you even lured in a fat sheep for me.

597
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,110
Your father has raised

598
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:11,070
such a vile creature.

599
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,550
You dare plot against your elders?

600
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:16,030
Such disrespect!

601
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,760
You little girl

602
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,030
trying to act like a man?

603
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,400
Has Cui Jingchu run out of sons?

604
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,230
My mistake was not killing you.

605
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,110
You're back!

606
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,030
Didn't we agree on two days?

607
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,360
Why did you return today?

608
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,590
Your orders

609
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,280
had to be completed early.

610
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,360
And guess what?

611
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,230
I ran into Cui Shijiu this time.

612
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,290
Miss Duanwu,

613
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,920
see how obedient I am?

614
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,960
This counts as a contribution, right?

615
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,360
So, please, give me the antidote.

616
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,900
I'm nearly at death's door!

617
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,670
There's no antidote.

618
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,510
Please hand over that antidote...

619
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,550
There's no poison. What antidote do you need?

620
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,080
Who said no poison? I'm itching all over!

621
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,030
I'm telling you,

622
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,030
if you don't leave now,

623
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,110
it'll really be too late.

624
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:16,920
Go quickly!

625
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,030
Duanwu.

626
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,000
Supervisor Kang.

627
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,800
Leave!

628
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,190
They're all safe?

629
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,760
They're all fine, rest assured.

630
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,670
Where's the Master?

631
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,920
He's in his room.

632
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,030
I just came from his room,

633
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,840
and I didn't see him.

634
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,280
He was on the bed when I left.

635
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,000
Cui Shijiu...

636
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,000
Do you know where Master Eight lives?

637
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,320
Be careful.

638
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,150
Cui Shijiu.

639
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,280
So it really is you.

640
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,760
Why are you here alone?

641
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,550
Where's Yan Zijing?

642
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,190
Yan Zijing has gone missing?

643
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,320
It's your duty to keep an eye on him.

644
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,800
Why ask me?

645
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,030
Stop pretending.

646
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,320
Who else but you would want

647
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,510
Yan Zijing dead?

648
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,280
Nonsense!

649
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,110
Bafang Tower is full of traps

650
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,480
and heavily guarded.

651
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,510
Even if he had wings, he couldn't escape.

652
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,280
He once faked Wei Yan's death to trap me,

653
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,960
then used an official auction

654
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,590
to cheat my Cui family out of everything.

655
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,030
He left my family in massive debt.

656
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,110
If I caught him,

657
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,710
why would I hide him?

658
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,030
I'd have killed him outright!

659
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,440
I wouldn't wait for you to ask me.

660
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,590
Fortunately, my family has a century of foundation,

661
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
wealth amassed over generations.

662
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,550
You think

663
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,150
there's no one behind me?

664
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,280
Duanwu, let's go!

665
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,320
Duanwu!

666
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,440
Duanwu!

667
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,280
Wake up!

668
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,590
Wake up!

669
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,480
Hurry up, what are you dawdling for?

670
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,280
Still slacking off?

671
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,360
Get up!

672
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,510
Get up!

673
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,630
Dead. Dump him.

674
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,110
Move aside!

675
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,840
Hurry up!

676
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,760
Move it!

677
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,710
Cui Jia!

678
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,230
Honored guests,

679
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,320
cool your tempers in this mine

680
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,710
and serve Master Eight well.

681
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,400
Heishan!

682
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,510
You're too bold.

683
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:35,190
This is Master Cui Shijiu!

684
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,590
Here, it's Master Eight's domain.

685
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,280
I don't care if you're Master Shijiu or Lady Shijiu.

686
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,230
You'd all better behave.

687
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,840
Take them away.

688
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,590
Yes, sir.

689
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,280
Play it by ear.

690
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,190
Get out!

691
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,590
Keep moving forward!

692
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,710
Move!

693
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,360
Faster!

694
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,190
Supervisor Kang.

695
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,670
Stop stalling!

696
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,320
Move!

697
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:05,590
The Master might be here too.

698
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,000
Quick!

699
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,510
Keep up!

700
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,320
Move faster!

701
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,760
Quit dawdling!

702
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,630
Hurry up!

703
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,840
Get up!

704
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:37,600
Work!

705
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,030
Move it!

706
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,150
Get up!

707
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,920
Keep moving!

708
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,480
Cui Jia,

709
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,670
assign them some hard labor.

710
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,000
Yes, sir.

711
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,960
Get to work!

712
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,800
Hurry up!

713
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:59,320
Why are you dragging your feet?

714
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,440
Get up!

715
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,280
Get to work!

716
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,030
Move faster!

717
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,360
Get up!

718
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,760
Move! Hurry up!

719
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,320
Go!

720
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,510
Let me introduce someone.

721
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:15,110
This is our Master Cui Shijiu.

722
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,030
Treat him well.

723
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,400
Master Shijiu!

724
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,840
Cui Jia!

725
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,760
Master Shijiu...

726
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,590
Over here,

727
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,320
if you don't work hard,

728
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,630
you're as good as dead.

729
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,230
Take this!

730
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,510
Cui Jia!

731
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,960
Master Shijiu!

732
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:54,960
Alright.

733
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,230
I'm leaving.

734
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,030
So, even you end up here.

735
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,320
Cui Jia, you'll meet a bad end!

736
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,590
Master Shijiu!

737
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,670
Let go of me!

738
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,480
Get up!

739
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,670
Get to work!

740
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,230
Hurry up!

741
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:19,920
Move!

742
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:21,630
What are you looking at? Get to work!

743
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,880
Didn't you hear my order?

744
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,710
Supervisor Kang,

745
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,440
we need to find a way

746
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,480
to get these people out.

747
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,320
I'll go look for the Master after that.
