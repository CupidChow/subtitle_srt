00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm sorry.

192
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,590
It was not your fault.

193
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,110
I was too careless.

194
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,790
But I knew

195
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,590
you could find me.

196
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,880
After this time,

197
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,510
I realized how important you are to me.

198
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,070
I was anxious

199
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,400
when I found out you were kidnapped.

200
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,310
My heart broke

201
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,680
when I saw you in the broken house,

202
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
not knowing whether you were alive or dead.

203
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,960
From now on,

204
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,000
I won't let you get hurt again.

205
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,350
Before,

206
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,270
I didn't have any worries in this world.

207
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,350
But I have you now.

208
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,440
You are the meaning of my life.

209
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,720
Don't worry.

210
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,000
I won't let you

211
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,200
get hurt again.

212
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,640
I was afraid.

213
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,880
I was afraid I would never see you again.

214
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,130
But I knew

215
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,590
you wouldn't leave me alone.

216
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,510
Duanwu.

217
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,330
Do you want to see the purple star

218
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,180
and the two stars shine bright?

219
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,750
I'll show you.

220
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,120
Mr. Zhang.

221
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:11,360
Lady Shiqi.

222
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,760
I have a favor to ask you.

223
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
I want to go with you to find Duanwu.

224
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,840
Lady Shiqi.

225
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,120
We're going to the desert to suppress bandits.

226
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,190
It's dangerous.

227
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,630
I promised Duanwu

228
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,280
to heal your hands.

229
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,190
Just wait for news from us in the camp.

230
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,800
Mr. Zhang.

231
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,390
My hands are about to be healed.

232
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,840
I won't drag you down.

233
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,800
I'm worried about Duanwu.

234
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,990
Mr. Zhang, please let me go with you.

235
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,060
We can't imagine

236
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,320
the dangers of the journey.

237
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,540
Besides, your hands haven't healed yet.

238
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,630
And there's a lot of inconvenience on the front line.

239
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,100
If something happens to you,

240
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,390
I can't explain it to Duanwu.

241
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,630
I'm not afraid of danger.

242
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,000
Please, Mr. Zhang.

243
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,300
Please take me with you.

244
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,760
I'm afraid I have to refuse you.

245
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,390
Mr. Zhang.

246
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,320
Please bring Duanwu back safely.

247
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,710
You must come back safely.

248
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:10,470
Let's go!

249
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,430
General!

250
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,150
General Pei.

251
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,120
General Ling said

252
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,800
he would arrive at our camp tomorrow.

253
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,360
General, please wait here for him.

254
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,400
I'm going to battle. But General Ling...

255
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,470
It's a big deal.

256
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,190
I knew I couldn't stop you.

257
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,800
So, I reported to General Ling.

258
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:34,910
General.

259
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,560
It's about the entire Pei's army.

260
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,280
Please think twice.

261
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,710
General Ling commanded you

262
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,760
not to leave the camp.

263
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,420
You and Yan Zijing's plan

264
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,800
is dangerous.

265
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,990
I'm afraid you will be in danger.

266
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,880
It is dangerous.

267
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,630
But we have to do it.

268
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,280
If I can't get there on the agreed date,

269
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,360
Duanwu, Yan Zijing,

270
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,840
and the trading convoy will be in danger.

271
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,360
No.

272
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,910
I have to go to Shijie.

273
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,190
Shijie.

274
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,800
I know you can't disobey orders.

275
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,800
Besides, the Pei's army's fate

276
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,040
is in your hands.

277
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,910
I don't want to give you a hard time.

278
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,710
I have a commitment with Yan Zijing.

279
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,430
Even if it's just me and Du Ming,

280
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,880
we'll arrive at the Piti Spring on the day of the full moon.

281
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,150
Shijie,

282
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:41,990
see you.

283
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,080
Jinran.

284
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,880
I'll give you my personal guards.

285
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,560
They are elites who have been through a lot of battles.

286
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,470
Thank you, Shijie.

287
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,880
I'm sorry

288
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,390
for you this time.

289
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,910
I understand that you cannot disobey orders.

290
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,800
See you.

291
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,710
Please.

292
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,990
Is there

293
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,950
really no purple star?

294
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,990
If there really is no purple star,

295
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,630
some people have been deceived.

296
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,080
I told you it was a lie.

297
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,430
Maybe it will come out later.

298
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,430
Let's wait a little longer.

299
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,230
Then...

300
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,520
Where do we go next?

301
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,910
I mean, where are we going

302
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,360
after we settle the Black Dragon Bandits' matter?

303
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,080
After that...

304
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,910
Let me think about it.

305
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:46,470
We'll go to Yangzhou.

306
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,430
Yangzhou?

307
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,120
Yangzhou is your hometown.

308
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,360
You told me

309
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,150
it was where my parents fell in love.

310
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,390
When the two stars shine bright,

311
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,300
we can get what we want

312
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,810
and stay together

313
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,520
forever.

314
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,710
I hope we can see the purple star today.

315
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,800
If we see the purple star, we can get what we want.

316
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,880
You're important to me.

317
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
I can't bear to leave you.

318
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,040
But I must

319
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,560
avenge the Yan family.

320
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,080
If I don't get my revenge,

321
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,190
I'll disappoint my ancestors.

322
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,520
Are you willing to leave?

323
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,630
She'll hate you.

324
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,430
Li Kui killed countless people.

325
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,670
This trip is dangerous.

326
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,710
I can only leave you at the Langhuan Dockyard.

327
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,560
If we are lucky, I will see you again

328
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,600
and apologize to you.

329
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,880
If we are not lucky,

330
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,600
I will die.

331
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,950
I wish you all the best.

332
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
There's an ambush.

333
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,630
Sogdians. The Black Dragon Bandits.

334
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,520
Kang Ju.

335
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
There are people from the Black Dragon Bandits in our trading convoy.

336
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,560
They dressed up as our guards.

337
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,800
Master!

338
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,280
Go!

339
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,560
Go!

340
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:03,910
Hurry.

341
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,710
Be careful!

342
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,390
Hide with Shrimp. Go!

343
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,150
- You... - Just go!

344
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,560
Go!

345
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,990
Don't come any closer!

346
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,390
I'll fight you!

347
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,390
Cao Da!

348
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,430
Cao Da!

349
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,040
Loud!

350
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,760
Loud!

351
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,950
Loud!

352
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,630
Run!

353
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,470
Kill!

354
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,470
Kill them all!

355
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,200
Li Kui.

356
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,760
You are a guard of the trading convoy.

357
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Shrimp, run!

358
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,470
Run!

359
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,240
A trading convoy guard wants to kill us!

360
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,640
Duanwu, run!

361
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,450
Duanwu, run!

362
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,480
A trading convoy guard wants to kill us!

363
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,750
Shrimp.

364
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,480
Duanwu!

365
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,320
Shrimp!

366
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,800
Shrimp!

367
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,320
Shrimp.

368
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,710
Shrimp.

369
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:02,200
Shrimp.

370
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,790
Shrimp.

371
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
Don't be scared.

372
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,600
I'll take you away.

373
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,840
Shrimp.

374
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,430
Shrimp.

375
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,720
Don't be scared.

376
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,030
Duanwu!

377
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:58,880
Shrimp.

378
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,190
Shrimp.

379
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,470
Duanwu!

380
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,470
