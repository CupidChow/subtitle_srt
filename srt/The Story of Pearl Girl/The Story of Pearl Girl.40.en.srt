00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,590
Your body is getting worse day by day.

13
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,870
Maybe we should leave early.

14
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,790
You always told me

15
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,070
you didn't want her to see you at your worst.

16
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,510
You're proud

17
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,630
and strong.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,750
Let's leave.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,800
It's time to go.

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,840
Is Zhang Jinran back?

21
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,560
We can leave him a message.

22
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,240
We can meet him somewhere else.

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,590
How's that thing going?

24
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,360
Have you arranged it?

25
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,590
Yes.

26
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,520
After you leave,

27
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,430
Steward Zhao will give all your money

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
to her.

29
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Good.

30
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,470
Can you bear to leave her?

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,870
Why do you want

32
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,840
to make me a belt?

33
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,430
I feel like you're losing weight.

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,870
I have lost weight.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,120
I'll make you a new belt.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
Don't you want it?

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,590
Thank you.

38
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,560
Gaoshou and Yingtao

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,870
are going to the west of the city to work as shopkeepers.

40
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,870
I made them something new.

41
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,590
I'll make one for you, too.

42
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,960
Don't think too much.

43
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,630
I thought I was the only one who would receive the gift.

44
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,630
Have you figured out what to make

45
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,840
to go to the Jewel Exhibition?

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,910
I have an idea.

47
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,910
We smashed one blood-stained pearl.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,680
We can make a pair of beads

49
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,190
out of the colorful glass.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,080
What do you think?

51
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,800
That pair of beads was Kang's tribute.

52
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,310
It's a symbol of friendly relations.

53
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,800
If we make that,

54
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,870
we're imitating it.

55
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,870
Even if we win the Jewel Exhibition,

56
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,800
it doesn't make any sense, right?

57
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,400
You have a good point.

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,630
How about I

59
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,520
add some Clear Mind's glass to it?

60
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,520
Will you like it?

61
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,750
Okay. It must be nice.

62
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,630
Walk around Yangzhou

63
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,150
with the belt.

64
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,150
Let people know

65
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,870
that Clear Mind can make belts in addition to jewelry.

66
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,630
Am I your showing stand?

67
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,560
Isn't that okay?

68
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,430
Turn around. I'll see how much bigger it is.

69
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,630
If you want to make me a belt,

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,040
you should also take a ruler.

71
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,360
Wait.

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,430
Ruler!

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,630
A ruler can measure land

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,510
and fields.

75
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,270
And it can measure clothes.

76
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,480
The ruler symbolizes justice and order.

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,750
Don't you want

78
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,120
peace and justice?

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,270
We'll make a colorful ruler

80
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,870
out of colorful glass.

81
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,310
What do you think?

82
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,240
It's okay.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Colorful ruler. I know.

84
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,830
I'll ask Mr. Qin

85
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,270
and Shiqi to make it.

86
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,830
About the Jewel Exhibition,

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,750
you don't have to worry about it.

88
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,870
They should

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,040
take charge of Clear Mind alone.

90
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,920
Right?

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
What do you mean?

92
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,720
Are you going to skip the Jewel Exhibition?

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,830
I have a more important thing to do.

94
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,600
What is it?

95
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,190
Spending time with you.

96
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,950
We will go to see the mountains and rivers.

97
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,920
We agreed.

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,160
It's such a big world, we'll go see it.

99
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
Now is the best time.

100
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,000
What's wrong?

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,120
Don't you want to go with me?

102
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,750
I want to.

103
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,390
But

104
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,480
I'd prefer you to participate in the Jewel Exhibition.

105
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,070
I hope that one day,

106
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,240
you will make everyone

107
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,240
envy you

108
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,360
and make everyone

109
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,360
see your success.

110
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,750
I hope Clear Mind will have a prosperous business.

111
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,750
I hope your journey is worth it.

112
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,870
I hope you get what you want.

113
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,480
I've gotten what I want.

114
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,630
I hope to spend

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,600
the rest of my life

116
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,600
with you in peace.

117
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,560

199

Ms. Su. Mr. Yan.

200
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm coming.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,550
Mr. Yan.

202
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,080
Zhang Jinran.

203
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,120
Here comes the imperial edict.

204
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,240
The Yan family

205
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,440
has been in business for generations and is loyal.

206
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,240
They escorted Kang to present the tribute.

207
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,240
But they were set up.

208
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,200
It's a pity that they died.

209
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,030
Now, the culprit was caught.

210
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,910
Today, I'll clear their names, give back their properties,

211
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,630
and reward them with a funeral ceremony and a hundred bolts of cloth.

212
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,670
Master Yan.

213
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,720
Take the imperial edict.

214
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

215
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,030
It's twenty years late,

216
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
but the day has come.

217
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,150
Get up.

218
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,150
Thank you.

219
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,750
We just met by chance.

220
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,480
But it's like we've been friends for years.

221
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,270
For the sake of this case,

222
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,480
you went through a lot.

223
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,240
You cleared

224
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,960
the Yan family's name.

225
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,630
Thank you.

226
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,720
Some people never understand each other.

227
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,120
Some people become friends at first sight.

228
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,120
Not to mention,

229
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,440
you are already my friend.

230
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,150
Master Yan.

231
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:03,390
Can I have a word?

232
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,630
Okay.

233
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,080
Great, Ms. Su.

234
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,150
Great.

235
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,440
Supervisor Kang.

236
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,790
Congratulations.

237
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,000
Mr. Zhang.

238
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,750
What is it?

239
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
The culprit was caught.

240
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,790
The Yan family's name is cleared.

241
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,200
It's all over.

242
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,680
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

243
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,310
What's wrong?

244
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,960
We've been through so much together.

245
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,440
I have long regarded you as a friend.

246
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,640
You can be straight.

247
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,030
What's wrong?

248
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,030
Yuchi Wuyi is dead.

249
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,830
I didn't find your antidote.

250
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,110
That's it?

251
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,200
It's okay.

252
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,920
I figured it out a long time ago.

253
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Anyway, thank you

254
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,400
for your effort.

255
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,070
By the way,

256
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,750
I have a favor to ask you.

257
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,440
Mr. Yan, just say it.

258
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,070
When I...

259
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,750
No.

260
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,400
Please

261
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,240
take care of Clear Mind in the future.

262
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,310
Actually...

263
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,310
Come on.

264
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
Actually, she already knew about it.

265
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,270
She asked me

266
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,790
for everything I did.

267
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,070
She did everything she could to find famous physicians.

268
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,550
But she didn't find a way to cure you.

269
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,110
She begged me

270
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,030
to go to the imperial physicians.

271
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,960
The imperial physicians studied the poison of the Black Dragon Pool.

272
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,030
But they didn't find a way to cure it.

273
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,830
Getting Yuchi Wuyi to reveal the formula for the cure

274
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,270
was her last hope.

275
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,000
People say, "Those who seek immortality cannot get it",

276
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,830
"Because life actually is short".

277
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,680
Many people are seeking immortality.

278
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,350
But I think

279
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,590
it's best if you make the most of the moment.

280
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,110
Duanwu.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,110
I hope

282
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,440
that whatever you do

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,640
in the future,

284
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,920
you will never be stumped by anything or anyone.

285
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,270
Painting

286
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,790
brings us good luck.

287
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,920
You hung the painting well this year.

288
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,400
You will also hang the next year's painting.

289
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,550
I have a more important thing to do.

290
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,640
What is it?

291
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,200
Spending time with you.

292
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,070
We will go to see the mountains and rivers.

293
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,200
We agreed.

294
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,240
It's such a big world, we'll go see it.

295
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,420

296
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,900
[Jewelry drawing]

297
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,720
You've been praising me a lot lately.

298
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,240
Do you want to be whipped?

299
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,070
Am I wrong to praise you?

300
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,350
No.

301
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,440
It freaks me out when you praise me.

302
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,680
Am I that scary?

303
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,000
You woke up early.

304
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,310
Here's the porridge I made for you.

305
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,550
Come on.

306
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,640
So, there you are.

307
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,550
I couldn't sleep.

308
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,640
I wanted to make you breakfast.

309
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,750
It's Longevity Porridge again.

310
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,270
Have a taste.

311
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,200
Why do you always cook Longevity Porridge?

312
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,640
You said it wasn't good last time.

313
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,680
I stuck to the recipe this time.

314
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,350
What do you think of it?

315
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,750
Just taste it, and you'll see.

316
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,000
Am I making it better?

317
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,640
It tastes better than last time.

318
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,110
Good. Eat more.

319
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,200
The Jewel Exhibition is in a few days.

320
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,720
I'm sure you'll shine

321
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,110
when the time comes.

322
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,310
Our Clear Mind

323
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,160
will be famous all over the world.

324
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,720
I've been thinking a lot lately

325
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,110
about how you've gone

326
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,680
from an arrogant

327
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,550
little girl

328
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,880
to the owner of Clear Mind.

329
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,160
It's

330
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,440
unbelievable.

331
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,920
Promise me

332
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,400
you will

333
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,200
do whatever you want

334
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,680
and never be stumped

335
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,270
by anything or anyone.

336
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,550
Okay?

337
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,720
What are you talking about?

338
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm almost done.

339
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:54,680
Eat more.

340
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,030
Don't leave.

341
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,070
What?

342
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,240
Don't leave, okay?

343
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,790
Can you not leave?

would it have ended differently?

Would we

have been different?

It will be much bigger than this lower deck.

473
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:18,760

00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,590

477
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,670

and the four seasons of the world

479

on the Peace Ruler.

480

can last forever.

482
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,670
But man cannot live forever.

483
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,670
It's just an exclamation of regret.

484
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,550

485
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,360

487
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,840
We went through a lot

488
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,880
to get to this beautiful sight.

489
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,510
I couldn't be more grateful.

490
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,360

491
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,280

the owner of Zhenlang Pavilion.

496

Business is complex.

497
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,230
I want to have a clear mind.

Advance bravely.

499
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,480
Like a boat on the water.

500
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,360
When you go against the current, face the wind and keep moving.

501
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,150
When you go downstream,

502
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,840
take advantage of the situation.

503
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,440
I believe you.

504
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,320
You can do better than me.

505
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,110
I want business to be fair.

506
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,510
I want to have a clear mind.

507
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,320
I wish the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild

508

509
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,000
and splendor.

510
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,070
Over the past 40 years,

511
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,440
I have done business in various places,

512
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,710
seen countless mountains and rivers,

513
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,670
and seen the bustling world.

514
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,760
I have regrets,

515
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,320
but I don't regret them.

516
