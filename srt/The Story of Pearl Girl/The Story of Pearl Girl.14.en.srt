[Episode 14]

12
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,660
How's it going?

13
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,680
It seems like he has a cold.

14
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
But I'm not sure.

15
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,200
Is he poisoned?

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,070
No.

17
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,430
What does he have?

18
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,260
I don't know.

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,920
Out of the way.

20
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,000
What are you doing here?

21
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,000
If he doesn't take this decoction,

22
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,840
he will not survive for two hours.

23
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
Why do you have the decoction?

24
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,030
The Cuis have a strange illness.

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,080
The onset time is different

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,590
depending on the constitution.

27
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,680
I know how to make it.

28
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,400
I've never heard of it.

29
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,080
It's the Cui family's secret.

30
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,800
We don't tell outsiders.

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,120
Well.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,710
Only I know the recipe for this decoction.

33
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,800
Besides, I am the principal of Wuling.

34
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,030
You have to listen to me.

35
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,150
Master Shijiu.

36
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,310
Do the Cuis have this weird illness?

37
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,910
My father mentioned it to me before.

38
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,470
Master Eight is allergic to lantanas.

39
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,520
Once he touches it, he develops the symptoms of a cold,

40
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
wheezing, and fainting.

41
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,400
You asked me to find this flower

42
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,000
as soon as we arrived at Wuling.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,710
You had a plan then.

44
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,280
You're brilliant.

45
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,150
You and the other stewards are fine after drinking this wine.

46
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,680
Only Master Eight is sick.

47
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,590
They couldn't find anything.

48
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,470
Fortunately, Master Eight recognized

49
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,710
the family head's token in front of them.

50
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,960
Otherwise, it's all for nothing.

51
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,400
Wuling is dangerous.

52
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,310
Only with the ownership of the mine and the family head's token

53
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,560
can I convince them.

54
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,630
We should tread lightly.

55
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,800
Yes.

About Heishan,

57
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,120
he's not a man to be trifled with.

58
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,630
Heishan is easy to deal with.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,710
He's loyal to Master Eight.

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,740
Besides, Master Eight's life

61
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,040
is in our hands.

62
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,190
He doesn't dare to do anything.

63
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,000
Every steward in Wuling is not easy to deal with.

64
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,000
We must get the mine title deed as soon as possible.

[Shaozhou Inn]
Caning was too good for you.

66

When we get to Wuling,

67
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,720
you should make amends.

68
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,410
Okay.

69
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,390
I'll listen to you.

70
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,430
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

71
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,160
Come on.

72
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Come on.

73
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,430
Put this on top.

74
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,160
Put it there.

What's wrong?

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We're not going with the trading convoy.

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,870
The Master said the trading convoy was going to the west,

79
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,880
the return date was uncertain

80
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,870
and just told him if you were homesick.

81

We...

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,850
We're homesick.

83
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,970
Don't worry.

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,200
The Master gave us a lot of money.

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,730
When we return to our hometown, we can buy a dowry

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,170
and marry a good man.

87
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,160
Okay.

88
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,800
It's better to live a peaceful life in the countryside

89
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,830
than live a life of fear

90
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,480
in the trading convoy.

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,070
Thank you for taking care of me all this time.

92
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,630

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,070
You won't be able to go if it's too late.

101

Let's go.

102
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,040
Are you homesick?

You can speak.

I'm all right.

109
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,310
Are the carriages loaded?

Yes.

Let's go.

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,510
I'll go first.

113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,750
My sleeves are fragrant.

I can't send the flower to my lover far away.

115

The flower is not rare.

116
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,630
I just want to use this flower to express my sorrow.

117
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,920
Forget it. She left early in the morning.

118
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,630
She didn't say goodbye to you.

119
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,800
It's all right. We'll catch up with them.

120
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,870
Are you worried about her?

121
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,560
Sort of.

122
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,720
From the Cui's Pearl Farm to the Yue family of Shaozhou ,

123
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,390
he never miscalculated.

124
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,000
It was as if he were weaving a huge net,

125
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,500
driving his prey into a corner,

126
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
and hanging them in it.

127
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,360
Who is his next prey?

128
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,720
You mean Yan Zijing?

129
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,670
What do you think?

130
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,790
I don't think so.

131
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,390
Then, you should eat more to replenish your brain.

132
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,320
Don't add tea leaves until the water is boiling.

133
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,600
Okay.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,670
Don't drink the first boiling water. Pour it away.

135
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,000
Don't drink the first boiling water. Pour it away.

136
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,150
Pour it away.

137
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,800
Don't drink the second boiling water.

138
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,090
Pour it into a boiled water vessel.

139
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,810
When the tea blends with water,

140
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,480
and the water is boiling,

141
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,450
it is the third boiling.

142
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,720
It is ready.

143
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,600
The water is boiling.

144
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Third boiling.

145
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,390
Wait.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,270
Wash the teaware with the second boiling water.

147
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,870
Is there anything wrong?

148
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,080
No.

149
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,910
Master.

150
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,200
I didn't know

151
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,690
you were so picky.

152
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,200
It's a long way.

153
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,200
I don't have anything to do.

154
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,720
You don't have anything to do.

155
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,640
Is that why

156
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,080
you're teasing me?

157
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
I'm not teasing you.

158
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm teaching you how to make tea.

159
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,550
It would have been perfect

160
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,400
if you had baked the tea cake before.

161
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,550
I learned to make tea.

162
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,860
But what I want to learn is jewelry, business,

163
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:22,820
or...

164
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,150
Anyway, I don't want to learn to make tea.

165
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,390
I told you I would teach you.

166
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,870
You should learn

167
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,200
how to make tea first.

168
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,440
I told you.

169
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,550
You didn't bake the tea cake. Start over.

170
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,790
Why don't you drink this pot first?

171
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,360
The tea is precious.

172
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,820
Don't waste it.

173
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,670
You have a cup.

174
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,720
I'll pass.

175
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,170
It's too precious.

176
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,870
Master, please.

177
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,850
Master, please.

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,640
Master, please.

179
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Master, please.

180
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,510
You...

181
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,550
It's good tea.

182
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,440
You should drink more.

183
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
Duanwu has been in the Master's carriage

184
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,630
for a long time.

185
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,670
Maybe Master Yan wants to talk to her.

186
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,420
What are you worried about?

187
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,200
Shiqi, you don't know.

188
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm worried

189
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,000
Master is plotting against Duanwu.

190
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,790
Why are you laughing?

191
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,000
Master Yan is not that kind of person.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,720
I'm afraid they'll fall in love with each other.

193
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,600
Fall in love?

194
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:06,880
Mm.

195
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,390
Who fell in love with whom?

196
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,150
Don't pry.

197
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,750
All right. I'll tell you.

198
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,670
The Master fell in love with Duanwu.

199
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,360
Maybe Duanwu fell in love with the Master.

200
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,080
That's what I'm worried about.

201
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,030
If they love each other,

202
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,030
isn't it a good thing?

203
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,430
They don't fit.

204
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,000
Mr. Zhang and Duanwu fit.

205
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,630
Why?

206
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,120
The Master treats Duanwu badly.

207
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,480
But Mr. Zhang is completely different.

208
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,880
He's educated, reasonable, and tender.

209
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,430
Most importantly, he's nice to Duanwu.

210
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,960
Mr. Zhang is the best for Duanwu.

211
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,120
Is the right person the best?

212
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,670
Love me tender.

213
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,720
Love me long.

214
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,030
It's important that they love each other.

215
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,550
It's important if they fit.

216
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,790
Don't fall in love with the wrong person.

217
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,750
Love with the right person lasts.

218
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,750
It's aurin.

219
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,550
It's native to Kuran.

220
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,630
A delicate texture without cracks is preferred.

221
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,790
Aurin.

222
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,000
This one is called fire bead.

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,750
Many dignitaries like it.

224
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,000
The gentiles would tribute it to the imperial court.

225
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,750
Fire bead.

226
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,000
This one.

227
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,000
This one is called emerald.

228
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,600
It has a long history.

229
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,120
But very few people know about it.

230
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,000
Emerald.

231
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:47,910
Yes.

232
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,880
It's so clear.

233
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,080
And it's deep green.

234
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,910
It gives me a bottomless feeling.

235
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,720
Master.

236
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,750
Emeralds are similar to you.

237
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,880
What is this?

238
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,840
It's a moonstone.

239
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,320
It's clearer.

240
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,550
It's bright.

241
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,790
A gentleman is like the moon.

242
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,120
The moonstone

243
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,600
is more like

244
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Lady Shiqi.

245
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,550
It's also similar to Mr. Zhang.

246
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,960
They are like it.

247
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,430
The moonstone goes well

248
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,910
with the emerald.

249
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,200
I don't think so.

250
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,510
You're right.

251
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,880
The emerald is too eye-catching.

252
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,360
It makes the moonstone look unremarkable.

253
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,120
What about this?

254
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,880
If you use a Nanyang pearl

255
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,270
with a moonstone...

256
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,390
They don't fit.

257
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,720
What do you mean by that?

258
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,840
One is from the deep sea.

259
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,080
The other one is from the mountains.

260
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,600
They don't go well together.

261
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,150
Is there such a thing?

262
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,080
Of course.

263
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,000
Western Regions colored stones don't go well with Central Plains jewelry.

264
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
Look.

265
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,550
The Nanyang pearl and the moonstone

266
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,390
are pure.

267
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,790
They complement each other

268
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,150
and go well together.

269
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,150
It has

270
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:38,320
a hazy feeling.

271
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,670
It's nice.

272
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,030
In that case,

273
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,880
why don't you

274
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,670
use an emerald with a pearl?

275
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,200
It's even better.

276
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,430
Better?

277
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,510
It's more eye-catching.

278
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,120
They set each other off very well.

279
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,430
In that case,

280
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,030
I'll give you a question.

281
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,990
Make an ornament

282
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,150
with emeralds and Nanyang pearls

283
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,710
and bring it to me tomorrow.

284
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,190
Pearl.

285
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:17,950
Aurin.

286
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,080
Well. Ask Kang Ju to stop.

287
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,230
We're camping here tonight.

288
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,190
Do it.

289
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,360
Supervisor Kang.

290
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,320
The Master wants to go to the toilet. We're camping here tonight.

291
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:33,560
Okay.

292
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,990
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

293
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,600
Do you want more tea?

294
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,360
I'll make it for you.

295
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,730
Put it in that tent.

296
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,520
Move this over.

297
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:58,880
Okay.

298
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,360
Hurry up.

299
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,880
Mr. Zhang.

300
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,990
Duanwu.

301
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,430
I didn't have time

302
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,320
to say goodbye to you in Shaozhou.

303
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,670
I didn't expect to meet you here.

304
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,430
Are you going back to Chang'an?

305
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,880
No.

306
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,670
I'm going to travel around.

307
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,630
I don't have a destination in mind.

308
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,280
Travel around.

309
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,430
Where are you going?

310
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,950
We're going to Wuling.

311
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,470
Wuling?

312
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,990
Wuling is a great place.

313
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,430
Maybe I'll go there.

314
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,760
Mr. Zhang, are you interested in Wuling?

315
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,950
I'm traveling around.

316
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,150
I'll go wherever I want.

317
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,230
It's a big world.

318
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,630
But we met here.

319
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,360
Duanwu.

320
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,710
We have a connection with Mr. Zhang.

321
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,670
Mr. Zhang, are you leaving later?

322
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,800
Of course not.

323
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,600
Since you're also going to Wuling,

324
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,120
we can go together.

325
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
Would you like

326
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,670
to have some wild foods with Duanwu and me tonight?

327
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,080
Okay.

328
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,360
Supervisor Kang, awesome. You didn't miss a shot.

329
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,560
Mr. Zhang, do you want to give it a try?

330
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,760
Take this one.

331
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,560
You got it.

332
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,630
Mr. Du, you're awesome, too.

333
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,120
It's easy.

334
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,120
Duanwu, you told me you wanted to learn archery.

335
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,560
I'll teach you today.

336
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,190
Is that okay?

337
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,150
Try it yourself.

338
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,840
Shrimp, how about it?

339
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,120
Duanwu, you were so close.

340
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
That chicken was running fast.

341
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,390
Come on.

342
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,710
You don't have enough strength if you don't want to kill it.

343
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,560
I'll teach you.

344
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,320
Hold it up.

345
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,560
Straighten your arm.

346
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,670
Raise your elbow.

347
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,600
Pull the string.

348
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:05,880
Okay.

349
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,760
Aim at the prey.

350
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,520
Do you see it?

351
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,990
Duanwu, you got it.

352
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,880
Duanwu, awesome.

353
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,470
Let me see.

354
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,600
Duanwu, we have a lot of chickens to eat tonight.

355
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,080
You don't have to show your teeth

356
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,760
in everything.

357
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,620
It's only about archery.

358
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,700
Mr. Zhang, I hope

359
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,280
you'll do your own thing.

360
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,580
I hope you'll work for the people

361
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,150
and punish injustice.

362
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,800
That's what you should do.

363
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,710
Of course.

364
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,360
I'll do it.

365
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
That would be the best.

366
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,910
Duanwu.

367
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:05,900
You're fetching water.

368
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,670
Mr. Zhang.

369
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:07,670
Let me help you.

370
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,880
No need.

371
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,390
- Let me. - Let me help you.

372
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,520
I'm almost done.

373
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,250
Okay.

374
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,060
I have some good news for you.

375
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,280
The Cui family was ordered to pay a high amount of compensation.

376
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,950
They can't turn the situation around.

377
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,190
They deserve it.

378
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,320
This is good news.

379
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,800
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

380
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,190
I thought of a story today.

381
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,630
What story?

382
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,760
Would you like to hear it?

383
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,630
Okay.

384
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,420
Once upon a time, there was a scholar.

385
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,710
He traveled by boat.

386
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,280
But he encountered a storm.

387
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,200
Fortunately,

388
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,390
he was saved by a beautiful mermaid.

389
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,560
From then on,

390
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,600
the scholar told the mermaid stories

391
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,800
about the world.

392
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,710
The mermaid

393
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,040
told the scholar stories about the sea.

394
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,520
They fell in love

395
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,190
at first sight.

396
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,950
But the mermaid couldn't leave the sea.

397
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,880
The scholar couldn't live at sea.

398
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,190
The sea separated them.

399
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,910
From then on,

400
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,320
the scholar looked everywhere for medicine

401
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,640
that would make the mermaid grow legs.

402
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,120
He wanted to be with her forever.

403
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,800
Done.

404
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,440
Mr. Zhang, why do you think

405
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,520
it's a sad story?

406
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,530
I don't think so.

407
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,860
The mermaid couldn't leave the sea.

408
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,150
The scholar couldn't live at the sea.

409
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,840
Why do they force it?

410
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,060
In that case,

411
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,880
their meeting was a mistake.

412
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,780
I don't feel sad,

413
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
but regretful.

414
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,430
Besides,

415
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,880
The scholar wanted the mermaid to grow legs.

416
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,150
But he didn't think

417
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,880
about finding the medicine to turn himself into a merman.

418
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,390
It's a pity.

419
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,080
Let's go.

420
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,150
Go.

421
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,880
Duanwu.

422
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,880
What if the scholar wanted to become a merman?

423
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
Mr. Zhang.

424
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,230
Life is not a story.

425
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,840
There is no such medicine in the world.

426
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,150
Right?

427
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,390
Yes.

428
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:09,120
Let's go.

429
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,800
I'll get water.

430
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,470
I'll go first.

431
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,840
Are you happy?

432
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,800
What are you doing here?

433
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,230
There's no meat in your meal.

434
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,190
I got some for you.

435
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,760
Eat it.

436
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,520
You're ungrateful.

437
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,430
You had a good time.

438
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,840
You've been sitting on a cushion

439
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,880
in a carriage these days.

440
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,150
What about me?

441
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,360
I've been sitting in a trailer.

442
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,760
It was bumpy.

443
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,520
I...

444
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,910
I'm falling apart.

445
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,520
How could you face me?

446
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,840
Are you going to comfort me with a few pieces of meat?

447
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,760
I never did anything wrong to you

448
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,600
or to the Yue family.

449
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,040
You should

450
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,190
blame yourself for all this.

451
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,520
What?

452
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,280
I worked hard

453
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,080
just to get you to marry a good man.

454
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,520
Did I do anything wrong?

455
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,670
Look at you.

456
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,710
You joined them

457
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,040
in bullying me.

458
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,080
You wanted to sell me.

459
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,040
You didn't do it for me

460
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,280
but for the Yue family.

461
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,800
What was wrong with that?

462
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,670
Think about it.

463
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,280
Where did I get the money

464
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,710
to spoil you?

465
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,670
It was all from the Yue family.

466
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,120
You should return the favor.

467
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,770
Have you thought about me?

468
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,040
I am human,

469
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,910
not a product.

470
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,250
Should I be sold

471
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,040
just because I'm a girl?

472
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,460
Let me ask you.

473
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,380
What am I to you?

474
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,910
You wanted to cut off my hand for money.

475
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,630
I didn't want to bring it up.

476
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,800
You knew

477
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,630
I had no other pursuit in my life

478
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,360
than to carve jade.

479
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,800
You even wanted to take it from me.

480
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,320
Don't talk about gratitude.

481
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,460
You...

482
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,940
How dare you!

483
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,430
I'm your father. How could you talk to me like that?

484
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,780
If it weren't for me,

485
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,360
you would have been thrown into a well

486
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,840
and drowned.

487
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,280
I...

488
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,260
I'd rather drown

489
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,080
than have a father like you.

490
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:10,600
You...

491
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,130
You...

492
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,240
You...

493
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,730
You...

494
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,390
Shrimp, does it smell good?

495
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,680
Smell it.

496
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,230
It smells great.

497
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,670
You have the first bite when it's done, okay?

498
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,470
Supervisor Kang.

499
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,280
That's very nice of you.

500
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,360
Shrimp, do you want a flatbread?

501
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,360
Okay.

502
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,840
You didn't put it in.

503
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,540
It tastes good.

504
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,840
- Who's there? - Stop it.

505
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,390
Come out.

506
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,390
He looks like...

507
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,320
Cao Da.

508
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,700
It's me.

509
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,480
I saw you in the morning.

510
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,560
But I couldn't believe my eyes.

511
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,880
I see you again.

512
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,320
Why do you look like this?

513
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,560
What are you doing here?

514
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,470
After I was kicked off the boat,

515
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,560
I didn't know where to go.

516
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,840
I walked here.

517
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,470
Then, I met you.

518
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,670
Master,

519
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,450
it was my fault

520
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,360
for betraying the trading convoy.

521
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,150
I was wrong.

522
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,230
I was wrong.

523
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,950
Please forgive me.

524
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,950
The book says

525
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,360
it's better late than none.

526
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,910
It's "It's better late than never."

527
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,910
Yeah, it's better late than never.

528
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,990
Please give me a chance.

529
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,880
I'll do whatever you want.

530
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,000
I can do everything.

531
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,040
I was promoted

532
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,390
because of my strength.

533
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,800
Duanwu, you punished him.

534
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,710
You decide

535
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,990
whether to let him stay or not.

536
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,950
Master, I...

537
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:36,840
Duanwu.

538
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,800
I know you are cold on the outside,

539
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,520
but you are kind on the inside.

540
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,950
Duanwu, you're kind.

541
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,560
I broke your trust.

542
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,460
No. Pang Song broke your trust.

543
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,670
No. It's all my fault.

544
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:55,520
I'm at your disposal.

545
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,670
I'm begging you.

546
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,120
- Please let me stay. - Wait.

547
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,950
Get up. Don't do that in front of so many people.

548
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,150
Are you willing to do anything?

549
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,910
Yes.

550
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,150
Are you willing to start at the bottom?

551
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,990
Yes.

552
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:17,190
Here's a chicken leg.

553
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,430
Eat a chicken leg first.

554
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,430
We'll roast chicken feet for you later.

555
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,560
Come on.

556
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,150
Duanwu, thank you.

557
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,040
Let's go eat chicken feet.

558
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,800
This chicken leg is a little burnt.

559
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,960
You forgave him?

560
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,260
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

561
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,710
You taught me that.

562
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,470
Make the best use of things and men.

563
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,600
That's it.

564
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,230
Our trading convoy is short of hands.

565
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,600
Why don't we let Cao Da stay?

566
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,500
It's good for all of us.

567
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,520
Mr. Zhang, I've been looking all over for you.

568
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,190
The meat is ready. Let's go eat.

569
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,430
Why bother?

570
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,360
It's not going to work out with you and her.

571
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,280
Your future wife

572
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,990
will be a daughter of a good family.

573
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,910
If you marry her,

574
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,560
you have to go against your whole family.

575
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,760
Are you willing to marry her

576
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:02,280
as a concubine?

577
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,390
That's the reality.

578
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,670
Let's go back to Chang'an tomorrow.

579
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,600
We're going to Wuling.

580
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,960
There must have been something wrong with the national gift.

581
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,910
Yunxiu, here.

582
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,520
Be careful.

583
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,080
Mr. Zhang, have one.

584
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,880
Yeah. Have a taste. I made it.

585
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,840
It's delicious.

586
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,080
I'll have one, too.

587
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:43,950
Duanwu.

588
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,360
Duanwu.

589
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,520
It's burnt.

590
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,800
It's all right.

591
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,840
Here.

592
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,330
- Eat mine. - Eat mine.

593
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,980
I roasted these chicken feet for Cao Da.

594
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,110
Cao Da, eat chicken feet.

595
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:17,180
Okay.

596
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,160
Come on.

597
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,840
Thank you, leader.

598
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,160
Just eat mine.

599
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,680
Thank you, Master.

600
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Eat a flatbread with it.

601
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,680
Okay.

602
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,550
Give me some.

603
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,470
Mr. Zhang, I heard you went to fetch water today.

604
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,030
But you got nothing.

605
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,200
You came first

606
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,950
but were not served.

607
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,430
Maybe you're in the wrong place.

608
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,070
Leader, I'm happy to be back in the trading convoy.

609
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,590
Let me dance for you.

610
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,110
Okay, I'll dance with you.

611
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,110
Come on.

612
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,910
Count me in.

♪How can we resist gazing at each other amid the blooms?♪

614
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,220

♪Drifting afar on the shore of your life. Quietly watching over you♪

623
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,110
It's time to go again.

624
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,720
If there's still a bumpy road ahead,

625
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,430
my butt can't stand it anymore.

626
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:25,280
My body is falling apart.

627
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,720
Hurry up, guys.

628
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,490
Come on.

629
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,770
Hurry up.

630
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,280
Come on.

631
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,360
Master Yan.

632
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,280
What is it?

633
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,990
Could you take care of my father?

634
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,100
He just got caned.

635
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,060
He can't stand the bumps.

636
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,600
Don't you hate him?

637
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:02,280
He raised me.

638
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,280
All right.

639
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,990
I'll get him a carriage.

640
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,880
Thank you, Master Yan.

641
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,030
This

642
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,030
is for you.

643
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,360
I think you should take it back.

644
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,470
Thank you.

645
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,720
I'll go back.

646
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,160
Okay.

647
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,680
Master.

648
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,530
Everything is almost packed.

649
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,680
We'll be ready to go in a minute.

650
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,110
Okay.

651
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,840
I told Yunxiu what happened in Shaozhou

652
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,140
and in the Yue's mansion.

653
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,900
Thank you for taking her with us.

654
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,370
You've thanked me for that.

655
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,680
If it weren't for me,

656
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:03,950
she wouldn't have gone through this.

657
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,510
If it weren't for you,

658
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,510
her hands would be broken.

659
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,720
If it weren't for you,

660
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,390
she would have been sold.

661
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,640
You saved her.

662
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,280
She will have new hope

663
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,910
with us.

664
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,430
I hope so.

665
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,070
What kind of dance is that?

666
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,680
- It is... - It's the hand-waving dance.

667
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,720
It is to drive away evil spirits,

668
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,910
diseases, and plagues.

669
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,430
Hand-waving dance...

670
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,910
It means

671
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,720
that they are praying for someone.

672
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,800
That's right.

673
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,640
Looks like someone in the Bafang Tower is sick.

674
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,590
He should be a big shot.

675
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,250
If I'm right,

676
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,200
it should be Master Eight.

677
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,440
Look.

678
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,490
They are giving away porridge.

679
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,160
Master Eight is a good man.

680
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,280
Master Eight is a member of the Cui family.

681
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,280
Wuling is famous for the Wuling Quarry.

682
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,540
The Wuling Mines

683
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,430
was created by the old master of the Cui family.

684
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,760
Then, it was handed over to the Cui's eighth son,

685
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,760
that is Master Eight.

686
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,720
Mr. Zhang, you know a lot.

687
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,760
I'm not as good as you.

688
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,200
I'm a businessman.

689
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,950
All I know is that someone owes me money,

690
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,280
and I have to ask for it.

691
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,800
Go.

692
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,430
We can't follow his lead.

693
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,760
He's waiting for us to make the first move.

694
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,910
But this is not the time.

695
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,680
Here.

696
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,180
Thank you.

697
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,920
Stay close.

698
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,610
Thank you.

699
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,360
Get away. Get in line.

700
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,880
Come here, Yunxiu.

701
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,390
Don't walk around.

702
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,000
This is different from the rumors.

703
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,880
Next one.

704
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,910
- Loud, keep an eye on him. - Why is this porridge so thin?

705
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,030
Can't you give me more?

706
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,410
Shut up.

707
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,200
- Leader, that guy is weird. - Next one.

708
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I'll check it out.

709
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,320
Go.

710
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:52,910
Duanwu.

711
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,470
Where are you going to stay?

712
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,550
- We... - We'll stay at the Bafang Tower.

713
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,950
Mr. Yan, it would be amazing

714
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,950
if you could stay at the Bafang Tower.

715
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,280
Mr. Yan, don't worry.

716
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,120
With my relationship with Master Eight,

717
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,360
we can stay at the Bafang Tower.

718
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,510
Thank you, Master Yue.

719
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,720
Mr. Zhang, because of your identity,

720
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,590
you can't stay at the Bafang Tower.

721
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,840
You'd better find an official inn.

722
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,030
Don't worry about me.

723
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,590
Get in line.

724
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,590
Duanwu.

725
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,910
Take care.

726
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:33,800
Next one.

727
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,360
Mr. Zhang, take care.

728
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,430
Keep an eye on the Bafang Tower.

729
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,030
Yes.

730
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,320
Go.

731
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,160
I'll do it.

732
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,030
Can you do it?

733
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,010
Again.

734
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,430
Come on.

735
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,240
Come on.

736
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,640
It's okay. That's what they do.

737
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,130
When Master Eight sees me,

738
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,220
I promise...

739
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,550
Wei Yan, settle them down.

740
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,240
Yes.

741
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,460
Be careful.

742
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,160
Kang Ju.

743
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,540
Come with me to meet Master Eight.

744
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,390
Please.
