I brought the deposit today.

98
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,560
Is the deposit too heavy

99
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,190
or are you embarrassed to take it out?

100
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
What is the meaning of this?

101
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,480
It's just a deposit.

102
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,510
How could Mr. Shi even care
about such a small sum?

103
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,880
An idea just came to me,

104
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,600
With your pearls, Mr. Shi,

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
they're certainly valuable as they are.

106
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,190
But if made into jewelry,

107
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
they would fetch

108
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
twice the price.

109
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,000
For instance,

112
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,270

114

- Don't listen to her...
- Hold on.

a promise is worth its weight in gold.

139

As long as I'm satisfied
with the samples,

140
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,600

They knew you were out on business,

158

190
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,360
Today, you'll see the price
of betraying the convoy.

191
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,200
Master,

192
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
I didn't!

193
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,470
I...

194
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,160
Master, perhaps this needs
further investigation.

195
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,430
Accountant Wei may have been framed

196
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:22,820
by someone...

197
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,810
I found this deed in her room.

198
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,350
It's from the Cui family.

199
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,360
The deed is for

200
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,240
one of the top jewelry shops
in Yangzhou.

201
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,630
Seems Cui Shijiu spared no expense
on you.

202
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,400
Guards!

203
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:35,790
Yes, sir.

204
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,500
Take her away and execute her.

205
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,040
Yes, sir!

206
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,680
Wait!

207
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,470
Master,

208
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,040
this matter needs further investigation!

209
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,150
Speak up! Say something!

210
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,610
Stop!

211
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,790
Yan Zijing,

212
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,790
why show such disregard for life?

213
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,680
This is my convoy.

214
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,110
When they boarded the ship,

215
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,680
they signed a contract.

216
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,360
Their lives belong to me.

217
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,760
But this is Tang territory,

218
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,230
under Tang law.

219
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,880
If you persist,

220
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,570
I'll have no choice but to report you.

221
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,580
Fine.

222
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,080
Zhang Jinran,

223
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,190
I'll give you a bit of courtesy today.

224
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,040
Wei Yan betrayed the convoy.

225
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,070
Throw her into the sea.

226
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,760
Banish her from the convoy!

227
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,320
Yes, sir!

228
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,400
Thank you, Master.

229
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,910
Accountant Wei...

230
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,320
Accountant Wei!

231
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,110
Everyone, clear out.

232
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,800
See you, Master.

233
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,420
Hurry, let's go!

234
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,490
Quick, move!

235
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,320
When did you discover Wei Yan's actions?

236
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,990
Last night.

237
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,390
Then why not deal with it last night?

238
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,390
If I'd dealt with it then,

239
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,630
how would I play today's game?

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you had acted last night,

241
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,890
things wouldn't be like this now.

242
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,120
I could have sealed the deal
with the Southern Seas traders.

243
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
That's far from enough.

244
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,510
Far from enough?

245
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,480
Buying pearls in Guangzhou
is a big matter,

246
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,840
yet you sent me,

247
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,600
someone that Cui Shijiu considers
as a mere pearl diver.

248
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,080
And you pretended not to see

249
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,600
Wei Yan's dealings with Cui Shijiu

250
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,790
make her feel too comfortable.

251
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,150
You showed me jewelry and the hairpins

252
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,240
to tempt Shi Nawei

253
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,000
into making pearl hairpins.

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,080
But it would be best
if he made this deal with Cui Shijiu.

255
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,390
This way,

256
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,430
once pearls become hairpins,

257
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,790
they can't be tribute pearls,

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
and she'll need to spend a fortune.

259
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,460
You have planned everything.

260
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,150
You're growing smarter by the day.

261
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,060
We're just pawns on your board.

262
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,480
You're not wrong.

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,790
Duanwu,

264
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,720
this is what you called

265
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,000
hope?

266
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,360
It hurts...

267
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,150
- Let me blow, and the pain will go away.
- It hurts...

268
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,670
I'll cover it for you.

269
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,480
The pain will go away.

270
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,790
Loud, speak louder.

271
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,320
This is as loud as I get.

272
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:41,580
Louder, like me.

273
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,880
This is the loudest I can go!

274
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,360
Sister, where did you go just now?

275
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,510
I went to get you something tasty.

276
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,750
Does it still hurt?

277
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,200
No, it doesn't.

278
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,180
If it hurts, tell me. Don't keep it in.

279
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,030
Do you regret it?

280
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,510
Regret what?

281
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,670
Running away with me.

282
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,670
No regrets.

283
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,510
I know you care for me most.

284
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,030
Wherever you are,

285
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,510
it's not hardship.

286
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,030
Where there's you,

287
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,200
there's home.

288
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,510
I'm sorry.

289
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,910
But I promise you,

290
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,750
I'll make a home for you

291
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,000
and protect you well.

292
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,850
Don't bother with Pang Song and Cao,

293
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,840
those petty people.

294
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,010
I believe that one day,

295
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,270
I'll make sure those scoundrels

296
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,960
won't dare to harm us anymore.

297
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,510
Don't worry about it.

298
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:46,880
Master,

299
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,600
we couldn't find Wei Yan.

300
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,950
Nice.

301
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,520
Let's finalize the contract right away.

302
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,470
Hold on!

303
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,360
You wish to sell pearls as hairpins,

304
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,970
but do you know Guangzhou's market?

305
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,990
Where will they be sold?

306
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,470
What are the preferences
and taboos in selling hairpins?

307
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Do you know, my honored guest?

308
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,560
You don't know.

309
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,040
You urged him to enter this business,

310
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,880
so, do you know?

311
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,840
I don't know.

312
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,150
I only know
that Yan's Trading Convoy's jewelry

313
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,390
is the finest there is.

314
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,710
Not necessarily.

315
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,710
These are Yan's hairpins from Yangzhou,

316
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,800
once popular among royal families,

317
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,150
highly fashionable at the time.

318
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,710
The design catalog now rests

319
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,950
with my family, the Cui.

320
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,430
Much of the craftsmanship
is lost to time,

321
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,430
and only my family can recreate it.

322
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,150
Opening the market
with seven unique hairpin designs

323
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,600
wouldn't be better?

324
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,390
This lacework is quite intricate.

325
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,760
Yan's Trading Convoy sincerely wishes
to work with Mr. Shi.

326
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,600
Besides designs and craftsmen,

327
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,390
we're also willing
to invest thirty percent

328
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,360
as a gesture of goodwill.

329
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,710
Thirty percent?

330
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,390
We will offer forty percent.

331
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,470
Are you willing to risk everything
to fight Yan Zijing?

332
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,760
I must acquire

333
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,560
this batch of pearls.

334
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,320
Mr. Shi,

335
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,320
additionally,

336
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,950
I'll add another five hundred
in deposit,

337
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,670
and we'll split the profits fifty-fifty.

338
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,520
But I want all your future pearls.

339
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,670
Fifty-fifty?

340
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,280
Yes.

341
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,630
Deal.

342
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,710
Then, young miss,

343
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,630
we'll do business another time.

344
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,150
Let me remind you,

345
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,990
if it sells for less than ten million,

346
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,520
it'll be a losing deal.

347
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,680
I heard someone's dead!

348
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,540
Someone's dead!

349
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,430
Hurry!

350
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,560
Someone's dead!

351
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,660
Let's go and look!

352
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,430
Someone's dead!

353
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:37,730
Someone's been killed!

354
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,450
Who was it?

355
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,380
She's been killed!

356
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,600
She's dressed nicely.

357
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,140
I heard she's from the ship.

358
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:44,780
I don't know her.

359
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,910
How did someone end up dead like this?

360
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,080
I have no idea.

361
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,040
It's so frightening.

362
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,910
Accountant Wei!

363
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,360
Someone reported
to the governor's office.

364
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,150
They claim to have seen
a murder by the river.

365
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,150
I led the men in searching
for a body along the river,

366
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,040
and sure enough,

367
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,990
we found it.

368
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,600
There's a reward for any informants.

369
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,470
There's a reward!

370
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,300
Do you know her?

371
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,820
I don't know.

372
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,960
I don't know her either.

373
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:31,990
Law officer,

374
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,370
it's him!

375
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,190
He killed by the riverside last night!

376
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,510
He killed her?

377
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,200
That man?

378
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,160
That tall one?

379
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,960
Yesterday, someone saw
with their own eyes

380
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,480
that Yan Zijing threw
his accountant Wei Yan overboard.

381
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,590
Today, a fisherman confirmed

382
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,960
that Yan Zijing killed Wei Yan
by the river.

383
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,160
Guards, search his ship top to bottom.

384
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,240
Don't overlook any clues!

385
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,160
Yes, sir!

386
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,270
Make way!

387
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,600
- Make way!
- Move aside!

388
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,590
Step back!

389
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,240
Step aside!

390
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,800
Special Envoy Xu, what brings you here?

391
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,280
Master Yan is a distinguished merchant
from Kang.

392
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,360
With such an incident,

393
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
how could I not come to see for myself?

394
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,670
It doesn't matter who he is,

395
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,990
whether noble or common,

396
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,630
we follow the rules.

397
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,080
Special Envoy Xu, rest assured.

398
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,630
Naturally, we should
enforce the law fairly.

399
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,600
Then,

400
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,910
I won't interfere further.

401
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,040
Go ahead and handle the case.

402
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,840
Law officer,
there's blood on this knife.

403
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,670
With both witnesses and evidence,

404
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,630
what else do you have to say?

405
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,360
Take him away!

406
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,800
Yes, sir.

407
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,080
Hold on.

408
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,120
Master Yan has extensive dealings
with Guangzhou's jewelry industry.

409
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,670
If he's taken away,

410
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,430
perhaps the government

411
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,840
should keep the cargo on this ship
in custody.

412
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,760
Once the case is resolved,

413
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,670
you can decide what to do with it.

414
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,800
What do you think, Law Officer Zhou?

415
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,150
The murder case isn't closed yet,

416
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,630
so why are you seizing
our convoy's goods?

417
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,760
How dare you!

418
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,360
The government is handling this case.

419
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,080
It's not your place to meddle!

420
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,280
Law Officer arrives,

421
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,360
then right after, Special Envoy Xu,

422
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,150
rather convenient timing.

423
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:35,560
Surely you're not here
just for the jewels on the ship?

424
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,560
Miss, that's not quite right.

425
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,390
While Yan's Trading Convoy
is indeed distinguished,

426
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,950
knowing the law doesn't mean
he can break it

427
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,670
or put himself above the rules.

428
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,950
Besides,
with both witnesses and evidence,

429
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,470
the case is ironclad.

430
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,710
Ironclad, you say?

431
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,280
Senior Brother, you're here.

432
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,360
Junior Brother.

433
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
Securing assets requires
an inventory check first.

434
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:21,190
We can't handle it carelessly.

435
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,320
Moreover, the case hasn't
even been formally tried.

436
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,280
Even if it were closed,

437
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,360
the goods would need
to go through official auction

438
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,520
and be distributed as per contract,

439
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,880
including compensation
for the victim's family.

440
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,910
You're right, Junior Brother.

441
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,080
But what if

442
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:41,430
someone on board tries
to smuggle goods and escapes?

443
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,390
What should we do then?

444
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,280
I can assure you,

445
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,150
not a single person from our convoy
will flee!

446
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:48,760
Right,

447
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,800
no one from the convoy will run.

448
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,040
If you're still concerned,

449
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,910
we can seal everything first

450
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,470
as a preventive measure.

451
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,670
And to show
the government's impartiality,

452
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,390
I'll personally seal the goods.

453
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,360
Master Yan,

454
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,600
what do you think?

455
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,560
With Mr. Zhang's guarantee, I'm at ease.

456
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,710
Very well, then.

457
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,150
With Junior Brother's assurance,

458
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,040
I am at ease too.

459
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,150
I have other matters to attend to.

460
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,840
Farewell.

461
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,360
Safe travels, Senior Brother.

462
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:38,280
Let's go.

463
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,670
Then I'll leave it to you, Mr Zhang.

464
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,760
I'll take the suspect back.

465
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:46,670
Thank you.

466
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,390
You, take four men

467
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,710
and assist Mr. Zhang with the seals.

468
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,430
Yes, sir!

469
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,600
Let's go!

470
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,370
My goodness...

471
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,570
What should we do?

472
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,080
Duanwu,

473
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,710
he won't be captured so easily.

474
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,280
I know.

475
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,600
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

476
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,520
Steward Zhao,

477
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,430
they mentioned official auctions earlier.
What does that mean?

478
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,150
The "official auction"

479
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,630
is when the government takes charge,
and brokers organize it.

480
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,670
They'll auction off
the convoy's valuables.

481
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,230
However,

482
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,670
most of the buyers allowed to bid
are insiders.

483
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,320
So, the final sale price
will be quite low.

484
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,560
He said this is what you deserve.

485
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,080
Take it and leave the convoy.

486
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,040
Would he really be that kind?

487
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:24,680
It was a direct order from him.

488
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,690
When did he give it?

489
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Before killing Wei Yan, or after?

490
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,360
Could he have foreseen this outcome?

491
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,040
He said it as they took him away.

492
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,150
As they were taking him,

493
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,950
he still thought of me?

494
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,990
Duanwu,

495
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,390
sometimes you're just too clever.

496
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,390
Now, when you have a chance to leave,
you won't.

497
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,360
Someday,

498
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,080
when you regret it,
you won't be able to.

499
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:02,940
Hurry up!

500
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,460
[Guangzhou]

501
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,700
[Governor's Office, Guangzhou]

502
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,390
Law officer, everything is here.

503
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,760
Yan Zijing has confessed
to killing Wei Yan.

504
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,820
I am here under orders to seize

505
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,430
all assets of Yan's Trading Convoy.

506
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:17,760
Take everything away!

507
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,560
Yes, sir!

508
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,600
Steward Zhao,
did Master really commit murder?

509
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,880
Now that he's convicted,

510
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,560
and the convoy's goods are confiscated,

511
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,990
what should we do?

512
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,600
Is our convoy going to break up?

513
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,150
Can we all leave now?

514
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,710
How are we supposed to go?
There's nothing left to us!

515
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,840
What about our contracts?

516
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,990
Everyone, keep calm!

517
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,430
Stay calm!

518
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,320
Don't worry!

519
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,390
I'll find a way to see Master

520
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,360
and get everyone a satisfactory answer.

521
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,120
Go back and rest.

522
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,710
Just go back and rest.

523
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,470
How did it come to this?

524
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,840
Just go back for now.

525
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,360
What else we can do?

526
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:21,880
Steward Zhao,

527
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,670
regarding the official auction...

528
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,710
Does that mean

529
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,150
we also have the right
to buy our things back?

530
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,560
Technically, yes,

531
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,190
but we don't have the money for it.

532
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,630
We have money! The Master...

533
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,520
Quickly, speak.

534
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,080
Wait.

535
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,260
[Governor's Office, Guangzhou]

536
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:44,710
Shi Nawei's pearl shipment
is expected tomorrow.

537
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,320
We can finally breathe easy

538
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,470
about the tribute pearls.

539
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,630
That's your family's business,
the Cuis'.

540
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:53,950
Yes, sir.

541
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,320
I heard Yan Zijing's ship cargo

542
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,360
will go up for an official auction soon.

543
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,040
He had a large quantity of pearls,

544
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,320
all of fine quality.

545
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,190
If we could secure them,

546
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,600
not only would the tribute pearl issue
be solved,

547
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,760
but we could also quickly complete

548
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,230
the Pearl Lotus Terrace for Prince Tan.

549
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,670
Plus, we'd profit considerably.

550
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,040
Though Yan Zijing has confessed,

551
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,760
those goods are under government seal,

552
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,710
outside my jurisdiction.

553
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:30,670
But, after all,
it's jewelry at the auction,

554
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,190
and Officer Zhou doesn't know
how to handle it.

555
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,380
How many pearls

556
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,320
to put up for auction...

557
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,080
isn't it all up to you,
Special Envoy Xu?

558
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,130
Ordinarily,

559
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,950
it wouldn't be a problem.

560
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,990
But recently, Zhang Jinran has
been watching me closely.

561
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,280
I can't afford to be careless.

562
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,910
But Zhang Jinran
is still just your junior,

563
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,710
merely a scholar.

564
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Surely you have ways

565
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,710
to keep him in check.

566
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,800
Having him as a junior
isn't very important.

567
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,600
But not having him

568
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,910
as a junior right now is crucial.

569
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,710
Yes, sir.

570
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,040
Since this official auction

571
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,560
involves tribute pearls
and the Pearl Lotus Terrace,

572
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,560
your Cui family

573
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,320
should be well-prepared financially

574
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,230
to ensure everything goes smoothly.

575
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,670
Naturally.

576
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,390
Very good.

577
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,320
That old fox Xu Nanying wants me

578
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,320
to pay for the auction,

579
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
all while raking in countless benefits!

580
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,950
Master Shijiu, no need to worry.

581
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,600
Once Shi Nawei's
second shipment of pearls arrives,

582
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,520
the tribute pearl issue
will be resolved.

583
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,990
Then, we won't have
to let that fox drain us dry.

584
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,880
Let's go check on Shi Nawei's shipment.

585
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,470
Yes, sir.

586
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,990
The pearls might not arrive?
What do you mean?

587
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,800
There was a storm at sea.

588
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,080
When will they arrive?

589
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,360
Even I couldn't say for sure
when they'll arrive.

590
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,120
But we signed a contract.

591
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,390
Are you trying to back out?

592
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,520
You paid a high price upfront.

593
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,670
I should compensate double.

594
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,190
However,

595
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,320
as clearly written in the contract,

596
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,670
sea transport is unpredictable,

597
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:35,710
and delivery depends on circumstances.

598
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,710
Master Shijiu, don't be upset.

599
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,320
Although this shipment hasn't arrived,

600
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,710
the next one is coming soon.

601
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,320
Master Shijiu, my goal

602
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,600
is to work with you long-term.

603
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,950
Then when will the next shipment arrive?

604
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,360
It's already on its way,

605
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,710
estimated to take over two months.

606
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,320
Two months?

607
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,390
The tribute deadline
is in less than ten days.

608
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,910
What are we supposed to do?

609
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,470
Don't worry, Master Shijiu.

610
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,760
I knew you'd need this batch urgently,

611
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,640
so I had the pearls

612
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,320
pre-drilled and inlaid.

613
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,720
Once they arrive,

614
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,200
your craftsmen can start right away.

615
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,640
Drilled?

616
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,760
Who gave you the authority
to drill them?

617
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,070
What use do I have
for pre-drilled pearls?

618
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,240
Pearls made into jewelry need
to be drilled, don't they?

619
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:37,070
Master Shijiu, I was helping you.

620
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,160
Unless... you had other plans for them?

621
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,990
What I intend to do
is none of your concern.

622
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:55,360
I have no use for these drilled pearls.

623
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,240
Hey...

624
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,760
Master Shijiu, this is the head
of the Yue family from Shaozhou.

625
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,160
He has been waiting here for a while.

626
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,550
Shaozhou's Yue family?

627
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,910
The Yue family from Shaozhou,

628
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,590
renowned for jade carving,
has a history with our family.

629
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,760
Greetings, Master Shijiu.

630
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,030
I am Yue Xun, head of the Yue family.

631
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,070
My father never mentioned you.

632
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,200
State your business.

633
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,550
Traditionally,
around this time each year,

634
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,590
the Cui's Pearl Farm would send
ten taels of pearls

635
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,800
to the Yue family.

636
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,680
But this year, they never arrived,

637
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,110
so I personally went to Hepu...

638
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:50,470
Are you implying
Cui Ding colluded with you

639
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,550
to steal our family's pearls?

640
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,990
Master Shijiu, I knew nothing of this.

641
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,950
This was a promise made

642
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,360
by the head of the Cui family years ago.

643
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,950
What's this nonsense?

644
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,550
On what grounds did my father
promise you ten taels annually?

645
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,590
Lady Cui, are you aware
that the Cui family has a lotus terrace,

646
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,510
- and there was an apsaras statue...
- Mr. Yue,

647
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,880
I won't give up a single pearl

648
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,720
without a signed certificate
from my family

649
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,320
or my father's confirmation.

650
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,390
If everyone came asking

651
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,880
for ten taels of pearls,

652
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,550
our family would be drained dry by now.

653
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,990
I have no time for idle chatter.

654
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,390
See him out.

655
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,430
You... you little girl!

656
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,590
You truly don't understand
who you're dealing with!

657
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,680
I'll go speak to Cui Jingchu myself!

658
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:49,070
What's wrong with Master Shijiu?

659
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,880
Shi Nawei's second shipment
can't arrive.

660
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,950
Master Shijiu,

661
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,550
if worse comes to worst,
we still have the official auction.

662
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,040
Though that old fox Xu Nanying
is greedy,

663
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,280
the most pressing issue now

664
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,910
is resolving the tribute pearl problem.

665
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,160
We still have the official auction...

666
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,840
Yan Zijing still has pearls.

667
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,840
But, Master Shijiu,

668
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,620
we've already invested heavily

669
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,470
in jewelry with Shi Nawei.

670
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,360
There's barely any money
left in our accounts.

671
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,720
With so many shops in Guangzhou,

672
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,640
surely we can gather enough funds.

673
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,640
We've raised all we can.

674
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,390
Raising more

675
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,950
could ruin
all of Guangzhou's businesses.

676
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,680
Master Shijiu, please,

677
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,850
inform the head of the family!

678
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,910
- Master Shijiu, I beg you!
- Yes, please!

679
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,720
Only the family head
can resolve this now.

680
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,120
- Just speak with him...
- Master Shijiu...

681
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,550
No!

682
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,760
What am I supposed to tell my father?

683
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,200
What should I report to him?

684
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,390
He is old,

685
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,640
and his health is poor.

686
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,780
The tribute pearls burned,

687
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,880
and the pearl farm was destroyed.

688
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,680
Such disaster has befallen
the Cui family,

689
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,550
and none of my brothers helped.

690
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,470
They're just waiting for him to pass,

691
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,430
eager to divide the inheritance.

692
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,950
What am I supposed to tell him?

693
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:03,430
That even though I tried my hardest,

694
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,800
I've lost everything,

695
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,400
with no way out?

696
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,590
What am I supposed to tell him?

697
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,190
If the tribute pearls are compromised,

698
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,960
the entire Cui family will be executed!

699
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,760
Yes, Master Shijiu...

700
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,760
- Master Shijiu...
- Master Shijiu...

701
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,320
Please think it through, Master Shijiu.

702
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,760
Otherwise, we'll all be doomed!

703
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,800
- Please, inform the family head!
- Master Shijiu!

704
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,000
- Master Shijiu...
- Master Shijiu...

705
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,710
- Master Shijiu...
- Master Shijiu...

706
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
Master Shijiu,

707
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,400
I beg you...

708
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,070
Be gentle!

709
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,510
Quick!

710
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,510
Be careful!

711
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,880
Careful!

712
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,400
Assistant Pang!

713
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,320
Look, we found it!

714
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,110
Turns out they were hiding jewels!

715
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,920
It's a pity there's so few,

716
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,070
but it's still not bad.

717
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,480
The authorities have taken
everything they needed.

718
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
So having these left is pure luck.

719
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,230
It's enough for us to enjoy ourselves!

720
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,400
Supervisor Kang, spare us!

721
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,230
The Master isn't here.

722
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,150
That doesn't give you the right
to steal from the convoy.

723
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,760
Supervisor Kang, have mercy!

724
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,800
Assistant Pang,

725
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,190
what's the punishment for stealing

726
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,550
from the convoy?

727
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,190
Now I get it.

728
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,550
You set us up!

729
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
What of it?

730
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,800
You said there were treasures
in the Master's room...

731
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,880
Yes, I did.

732
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,590
But,

733
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,590
did I force you to steal,
Assistant Pang?

734
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,190
We only intended
to check the Master's room

735
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,920
to see if anything valuable was left.

736
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,420
Right.

737
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:45,880
Right.

738
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,070
Shrimp.

739
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,190
Everyone, look
at Pang Song and Cao's actions!

740
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,440
They took valuables before the seizure.

741
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,550
They wrapped them in oil paper,

742
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,320
tied them to stones,
and threw them into the sea.

743
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,710
They planned to retrieve them later.

744
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,760
Look, everyone!

745
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,320
Nonsense!

746
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,480
Steward Zhao, you see!

747
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,710
Cao did it all!

748
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:08,280
I had no part in it!

749
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,480
You're lying!

750
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,920
I've never seen this before!

751
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,800
And I only took a small cut
of the profits,

752
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,440
and the rest went to him!

753
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,280
You're lying!

754
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,670
You're slandering me!

755
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,360
You're the one slandering!

756
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,230
Duanwu, listen,

757
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,670
we have no grudge between us!

758
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,880
Shrimp's suffering
was all Cao Da's doing!

759
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,480
I knew nothing of it!

760
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,960
You're just jealous

761
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,630
that Duanwu gets to do big business
with Accountant Wei,

762
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,510
so you had me scheme against Shrimp!

763
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,190
You...!

764
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,000
- Well deserved!
- Well deserved!

765
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,190
You two colluded

766
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,320
in Master's absence,

767
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,110
stealing from the convoy.

768
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:49,680
Well said!

769
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,920
As head of the convoy's attendants,

770
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,070
you exploited them,

771
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,510
stealing their hard-earned money!

772
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,840
You also colluded with Wu Xiang

773
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,070
to steal scraps to frame me.

774
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:04,780
Well deserved!

775
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,230
Hit him!

776
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,110
And you,

777
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,150
you hit my brother.

778
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,400
he's just a child.

779
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,230
Enough!

780
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:20,880
- Mr. Zhang, save me!
- Save me!

781
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,590
Duanwu,

782
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,880
abusing your power like this,

783
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,360
how are you different from Yan Zijing?

784
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,320
They're despicable people.

785
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,110
Why do you bother with them?

786
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,760
