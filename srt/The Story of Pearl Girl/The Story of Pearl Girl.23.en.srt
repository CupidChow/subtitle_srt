Lady Bai,

81
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,750
if you wore these mother-of-pearl press-on nails to play the pipa,

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,920
She got injured, perhaps?

85
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,280
If her nails hadn't broken,

86
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,640
she might have finished the piece

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:20,790

Quite a disappointment for everyone.

97
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,190

Just her costume alone

99
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,260

they're sure to dazzle.

143

And how is this different from Bai Niao?

144
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,790

while we are merely protecting ourselves.

146
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,640
What do you mean by that?

147
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,120

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,760

Me, second on the Qionghua list,

152
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,280
support a fading songstress?

153
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,670
One plays, the other dances.

154
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,790

155
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,470
These Jing shoes have silver bells.

156
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,240
I would add some jewels

157
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,160

158
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,160

159
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,310
It'll be truly unmatched.

160
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,760
Lady Xue, wouldn't you like to give it a try?

161
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,430

00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,280

Just like you, already one of the best.

167

168
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,830
Helping you benefits me,

169
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,070
and provides you more security.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,550
Su Muzhe!

171
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,710
How dare you plot against me?

172
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,790
Plot?

173
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,400
When I showed you these mother-of-pearl press-on nails earlier,

174
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,360
it was only to display

175
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
the craftsmanship of their carvings.

176
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,550
Had you accepted my offer,

177
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,040
I would have gifted you

178
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,920
the finest mother-of-pearl pipa.

179
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,760
But you used

180
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,950
my unfinished press-on nails.

181
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,040
They're made from bamboo.

182
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,240
It's naturally thin by nature.

183
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,430
Pairing it with such intense music,

184
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,430
of course, it would break.

185
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,040
Blame yourself

186
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,120
if you must blame someone.

187
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,550
You...

188
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,550
My lady!

189
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,550
You... you dare strike me?

190
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,670
You!

191
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
Why wouldn't I dare?

192
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,880
You resorted to stealing,

193
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,950
utterly disgraceful.

194
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,190
Lady Bai,

195
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,360
act with restraint

196
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,360
at the Qionghua Festival.

197
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,590
Duanwu!

198
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,400
Lady Huan is up next. Hurry and come!

199
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,830
Coming!

200
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,400
My lady, let me see.

201
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,920
What shall we do about this?

202
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,670
Wonderful!

203
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,340
- Well done! - Bravo!

204
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,490
Absolutely beautiful!

205
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,880
Magnificent!

206
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,830
Truly exquisite!

207
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,360
Superb!

208
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,710
Amazing!

209
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,480
- Truly excellent! - Awesome!

210
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,340
Well done!

211
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,760
Absolutely marvelous!

212
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,640
I, humble and modest in appearance,

213
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,670
can offer only my dance to bring you joy.

214
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,590
I'm pleased to donate the Qibao necklace

215
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,550
for the peace and prosperity of Yangzhou!

216
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,310
Well said!

217
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,430
In my view,

218
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,470
this Qibao necklace

219
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,920
must come from your Jubao House.

220
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,830
Indeed.

221
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,240
Songstress Xue Liniang donates the Qibao necklace.

222
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,830
The starting bid is two million mace.

223
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,470
The Qibao necklace is exquisite,

224
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,240
but Xue Liniang herself isn't particularly remarkable.

225
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,190
Lady Huan's pipa performance still outshines hers.

226
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,070
Exactly.

227
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,550
Who could possibly say for sure?

228
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,470
Each has their own merits.

229
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,430
No need to judge her.

230
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,040
I'll bid 2,200,000 mace!

231
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:31,880
You're too kind.

232
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,880
I'll bid three million!

233
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,950
I'll bid 3,500,000 mace!

234
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,360
Four million mace!

235
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,830
Four million?

236
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,070
It keeps rising higher!

237
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,520
Any bids over four million mace?

238
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,950
Alright.

239
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,590
Songstress Xue Liniang donates four million mace.

240
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,740
She now holds the top bid.

241
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,070
Well done!

242
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,190
Quite impressive!

243
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,480
- Bravo! - Bravo!

244
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,950
Now we have Songstress Lady Huan.

245
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,040
The tune is "Seven Steps, Seven Kills" composed by my own hand.

246
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,240
The pipa is the mother-of-pearl pipa from Su's Clear Mind.

247
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:17,590
This pipa has a foundation of purple sandalwood,

248
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,520
inlaid with 36,000 mother-of-pearl pieces.

249
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,590
Such exquisite craftsmanship is the pinnacle of artistry.

250
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,310
Tonight, I donate this pipa,

251
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,310
wishing for the flourishing of art

252
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,000
and peace under heaven.

253
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,640
What a treasure, truly worth passing down!

254
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,360
Lady Huan donates the pipa.

255
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,470
The starting bid is four million mace!

256
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,210
Who could afford such a sum?

257
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,790
Four million...

258
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,430
I'll bid 4,200,000 mace!

259
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,920
I'll bid five million!

260
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,070
Five million?

261
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,400
Five million...

262
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,400
I'll bid six million!

263
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,640
Six million!

264
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,990
Six million?

265
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,360
Any bids higher than six million?

266
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,750
It appears

267
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,840
Lady Huan's pipa has no equal.

268
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,800
She truly deserves the title of top beauty!

269
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,800
Well-deserved!

270
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,510
Bravo!

271
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,470
My heartfelt thanks to you all.

272
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,320
Today, I've claimed the top beauty title.

273
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:40,120
It's unrelated to the Huan family or anyone else.

274
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,320
The Huan family deceived me, stole my dowry,

275
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:46,880
then a heartless man took advantage of my innocence.

276
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,320
But how fortunate I am

277
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,670
to have a friend who helped me wholeheartedly.

278
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,750
She's Su Muzhe from Clear Mind.

279
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,270
- Clear Mind? - Su Muzhe?

280
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,510
I've never heard of it before.

281
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,430
Today, I would like to inform you all:

282
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,950
Lady Huan is retiring from the stage,

283
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,880
never to perform again.

284
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,510
Such a pity!

285
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,880
Indeed, such a great loss!

286
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,860
Farewell!

287
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,920
See you at Clear Mind!

288
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,230
Clear Mind...

289
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,120
I'll certainly visit one day.

290
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,510
Duanwu, this is wonderful!

291
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,710
Lady Huan has won!

292
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,800
She also spoke her heart out.

293
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,030
Lady Huan has retired.

294
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,120
She has brought fame to our shop Clear Mind.

295
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,270
We...

296
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,360
can finally open our shop.

297
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,640
Wonderful! We can finally open!

298
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,470
What?

299
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,400
Still want to kill me?

300
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,950
You're not worth it.

301
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,430
Ms. Su,

302
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,270
congratulations.

303
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,880
With all your scheming

304
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,510
backing up Lady Huan,

305
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,600
were you only aiming to be a merchant?

306
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
If that was your goal,

307
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,880
you've achieved it.

308
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,950
Today, I waited here for you

309
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,920
just to tell you this:

310
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,360
I've made up my mind

311
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,160
to settle down in Yangzhou.

312
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,600
But right now,

313
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,880
you don't have the ability to go against me.

314
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,030
But today, I won.

315
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,160
I trust you know

316
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,360
what I'll be doing next.

317
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,120
And you should also know

318
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,270
that I won't give up easily.

319
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,120
If you keep getting in my way,

320
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,710
don't blame me for not giving you a chance.

321
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,320
Although you won today,

322
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,320
you know

323
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,270
that with my resources,

324
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,360
I can afford to lose countless times

325
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,320
and keep going.

326
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,990
But you

327
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,670
just one loss

328
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,710
would be your end.

329
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,750
I'm already beyond redemption.

330
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,710
Then do as you please, Ms. Su.

331
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,800
- Let's have some more drinks! - Sure!

332
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,250
Here!

333
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:01,360
Cheers!

334
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:02,920
Try this.

335
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,360
Here!

336
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,400
Cheers!

337
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,230
To us

338
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,800
and Clear Mind!

339
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,430
These hands truly are worth a fortune.

340
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,990
Thank you, Lady Xue.

341
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,430
Yes, indeed.

342
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,810
- Let's add a little more. - Yunxiu here will be

343
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,920
our future Master Artisan of Clear Mind.

344
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:20,120
Master Artisan?

345
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,230
What is a Master Artisan?

346
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,030
A Master Artisan is one who oversees all drawings and craftsmanship.

347
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,600
Everyone

348
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,360
will respectfully call you Master Artisan.

349
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,190
Master Artisan?

350
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,080
Duanwu, can I really do it?

351
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,470
Yunxiu,

352
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,270
you are

353
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,320
the most talented Master Artisan I've ever known.

354
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,230
Master Artisan!

355
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,360
Come on, Master Artisan!

356
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,120
A toast to our Master Artisan!

357
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Lady Huan.

358
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,510
I never expected you to retire like this.

359
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,430
Such courage is truly admirable.

360
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,750
Here!

361
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,160
Yingtao, eat up.

362
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,560
Thank you, Yunxiu.

363
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,840
People like us,

364
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,800
no matter how charming we seem,

365
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,990
are ultimately just playthings of the wealthy.

366
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,360
When favored, we're praised to the skies.

367
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,120
When not, we're trampled into the mud.

368
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,950
All these years,

369
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,470
we've kept smiling, welcoming and bidding farewell,

370
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,320
seeming prosperous on the surface,

371
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,160
but in reality, we're all alone.

372
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,800
Muzhe,

373
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,470
say a few words?

374
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,640
Would you all like a fallback option for the future?

375
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,510
I plan to open Clear Mind with Lady Huan,

376
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,270
as you all know by now.

377
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,470
Part of the capital

378
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,470
comes from Lady Huan,

379
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,640
and the rest from Mr. Zheng.

380
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,030
I'm willing to give each of you a share in Clear Mind.

381
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,120
All you need to do is invest.

382
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,230
Each year, you'll receive dividends.

383
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,190
That will give you a sense of security.

384
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,190
How about it?

385
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,360
What do you think?

386
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,120
Really?

387
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,950
Of course it's true.

388
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:50,800
But

389
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,470
such a good deal doesn't come so easily.

390
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,190
In return, I'll need you all to promote Clear Mind.

391
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,880
Thank you!

392
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,320
With Ms. Su's Clear Mind in place,

393
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:05,470
we will finally have something to rely on.

394
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,600
- Wonderful! - Just wonderful!

395
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,400
- Amazing! - Truly wonderful!

396
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,320
How wonderful.

397
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,990
- Come on! - Come on!

398
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,080
Let's toast to Clear Mind!

399
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,800
Let's toast to our Clear Mind!

400
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,600
Clear Mind!

401
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,160
Cheers!

402
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
- Cheers! - Here, cheers!

403
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,360
Sit down and eat, Miss.

404
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,160
My lady,

405
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:32,230
may I work at Clear Mind?

406
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,320
Is it because I scolded you and hurt your feelings?

407
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
No, my lady.

408
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:37,840
If not for you,

409
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,190
I would have starved long ago.

410
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,270
But I'm not suited for this.

411
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,160
I'm no good at pipa or dance.

412
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,470
I'd only be a burden to you.

413
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,600
Have you thought it through?

414
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,670
Then go ahead.

415
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,750
Ms. Su,

416
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,470
is there a need for help at Clear Mind?

417
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,470
Of course, we need more hands.

418
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,880
Then, could Yingtao

419
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,710
go with you?

420
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,920
I don't know if Clear Mind will succeed or fail,

421
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
yet you'd still follow me?

422
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,030
Good or bad,

423
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,360
I'm willing to try.

424
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,430
Then come to Clear Mind.

425
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,080
Thank you, Ms. Su!

426
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,270
Thank you, Lady Huan!

427
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,270
Come on, let's drink!

428
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,190
My lady...

429
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,750
- Let's drink! - Let's drink!

430
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,270
Come on!

431
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:45,840
Come quickly!

432
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:47,880
Let's drink!

433
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,510
Cheers!

434
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,230
These...?

435
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,270
These are all Black Dragon Bandits' loots.

436
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,160
Could it be they fled south

437
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,710
after Hexi's crackdown?

438
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,120
These people act as desert bandits

439
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,600
and also as water pirates.

440
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,470
No wonder they look suspicious.

441
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,270
This ship is heading for Yangzhou,

442
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:23,270
so there must be someone fencing their loot.

443
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,990
So, we've boarded a pirate's ship by chance.

444
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,990
By chance,

445
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:30,600
or is someone using my name

446
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,840
to slip through undetected?

447
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,080
Who knows?

448
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,670
Shall we seize them all in one go?

449
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,600
For now, hold our positions,

450
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,880
and see who they're meeting.

451
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,840
To help Lady Huan win the top beauty title,

452
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,080
you really do have some skill.

453
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,670
Sign this contract before you.

454
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,320
Once Clear Mind opens,

455
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,800
I'll grant you a position as a steward.

456
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,470
"Su Muzhe willingly sells herself as a servant

457
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,670
to Zheng Zhiheng in Yangzhou."

458
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,800
You're courting death!

459
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,080
Garuda,

460
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,800
get out.

461
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,560
I said

462
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,920
I would manage your assets.

463
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,320
When did I ever agree to be a servant?

464
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,120
Then tell me, what do you want?

465
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:55,320
Lady Huan has signed the partnership agreement with Clear Mind.

466
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,950
Other songstresses are also willing to invest in Clear Mind.

467
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,950
Now it's not me asking you to join Clear Mind.

468
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,030
Clear Mind doesn't lack investors.

469
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,120
It's you, Mr. Zheng,

470
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,160
who lacks someone truly capable of managing

471
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,160
and growing your assets.

472
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,270
Isn't that?

473
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,920
A retired top beauty,

474
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,840
and a group of nameless songstresses...

475
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,080
You're all taking yourselves too seriously.

476
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,640
If you were the only son of the Zheng family,

477
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,030
it might be impossible.

478
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,920
But alas,

479
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:33,710
you have an older brother.

480
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,920
Su Muzhe,

481
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,560
are you out of your mind today?

482
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,640
Calm down, sir.

483
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,670
Hear me out.

484
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,470
Right now, the income from Jubao House

485
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,600
only barely covers the Zheng family's expenses.

486
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,950
No matter how wealthy you are,

487
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,470
it's all from Master Zheng's hand.

488
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,840
Once Clear Mind opens,

489
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,190
if it succeeds,

490
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,670
would you still depend

491
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,320
on Master Zheng's small handouts?

492
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,030
Lady Yu's position in the Zheng family will also be much more secure.

493
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,990
Aside from Clear Mind,

494
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,800
what better option do you have?

495
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,920
None.

496
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,230
Forty percent shares,

497
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,360
five million mace,

498
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,230
annual dividends.

499
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,400
It may be more,

500
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,360
or less.

501
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,840
Since you have

502
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,640
the discerning eye to recognize a top beauty,

503
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,710
why don't we

504
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
make a longer-term deal?

505
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,560
What do you say?

506
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,430
Tell me where you plan to open the shop first.

507
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,560
Clear Mind rose to fame at the Qionghua Festival

508
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,320
thanks to Lady Huan's performance.

509
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,920
If it's to open,

510
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,030
it should be at the most prominent location.

511
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,600
Very well.

512
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,190
I'll give you a chance.

513
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,880
Where will it be?

514
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,030
A place you'd never expect.

515
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,800
Good.

516
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,320
From Hepu to Guangzhou,

517
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,710
then from Guangzhou to the Great Desert,

518
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
time has flown by,

519
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,470
and it feels everything has changed.

520
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,640
Now I go by the name Su Muzhe,

521
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,430
after many twists and turns, I've come to Yangzhou,

522
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,120
and finally established my own shop Clear Mind.

523
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,560
In this chaotic world,

524
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,640
I now have a small place to call home.

525
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,430
Dear Wu, we parted hastily in Guangzhou,

526
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,640
but not for a moment did I forget our bond.

527
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,710
I still remember our ambitious words from those days.

528
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,230
How we listened to the Hu flute and watched wealth pour in,

529
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:39,430
gazed across the river at the dashing young men of Qujiang.

530
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,190
Awaiting the day

531
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,430
when we would share wealth and fortune,

532
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,400
to fulfill the promise we made back then.

533
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:50,640
Clear Mind in Yangzhou, Su Muzhe.

534
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,470
Lady Feng.

535
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,270
Lady Feng.

536
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,430
How much is this piece of jewelry?

537
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,080
This one's 2,600 mace.

538
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,080
But for a loyal customer like you,

539
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,160
let's make it two thousand.

540
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,030
I'll take it.

541
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,560
Alright.

542
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,030
What's got you so cheerful?

543
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,230
Did some young gentleman write you a letter?

544
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,800
What young gentleman?

545
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,230
It's my dear friend.

546
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,710
She's opened a shop in Yangzhou.

547
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,030
Look, all the jewelry on my counter,

548
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,990
including this piece of yours,

549
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,600
they're all designed by her.

550
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,430
Yangzhou?

551
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,080
That's a wonderful place.

552
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,030
Absolutely.

553
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,080
One day, our branch of Zhuobao House

554
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,710
will open in Yangzhou as well.

555
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,510
Then, the two of us will dominate

556
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,270
the jewelry industry in Yangzhou.

557
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,470
And we can choose any gentleman we like.

558
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,030
Then congratulations to Lady Feng in advance.

559
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,710
Take care.

560
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,280
Congratulations,

561
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,880
Su Muzhe.

562
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,750
All hardships will pass,

563
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,360
may you move forward with all your heart

564
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,750
with no mountains or seas to hold you back.

565
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,120
- Duanwu! - Shrimp!

566
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,950
Why are you still sleeping in today?

567
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,470
Duanwu, you're amazing!

568
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,720
Duanwu, you really wore red!

569
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,110
When have I ever lied to you?

570
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,400
Does it look nice?

571
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,200
Duanwu, you look stunning!

572
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,240
Where's Loud?

573
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,320
I'm here!

574
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,030
Coming!

575
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,070
Why are you still so late today?

576
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:25,470
Is it heavy?

577
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:26,550
No worries.

578
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,510
Where did Cao Da go?

579
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,510
Cao Da's over there, slacking off.

580
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,680
He's munching on chicken feet!

581
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,760
Just because I stepped away, you blame me?

582
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,800
It's opening day.

583
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,760
At least hide the chicken feet for now, will you?

584
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,950
Sure. Leader, it's almost opening time.

585
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,630
How about a little raise?

586
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,920
All you think about is money.

587
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,510
Earn it first before you spend it!

588
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,030
I'm just saying it in advance.

589
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,320
I didn't say I need it now.

590
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,430
Duanwu, don't give him money.

591
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,470
Later, you need to buy me some candied hawthorn.

592
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,240
That's your plan?

593
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,920
You silly.

594
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,800
When I have money, I'll buy you candied hawthorn myself.

595
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,920
Make sense?

596
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,840
Fine, I'll raise it.

597
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,240
Alright. thanks, Leader.

598
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,510
Where's the Accountant Wei?

599
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,950
Look.

600
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,630
She's bringing back firecrackers.

601
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,280
Duanwu, what's wrong?

602
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,590
Let me look at you one more time.

603
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:42,990

It complements the skin beautifully.

00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,550
This is lovely.

654
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,320
We have a pair here.

655
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,240
Want to try them on?

656
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,290
This style is quite nice.

657
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,950
Do you have any others?

658
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,320
How about this one?

659
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,130
Yingtao, take care of them.

660
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,680
Alright.

661
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,990
Congratulations!

662
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,760
I thought you weren't coming.

663
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,030
It's been a while.

664
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,150
Wishing you a prosperous opening!

665
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,760
Our Clear Mind wouldn't be here today

666
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,880
without the help of you all.

667
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,030
We'll take a look around first.

668
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,990
Take your time. Let me know if anything catches your eye.

669
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:21,720
Alright.

670
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:25,590
What is it? Something caught your eye?

671
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,950
More than just caught my eye.

672
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,510
I'm overwhelmed with choices.

673
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,590
I've already told Yingtao,

674
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,400
anything you fancy today

675
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,470
will be a gift for you.

676
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,320
Really?

677
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,760
When have I lied to you?

678
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,150
Yingtao!

679
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,880
My lady is here!

680
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:43,840
I'll go over in a bit.

681
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,760
Is Yingtao helpful here?

682
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,320
Extremely helpful.

683
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,200
She's clever and hardworking.

684
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,950
I know you gave her up reluctantly,

685
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,510
letting such a good girl come to me.

686
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,680
Indeed.

687
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,950
Yingtao has been with me for years,

688
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,240
it was hard to part with her.

689
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,990
But she's happy here with you,

690
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,150
so I suppose I made the right choice.

691
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,150
It's your big opening day.

692
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,510
Where's Lady Huan?

693
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,760
Can't you guess?

694
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,320
Lady Huan's always been quiet and refined,

695
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,880
not one for large crowds.

696
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,590
With so many people here today,

697
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,280
she'd feel out of place.

698
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,800
But on such an important day,

699
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,950
she should come by to see me.

700
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,240
Ms. Su,

701
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,920
this is a gift from Lady Huan for your opening.

702
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,110
She won't be coming in.

703
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,880
Thank you.

704
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,760
Please tell Lady Huan

705
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,550
that it's windy today, and she should head back early.

706
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,920
Thank you, Ms. Su.

707
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,150
I'll go and put it away first.

708
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:45,760
Alright.

709
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,030
This bracelet...

710
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,360
If you like it, think it over.

711
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,280
But if I'm buying it,

712
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,880
I'll have to get the whole set.

713
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,280
It looks best as a set.

714
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:58,920
See...

715
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,150
A single bracelet doesn't stand out,

716
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,470
but a full set is truly stunning.

717
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,070
Agreed.

718
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,800
Su Muzhe has quite the eye for things.

719
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,400
I'll take it.

720
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,150
Wait!

721
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,320
I want the whole set.

722
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,950
That won't do.

723
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,320
When I spot a piece of jewelry I like,

724
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,150
I've got to act fast.

725
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,680
If someone else takes it first,

726
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,070
I'll regret it in the middle of the night.

727
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,760
Exactly.

728
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,990
Lady Xue is absolutely right.

729
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,470
Hand it over!

730
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,240
I haven't worn it long enough.

731
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,400
Yingtao!

732
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,150
There are so many pieces in the store

733
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,360
for you to try on.

734
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,430
Let this set go, won't you?

735
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,590
Yes.

736
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,720
Give it to me. Come on.

737
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,800
- Time to pay. - Okay

738
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,800
Why won't Master Yan see me?

739
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,510
My hand is like this,

740
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,680
and he won't even hear me out.

741
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,590
Lady Bai, you're a smart one.

742
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,760
Tell me,

743
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,030
does someone with no use

744
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,840
deserve to see Master?

745
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,510
Go home and tend to your injury.

746
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,030
