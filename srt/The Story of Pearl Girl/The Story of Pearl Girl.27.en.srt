[Episode 27]

12
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,710
Inspector Zhang.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm in this look again.

14
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,900
Apologies for the trouble, Inspector Zhang.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
You used yourself as bait to lure out Zheng Zhixing.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,750
It was too risky.

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,020
I know it was risky,

18
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,260
but Zheng Zhixing left no evidence.

19
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,800
To clear Lady Huan's name,

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,060
this is the only way to break the case.

21
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,060
There's no other way.

22
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,240
But your current evidence

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
is just Zheng Zhixing's own confession.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,530
He could still say you forced him.

25
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,870
At least this will bring him to justice.

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,620
I trust you, Inspector Zhang.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,080
Rest assured,

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,240
I will do everything I can to protect you

29
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,870
and bring you justice.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,920
Inspector Zhang,

31
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,830
this isn't about my justice.

32
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,440
It's about justice for Lady Huan.

33
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,920
She's suffered too much in life,

34
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,720
betrayed by her lover.

35
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,330
Even after her death,

36
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,040
she's still accused of trafficking stolen goods.

37
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,830
This is not justice.

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
I'll gather evidence soon

39
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,510
and start the trial.

40
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,390
Take care of yourself.

41
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,440
Inspector Zhang,

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,120
could you hold a public trial?

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,920
Mr. Xu, please help me!

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,070
I was deceived...

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,630
I never imagined

46
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,000
that you'd be locked in such a tiny cell.

47
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,840
No one's troubling you, right?

48
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,040
It's all your fault.

49
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,520
You betrayed the family,

50
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,430
conspiring with that wretch Su Muzhe to harm me!

51
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,670
Si,

52
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,960
watch what you say.

53
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,160
These days, if I'm not at the Governor's office,

54
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,670
I'm wandering between the old house and the villa,

55
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,880
nowhere else.

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,110
Oh, you're saying

57
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,350
the news I passed to you?

58
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,230
It's all nonsense from Garuda,

59
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,550
completely mistaken.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,350
Si, don't worry.

61
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,230
I'll give him a proper scolding!

62
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,190
You...

63
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,750
Seeing you in good spirits,

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,520
I can leave with peace of mind.

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,670
Si, don't worry.

66
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,670
The family is doing everything to get you out.

67
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,640
Is there anything you'd like me to tell Father?

68
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,080
I've given everything I have,

69
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,990
risking severe punishment.

70
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,920
Father won't abandon me.

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,110
Zheng Wu, you're overthinking this.

72
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,670
Si, don't worry.

73
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,640
I'll pass on

74
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,110
exactly what you said to Father.

75
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,280
Here's all your favorite dishes,

76
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,520
still hot.

77
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,110
I am the legitimate son,

78
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,670
the true heir of the Zheng family!

79
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,520
Mr. Xu,

80
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,110
is there really no other way?

81
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,670
He's nothing but a worthless fool,

82
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,310
easily provoked by Su Muzhe

83
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,190
and spilling the truth right away.

84
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,310
That disgrace...

85
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Master, Lady Shijiu of the Cui family seeks an audience.

86
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,080
I won't see her!

87
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
Let her in.

88
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,110
Understood.

89
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,920
Greetings to you both.

90
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,750
Master Shijiu, you always favored men's attire,

91
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,960
but you have a unique charm

92
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,640
in women's clothing

93
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,080
Are you thinking of becoming Lady Shijiu again?

94
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,480
Mr. Xu, you jest.

95
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,640
Whether I'm dressed as a man or a woman,

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,400
it's all for others to see.

97
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,040
I have only one true identity,

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,230
Cui Shijiu.

99
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,600
Cui Shijiu, why have you come to see me?

100
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,040
I've come here today

101
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
first, to issue a warning

102
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,080
and second, to offer advice.

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,670
Speak.

104
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,480
In Lady Huan's case,

105
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,920
the mastermind behind it all is Yan Zijing.

106
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,960
I'm sure I don't need to remind you both of this.

107
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,350
However, Mr. Xu,

108
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,310
you only know

109
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,670
how Yan Zijing stirred up chaos in Guangzhou.

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,720
What you don't know is, back in Wuling,

111
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,230
he played the weak in front of Master Eight,

112
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,840
but uprooted everyone behind the scenes,

113
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,230
all to expose Master Eight's secret dealings

114
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,750
with the Black Dragon Bandits.

115
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,920
So what?

116
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,480
What befell the Cui family long ago

117
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,230
is now about to happen to the Zheng family.

118
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,480
Nonsense!

119
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,400
Whether it's nonsense, you both know in your hearts.

120
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,840
I'll say no more.

121
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,350
But given the current situation,

122
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,870
with both Lady Huan's case and the smuggling scandal,

123
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,520
someone will have to take all the blame

124
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,280
and sever every link.

125
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,280
Only then will they let go.

126
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,790
Cui Shijiu,

127
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,190
did Zheng Wu instruct you to say this?

128
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,070
Zheng Wu doesn't know I'm here.

129
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,430
I'm offering this advice solely based on the situation.

130
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,470
Mr. Xu, Mr. Zheng,

131
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,550
that's all I have to say. Farewell.

132
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,310
This Cui Shijiu, since leaving Guangzhou,

133
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,670
has toned down much of her fierceness.

134
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,640
She's steadier but more ruthless now.

135
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Do you know why Prince Ying sent me to Yangzhou?

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,280
He feared seeing you like this,

137
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,880
hesitant to make the tough decisions.

138
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,070
Master Yan,

139
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,070
if Mr. Qin or the Baicaojing House

140
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,070
has offended you in any way,

141
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,550
I apologize on their behalf.

142
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,000
He didn't offend me.

143
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,880
You did.

144
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,590
Why did you set up Su Muzhe?

145
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,120
Master Yan,

146
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
I truly don't understand.

147
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,880
You don't understand?

148
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,670
It was Zheng Si!

149
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,790
He gave me the witness and blood-stained letter.

150
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,120
And?

151
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,430
He instructed

152
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,670
that the moment I hear of Lady Huan's death,

153
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,190
I should take the witness and evidence to the Governor's Office.

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,790
Master Yan!

155
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,360
Qin Mu can't endure this kind of punishment!

156
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,670
Please, release him!

157
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,430
Master Yan...

158
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,430
if you want to save your brother,

159
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,160
you should know what to do.

160
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,550
I'm willing to testify against Zheng Si.

161
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,410
I'll go and testify against him!

162
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,760
Kang Ju.

163
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,040
Mu...

164
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,830
Tomorrow, if you dare say a single wrong word,

165
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,790
the whole of Yangzhou will know

166
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,550
Qin Mu is your brother.

167
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,760
By then, the former top beauty,

168
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,190
and the Baicaojing House will both be a laughingstock.

169
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,040
But by that time,

170
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,400
it won't matter for your brother,

171
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,580
as he'll already be dead.

172
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,760
Don't worry, Master Yan,

173
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,000
I won't say a single wrong word,

174
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,040
as long as...

175
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,190
you release my brother.

176
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,730
After the task is done tomorrow,

177
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,240
come back and take your dear brother.

178
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,260
When Lady Huan died,

179
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,120
she was holding a torn sleeve.

180
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,670
Zheng Zhiheng,

181
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,830
someone accused you of owning that sleeve.

182
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,830
Do you have anything to say?

183
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,570
In response to Inspector Zhang,

184
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,050
I own many clothes.

185
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,520
I genuinely don't remember.

186
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,130
Someone must have framed me.

187
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,190
I trust Inspector Zhang will see the truth.

188
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,920
Is there anyone who can prove

189
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,310
you weren't at the scene when the incident occurred?

190
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
I can prove it.

191
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,120
Cui Shijiu?

192
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,190
This isn't Cui Shijiu.

193
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,360
At the time of the incident, Zheng Wu was with me.

194
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,000
A man and a woman alone, meeting in secret.

195
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,830
It's not exactly respectable,

196
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,830
but

197
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,790
it's not a crime either.

198
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,830
Su Muzhe,

199
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,830
someone reported that at the time of the incident,

200
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
you were seen in Riverside Alley.

201
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,240
Do you have anything to say?

202
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,760
In response to Inspector Zhang,

203
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,470
I went to Riverside Alley to look for Lady Shiqi.

204
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,670
She had gone to sell jewelry and hadn't returned for a long time,

205
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,470
so I brought Gaoshou with me to find her.

206
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,400
By the time we arrived at the small courtyard,

207
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,640
Lady Shiqi had fainted,

208
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,520
and Lady Huan was already gone.

209
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,190
So, you two were the man and woman who fled?

210
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,000
That man was carrying something heavy,

211
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,670
which must have been Miss Yue beside you.

212
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,760
Inspector Zhang,

213
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,830
the situation is clear.

214
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,070
First, Bai Niao accused Su Muzhe

215
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,790
of killing for profit,

216
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,920
and just now, she admitted

217
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,640
they were all at the scene during the incident.

218
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,590
In my opinion,

219
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,310
these three are undoubtedly the culprits behind Lady Huan's murder.

220
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,670
Mr. Xu...

221
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,550
I have a report to make!

222
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,670
Mr. Xu, Inspector Zhang.

223
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,040
Before this,

224
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,760
the blood-stained letter and the witness accusing Ms. Su

225
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,040
were both brought to me by Zheng Si!

226
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,830
But I never expected

227
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,430
that after Zheng Si was imprisoned,

228
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,120
the witness disappeared.

229
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,190
Only then did I think

230
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,120
to examine the blood-stained letter carefully,

231
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,670
realizing it wasn't written by Lady Huan at all.

232
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,280
Zheng Si is from a noble family,

233
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,760
and I always knew he was close with Lady Huan,

234
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,280
so I assumed he was seeking revenge for her.

235
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,950
Foolishly, I believed him,

236
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,880
and this led to my grave mistake.

237
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,760
I ask for your mercy, Mr. Xu, Inspector Zhang.

238
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,000
Bai Niao, making false accusations is a serious crime.

239
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,160
I was misled by others

240
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,880
and misunderstood Ms. Su.

241
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,920
Zheng Zhixing,

242
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,040
do you have any further confessions?

243
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,040
Zheng Zhixing,

244
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,710
you can remain silent,

245
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,070
but remember,

246
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,880
in Lady Huan's embroidery chamber,

247
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,240
you personally admitted to tricking her into trafficking stolen goods

248
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,640
and then mercilessly killed her.

249
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,830
I heard it,

250
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,360
Mr. Xu heard it,

251
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,070
and even more soldiers heard it too.

252
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,880
Zheng Si,

253
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,160
I'll ask you again,

254
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,310
did you instruct Bai Niao

255
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,240
to frame Su Muzhe with the forged blood-stained letter?

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,590
The Zheng family

257
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,160
will do everything to protect you.

258
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,920
After all, your mother is still the lady of the Cui family.

259
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,470
But if something happens to the Cui family,

260
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,040
then...

261
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,760
In the Zheng family,

262
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,520
anyone could be sacrificed

263
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,950
for the sake of the Zheng family.

264
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,670
For the Zheng family!

265
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,470
Yes.

266
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,160
I admit it.

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,310
I killed her,

268
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,590
and I bribed Bai Niao

269
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,380
to frame Su Muzhe.

270
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,040
He confessed!

271
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,380
He killed Lady Huan!

272
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,280
What a heartless creature!

273
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,520
Lady Huan died for nothing.

274
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,670
So, he was the killer.

275
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,640
All these treasures,

276
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,430
upon investigation,

277
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,280
are loot from the Black Dragon Bandits of Hexi.

278
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,360
Lady Huan secretly hid them as clues

279
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,920
before she died,

280
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,000
proving that this stolen loot came from the Zheng family.

281
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,560
You Zhengs colluded with the bandits from Hexi,

282
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,310
fencing stolen goods to build wealth.

283
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,160
Zheng Zhixing,

284
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,880
do you acknowledge your crime?

285
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,880
The Black Dragon Bandits!

286
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,120
- Zheng family's trafficking... - Inspector Zhang,

287
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,000
the matter of the Black Dragon Bandits hasn't been fully investigated.

288
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,950
Don't jump to conclusions.

289
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,400
It's not the Zheng family.

290
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:05,880
It's the Cui family.

291
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,030
The Cui family is responsible!

292
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,030
You're lying...

293
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,190
The Cui family gave me those jewels.

294
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,120
The Zheng family knew nothing of it.

295
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,400
I had no idea where those jewels came from,

296
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,920
or anything about the Black Dragon Bandits.

297
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,510
The Cui family is my mother's side,

298
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,230
and my uncle, Cui Jingchu, gave them to me before he died.

299
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,430
This has nothing to do with the Zheng family.

300
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,920
I confess.

301
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,400
I am willing to face death.

302
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,840
Zheng Zhixing has confessed

303
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,640
to murder and trafficking.

304
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,190
Guards,

305
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,030
take him away to the death row to await sentencing!

306
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,160
Mr. Xu, Inspector Zhang,

307
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,190
Lady Huan was innocent in this.

308
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,560
She was deceived by Zheng Zhixing

309
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,230
and shouldn't be linked to the crime of trafficking.

310
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,320
I ask you to clear her name today

311
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,320
and remove her unjust charges.

312
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,270
Of course.

313
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,320
Take Zheng Zhixing away!

314
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,160
Yes, sir.

315
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,160
Thank you, Inspector Zhang.

316
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,190
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

317
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,430
Bai Niao,

318
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,160
you made a false accusation,

319
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,470
but you were misled and deceived

320
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,470
by others.

321
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,750
This time, your only punishment is a fine of ten million mace

322
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,510
to cover Lady Huan's funeral expenses.

323
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,230
Thank you, Inspector Zhang.

324
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,400
Su Muzhe and Zheng Zhiheng are innocent.

325
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,990
Besides, Su Muzhe risked his own life,

326
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,230
baiting Zheng Zhixing into confessing publicly.

327
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,750
Such noble action deserves commendation.

328
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,470
She is to be released immediately!

329
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
Mr. Xu, what do you think?

330
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,880
Agreed.

331
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,080
Court is adjourned!

332
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,470
Rise quickly.

333
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,510
Inspector Zhang and Mr. Xu are wise indeed,

334
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,320
fair and just.

335
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,990
The legitimate son of the Zheng family actually did such deeds!

336
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,080
And the Cui family is involved in fencing!

337
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,360
This time, we failed to convict the Zhengs.

338
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,360
You don't seem too pleased.

339
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
I'm just an observer.

340
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,600
What's there to be pleased about?

341
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,120
Yan Zijing,

342
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,670
your Yan family's old case still has a chance to be cleared.

343
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,750
Don't let this opportunity slip by.

344
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,470
Everything should be resolved within the law.

345
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,230
You believe in the law,

346
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,120
but I do not.

347
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,230
Many people, driven by selfish gain,

348
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,030
are undermining the very foundation of the law.

349
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,800
You may have captured these lawless criminals,

350
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,600
but can you truly expose those working behind the scenes?

351
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,320
How do you know I wouldn't dare?

352
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,230
Xu Nanying, sitting there in the hall,

353
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,280
was once Prince Tan's man,

354
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,510
but then he switched sides to Prince Ying

355
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
and quickly gained favor.

356
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,430
Do you know why?

357
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,800
Black is black,

358
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,750
and white is white.

359
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,270
I will always uphold justice.

360
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,190
If one day you break the law,

361
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,080
I will treat you the same.

362
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,160
How can you stay seated?

363
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,950
That's ten million...

364
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,750
Ten million mace!

365
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,990
You said following Xu Nanying would bring us wealth and fame?

366
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,190
But without Mr. Xu's support,

367
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:19,270
we wouldn't have opened such a large shop.

368
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,360
He had no choice but to rule that way.

369
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,640
I don't have the money anyway.

370
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,400
Don't worry,

371
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,160
I can still afford the ten million mace.

372
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,880
I've got some jewelry here.

373
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,120
Take it and melt it down.

374
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,430
After paying the fine,

375
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,990
use the rest to find a good craftsman

376
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,190
and buy some fine white jade and gems.

377
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,120
Will that be enough?

378
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,470
Mu, you need to think long-term.

379
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,600
Take that Clear Mind for example,

380
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,430
they don't sell particularly valuable jewels,

381
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,640
but their designs are fresh and unique.

382
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,160
You should learn from Su Muzhe.

383
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,560
Don't mention Su Muzhe to me.

384
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,120
Just hearing her name gets me mad.

385
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,980
We worked so hard to make a name for ourselves.

386
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,650
You have to manage it well.

387
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,410
With Mr. Xu's support,

388
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,990
I believe Baicaojing House

389
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,880
will be renowned across the land one day.

390
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,920
Alright, I get it.

391
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,990
Don't worry.

392
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm heading out now.

393
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,470
Father.

394
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,560
Wu, you're back.

395
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,080
Yes.

396
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,670
From now on, the Zheng family's responsibilities will rest on you.

397
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,510
The Red Leaf Crown commissioned by Prince Ying for the Empress Dowager,

398
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,320
we must not delay it.

399
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,160
This task is yours to handle.

400
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,750
Go to Zhenlang Pavilion and find Yan Zijing,

401
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,030
and secure ruby first.

402
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,880
Father,

403
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,430
what if he demands a high price?

404
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,990
Agree to it for now.

405
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,080
But remember,

406
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,990
he is the Zheng family's great enemy.

407
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,160
I'll remember, Father.

408
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,230
Wu,

409
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,510
you are my son,

410
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,920
just as Si is.

411
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,510
For the sake of the Zheng family,

412
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,640
he took everything upon himself.

413
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,750
Don't hold onto past grudges.

414
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,600
Understood, Father.

415
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,400
Father,

416
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,880
I also visited brother in prison.

417
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,080
Do you think we should

418
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,640
find a way to get him out?

419
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,750
Remember.

420
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,360
Pieces on a chessboard are neither black nor white.

421
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,120
It's the player who decides.

422
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,840
The Zheng family's century-old legacy

423
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,990
has never done anything wrong.

424
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,160
Those who fight us

425
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,470
are challenging the hand that plays.

426
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,190
They will be crushed sooner or later!

427
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,120
Forgive me, Father.

428
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,270
I understand.

429
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,750
The Cui family has fallen completely,

430
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,230
and Cui Shijiu is unworthy to be your wife.

431
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,030
Don't get entangled with her anymore.

432
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,080
Don't worry, Father.

433
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,950
I know what to do.

434
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,030
Ms.

435
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,160
- Duanwu! - You're finally out!

436
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,750
Alright, why are you crying?

437
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,400
You don't know,

438
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,640
every night while you were away, we prayed for you,

439
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,400
especially Yunxiu.

440
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,920
I was worried she'd fall ill.

441
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,560
I'm fine.

442
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,360
Let's go home.

443
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,230
Oh, right!

444
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,120
What's this?

445
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,920
Come on, Ms.

446
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Wait, what's this about?

447
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,160
- Come on... - Step over it.

448
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,030
Step over it.

449
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,880
Quickly!

450
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,710
Take it slow.

451
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,560
Great!

452
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,160
After a great disaster, blessings are sure to come!

453
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,880
Exactly!

454
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,600
Ms. Su, fate protects the blessed!

455
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,320
Come on.

456
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,260
[Clear Mind]

457
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,510
- Greetings, Inspector Zhang. - Greetings, Inspector Zhang.

458
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,990
You're back.

459
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:49,880
Duanwu, you chat with Inspector Zhang,

460
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,430
and we'll go inside and tidy up.

461
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,990
Let's go.

462
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,640
Thank you, Inspector Zhang.

463
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,880
Since when

464
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,600
do we need to say "thank you" between us?

465
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,190
And you called me "Inspector Zhang."

466
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,670
This is just part of my duty.

467
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,430
Once Clear Mind reopens,

468
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,360
I'll definitely invite you for a drink.

469
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,030
If you want to invite me for a drink,

470
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,670
do you have to wait until it reopens?

471
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,270
I haven't been back in so long,

472
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,360
everything's changed.

473
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,600
If it's messy or dirty,

474
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,400
we can wipe it clean.

475
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,600
Just like...

476
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,270
what's past has scattered with the wind,

477
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,840
leaving no trace in the heart.

478
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,030
That's true freedom in this world.

479
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,710
Come on, let me help you.

480
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,190
You'll help me?

481
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,640
Let's go.

482
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,030
Ms. Yingtao.

483
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,430
Mr. Gaoshou.

484
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,600
Today,

485
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,270
you must be exhausted from helping us.

486
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,430
Not at all!

487
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,470
Then...

488
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,230
please, sit.

489
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,800
Ms. Yingtao, this isn't proper...

490
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
Your mustache is fake!

491
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,600
Let me see what you look like without it.

492
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,800
Now you look even more handsome!

493
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,950
Well, my buddies did say

494
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,670
I look decent.

495
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,360
Then why do you wear a fake mustache?

496
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,710
Don't you think it makes me look tougher?

497
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,990
I don't think you look tough at all.

498
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,510
You mean

499
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,880
my efforts were all in vain?

500
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,430
Outsiders might think that,

501
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,640
but I never thought you were tough.

502
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,190
If my Ms. Yingtao thinks it's fine,

503
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,750
then it's fine.

504
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,880
So you're called Gaoshou,

505
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,670
Does that mean...?

506
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,920
Gaoshou is indeed just a nickname.

507
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,470
What's your real name?

508
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,840
My real name is

509
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,840
Gao Daliang.

510
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,840
Gao Daniang?

511
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,880
It's "liang," not "niang"!

512
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,670
Gao Daniang?

513
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,430
Ms. Yingtao,

514
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,080
you can call me

515
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,990
however you like,

516
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,560
just don't let others know.

517
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,030
Is this also fake?

518
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,140
[Wei Yan's Memorial Tablet]

519
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,190
Huan,

520
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,560
you've never been to my Clear Mind.

521
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,640
These are my dearest ones.

522
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,400
From now on,

523
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,080
Clear Mind is your home.

524
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,640
This whole life,

525
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,640
you were bound by the obligations of the Huan family,

526
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,670
unable to follow your own heart.

527
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,750
Yet you were so genuine and passionate,

528
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,120
and trusting the wrong person.

529
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,030
Your radiant youth

530
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,360
ended in tragedy.

531
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,640
I feel your life was unjust.

532
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,750
Though our time together was short,

533
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,190
I felt such a deep bond.

534
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,920
In my life,

535
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,400
meeting you

536
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,320
was truly worthwhile.

537
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,710
Huan,

538
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,190
in your next life,

539
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,430
may you find peace,

540
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,030
comfort,

541
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,570
and be your true self.

542
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,840
Where's Yan Zijing?

543
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,320
He's not here.

544
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,880
What's your business with me?

545
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,330
How did you get Bai Niao to change her testimony?

546
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,120
I held her brother hostage.

547
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,710
Are you trying to say

548
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:51,430
that I've always preferred

549
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,270
using such despicable tactics?

550
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,510
So, it was your doing.

551
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,320
Now Zheng Zhixing has taken the fall for the Zheng family,

552
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,560
something you didn't anticipate, did you?

553
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,510
This time I failed,

554
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,840
but there will be a next time.

555
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,110
I have only one goal in this life,

556
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,150
and I will achieve it.

557
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,030
But from now on,

558
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,760
the Zheng family will be led by Zheng Zhiheng.

559
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,200
Good luck to you.

560
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,240
The Zhengs wish to dominate Yangzhou alone,

561
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,800
uncaring if the Cui family was ruined over the tribute pearls.

562
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,240
Little did they know

563
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,280
that it was actually done by the Yan family of Yangzhou.

564
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,760
What are you trying to say?

565
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,430
Stay out of this matter.

566
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,150
Years ago, the tribute convoy was ambushed,

567
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,280
and my father died because of it.

568
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,680
I want to know the truth.

569
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,840
Back then, it was a conspiracy between the Cui and Zheng families.

570
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:54,990
So how could I not be involved?

571
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,550
Aren't you supposed to be a merchant now?

572
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,430
Look at the state of your Clear Mind.

573
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,950
Take care of yourself first.

574
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,280
No need to worry about me.

575
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,110
Shijiu,

576
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,070
you risked your reputation to testify for me,

577
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,200
and I, Zheng Wu, swear

578
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,720
never to let you down in this life.

579
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,470
I'm the proud legitimate daughter of the Cui family.

580
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,140
Now I become your concubine.

581
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,330
You must feel triumphant.

582
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,780
Except the title,

583
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,730
I can give you everything.

584
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,010
Then yesterday, when Zheng Si slandered the Cui family,

585
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,430
why did you stay silent?

586
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,320
Because there's no one left in the Cui family,

587
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,510
so we can bear all the blame?

588
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,950
It all happened so suddenly.

589
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,320
I didn't expect it to turn out this way.

590
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,680
But it was the only way to save the Zheng family.

591
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,150
Only by saving the Zheng family

592
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,150
can I

593
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,630
and we have a future.

594
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,150
Although Father favors me,

595
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,200
Zheng Si is still the legitimate son.

596
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,470
Even he was so easily abandoned.

597
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,950
What if it were me instead this time?

598
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,430
How is our situation any different?

599
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,950
I am also my father's legitimate daughter.

600
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,240
I would still be beaten

601
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,920
and abandoned just the same.

602
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,590
You're right.

603
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,240
We're the same.

604
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,990
Shijiu,

605
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,680
we only have each other.

606
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,240
But you will have your legitimate wife,

607
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,430
and where will that leave me?

608
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,500
Wu, I want

609
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,760
a shop of our own,

610
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,360
so I can have a fallback in the future,

611
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:34,590
no longer living at the mercy of others.

612
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,280
What do you think?

613
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,630
We'll have it.

614
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,360
Mother!

615
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,950
Where are you going so late?

616
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
I'm going to see off Lady Cui.

617
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,720
Actually, you're good enough.

618
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,950
But alas, in this life,

619
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,990
you're destined not to be Zheng Wu's legitimate wife.

620
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,470
A wise woman

621
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,280
knows her place.

622
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,880
Zheng Shiyuan has lost a son,

623
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,280
and all the loot was confiscated.

624
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:43,800
Now he has no choice

625
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,620
but to buy ruby from you at a high price.

626
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,930
These setbacks have cost him dearly.

627
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,300
On top of that,

628
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,380
Zheng Shiyuan gave up on Zheng Si so easily,

629
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,150
which will surely disappoint Zheng Zhiheng in his father.

630
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,070
The fall of the Zheng family

631
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,200
is only a matter of time.

632
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,550
Will I live to see that day?

633
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,220
Whether you do or not,

634
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,930
you'll just have to wait.

635
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,860
You must live well.

636
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,550
What did she say to you today?

637
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,850
With ears as sharp as yours,

638
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,800
didn't you hear it all?

639
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,800
I didn't hear it.

640
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,070
She was so calm

641
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,680
that doesn't seem like her usual self.

642
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,510
And to her,

643
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm just an enemy.

644
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,320
She already knows the Zhengs are linked to the Black Dragon Bandits.

645
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,590
Why are you still hiding it from her?

646
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:51,470
Do you really want her to hate you for life?

647
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:53,590
Even if I told her, what would that change?

648
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,110
Right now, all she cares about is Clear Mind.

649
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,010
I think that's for the best.

650
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,950
Besides, if I told her it was the Black Dragon Bandits

651
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,400
and that Li Kui killed Cao Da and Shrimp,

652
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,680
how do you think she would react?

653
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,320
Are you really not thinking about yourself at all?

654
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,030
The Black Dragon Bandits have been rampant for so many years,

655
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,280
and even the authorities couldn't do anything about it.

656
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,720
So,

657
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,430
even we don't know

658
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,550
if we can defeat Li Kui.

659
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,240
Why involve her

660
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,510
and let her risk her life?

661
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,360
Lady,

662
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,800
what will we do from now on?

663
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,630
Even the Master...

664
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,320
decades of loyalty, yet he still...

665
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,880
I'm paying my respects to you one last time, Lady.

666
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,150
You should feel fortunate.

667
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,630
Master is a man of sentiment.

668
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,280
Otherwise, instead of sending you to the convent,

669
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,800
he would have sent you away entirely.

670
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,470
Zheng Shiyuan is hypocritical and heartless.

671
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,680
My son sacrificed himself for the Zheng family,

672
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,280
and so did I.

673
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,690
But now it's your turn

674
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,920
and your Zheng Wu's.

675
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,760
What goes around comes around.

676
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,880
That day will come.

677
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,590
Is everyone dead?

678
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,840
What are you standing there for?

679
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:39,990
Let's go back, Lady.

680
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,800
That day will come!

681
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,630
- Don't push! We can walk ourselves. - Lady,

682
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,360
don't listen to her nonsense.

683
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,320
From now on, you're the lady of the Zheng family.

684
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,160
My Zheng Wu

685
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,590
finally doesn't have to suffer anymore.

686
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,840
Yes.

687
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,950
Why did Zheng Zhixing

688
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,720
and Zheng Yuqing die in prison?

689
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,470
They broke their bowls

690
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,280
and used the shards to take their own lives.

691
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,030
Not even immortals could've saved them.

692
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,800
I've already punished the jailers severely,

693
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,150
but this is as far as it goes.

694
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,990
Their deaths are not that simple.

695
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,320
Prince Ying has decreed

696
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,030
that the Black Dragon Bandits have been wiped out.

697
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:56,880
The era of bandits ravaging Hexi is over.

698
00:42:58,110 --> 00:43:00,630
Don't stir up any more trouble.

699
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,920
Jinran, listen to my advice.

700
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:13,590
Let the past stay in the past.

701
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,700
There...

702
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:43,280
there's a white figure up ahead.

703
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,030
Could it be Lady Huan's spirit returned?

704
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,430
Lady Huan just passed away.

705
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,360
