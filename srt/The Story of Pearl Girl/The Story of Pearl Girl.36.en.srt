12
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,350
Come on. Greet our guest.

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,150
Okay.

14
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,400
No need.

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,150
Wuyi, how are you doing?

16
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,430
Zijing.

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,680
You look thin.

18
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,070
Mr. Yuchi.

19
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,960
Duanwu.

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,560
No, I should call you Ms. Su now.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,350
Mr. Yuchi, you are well informed.

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,430
You're famous in Yangzhou.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,430
I asked around.

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,200
Many people showed me the way.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm flattered.

26
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,870
You started from scratch in Yangzhou

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,350
and achieved so much.

28
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,160
Your looks

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,630
and abilities

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,440
are outstanding

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,550
and remarkable.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,110
My Clear Mind

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,920
is nothing compared

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,280
to your Langhuan Dockyard.

35
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,200
It's just a small business.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,670
I was just lucky.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,110
Mr. Yuchi, let me introduce them to you.

38
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,600
This is Yunxiu,

39
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,350
the Master Artisan of Clear Mind.

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,230
Mr. Yuchi, nice to meet you.

41
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,110
They are my right-hand men.

42
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,230
I am Yingtao.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,000
He is Gaoshou.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,880
He's my subordinate.

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,200
This is Mr. Zhang.

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,350
Mr. Zhang, we know each other.

47
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,760
You know each other?

48
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,950
Mr. Zhang was anxious

49
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,920
after you were attacked.

50
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,390
He went to me to look for you.

51
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
Mr. Yuchi, how are you?

52
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,070
We were anxious to find them at Langhuan Dockyard.

53
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,920
We meet again today.

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,510
When I first arrived in Yangzhou,

55
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,880
I heard that there was a fair

56
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,480
and impartial inspector.

57
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,880
It must be you.

58
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,440
I'm flattered.

59
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,160
Let's sit down and talk.

60
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,760
- Okay. - Please.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,670
Please, Mr. Yuchi.

62
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,140
Okay.

63
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,630
This way.

64
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,280
Please.

65
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,440
Have a seat.

66
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,510
Mr. Yuchi.

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,440
Taste the tea in Yangzhou.

68
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,440
Okay.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Have you ever been to Yangzhou before?

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,630
It's much better

71
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,510
than desert tea.

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,350
I didn't expect you

73
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,110
to be able to start Clear Mind

74
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,630
from scratch

75
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,350
after such a big event.

76
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,720
And you're doing great.

77
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,000
If your father and mother see this above there,

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,280
they will be happy.

79
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,630
If my father and mother

80
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,390
see this above there,

81
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,480
they will be happy.

82
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,960
Wuyi.

83
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,280
Why did you come to Yangzhou?

84
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,280
There's a lot you don't know.

85
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,110
I am no longer the owner of Langhuan Dockyard.

86
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,550
I was anxious

87
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,190
when you were attacked at Langhuan Dockyard.

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,600
I looked for you many times, but I couldn't find you.

89
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,920
I felt hopeless.

90
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,310
Later,

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,790
officers came to me many times.

92
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,670
Everyone at Langhuan Dockyard was in a panic.

93
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,960
So, I decided to quit.

94
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,230
Wouldn't it be better to come to the southeast

95
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,350
to enjoy the mountains and rivers?

96
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,670
So were we.

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,110
We've been through a lot to get settled in Yangzhou.

98
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,040
I'm here to see you.

99
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,310
As the host,

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,080
you should take good care of me.

101
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,310
Don't worry. I've arranged everything for you.

102
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,350
Great.

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,520
Come on.

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,870
I heard Clear Mind is famous for its glassware.

105
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,550
Here's a Persian glass bracelet for you.

106
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,840
Mr. Yuchi.

107
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,870
It's an expensive gift.

108
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,190
Good things should be given to people who understand them.

109
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,640
Since Wuyi wanted to give it to you,

110
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,750
just take it.

111
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
Okay, I'll take it.

112
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,750
Thank you, Mr. Yuchi.

113
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,990
What are you going to do to thank me?

114
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,920
I will take you on a tour

115
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,720
of Yangzhou.

116
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,280
What do you say?

117
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,600
Great.

118
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,920
You've been working hard lately.

119
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,790
Let's close our shop today and go out.

120
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,750
We can go out.

121
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,110
- We can go out. - Great.

122
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:01,960
Gaoshou.

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,750
Don't be rude.

124
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,550
Mr. Zhang.

125
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,920
Come with us if you're not busy.

126
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,550
Mr. Zhang has something important to do.

127
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,430
I don't think he has time.

128
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,990
I don't have important things to do today.

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,790
If you, an official, socialize too much with businessmen,

130
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,960
people will start talking.

131
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,350
As the saying goes, a clean hand wants no washing.

132
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,840
Mr. Yuchi.

133
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,350
Please.

134
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,280
Let's go.

135
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,640
You don't have to go.

136
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,520
I'll take you on a good tour of Yangzhou.

137
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,040
Thank you.

138
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,790
Mr. Yuchi.

139
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,040
This is the view of Jiangnan.

140
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,720
It should be different from the desert.

141
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,080
If the world's beautiful scenery is three,

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
Yangzhou occupies two shares.

143
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,160
Watch singing and dancing on the bridge under the moon.

144
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,230
There are streets and water but no horses.

145
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,750
Please.

146
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,230
This way.

147
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,520
Ms. Su.

148
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,550
I heard that there are painters in Yangzhou

149
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,310
who can paint people very similar.

150
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,960
Let's go to them and paint a painting of us.

151
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,720
Where can we find them?

152
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,520
Mr. Zhang, you can paint, right?

153
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
I can't do it.

154
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,870
I want to be in the painting.

155
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,550
We want to paint a painting of Clear Mind's people.

156
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,040
Mr. Yan is not from Clear Mind.

157
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,960
What does it have to do with you?

158
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,310
You have a thick skin.

159
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,790
Let me see how the Go skills of the Central Plains people are.

160
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,080
Let's go.

161
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,480
You like it, too, right?

162
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
The game is set.

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,870
Black is going to lose.

164
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,210
Good.

165
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,670
Tang's Go pieces are pottery.

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,720
They're rough.

167
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,430
And they don't sound good.

168
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,640
That's why I lost.

169
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,670
Where are my Go pieces?

170
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,230
Look.

171
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,840
They are jade pieces.

172
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,920
Each one is a one-of-a-kind treasure.

173
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,670
Jade pieces?

174
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,670
They are rare in Yangzhou and even in Tang.

175
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,720
Can I have a look?

176
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,430
They are national treasures of Haidong.

177
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,230
They are all unique.

178
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,350
Unique.

179
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,400
What are you thinking about?

180
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,880
They are good pieces.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
Let's have another game

182
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,280
with your pieces.

183
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,040
You must have thought

184
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,160
- of a money-making business. - Let's have another game.

185
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,670
Yunxiu.

186
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,310
Yunxiu.

187
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,640
Come here.

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,880
Do you remember

189
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,830
when we made black glass?

190
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,310
Yes.

191
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,280
What's the use of it?

192
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,310
No wonder she's a shopkeeper.

193
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,280
She thinks about business

194
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,950
all the time.

195
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,470
She was born to be a businesswoman.

196
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,430
You have a good eye for business.

197
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,310
You can find business opportunities everywhere.

198
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,070
Duanwu.

199
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,590
The colors and materials are easy to handle.

200
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,830
But it's difficult

201
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,280
to make them the same size.

202
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,520
It is difficult

203
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,190
to make them the same size.

204
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,040
Duanwu, why don't we try using the mold casting process?

205
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,430
We can make a wax piece first.

206
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,470
Then, make a mold with it.

207
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,040
Next, pour the melted glass into it.

208
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,470
Finally, cut it and flatten it

209
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,360
while it's hot.

210
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,830
We can give it a try.

211
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,880
The ratio of materials must be accurate.

212
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,440
- You have to be very careful. - More.

213
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,000
Ready to open to the kiln.

214
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,790
Yingtao, get ready.

215

216
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,160
Okay.

217
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,190
Be careful. Wait for it to cool down.

218
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Mr. Qin, please take a look.

219
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,670
This is a finished product.

220
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,710
Good.

221
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,950
Nice texture.

222
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,120
Yangzhou is famous for having treasures from all over the world.

223
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,590
Playing Go is an elegant thing.

224
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,880
But there are no merchants in Yangzhou

225
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,520
who can make good Go pieces.

226
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,790
Miss, your Go pieces are nice.

227
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,310
Ladies,

228
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,360
Your pieces look good

229
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,280
and crystal clear.

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,240
Where did you get them?

231
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,280
What's this made of?

232
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,190
Is it made of crystal?

233
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,830
It's rare.

234
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,520
When you look up at it, it looks like jasper.

235
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,920
When you look down at it, it looks like black paint.

236
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,430
It's impossible.

237
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,830
These are Clear Mind's original glass Go pieces.

238
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,670
Your pieces are made of glass?

239
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Can your glass pieces

240
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,190
match my jade pieces?

241
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,590
They can't match your jade pieces.

242
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,120
Glass pieces feel smooth

243
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,190
and sound clear.

244
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,520
Each one has a different pattern on it.

245
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,590
It's so special.

246
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,280
More importantly, they show different colors

247
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,640
in different weather.

248
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,790
That's true.

249
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,880

378
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:23,790
Come on.

379
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,280
They're opening branches.

380
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,430
I heard.

381
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,830
She's amazing.

382
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,640
Glass pieces are nice and cheap.

383
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,400
- That's true. - I want one, too.

384
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,470
Let's buy some.

385
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,120
Go.

386
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,830
Write more clearly.

387
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,360
Please sign here. Thank you.

388
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,310
Excuse me.

389
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,550
Ms. Su.

390
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:45,950
Mr. Kang is here.

391
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,240
- Come on. - I got it.

392
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:53,950
Wait a moment.

393
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,550
Okay.

394
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,790
Thank you.

395
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,070
I'm sorry I didn't greet you.

396
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,400
Mr. Kang, why didn't you inform me before you came?

397
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,710
I heard Clear Mind's new glass pieces

398
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,670
are nice and cheap.

399
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,030
Ms. Su.

400
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,030
Can you show me?

401
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,950
Mr. Kang, I didn't expect you

402
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,670
to be interested in it.

403
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,860
- Wait a minute. - It's delicate.

404
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,510
Thank you.

405
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,040
Mr. Kang, here you are.

406
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,560
Take care.

407
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,360
Do you like it?

408
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,010
Here you are.

409
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,810
It's beautiful.

410
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,680
Okay.

411
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,520
Have a look.

412
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,280
Is this the only one?

413
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,840
I want a thousand sets to be delivered in a month.

414
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,400
One month?

415
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,800
If I take your order,

416
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,030
I'll have to delay

417
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,320
the previous customer's orders.

418
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,670
Clear Mind will lose credit.

419
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,430
If you want one thousand sets,

420
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,030
I think it will take us more than three months.

421
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,400
No, more than three months.

422
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,320
Can you wait for more than three months?

423
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,270
If you can't,

424
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,230
we'll work together next time.

425
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,230
It's a big order.

426
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Aren't you worried about offending me?

427
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm worried.

428
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,360
But Clear Mind is a small shop. We value credit.

429
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,320
If you just said yes,

430
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,800
that's our

431
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,750
last deal.

432
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,560
I'll give you three months.

433
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,560
I'll send someone to pick them up in three months.

434
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,080
Mr. Kang, I'll get a contract for you.

435
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,640
Okay.

436
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,080
Thank you.

437
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,990
Gaoshou, take it easy.

438
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,160
Don't tremble your mouth.

439
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,920
I'm not.

440
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,600
Don't tremble your mouth.

441
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,750
Don't be nervous.

442
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,600
Yingtao, your left eyebrow. No.

443
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,360
Your right eyebrow.

444
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,190
Lower your right eyebrow a little bit.

445
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,320
Lower.

446
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,920
Lift the left corner of your mouth.

447
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,510
No, right corner.

448
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,190
It's good.

449
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,600
Don't be nervous, you two.

450
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,120
I'm not nervous.

451
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,270
Look here.

452
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,710
Duanwu, we're here.

453
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,510
Do your clothes fit?

454
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,600
Yes.

455
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,560
Let me see.

456
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:32,880
Mr. Qin.

457
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,600
It fits you well.

458
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,080
No.

459
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,670
It's good.

460
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,400
Come on.

461
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,230
- What are you painting? - Come here.

462
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,750
- It fits you well. - I have one more...

463
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,560
It's good.

464
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,950
It's okay. We'll talk about it later.

465
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,990
Supervisor Kang, come on.

466
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,080
Coming.

467
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,270
It's not over yet.

468
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,840
I'm not playing with you.

469
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,120
I want to paint a portrait.

470
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,270
Won't you join us?

471
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,230
I won't join you.

472
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,920
All right.

473
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,950
Come on.

474
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,430
Am I late?

475
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,190
You're just in time.

476
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,270
Supervisor Kang.

477
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,880
It will take two hours.

478
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,750
Find a place to sit.

479
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,400
Come here.

480
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,320
Otherwise, your legs...

481
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
My legs? Okay.

482
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,990
I have the best legs in the West Regions.

483
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,400
Be careful.

484
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,030
It's good.

485
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,030
You're intimacy.

486
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,320
It's good.

487
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Stand still.

488
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,080
Stand still.

489
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,320
Is everyone here?

490
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,710
Let's get started.

491
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,470
We're all here.

492
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,120
Come on.

493
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,430
I still have work to do.

494
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,710
Mr. Qin can't hold back anymore.

495
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,600
Yingtao.

496
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,920
Is that your double chin?

497
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,400
Yunxiu, I told you he painted me fat.

498
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,320
No. It's beautiful.

499
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,670
Yeah. Your teeth are white.

500
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,190
Really?

501
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,990
Gaoshou.

502
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,320
Why didn't you look at the Yingtao?

503
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:47,880
I...

504
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:48,920
I wanted to ignore him.

505
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,270
I wanted to pretend to be deep.

506
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,030
I have a question.

507
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,360
Am I usually so handsome?

508
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,320
Supervisor Kang's head is tilted.

509
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
I didn't even notice it.

510
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,030
His head was tilted the whole time.

511
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,600
You're not as handsome as Du Ming.

512
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,510
Wait.

513
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,560
Look at Zhang Jinran.

514
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,710
He doesn't look like an official.

515
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,880
Mr. Zhang's head

516
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,990
is as thick as his head.

517
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,990
Ms. Su is beautiful.

518
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,710
Duanwu is so beautiful.

519
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,600
The painting looks exactly like her.

520
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,750
You and him are a good match.

521
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,400
No, the painting is nice.

522
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,270
I'll go to that painter

523
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,030
and paint a portrait for myself.

524
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,600
Supervisor Kang, are you addicted?

525
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,640
Good.

526
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,750
It's beautiful.

527
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,840
Supervisor Kang, you're whiter in the painting.

528
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,880
Supervisor Kang.

529
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,320
Your legs are not good. Walk slowly.

530
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,360
Walk slowly.

531
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,400
Don't fall again.

532
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,600
You're on crutches.

533
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,560
They look happy.

534
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,470
I didn't expect them to like it so much.

535
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:54,080
Since they like it, we'll paint another one next year.

536
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,430
We'll paint one every year.

537
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,670
Clear Mind's business will get bigger and bigger.

538
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,920
There will be more and more people.

539
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,800
One painting can't fit everyone.

540
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,320
Don't be silly.

541
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,950
We can paint a large painting.

542
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,080
This wide. Or this wide.

543
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,120
It will fit everyone.

544
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,190
It will take a little longer.

545
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,320
We will sit.

546
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,640
It's good.

547
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,710
Painting brings us good luck.

548
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,470
I'm telling you.

549
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:29,600
You hung the painting well this year.

550
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,880
You will also hang the next year's painting.

551
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,990
Let's talk about it next year.

552
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
It depends on my mood.

553
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,270
What do you mean by that?

554
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,080
What's wrong?

555
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:47,800
That won't do.

556
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,160
I'm taking you

557
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,950
as a waiter at Clear Mind.

558
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,920
It's not like you'll not be at Clear Mind.

559
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm just a waiter?

560
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,560
I should be a manager at worst.

561
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,430
I can't afford to pay a manager.

562
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,840
Money doesn't matter.

563
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,750
Ms. Su.

564
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,600
I want you to give me a job for life.

565
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:30,710
Look.

566
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,560
Zhang Jin looks much taller than me.

567
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,640
His hat is tall.

568
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,670
Look.

569
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,400
I'm handsome in the painting.

570
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,800
I'm tall and mighty.

571
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,190
The painting painted us well,

572
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,990
especially you and me.

573
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,640
It's nice.

574
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,190
Ninety-eight...

575
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,840
Fifty...

576
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,320
Ms. Su.

577
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,400
These are samples.

578
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,080
I put the rest in the backyard.

579
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,710
With these raw materials,

580
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,400
we can fill Mr. Kang's order.

581
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,120
And the rest

582
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,670
can be made into jewelry.

583
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,160
Clear Mind's

584
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,560
glass crown and belt were sold out

585
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,510
as soon as they hit the shelves.

586
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,400
Clear Mind is finally

587
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,560
in luck.

588
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,710
Ms. Su.

589
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,800
When I came back just now,

590
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,190
I found that the Zhenlang Pavilion was not open.

591
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,800
It's not open?

592
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,160
Open the door.

593
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,600
Open up. There's big business coming.

594
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,510
Clear Mind wants to buy Zhenlang Pavilion

595
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,990
at a high price.

596
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,920
This is your last chance.

597
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,470
Who said we wanted to sell Zhenlang Pavilion?

598
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:25,950
If you're not selling it,

599
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,320
why don't you open the door and do business?

600
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,360
It has nothing to do with you.

601
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Wait.

602
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,510
IS Zhenlang Pavilion for sale?

603
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,160
If you don't do business,

604
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,470
you'd better sell it to me.

605
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,470
Even if you don't sell it to me,

606
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,080
someone else will buy it.

607
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,400
You're wasting

608
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,320
your shop.

609
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,640
This table is nice.

610
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:50,840
We need a table.

611
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,030
You...

612
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,600
Cui Shijiu.

613
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,230
Why are you hiding?

614
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,950
Tong.

615
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,270
Send them away.

616
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,430
Did you hear it? Get out.

617
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,670
I'm begging you.

618
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,030
If you're just looking for a place to stay,

619
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,880
you should continue to be the Cui's legitimate daughter

620
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,120
and rely on the Zheng family.

621
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,670
If you want to start all over again,

622
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,950
run Zhenlang Pavilion well.

623
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,990
Get out. Stop it.

624
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,430
Cui Shijiu, your time is running out.

625
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,400
Ms. Su, why do we always help her?

626
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,470
She deserves it.

627
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,920
Zhenlang Pavilion's situation

628
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,230
will affect our business.

629
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,640
Tell me.

630
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,840
Why does she get everything

631
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,950
she wants?

632
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,360
Why can I get

633
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,030
what I want?

634
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,600
Am I wrong,

635
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,600
or is it something I want wrong?

636
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,430
Zhenlang Pavilion.

637
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,360
Zhenlang Pavilion.

638
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,800
All I did was to get you.

639
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,950
Now, I finally get you.

640
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
I own Zhenlang Pavilion.

641
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,430
But I'm alone.

642
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,510
Mother.

643
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,120
Father.

644
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,360
Wu.

645
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:01,080
I finally got Zhenlang Pavilion.

646
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,990
But I'm alone.

647
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,270
In that case,

648
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,640
I don't need you.

649
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,600
I don't want you.

650
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,510
I don't want you.

651
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,750
I don't want Zhenlang Pavilion.

652
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,510
I don't want it.

653
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,030
I want them back.

654
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,510
I want my mother.

655
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,710
I want my father.

656
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,120
I want them back.

657
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,920
I want them back.

658
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,190
I don't want it.

659
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,430
I don't want it.

660
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,670
I don't want it.

661
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:17,710
I don't want it.

662
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,560
The glass is transparent.

663
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,430
Ms. Su, our goods arrived.

664
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,840
Duanwu, have a look.

665
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,360
Are those raw materials?

666
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,400
These raw materials are from the Kang royal family.

667
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,880
They must be good.

668
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,160
They are of good quality.

669
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,800
We can make good glassware.

670
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,320
Time is tight.

671
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,750
Should we hire some people to help you?

672
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,510
We have to train new recruits.

673
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,400
And they are not necessarily reliable.

674
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,580
It's okay. We have Mr. Qin, a veteran expert.

675
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,380
We can finish it by working overtime.

676
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,160
Why didn't Mr. Qin come out?

677
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,230
The glass is good.

678
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,840
He'll be so happy to see it.

679
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,750
He didn't come today.

680
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,030
I sent Gaoshou to go to him.

681
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,320
Mr. Qin is usually the first to arrive.

682
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,670
Is he sick?

683
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,190
Gaoshou, where is Mr. Qin?

684
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,160
Where is he?

685
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,320
I asked you to go to him.

686
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,670
I did.

687
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,880
His daughter wasn't at home. And I didn't see him.

688
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,990
I thought he was here.

689
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,780
We're on a deadline.

690
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,560
Where did he go?

691
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,320
I don't know.

692
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,030
Yunxiu.

693
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,750
Go to Mr. Zhang

694
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,510
and ask him to come to Clear Mind.

695
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,670
Mr. Qin left suddenly

696
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,190
without telling anyone.

697
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:34,990
It's weird.

698
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,320
Yingtao, stay in the shop.

699
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,160
Tell Mr. Yan about it when he gets back.

700
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,560
Gaoshou, come with me.

701
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,270
Ms. Su.

702
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:43,470
Why don't you wait for Mr. Yan?

703
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,360
Don't worry, Yingtao.

704
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,990
I'll go with Ms. Su.

705
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
What can you do?

706
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,400
I can do anything.

707
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,160
Let's go, Ms. Su.

708
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,320
Let's go.

709
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,600
Take good care of Ms. Su.

710
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,160
Rest assured.

711
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,940
Why did Mr. Qin suddenly return

712
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,840
to his hometown?

713
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,750
Don't worry, Ms. Su.

714
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,430
This is the only way

715
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,750
to Zizhou.

716
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,990
We'll catch up with him. Don't worry.

717
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,080
What do you want?

718
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,230
Let go of me.

719
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,880
What do you want?

720
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,400
Let go of me.

721
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,600
Ms. Su, something is going on over there.

722
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,120
I'll check it out.

723
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,640
I'll be back in a minute. Wait for me in the carriage.

724
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,190
Gaoshou!

725
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,160
Wait here.

726
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,670
Yes, ma'am.

727
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,360
Gaoshou!

728
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,990
Gaoshou!

729
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,840
Gaoshou.

730
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,070
Gaoshou, wake up.

731
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,430
Su Muzhe.

732
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:01,030
You killed my two sons.

733
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,400
You made me, Zheng Shiyuan, lose my offspring.

734
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,360
Today,

735
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,550
either you get down on your knees

736
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,030
and apologize to them,

737
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:10,880
or

738
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:15,400
I'll bury you here.

739
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,280
Zheng Shiyuan.

740
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,030
Don't pretend to be a good father.

741
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,990
You know

742
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,320
how your two sons died.

743
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,880
The person who should kneel is you, not me.

744
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
Drop the act.

745
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,110
You want my blood-stained pearl.

746
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,630
Right?

747
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,550
Su Muzhe.

748
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,950
You made my two sons

749
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,430
unable to enter the ancestral hall after they died.

750
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,030
Do you know how sad I am?

751
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:07,470
You

752
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,990
give everything at Clear Mind to me

753
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,150
and get out of Yangzhou.

754
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,360
Maybe I'll spare your life.

755
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,320
You killed your sons.

756
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,550
It's you, Zheng Shiyuan. You killed your sons.

757
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,110
You want my Clear Mind.

758
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,720
Dream on.

759
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,840
Master, the savior is coming.

760
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,990
Let go of me.

761
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,430
Let go of me!

762
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,430
Are you saying that she and Gaoshou

763
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,400
went to chase Mr. Qin?

764
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,240
Yes. Ms. Su said we couldn't delay.

765
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,150
So, they went to chase him.

766
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,840
She was too reckless. What if they encounter bad people?

767
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,070
[Clear Mind]

768
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,720
They haven't come back yet?

769
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,110
What took them so long?

770
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:47,720
I don't know.

771
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,360
I'll go find them.

772
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,400
Don't rush.

773
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
Let's go to the glass shop first.

774
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,990
What if they're already back?

775
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,720
Okay, let's go.

776
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,240
Go.

777
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,920
I'll go with you.

778
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,240
Stay here and watch the shop.

779
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:06,760
Help!

780
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,200
Help!

781
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,150
Hello? Help!

782
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,030
Where is your father?

783
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,400
I'm looking for him, too.

784
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,430
Where did he go?

785
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,150
Neighbors said

786
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,400
he went out in the morning and said he was going back to his hometown.

787
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,950
Go back to his hometown?

788
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,590
Is Mr. Qin

789
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,720
a bait?

790
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,950
Zheng Shiyuan.

791
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,920
Mr. Zheng.

792
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,550
Did you make it?

793
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,400
You startled me.

794
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,360
With your help,

795
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,800
Su Muzhe will die.

796
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,990
Where is the stuff?

797
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,320
I'm the only one in the world

798
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,510
who can tell if it's real.

799
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,880
It's just a blood-soaked jade bead.

800
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,760
It's unlucky.

801
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,430
Why do you want it?

802
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,920
Do you want to ruin our business?

803
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:59,470
The Zheng family made many mistakes.

804
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,590
You redeemed yourself

805
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,320
by finding the blood-stained pearl.

806
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,990
When can I meet the savior?

807
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,430
Wait.

808
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,840
Well.

809
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,470
I want to take you to a place.

810
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,240
We'll go to a place where there are just the two of us.

811
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,430
When we get there,

812
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,430
I'm not Zheng Wu,

813
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,510
and you're not Cui Shijiu.

814
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,550
We can live our own lives.

815
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:05,990
Wu.

816
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,150
I'd rather die

817
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,280
than let anyone hurt Cui Shijiu.

818
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,360
Shijiu...

819
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:27,110

Your name is Cui Zhuohua.

823
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,360
You're not just Cui Shijiu.

824
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,510

For you

834
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,510

Lady Shijiu.

838
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,920
Go get Garuda.

Don't we open the door? Are you going to...?

Yes, I will get Garuda.

843
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,470
