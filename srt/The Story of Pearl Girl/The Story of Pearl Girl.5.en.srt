[Episode 5]

12
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,960
Before you bargain with me,

13
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,330
consider carefully

14
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,490
what value you hold,

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,720
and what leverage you have.

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,770
I have no leverage.

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,010
I'm merely a slave.

18
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,050
As a noble master,
you broke your promises

19
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,690
and made things hard for a slave.

20
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,760
What's your purpose?

21
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,490
You really don't want me
leaving the ship?

22
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,810
What's wrong?

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,690
Afraid of losing?

24
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,530
What else?

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,050
I want off the ship.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
You're that desperate to leave?

27
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,800
Getting off the ship is my chance.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,720
Fine,

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,120
I'll allow it.

30
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:21,970
But the others?

31
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,650
No, they cannot.

32
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,800
Do you ever feel

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,610
like you've walked right into a trap?

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,840
What trap could there be?

35
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,890
If it works, the convoy profits.

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
If it fails,

37
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,450
I'll get a chance to punish her.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,360
She was right.

39
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,330
You, a noble master,

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,280
why bother with a slave?

41
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,400
You think she's a slave, too?

42
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,450
What kind of slave
defies her master daily?

43
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,730
She just wants her mother's keepsake.

44
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,280
Since when

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,360
have you gone soft?

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,530
Haven't you noticed?

47
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,810
She's like you were when you first
ventured into Black Dragon Cave,

48
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,200
knowing nothing, helpless,

49
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,280
just driven by sheer will,

50
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,610
and risking everything.

51
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,280
That's why I was bloodied and beaten.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,050
Just like me,

53
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,610
you also clawed your way
out of that pit.

54
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,890
You know what that blood-stained pearl

55
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,360
represents.

56
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,730
I asked you to tell Master Zhang

57
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,170
if you were with me that day,

58
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,760
or saw Cui Ding.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,050
I haven't seen Cui Ding.

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,450
Duanwu, are you all right?

61
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,760
I'm free to leave now.

62
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,680
Then are you going

63
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,010
to sell that waste?

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,610
Right now, I can only try my hand at it,

65
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,290
though...

66
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,610
I still don't know

67
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,290
how to get that waste.

68
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,730
Eighteen cash a jin,

69
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,800
Mr. Cao must have pocketed a nice cut.

70
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,130
He won't make it easy for us.

71
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,050
What about Cao's superior,
Assistant Pang?

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,010
He manages sales.

73
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,610
He should have the authority, right?

74
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:49,200
He's in cahoots with Mr. Cao,
not exactly trustworthy.

75
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,640
Besides, we don't even know him,

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,200
and he's unlikely to trust us.

77
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,240
There's one other person

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,680
who truly cares about the convoy.

79
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,960
But I don't know if she'd help.

80
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,290
Um...

81
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,760
Duanwu, I can't hold it anymore.

82
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,450
I, Duanwu, a lower-deck slave, request
to see Accountant Wei.

83
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,290
If it's an issue, go find Mr. Cao.

84
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,360
This issue concerns the trading convoy.

85
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,610
Reporting with overstepping

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,890
will lead to punishment.

87
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,080
What if I suggest a potential oversight
in your accounts?

88
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,760
Please hear me out first,
and then punish me as you will.

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,170
Come in.

90
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,560
Greetings, Accountant Wei.

91
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,800
Speak. What account?

92
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,240
Accountant Wei,

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,440
this is waste from the trading convoy.

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,530
Mr. Cao currently sells it
at eighteen cash per jin.

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
But look, Accountant Wei,

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,530
within this waste,

97
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,480
if we extract all useful materials,

98
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
then refine it further,

99
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,480
it could

100
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,530
be sold to herbal shops

101
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,650
and used for medicinal ingredients.

102
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,210
Each batch could then earn
two extra cash.

103
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,000
Twenty cash per jin?

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,560
Correct.

105
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,770
Twenty cash.

106
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,680
A hundred jin only makes 2000 cash.

107
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,770
That's barely enough

108
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,050
for a day's meal for lower-deck slaves.

109
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,170
So, you're giving me a number breakdown?

110
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,480
But our convoy handles

111
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,170
a lot of jewelry,

112
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,880
and thus, lots of waste.

113
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,480
Accountant Wei, I've observed

114
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,730
the Master's shipments.

115
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,120
Each transfer produces
over two hundred jin of waste.

116
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,290
Conservatively,

117
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,440
at twenty cash per jin,

118
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,000
that gives us 4000 cash.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,360
I've been with the convoy
for two weeks now,

120
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,560
shipping at least three times already.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,090
That amounts to 12000 cash.

122
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,090
Calculate it...

123
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,920
three times a month,

124
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,410
and thirty-six times a year.

125
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,680
With thirty-six times,

126
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,000
it amounts to a total of...

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,530
It's 144,000 cash annually.

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,440
The convoy can easily handle

129
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,360
thirty shipments.

130
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,610
Our convoy's route from the West Regions
to the South Sea

131
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,210
passes various ports.

132
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,730
the Master purchases
and sells jewels each time.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,480
Recently, the Master held
the pearl auction,

134
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,610
boosting our convoy's reputation.

135
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,970
Given this,

136
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,000
there'll be large shipments.

137
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,530
You're sharp.

138
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:21,970
Are you saying

139
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,480
that I, Wei Yan,

140
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,090
overlooked this profit

141
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,090
under my own watch?

142
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,770
Not at all.

143
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,770
That's not my intention.

144
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,970
The accounts handled by you

145
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,090
are all major accounts.

146
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,560
This waste

147
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,850
is only known to us lower-deck slaves,

148
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,440
working with it daily.

149
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,050
Even adding

150
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,120
just 140,000 cash annually,

151
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,770
little by little,

152
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
over time,

153
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,730
it would accumulate significantly.

154
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,170
Isn't that right?

155
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,970
So, what are you hoping for with this?

156
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,240
I request permission from you

157
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,000
to handle the waste sales.

158
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,090
Accountant Wei.

159
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,920
She wants to sell the waste.
You two can discuss it yourselves.

160
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,780
Take a seat.

161
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,420
Assistant Pang,

162
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,180
I'm Duanwu, a slave from the lower deck.

163
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,420
The Master has permitted me

164
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,180
to get off and sell waste when docked.

165
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,330
From now on,

166
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,860
I'll be relying on your help,
Assistant Pang.

167
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,180
I see.

168
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,660
No problem. It's just waste anyway.

169
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,490
I recall

170
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,540
Mr. Cao handled it

171
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,060
at eighteen cash per jin before.

172
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,330
Since you're under
Accountant Wei's guidance,

173
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,130
let's make it sixteen cash

174
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,060
to help you open business.

175
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Thank you, Assistant Pang.

176
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,010
However,

177
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,180
considering it's all waste,

178
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,890
going back and forth is a hassle.

179
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:06,420
It's best to clear it all at once.

180
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,540
All at once?

181
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,010
Yes.

182
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:08,810
How much is there this time?

183
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,890
About two hundred jin, I believe.

184
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,100
Alright.

185
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,220
I see.

186
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,810
Can this really make money?

187
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,490
Duanwu, will the herbal shops buy it?

188
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,780
I'm not sure,

189
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,980
but I can give it a try.

190
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,740
There's a full two hundred jin here.

191
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,740
If we can sell it all,

192
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,570
it'll be a nice amount.

193
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,810
Duanwu, you're really impressive.

194
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,300
Barely here,
and you're already allowed off the ship

195
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,620
to sell waste!

196
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,370
This used to be something

197
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,890
only Mr. Cao could handle.

198
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,980
Duanwu's amazing, of course!

199
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,540
When she makes big money,

200
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,930
we'll get you loads of dried meat, Loud,

201
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,300
and medicine for your throat!

202
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,060
Dear Hu,

203
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,810
we'll buy you twenty dresses!

204
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,780
Twenty?

205
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,220
Dear Xiu,

206
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,100
we'll get you shoes

207
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,220
encrusted with pearls!

208
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,810
Pearl shoes?

209
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,090
We're rich!

210
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,090
We're rich!

211
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,260
What wealth?

212
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,610
From a distance,

213
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,020
I could hear all of you yelling here.

214
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,090
It's the middle of the night.

215
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,180
Isn't there any order in the lower deck?

216
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,970
Duanwu,

217
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,540
not bad at all.

218
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I hear

219
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,140
you're going to sell waste?

220
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,260
Mr. Cao.

221
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,780
I know,

222
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,970
you were handling this waste before,

223
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,930
and I appreciate your effort.

224
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,570
This time, I'll go for you.

225
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,690
Naturally, the money from the sale...

226
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,610
You're overthinking.

227
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,330
I never said that.

228
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,730
That's your imagination.

229
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,210
But about the money...

230
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,660
Oh, it's late.

231
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,540
All of you should head to bed.

232
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,810
Thank you, Mr. Cao.

233
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,570
Shrimp!

234
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,210
Cao's a greedy guy.

235
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,900
Clean this up.

236
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,090
You were coming to Lingnan.

237
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,540
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

238
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,690
We could've traveled together.

239
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,850
Senior Brother,

240
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,180
I had no idea you were in Guangzhou.

241
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,570
If I'd known,

242
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,730
I would've told you.

243
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,210
Here.

244
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,540
Junior Brother,

245
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,380
why exactly

246
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,450
did you come to Hepu?

247
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,020
The beauty of the South Sea pearls

248
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,970
is too tempting.

249
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,020
So, I wanted to see Hepu for myself.

250
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,690
But once I arrived,

251
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,060
do you know what I saw?

252
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,210
Just pearl divers

253
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,810
leaping out of the water
to escape man-eating sharks.

254
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,850
At the pearl auction,

255
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,900
esteemed guests abound,

256
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,570
yet it's built on the blood and tears
of countless pearl divers.

257
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,140
I understand how you feel.

258
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,450
But,

259
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,660
The hardships of pearl diving

260
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,420
have always been this way.

261
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,810
We don't control that.

262
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,140
But before, the pearls

263
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,260
were for tributes.

264
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,090
Now look at the Cui's Pearl Farm,

265
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,210
they are recklessly abusing the divers,

266
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,330
treating lives like they're worthless.

267
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,500
Worse still...

268
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,690
Even worse than that?

269
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,690
Junior Brother,

270
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,380
don't hold back.

271
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,260
Just say it.

272
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,330
If what you say
about the Cui's Pearl Farm

273
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,660
is true,

274
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,900
I'll make sure
they don't get away with it.

275
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,570
On the second night
of the pearl auction,

276
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,210
the Pearl Tower burned down.

277
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,420
Peng Wu, a merchant from Chang'an,

278
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,450
died inside.

279
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,090
Cui Ding fled with the funds,

280
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,060
and his body was later found
in Guangzhou.

281
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,610
Peng Wu is dead?

282
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,450
Cui Ding fled with the funds?

283
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,140
The burning of Pearl Tower has caused

284
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,300
a huge stir in Hepu.

285
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,330
Cui Ding's body

286
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,930
is still at the Guangzhou prefecture.

287
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,660
You didn't know?

288
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,420
I was indeed careless.

289
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,020
Senior Brother,

290
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,570
do you know those two?

291
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,850
Regardless of my acquaintance,

292
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,210
if Cui's Pearl Farm did such evils,

293
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,260
as an upright official,

294
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:25,690
I won't let them get away!

295
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,260
Since you're involved,

296
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,380
I can rest assured.

297
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,330
As long as I'm here,

298
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,330
I won't let those villains

299
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,900
run wild in this just world!

300
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:40,730
Here.

301
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,210
Just leave it to me.

302
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,020
This drink is for you, Senior Brother!

303
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,850
Master, the guest has left.

304
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,140
Do you think my junior

305
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,900
has already set his sights on me?

306
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,570
Master, you've always been cautious,

307
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,500
leaving no trace.

308
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,730
Besides, Peng Wu and Cui Ding are dead.

309
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,450
Zhang Jinran

310
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,210
surely won't find proof.

311
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,380
You don't know my junior brother.

312
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,330
Once he's set on something,

313
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,930
he won't easily let it go.

314
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,210
Otherwise,

315
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,380
why would Prince Ying send him to Hepu?

316
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,420
Prince Ying...

317
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,570
Could it be over Prince Tan?

318
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,610
Cutting off trade is minor,

319
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,540
but if we're exposed,

320
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:56,930
we might

321
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,210
meet a fate worse than Cui Ding.

322
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,730
Master, Lady Shijiu sent an invitation,

323
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,140
requesting a meeting tomorrow.

324
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,140
Why does she keep pestering?

325
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
Tell her I won't meet her!

326
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:13,930
Yes, sir.

327
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,180
Special Envoy Xu refused
your invitation.

328
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,810
He's eager to distance himself,

329
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,660
not to investigate someone,

330
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,020
but afraid of being investigated.

331
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,210
It seems we'll have to find a way

332
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,970
to handle the tribute pearls ourselves.

333
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,140
Go, contact the Guangzhou banks,

334
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,090
gather all available silver.

335
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,660
Contact every jewelry shop here.

336
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,930
We need to buy pearls.

337
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,380
No matter the cost,

338
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,380
bring back every last one

339
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,260
they have in reserve.

340
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,570
Yes, sir.

341
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,570
Cui Jia.

342
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,810
Master Shijiu.

343
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,020
You said at the pearl auction,

344
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,210
Zhang Jinran and Yan Zijing

345
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,330
bid against each other
over a mere pearl diver?

346
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:10,450
Indeed.

347
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,570
Mr. Peng said

348
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,500
Yan Zijing

349
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,020
met Zhang Jinran on the ship.

350
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,380
Seeing Zhang as a poor scholar,

351
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,330
unworldly,

352
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,780
Yan brought Zhang along.

353
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,850
He can spend gold willow leaf
at an auction.

354
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,660
You call him a "poor scholar"?

355
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,420
He's the fourth son of Minister Zhang,

356
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,450
and a companion to the Emperor.

357
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,330
You call him a "poor scholar"?

358
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,450
Their meeting can't be a coincidence.

359
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Investigate for me.

360
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,090
Find out who Yan Zijing truly is.

361
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:51,570
Understood.

362
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,810
[Fushu Port]

363
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,450
Come on, unload the goods!

364
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,330
Take it slow.

365
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,500
Duanwu,

366
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,300
should I try asking
Supervisor Kang again?

367
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,570
I'll go with you.

368
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,970
You can't carry this load alone.

369
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,690
No need.

370
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,020
Don't worry. I got this.

371
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,060
Duanwu,

372
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,450
this batch is top quality.

373
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,420
It might even be sold
for twenty cash a jin!

374
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,660
We'll be rich then!

375
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,330
Keep your voice down.

376
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,660
Rich or not,

377
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,090
let's wait until I actually sell it.

378
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,570
But I promise,

379
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,660
I'll give it my best.

380
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,260
I believe in you, Duanwu.

381
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,210
You can do it.

382
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,500
Shrimp, tell me,

383
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,020
is it really like you said,

384
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,540
just bring the goods
to a herbal shop door,

385
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,810
let them inspect, and that's it?

386
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,850
My third uncle used to do it this way.

387
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,610
If one shop doesn't want it,
go to the next.

388
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,020
This batch has been sold!

389
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,210
Someone's bound to want them.

390
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,060
Duanwu,

391
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,450
if he can do it, so can you!

392
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:51,730
I'm off.

393
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,300
Hurry up, keep moving!

394
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:00,900
Thanks for your hard work!

395
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,450
You can't go ashore.

396
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,810
I know, Mr. Cao,

397
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,450
but I'm not on land, am I?

398
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,690
Look, is this shore?

399
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,210
Get on the ship, you brat.

400
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,060
Shrimp.

401
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,180
I'll bring you some treats back!

402
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,300
Got it, Duanwu!

403
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,690
Safe travels, Duanwu.

404
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,260
May business be booming!

405
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:29,970
Foolish.

406
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,090
At least she's bold.

407
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,130
Bold and foolish.

408
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,740
Do you know the consequences?

409
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,850
A quick death.

410
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,980
And what about a nasty one
with a sharp tongue?

411
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,090
Then he'd live a thousand years.

412
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,500
We should get off too.

413
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:50,890
What for?

414
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,650
Every place has its own boss.

415
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,780
We're making money on their turf.

416
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,980
So we should pay our respects
to the head of Guangzhou's guild.

417
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,330
Take it slow.

418
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,460
Take your time, sir.

419
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,260
Take care.

420
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,850
Pardon me.

421
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,810
See you.

422
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,650
Sir.

423
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,300
Sir.

424
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,410
I have jewelry scraps,

425
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,650
including lapis, mica...

426
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,330
all available for inspection.

427
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:08,890
Take a look.

428
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,130
What shop are you with?

429
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:11,980
Yan's Trading Convoy.

430
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,540
I never heard of it.

431
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,060
Move along.

432
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,260
Yan's Trading Convoy came from the West,

433
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,370
and we recently bought
a large batch of pearls

434
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,940
from Cui's in Hepu.

435
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,220
Our goods are guaranteed good quality.

436
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,500
I can show you.

437
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,300
Miss,

438
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,570
this is a herbal shop,
and we deal in medicine.

439
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:27,780
I can't take such a risk.

440
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,570
Understood.

441
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,980
But I assure you,
our quality is top-notch.

442
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,700
Just take a look, you'll see.

443
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,570
Even with our century-old legacy,

444
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,810
we can't afford the risk
of selling fakes.

445
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,610
No way. How could it be fake?

446
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:40,980
Give me the lowest price.

447
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,500
I guarantee.

448
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,300
Just give me the lowest price
you offered before.

449
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,260
How about it?

450
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,300
Then let me ask you,

451
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,610
once you sell this load,
where will you go?

452
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,410
What about this? Take a look.

453
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:54,850
I don't know.

454
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,780
And if there's an issue with the goods,

455
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,850
who do I go to? Where would I find you?

456
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,940
There can't be an issue, sir.

457
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,330
Really, see for yourself.

458
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,650
Our shop already

459
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,260
has its own suppliers.

460
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,500
If I buy your load,

461
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
when they deliver their goods,

462
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,090
how would I explain it?

463
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,300
Miss, you'd better move along.

464
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,300
Wait, sir...

465
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,370
Leave, hurry up!

466
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,540
We told you, we can't do this deal.

467
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:19,940
I'll leave right away.

468
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,890
Go on, quickly now.

469
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,740
Move along.

470
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
We're not doing this business.

471
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,980
Wait...

472
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,460
We're not doing this business.
Now, leave!

473
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,700
[Baifu Hall]
Move along!

474
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,540
Honestly. Don't come back here!

475
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:36,780
Sir, come on in!

476
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,130
This way!

477
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,570
Trinkets here, take a look!

478
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,610
Sachets, charms, small items here!

479
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,300
[Prosperity in Business]
I didn't expect the head of the jewelry guild here

480
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,260
to be such a young master.

481
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,570
My apologies and respects.

482
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,220
Your Pearl Poetry Gathering
gained fame overnight.

483
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,460
I'm deeply impressed.

484
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,330
You flatter me.

485
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,020
Please, appraise these jewels for me.

486
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:22,170
What...

487
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,650
not interested in Lingnan pearls?

488
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:25,570
Not at all.

489
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,410
But as the head of the guild,

490
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,570
you must know

491
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,410
that rarity drives value.

492
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,060
Merchants all know

493
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,570
the more, the cheaper.

494
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,810
Everyone hopes, of course,

495
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,650
to stock rare goods to sell.

496
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,330
Lingnan pearl ornaments

497
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,220
are famous far and wide.

498
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,020
But over the years,

499
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,260
imitators abound,

500
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,890
with similar designs everywhere.

501
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,460
To keep customers,

502
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,890
each guild

503
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,570
has had to lower prices.

504
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,220
This competition

505
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,980
is inevitable.

506
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,850
But our craftsmanship,

507
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,460
especially the quality of our pearls,

508
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,810
is top-notch.

509
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,090
How could they compare

510
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,260
with mere imitators?

511
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,610
We both know

512
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,130
that exhausting fortunes
to battle imitators

513
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:10,850
isn't sustainable.

514
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,170
Besides,

515
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,220
Hepu's pearl farm is now destroyed.

516
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,460
In three months, there'll be no supply.

517
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,940
When that time comes,

518
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,650
what will you all do?

519
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,890
Yes, what can we do then?

520
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,500
We can't eat through our fortune.

521
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,060
Master Yan, with your insight,

522
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,260
you've uncovered the truth.

523
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,780
Please, enlighten us.

524
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,940
These are colored stones

525
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,170
my master brought from the West.

526
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,980
Please, take a look.

527
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,650
Truly, Master Yan,

528
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,980
these are rare treasures.

529
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,850
I'm amazed.

530
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,610
These here

531
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,940
are gifts for everyone.

532
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,810
In giving such precious gifts,

533
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,650
I wonder, Master Yan,

534
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,940
what you seek in return?

535
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,540
I seek mutual prosperity

536
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,220
and wealth through harmony.

537
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:30,650
Within three months,

538
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,650
I'm willing to bring

into the Guangzhou's jewelry industry,

541
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,570
becoming the first
to do colored stone business here.

542
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,700
We'll provide the raw stones

543
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,650
and the techniques.

544
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,570
Guangzhou's jewelry guild

and manage the sales.

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,460
What's the profit split?

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,330
Seventy-thirty.

549
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,700
Master Yan, you drive a hard bargain.

550
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,780
I believe you'd rather

00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,740
not eat through your fortune.

552
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,500
We can promise your guild

553
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,060
exclusivity in Guangzhou,

554
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,410

as the only
Western Regions colored stone supplier.

556
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:14,740
Fine,

557
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,370
I accept your terms.

558
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,130
But I have one more request.

559
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,980
My mother

560
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,300
dearly loved Hepu's South Sea pearls.

Her death anniversary is in a few days.

562
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,330
I hope you can gather
some pearls for me.

563
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:27,700
Of course,

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,500
only the best.

565
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,850
Rest assured, Master Yan.

566

573
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,980
Miss,

574
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,130
I've seen you pushing this cart

575
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:21,980
around the streets all afternoon.

576
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,330
Are you selling something?

577
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,370
These are scraps
from our trading convoy,

578
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,570
including mica, lapis, all kinds.

579
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,570
Local herbal shops won't buy

580
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,060
from traveling merchants.

It's tough to sell this way.

585

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,370
I can offer you some advice.

587

I have channels to help you sell.

But, I'll need a commission.

Oh, I just remembered,

what's your price?

621
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,170
Will twenty-five cash a jin do?

622
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,460
How about twenty-three?

623
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,130
Let's settle at twenty-four a jin.

and trusting others too easily,

00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,410
Continue as a slave.

753
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,980
A nobody deserves only to be trampled.

754
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,370
Master,

755
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,610
may I have a chance to redeem myself?

756
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,410
Still unwilling to yield?

757
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,570
Please, Master, give me one chance.

758
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,570
And if you fail again?

759
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,130
If I fail,

760
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,570
you may do as you wish.

761
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,170
Fine.

762
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,130
Complete your task

763
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,850
by tomorrow afternoon.

764
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,740
What are you going to do?

765
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,850
Where's Wu Xiang?

766
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,810
What are you talking about?
I don't know...

767
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,980
Where's Wu Xiang?

768
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,020
I'll tell you, Mr. Cao,

769
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,260
if I fail, I'll die for it.

770
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,090
And before I die,
I'll take someone with me.

771
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,740
I'll tell you...

772
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,650
He's at... the Sanqi Garden.

773
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,570
[Sanqi Garden]

774
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,330
What a fool girl.

775
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,500
Stop...

776
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,370
Are you Wu Xiang or Master Wu?

777
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,890
Xiang.

778
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:24,740
Where are my scraps?

779
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,610
Sold.

780
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,540
Where's the money?

781
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,540
I... lost it all.

782
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,740
Don't...

783
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,740
I have it...

784
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,690
I sold them for 4000 cash.
The money is all here.

785
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,770
My goodness...

786
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,130
Are you here looking for me?

787
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:24,980
Assistant Pang.

788
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,900
This is...

789
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,610
Two hundred jin of scraps,

790
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,900
as previously agreed,

791
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,020
I bought them from you
at sixteen cash a jin.

792
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,460
They were sold for 4000 cash.

793
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,770
You actually brought the money back.

794
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:36,250
This little slave is truly something!

795
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,860
Four thousand cash...

796
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,170
Here are 3200 cash.

797
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:43,570
I'll take the excess.

798
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,420
It's my share.

799
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,130
You got the accounting all sorted out.

800
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,690
You've got potential!

801
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:05,900
What's wrong?

802
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,130
We got it wrong?

803
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,610
No. Assistant Pang's figures

804
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,380
can't be off.

805
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,130
They let a sure thing slip away!

806
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,090
Move it along.

807
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,380
You're slow as molasses!

808
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,380
I got the money back.

809
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,690
Wu Xiang's tied up at Sanqi Garden.

810
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,170
Want me to bring him in?

811
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,900
What you said before...

812
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,020
My words count more than yours.

813
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,420
But I'm just a small slave.

814
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,900
I'll still need Mr. Cao's guidance

815
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,460
here on the ship.

816
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
Name your terms.

817
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,420
Letting slaves ashore.

818
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,610
Absurd...

819
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,170
Do you know how many slaves
are on this ship?

820
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,090
If they were all ashore,

821
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,770
the Master would have my head.

822
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,090
Seventy-eight slaves on board,

823
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,570
divided into three shifts.

824
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,570
Registered each time they get off,

825
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,940
and watch one another.

826
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,690
The Master is merciful.

827
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,210
He provides good food and shelter.

828
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,130
The slaves outside

829
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,130
have no papers, no means to survive.

830
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,020
Why wouldn't they return?

831
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,690
You're thorough in your planning.

832
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,210
Your choice.

833
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,170
But remember,

834
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,380
after all that scheming to rise up,

835
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,420
don't let Wu Xiang trip you up.

836
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,340
I...

837
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,860
Dad,

838
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:18,770
when will we reach the State of Kang?

839
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,690
First by water,

840
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,730
then by land,

841
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,860
still a long way to go.

842
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,210
Mom,

843
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,690
when will we return to Yangzhou?

844
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,420
Likely in October.

845
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,060
By then,

846
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,020
my little sister will have grown up.

847
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,770
That's right.

848
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:34,770
Then from then on,

849
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,610
we can bring her with us wherever we go.

850
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,380
Of course.

851
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,540
From then on, she'll be always with us.

852
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,770
Our family

853
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:42,940
will always stay together.

854
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,340
Master,

855
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,090
I've gotten the money.

856
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,540
Tomorrow, report to Accountant Wei
for punishment.

857
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:10,770
This month,

858
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,460
half of your wages are cut.

859
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,170
I took the lashes,

860
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,130
and I got the money back.

861
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,500
Why still take punishment?

862
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,730
You broke the rules.

863
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,170
Shouldn't you be punished?

864
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,020
But I was set up.

865
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,210
You already knew that?

866
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,340
So what?

867
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,340
Is there fairness
in Yan's Trading Convoy?

868
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,060
This began with you taking

869
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,460
Mr. Cao's business by force.

870
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,940
Besides,

871
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,570
your recklessness

872
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,420
nearly hurt the convoy.

873
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,860
Are you not at fault?

874
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,020
Shouldn't you be punished?

875
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:51,380
So, for Mr. Cao,

876
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,610
he's neither punished

877
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,060
nor scolded?

878
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,860
We just let it slide?

879
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,770
In Yan's Trading Convoy, the rule is:

880
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,730
everyone does their duty,
and everything serves its purpose.

881
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,250
Mr. Cao may be vile,

882
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,770
but if he gets his job done,

883
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,250
I'll use him.

884
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,940
And as for fairness,

885
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,900
if you want it,

886
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,980
you'd better start thinking

887
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,940
about making yourself useful.

888
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,570
Then,

889
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,380
you'll have the right
to talk about fairness.

890
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:20,860
This

891
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,730
is the rule of the world.

892
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,130
Everything serves its purpose,

893
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,210
and everyone does their duty...
