[Episode 7]

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,550
So much money!

13
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,440
Don't speak.

14
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,160
However,

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,910
this Sea God Festival's treasure pool
is filled with hidden swords.

16
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,550
Danger lurks everywhere.

17
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,110
It's a matter of life and death.

18
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,640
Anyone volunteering to go first?

19
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,270
Anyone willing to step up?

20
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
If no one goes forward,

21
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,830
then we'll draw lots.

22
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,520
Whoever draws the red lot

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
will be the one to go.

24
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,110
Who will draw first?

25
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,480
Assistant Pang,

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,670
I heard Duanwu used to dive for pearls.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,390
She must be a good swimmer.

28
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,870
Why don't we let her go first?

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
Good swimmer?

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
Duanwu, why don't you draw first?

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Please.

32
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,590
Sister...

33
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,550
Congratulations!

34
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,110
Reporting to Master,
Duanwu drew the red lot.

35
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,150
Why are they all red lots?

36
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,760
You're trying to set us up, aren't you?

37
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,960
You're tricking us, deceiving my sister!

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,240
I really didn't know!

39
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,640
I had no idea!

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,040
Mr. Cao,

41
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,710
Leave!

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,920
Yes.

43
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,660
It doesn't count.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,840
We'll draw again.

45
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,940
Master,

46
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,430
I'll go.

47
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,590
You?

48
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,760
Today, we have to send someone.

49
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm a good swimmer.

50
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,110
I'll go.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,990
Fine. My trading convoy

52
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,430
always rewards courage and loyalty.

53
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,360
Since you volunteered,

54
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,670
your bravery is admirable.

55
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,870
If you win the competition,

56
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,430
I'll give you an extra million.

57
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,960
If I win the Treasure Hunt,

58
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,830
could you officially allow me
to join Yan's Trading Convoy?

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,110
Deal.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,240
If you win the Treasure Hunt,

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,550
I'll let you join the convoy.

62

Thank you, Master.

63
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,590
Master, any instructions?

64
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,080
During tomorrow's competition,

65
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,390
wear this.

66
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,230
What's special about it?

67
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,270
It'll keep you from dying in the water.

68
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,200
My life or death...

69
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,520
does it matter?

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,350
It doesn't.

71
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,560
But you must succeed in the hunt.

72
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,440
Understood.

73
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,710
But don't worry, Master.

74
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,150
I've done this since I was young.

75
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,200
Tomorrow's situation
will be unusually dangerous.

76
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,560
Can I raise the price further?

77
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,590
No.

78
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,880
I know my life is worthless,

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,470
but your jewels are valuable.

80
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,440
Don't I deserve a better price?

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,270
They are, but you have no choice.

82
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,000
In truth, if you give up
on the blood-stained pearl now,

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
you could walk away

84
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,830
and wouldn't need
to wade into this mess.

85
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,080
If I don't get the pearl back,

86
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,000
I won't find my father.

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,120
Enough.

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,830
Go now.

89
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,350

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,470

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,790

Hold on!

123
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,270
The Sea Festival is a local tradition,

124
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,390
passed down for over a century.

125
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,470
Its purpose is to bring blessings

126
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,080
and a bountiful harvest to all.

127
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,110
Such brutality now

128
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,710
goes against its original intent.

129
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,280
As the Special Envoy of Treasures,

130
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,160
I absolutely forbid such cruelty

131

132
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,510
Therefore, I propose

133
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,510
we move this contest to the shore.

134
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,990
Let each team compete,

135
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,920
and just determine the winner.

Yan Zijing, what are you aiming for?

144
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,230
Victory.

145
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,630
But Duanwu is innocent!

146
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,920
No one is innocent.

147
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,350
Mr. Zhang,
you have a heart to save others

148
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,510
but lacks the power to do so.

149
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,710
It's because you've never known

150
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,510
the suffering of this world.

151
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,160
This world suffers
because of people like you.

152
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,750
That's why there's hardship.

153
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,470
I said no one is innocent.

154
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,960
Don't worry.

155
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
She won't die.

156
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,680
My junior brother

157
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,160
seems to care quite a bit

158
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,280
for that pearl diver.

159
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,040
For that pearl diver,

160
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,280
he spent a fortune at the pearl auction
to cheer her on.

161
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,080
Then he even revealed his identity
with the gold willow leaf.

162
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,200
He's young yet

163
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,510
and needs more tempering.

164
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,510
He has some attachments.

165
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,590
That's easier to manage.

166
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,870
Duanwu!

167
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,110
Duanwu!

168
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,870
I'll take her away.

169
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,510
The servants are after the treasure,

170
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,710
and Master Yan,
you intervened personally.

171
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,990
What's your purpose?

172
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,040
This is what you meant
by "just determine the winner"?

173
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,590
I thought this Treasure Hunt,

174
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,560
was supposed to be a sincere ritual

175
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,870
for the well-being of the people.

176
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,990
Otherwise, I would never

177
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,680
have offered my priceless emerald.

178
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,870
But I didn't expect

179
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,040
that the Sea Festival rules
could change at will,

180
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,320
or that some people would use
such low tactics

181
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,920
to turn a holy ritual

182
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,440
into a violent struggle.

183
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,590
The Sea God Festival's Treasure Hunt
has long been a tradition.

184
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,040
Whether it's held in the sea or onshore

185
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,680
is merely a matter of form.

186
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,920
When Special Envoy Xu announced
the rules earlier,

187
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,590
I didn't hear you object.

188
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,440
Now that you've lost, you argue.

189
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,870
My servant

190
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,590
claimed the treasure
just as the incense burned out.

191
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,230
The Cui family is victorious.

192
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,080
Yan's Trading Convoy operates worldwide

193
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,160
on a foundation of honesty.

194
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,320
Reputation is what we value.

195
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,470
Today, I lost.

196
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,710
I accept that.

197
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,440
Master Yan, don't forget

198
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,160
the promise we made.

199
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,870
Now that I've won this Treasure Hunt,

200
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,440
you must give up

201
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,750
the pearl procurement rights in Lingnan.

202
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,470
You're a man of your word.

203
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,710
You won't go back on it, will you?

204
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,590
Naturally, I won't.

205
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,870
Everyone,

206
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,680
today, the Cui family has won.

207
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
We will prepare the ritual offerings

208
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,870
to honor
the Temple of the South Sea God,

209
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,710
praying for favorable winds and rain,

210
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,470
and safe journeys for all traders.

211
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,040
This is all I can do.

212
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,870
What comes next is up to you.

213
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,160
We'll need more help from you.

214
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,680
Yan Zijing is just a merchant,

215
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,920
hardly a real threat.

216
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,080
I've taken care of your biggest worry.

217
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,990
And you?

218
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,830
Rest assured, Special Envoy Xu.

219
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,800
Zhang Jinran is here without protection.

220
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,830
He likely won't leave Guangzhou
in one piece.

221
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,960
Whether he can leave Guangzhou or not
is not my concern.

222
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,440
Prince Tan's birthday banquet
is approaching,

223
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,800
and regarding the Pearl Lotus Terrace...

224
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,350
Do I need to remind you?

225
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,800
Understood.

226
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,630
Let's go.

227
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,940
[Hefu Hall]

228
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,630
You're awake, Duanwu.

229
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,630
Feeling any better?

230
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,400
Here,

231
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,990
take this medicine first.

232
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,120
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

233
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,120
Feeling better?

234
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,360
Mr. Zhang, where is this place?

235
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,200
This is the medical hall.

236
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,960
The doctor just said,

237
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,510
you had some old injuries from before,

238
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,400
and the Treasure Hunt added
a few new ones.

239
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,310
Fortunately,

240
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,270
you were wearing this soft armor,

241
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,750
which saved your life.

242
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,790
You must rest well from now on,

243
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,030
or these injuries could become chronic.

244
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,160
Duanwu,

245
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,120
A female doctor treated you.

246
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,750
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

247
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,600
Duanwu,

248
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,880
I won't ask

249
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,200
why you helped Yan Zijing
with the Treasure Hunt.

250
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,160
I only know
you can't treat yourself like this,

251
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,400
risking your life recklessly.

252
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,750
At this point,

253
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,550
I can't give up any opportunity.

254
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,710
I chose to join the Treasure Hunt.

255
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,070
But what kind of opportunity is this?

256
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,200
What opportunity
is worth risking your life?

257
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
What's the difference between this
and diving for pearls?

258
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,990
Staying close to Yan Zijing
isn't the only future for you.

259
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,360
How can you get blood

260
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,600
from a stone?

261
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,750
I'll tell you the truth.

262
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,440
Yan Zijing sent you to the Treasure Hunt

263
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,440
merely to settle a bet with Cui Shijiu.

264
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,400
All he wants

265
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,990
is to control all the pearls
in Guangzhou.

266
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,750
But he lost this time.

267
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,160
Come with me to Chang'an.

268
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,070
The Directorate of Construction there
has the finest skills of the Tang.

269
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,880
Here's my letter
of recommendation for you.

270
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,200
There,

271
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,680
you could learn a craft
to support yourself.

272
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,160
If I go with you to Chang'an,

273
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
wouldn't that mean

274
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,960
I'd be even further from my freedom?

275
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,790
Mr. Zhang,

276
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,990
I lost the Treasure Hunt.

277
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,920
But I've already brought my partner
into the Mirage.

278
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,880
There's no way I can simply leave.

279
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,440
You have been so kind to me,

280
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,750
so kind

281
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,960
that I dare not accept it.

282
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,200
But one day, if I'm able

283
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,790
and find a way to repay your kindness,

284
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,550
I'll surely return the favor.

285
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,880
Alright.

286
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,990
Then I'll wait.

287
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,440
But for now,

288
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,960
you should accept this kindness

289
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,790
as a way

290
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,790
to leave yourself an escape.

291
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,710
I'll wait outside for you.

292
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,200
I'll take you back later.

293

Pull the strings downward.

297

Watch your hand's movement.

298
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Enough.

299
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,070
Take a break.

300
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,030
Once we successfully

301
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,750
deliver the Apsaras statue tribute
for the State of Yan,

302
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,960
not just Yangzhou's jewelry guild,

303
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,440
but the entire jewelry industry

304
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,840
will look to the Yan family.

305
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,310
Kill them all!

306
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,270
Protect the statue!

307
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,120
Yes, sir!

308
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,840
Leave no one alive. Kill them!

309
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,230
Go!

310
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,160
Alright!

311
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,750
Quick, go!

312
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,640
Move!

313
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,360
Take Zijing and go first!

314
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,400
Let's leave together!

315
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,160
No, go now!

316
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:16,960

Go!

322
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:24,960

328
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,440
Are some things too hard to forget?

329
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Why force yourself to remember?

330
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,030
If I forget even this,

331
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,510
then what's the point of living?

332
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,640
Your mother barely escaped with you,

333
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,840
only to be intercepted by Cui Ding.

334
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,640
But their deaths

335
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,470
were meant to give you a chance
to live well.

336
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,400
Only when I've avenged them

337
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,840
can I truly live in peace.

338
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,600
Here.

339
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,960
Treasure Hunt is naturally dangerous.

340
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,960
Putting all your trust
in one young girl,

341
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,070
you should've anticipated the risk.

342
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,470
Are you saying

343
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,400
I've staked everything this time?

344
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,440
You always keep a backup plan.

345
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,920
But what if I told you

346
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,160
that this time,
I really have no fallback,

347
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,200
that I truly staked it all?

348
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,230
Master, Mr. Zhang escorted Duanwu
back to the ship.

349
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,990
Mr. Zhang, thank you for today.

350
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,070
[Fuxu Port]
I'll head back now.

351
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,120
You're unwell.

352
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,440
Let me escort you up.

353
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,510
No need. I can manage.

354
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,070
It's fine.

355
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,840
Let's go.

356
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,710
Oh, Mr. Zhang's here.

357
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,200
You're truly considerate, huh?

358
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,990
Escorting my servant girl to the doctor

359
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,200
and even bringing her back.

360
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,790
I'm humbled by your courtesy.

361
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,120
Is this what you call

362
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,790
"humbled"?

363
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,920
I only just recognized you.

364
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,230
Besides, boarding the ship
at this late hour,

365
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,030
who knows if it's friend or foe?

366
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:58,440
What if it were someone
coming aboard to steal?

367
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,270
Duanwu.

368
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,470
Mr. Zhang, my apologies.

369
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
I'll take my leave now.

370
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,360
Thank you for today.

371
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,160
This is a peace token
granted by His Majesty.

372
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,750
Wear it day and night,

373
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,270
it will ensure your safety.

374
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,230
I don't need it.

375
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,070
Wear it.

376
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,230
Mr. Zhang, I truly cannot accept it.

377
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:29,710
Take it.

378
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,120
I really shouldn't.

379
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,200
Duanwu!

380
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,510
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

381
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,160
I'll be fine.

382
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,310
Three, two,

383
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:51,120
one.

384
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,160
Master.

385
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,400
What?

386
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:58,990
Are you scared?

387
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,960
Mr. Zhang only brought me back
out of kindness.

388
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,200
Have you forgotten your days
at the pearl farm?

389
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,440
There aren't that many
kind-hearted people in this world.

390
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,510
Mr. Zhang is a good man.

391
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,990
So I'm the bad one?

392
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,270
Do you know what punishment awaits you

393
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,440
for losing the Treasure Hunt?

394
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,270
I believe if you're willing,

395
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,030
Mr. Zhang would take you away.

396
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,470
I won't go with him.

397
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,920
All for the blood-stained pearl?

398
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,470
The ransom is only three million.

399
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,510
Mr. Zhang could cover that
with just a gold willow leaf.

400
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,920
I can get the pearl back myself,

401
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,070
without anyone's help.

402
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,510
Then I'll punish you.

403
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,470
Will you accept it?

404
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,200
I'll accept it.

405
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,960
Come in.

406
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,550
Mr. Zhang asked me to treat you kindly,

407
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,120
and I'll give him that respect.

408
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,750
So I'm giving you two choices.

409
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,120
The first,

410
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,400
from now on,

411
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,790
you'll have nothing to do
with trading convoy business.

412
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,840
You'll come to the upper deck
to serve as my attendant,

413
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,640
serving only me alone.

414
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,990
Naturally, forget
about ever getting the pearl back.

415
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,400
Fine.

416
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,710
I'll take the second.

417
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,070
You'll be lashed twenty times

418
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,600
and sent back to the lower deck.

419
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,400
If you want to rise in the convoy,

420
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,270
you'll have to climb step by step.

421
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,230
I accept the punishment.

422
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,840
Kang Ju,

423
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,360
do it.

424
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,120
Master,

425
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,880
the punishment is decided.

426
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,510
Then,

427
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,310
what will you reward me with?

428
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,880
Why would I reward you?

429
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,680
I accept that I lost the Treasure Hunt,

430
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,360
but through my desperate effort,

431
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
I earned fame for Yan's Trading Convoy.

432
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,790
Don't I deserve a reward?

433
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,440
This time, Western colored jewels

434
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,750
have made a grand impression
before all Guangzhou merchants.

435
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,160
This jewelry market

436
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,230
should bring in a good profit.

437
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,440
How do you know that?

438
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,840
When I boarded just now,

439
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,510
I saw with my own eyes

440
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,840
that the servants were moving goods
in and out of the ship.

441
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,840
That's when I realized,

442
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,360
congratulations, Master,

443
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,070
the stock has been cleared out,

444
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,550
and new goods have arrived.

445
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,470
You think you're so clever, huh?

446
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,440
I had already signed a contract
with Guangzhou's guild lead.

447
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,360
This campaign

448
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,160
was merely
to speed up the sales process.

449
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
But don't forget,

450
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,120
you cost me

451
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,840
the right to purchase all the pearls
in Guangzhou.

452
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,710
Yan's Trading Convoy can't buy pearls,

453
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,120
but what about other merchants?

454
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,160
Previously, we sold coral pearls
to Zhuobao House.

455
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,270
Could we

456
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,960
have Zhuobao House procure pearls
on our behalf?

457
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,160
With so many businesses in Guangzhou,

458
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,640
why Zhuobao House?

459
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,160
Zhuobao House
is Guangzhou's largest jewelry house.

460
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,550
And I heard

461
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,550
Feng's Jewelry and the Guangzhou Guild

462
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,230
have some subtle ties.

463
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,160
Feng's Jewelry never works
with local merchants.

464
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,880
They have their own system.

465
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,680
But with a century-old reputation,

466
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,920
no one dares to interfere.

467
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,680
You had long been planning this move,

468
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,600
intending to sell coral pearls
to Zhuobao House

469
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,310
and establish ties with them.

470
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,550
It's just that Mr. Cao failed
to handle it.

471
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,030
By accident,

472
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,600
I made it. Isn't that right?

473
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,680
So what makes you think

474
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,840
Zhuobao House will definitely help us?

475
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,880
I know Lady Wu of Zhuobao House.

476
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,120
I can ask her.

477
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,310
All your dealings with her
are just minor trades.

478
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,440
Will she help you?

479
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,270
Through the coral pearl collaboration,

480
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,600
she considers me a friend.

481
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,030
I trust she'll help me.

482
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,710
Even blood relatives keep
clear accounts.

483
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,640
Haven't you been tricked enough?

484
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,310
Lady Wu isn't like that.

485
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,120
I want all the pearls in Guangzhou.

486
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,880
Understood.

487
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,440
Not a single one will be missing.

488
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,710
But I'll need an advance
from you, Master.

489
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,840
Once Zhuobao House places a deposit,

490
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
we'll monopolize all the pearls
in Guangzhou.

491
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,470
When Cui Shijiu scrambles
to gather tribute pearls,

492
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,030
she'll have to buy from you at any cost.

493
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,230
I won't sell her a single one.

494
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,920
So...

495
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,640
about the cooperation
with Zhuobao House,

496
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,840
is it feasible?

497
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
It's feasible.

498
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,230
Could I have a clear title?

499
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,400
Sure.

500
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,960
I'll bring Shrimp along with me.

501
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,750
Approved.

502
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,920
Then the deposit...

503
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,360
Go ask Accountant Wei for it.

504
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,070
I should ask Accountant Wei?

505
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,840
How would she ever give it to me?

506
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,200
Then use your head.

507
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,200
Anything else?

508
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,310
Master,

509
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,790
about those twenty lashes...

510
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,270
can they be postponed?

511
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,120
They can.

512
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,790
But if you don't accomplish this task,

513
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,160
you'll receive double punishment.

514
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,400
Off you go.

515
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,790
Having Zhuobao House
procure pearls for you

516
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,440
is your backup plan?

517
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,960
Take a guess.

518
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,440
I won't guess.

519
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,530
Whether I'm right or wrong,
it won't end well.

520
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,680
This Duanwu...

521
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,230
is becoming more and more like you.

522
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,190
Sister, you're finally back!

523
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,920
Shh.

524
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,070
You worried us to death!

525
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,190
I'm fine. Why aren't you asleep yet?

526
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,590
Sister,

527
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,760
are you really okay?

528
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,070
Let me see.

529
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,320
I'm truly fine.

530
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,040
You saw through their schemes.

531
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,160
Why did you still agree?

532
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,880
If today, we escaped

533
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,110
the Treasure Hunt,

534
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,760
what about next time?

535
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,920
As long as we're on this ship,

536
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,240
they'll keep coming.

537
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,030
So the only way is to make Master

538
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:09,550
recognize us as part of the convoy.

539
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,030
This way,

540
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,880
we can be protected on this ship.

541
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,630
Do you understand?

542
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,470
Shrimp,

543
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:30,070
actually, with today's Treasure Hunt,

544
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,590
I was gambling, too.

545
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,550
I was betting that Master

546
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,800
would come to save me.

547
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,100
I didn't expect

548
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,010
that I was right.

549
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,250
So at the very least,

550
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,460
now, on this ship,

551
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,320
we're safe.

552
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,990
We're protected.

553
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
Staying on this ship

554
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,360
is not just
about getting the pearl back.

555
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:01,860
There's one more thing.

556
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,190
I want to learn the trade,

557
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,920
and the ins and outs of this business.

558
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,960
Do you remember

559
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,800
I said I'd take you to be a peddler

560
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,030
or to open a shop?

561
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,920
But we need
to understand the trade for that.

562
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,070
So staying here to learn

563
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,670
isn't wrong.

564
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,240
Sister, can we really open a shop?

565
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,510
Why are you so excited?

566
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,360
I want to open a shop with you!

567
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:29,590
By then,

568
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:32,400
our shop will be so big,

569
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,360
much bigger than this lower deck!

570
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:38,960
Every day, I'll polish the counter

571
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,470
until it's spotless.

572
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,630
And on opening day,

573
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,880
you'll have to wear bright red!

574
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,030
And there'll be firecrackers
at the door,

575
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,070
so everyone in town comes to see.

576
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,590
Why do I have to wear bright red?

577
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,720
So your shop will flourish!

578
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,670
Where'd you get that idea?

579
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,280
Alright,

580
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,030
we can do that.

581
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,110
Then I'll...

582
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,510
wear a bright red dress.

583
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,960
What?

584
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,590
It's a deal.

585
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,760
Childish.

586
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,670
Why bother with this?

587
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,190
Alright,

588
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,360
it's a deal.

589
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,320
I'll wear a bright red dress.

590
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,800
And we'll set off firecrackers.
Don't forget it!

591
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,990
Yan Zijing lost the Treasure Hunt.

592
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,150
He won't let it go so easily.

593
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,440
Send someone to get close
to his convoy members.

594
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,440
Greetings to Steward Zhao,
Accountant Wei.

595
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,800
Greetings to Steward Zhao.

596
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,840
Greetings to Accountant Wei.

597
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,960
Greetings to Steward Zhao,
Accountant Wei.

598
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:53,720
Shrimp...

599
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,670
I heard that Steward Zhao

600
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,400
has a photographic memory.

601
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,160
Did you know that?

602
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:05,760
Yes!

603
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,550
I finally got to see it today.

604
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,510
Truly an eye-opener.

605
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,030
The Master has entrusted Steward Zhao

606
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,110
with managing all affairs on this ship.

607
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,440
That shows how much he trusts him.

608
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,280
We should learn from him.

609
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,190
So young,

610
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:24,440
and you've already moved up
from the lower deck to the convoy.

611
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,240
You really do have
some impressive skills.

612
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,510
I'm flattered.

613
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,440
I'll still need guidance from you
in the future.

614
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,070
I heard you sold off scraps,

615
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,150
recovered the money,
and made an extra 800 cash.

616
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,070
How did you do it?

617
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,670
It had nothing to do with me.

618
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,960
It was all thanks to Assistant Pang.

619
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,840
And this time,

620
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,550
even more thanks to Accountant Wei.

621
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,150
Yes, indeed.

622
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,670
Thank you for the advice.

623
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,590
I didn't advise you at all.

624
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,150
It's your own skill.

625
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,190
It has nothing to do with me.

626
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,030
I saw your transaction records
with Zhuobao House.

627
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,510
The accounts are clear and organized,

628
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,990
with accurate details and no errors.

629
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,510
I've never heard Accountant Wei
praise anyone before.

630
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,510
Reporting to Accountant Wei,

631
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,360
when I was at the pearl farm,

632
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,840
I learned bookkeeping from the steward.

633
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,070
But it's just basic knowledge,

634
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,990
nowhere near your level.

635
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,070
And you, Accountant Wei,

636
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,470
have the books in hand

637
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,840
and numbers in mind.

638
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,150
I could never reach that level

639
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,150
in my lifetime.

640
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,920
Yes, indeed.

641
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,400
It's all part of the job.

642
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,440
Yes.

643
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,510
Here's 1,000 cash.

644
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,590
The Master instructed me
to give this to you.

645
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,990
Use as you see fit.

646
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,960
Sign the receipt.

647
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,550
Hu, Xiu,

648
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,920
This...

649
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,470
please take this.

650
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,150
What's this?

651
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,760
Loud!

652
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,920
So much money.

653
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,760
You've been so kind to us.

654
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,150
Thank you!

655
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:21,670
Duanwu,

656
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,070
you're lucky to have survived.

657
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,190
I heard the Treasure Hunt was dangerous.

658
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,030
But seeing you safe now,

659
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,240
I must congratulate you.

660
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,920
In all my time here,

661
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,320
it's the first time I've seen

662
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,280
a servant make it to the upper deck.

663
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,110
Yes.

664
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,240
Congratulations, Duanwu.

665
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,240
In the future, we'll rely on you.

666
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,360
There's no need to be so formal.

667
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,840
Once Shrimp and I are on the upper deck,

668
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,400
if you ever need any help, just ask us.

669
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,190
Alright, let's eat.

670
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,550
My sister went

671
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,400
all around Guangzhou
to find these treats.

672
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,540
If you don't eat,

673
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,840
- I'll starve just looking at them.
- Try some!

674
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,760
Chicken legs!

675
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,880
Sister, have this.

676
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,920
