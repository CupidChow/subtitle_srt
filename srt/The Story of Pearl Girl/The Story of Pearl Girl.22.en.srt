What do you want to see me about?

14

My master wants to pay you 30 million mace

to withdraw from the Qionghua Festival.

16
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,600
You'd better take it.

Ms. Huan.

22
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,230
You're reasonable.

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,350
You're old.

24
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,830
It would be nice to retire.

25

When I was five, I entered the Huan family to practice pipa.

137

and made the Huan family famous again in Yangzhou.

139

When I was twelve,

140
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,670
they sent me to a brothel.

141
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,840
I put on makeup

142
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,400
and received guests for the Huan family.

143
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,280
Only I gradually degenerated.

144
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,670
No one asked me if I wanted to do it.

145

Do you really think I'm a Huan?

146
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,670
Lady Huan, I was wrong.

147
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,860
I didn't think that much.

148

Lady Huan, are you going to let her go?

153
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,040
She wanted to go.

It's a bad name.

157
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,640
It sounds like "leave".

158
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,670
Lady Huan, look at you.

159
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,520
Obviously, you don't want her to go.

160
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,520
Since you don't want her to go,

161
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,840
why did you do that?

162
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,640
If I force her to stay, we'll suffer.

163
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,920
Why do people have to suffer?

164
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,520
They never treated me like family.

165
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,190
Now, I treat them the same way.

166
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,710
If the jewelry

167
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,710
can buy me a clean break with the Huan family,

168
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,040
I think it's worth it.

169

172

Clothes, jewelry,

makeup, and music.

174

Everything costs a lot.

175

Now,

176
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,790
I don't even have a decent piece of jewelry.

177
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,470
It's a pipe dream for me to join the Qionghua Festival.

178
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,670
We'll figure it out.

179
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,040
Lady Huan, give me some time.

180
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,310
Let me ask you something.

181
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,830
Am I the only songstress you can find right now?

182
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,120
Forget it.

183
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,880
We are at the end of our rope.

184
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,830
There's another way.

185
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,470
Maybe I can give it a try.

186
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,520
Si.

187
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,590
Stop beating him.

188

379
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,360
disagree.

380
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,990
Smart people only do what's good for them.

381
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,320
The tea is too hot.

382
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,430
Remember.

383
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,190
Be obedient in the future.

384
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,190
Thank you, Mr. Zheng.

385
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,400
Aren't you worried about Duanwu?

386
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,430
I'm worried about her.

387
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,320
But I believe her.

388
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,840
Lady Huan, you also believe her, don't you?

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,510
Muzhe said

390
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,880
that you must learn to love yourself first.

391
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,230
She went everywhere for me

392
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,030
and tried to pull me out of the abyss.

393
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,030
I believe her.

394
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,800
Duanwu said the same thing to me.

395
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,400
You should rely on yourself

396
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,270
rather than others.

397
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,800
Good one.

398
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,230
When you came,

399
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,320
it was as if spring had come.

400
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,230
That's great.

401
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
Lady Huan.

402
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,990
Shiqi.

403
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,470
Duanwu.

404
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,040
Muzhe.

405
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,190
How's it going?

406
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,510
Did you find someone to support me?

407
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,950
I did it.

408
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,080
That's a lot of money.

409
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,230
Does he have any harsh conditions?

410
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,710
Lady Huan, don't worry.

411
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,950
Put it away.

412
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,880
It's the Zheng family.

413
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,320
Zheng family?

414
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,880
Zheng Wu.

415
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,120
Zheng Wu.

416
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,920
He's a concubine's son.

417
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,710
How could he come up with so much money?

418
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,120
It's because he's a concubine's son

419
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,560
that I made a deal with him.

420
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,950
Lady Huan, don't worry.

421
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,710
Zheng Wu only provides money.

422
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,710
It has nothing to do with you.

423
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,560
All right.

424
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,160
Great.

425
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,840
Duanwu, with all this gold,

426
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,030
we can buy the best jade jewelry.

427
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,470
Lady Huan, don't worry.

428
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm sure we'll win.

429
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,710
We'll win.

430
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,640
Yunxiu.

431
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,710
We now have this gold.

432
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,750
I'll draw more drawings.

433
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,430
Lady Huan, you can pick from them then.

434
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,840
New drawings.

435
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,080
Can we make it?

436
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,320
We have to do it.

437
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,640
I'll stay up all night drawing.

438
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,610
Lady Huan, did you see

439
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,840
other songstresses' jewelry?

440
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,600
Do I have the same drawing as theirs?

441
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Or am I not as good as them?

442
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,400
Are you worried about losing?

443
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
You told me

444
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
that jewelry has spirit.

445
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:29,510
If you are not calm when making jewelry,

446
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,560
the jewelry won't be outstanding.

447
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,320
Up to this point,

448
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm kind of scared.

449
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,710
Lady Huan.

450
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,600
What if you lose the top beauty

451
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,120
because I didn't

452
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,120
do my jewelry well?

453
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,360
Your Clear Mind is a new shop.

454
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,160
Other jewelry shops have been open in Yangzhou for many years.

455
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,800
It's not easy for you

456
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,560
to amaze the people.

457
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,670
Not to mention, we don't have anything.

458
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,640
Don't be afraid to lose.

459
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,710
Lady Huan, you're right.

460
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,320
Muzhe.

461
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,840
Close your ears.

462
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,120
Clear your mind.

463
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,270
It's time to fight.

464
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,360
We don't fight for others.

465
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,990
We fight for ourselves.

466
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:41,950
Yes.

467
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,950
Stop.

468
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,230
You've been practicing all morning.

469
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,560
But you're not getting any better.

470
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,950
Dancing is not about showing off.

471
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:38,190
It's about understanding its essence.

472
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,990
Breathing, rhythm,

473
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,990
action, and emotion.

474
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,560
You must think over

475
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,510
every detail.

476
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,120
If you can make a difference

477
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,710
in the same dance,

478
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,430
you are qualified to be the top beauty.

479
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,670
Are you tired?

480
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,670
No.

481
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,470
Are you sure?

482
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,640
Yes.

483
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,600
Good.

484
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,190
If you're tired, quit the Qionghua Festival.

485
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,510
Lady Bai, don't worry.

486
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,600
These press-on nails are the same as the ones you gave me.

487
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,430
Reward him.

488
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,710
Thank you, Lady Bai.

489
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,560
Excuse me.

490
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,800
Niao.

491
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,840
Look.

492
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,470
[Yangzhou Zheng family]
The Zheng family sent you an invitation.

493
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,030
They have an honored guest for dinner tonight.

494
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,030
They invited you to accompany them.

495
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,640
Why didn't they ask Xue Liniang to go?

496
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
Xue Liniang practices every day.

497
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,160
But they always ask me to accompany them.

498
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,320
Xue Liniang can't compare to you.

499
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,560
You're the top beauty.

500
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,750
Besides,

501
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,030
We can't offend Mr. Zheng.

502
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,530
Guys, check this out.

503
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,750
Lady Bai passed the age of flower blooming.

504
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,440
But she said she was only the age of peach and plum.

505
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,950
Lady Bai is not 20 years old.

506
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,130
She's 24.

507
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,840
Yeah.

508
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,410
Songstress Yan said she was from a famous family.

509
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,260
But she's from a poor family.

510
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,530
She pawns her jewelry for a living.

511
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,670
She's beautiful on the outside but mean on the inside.

512
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,120
It's mean.

513
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,430
Look at this.

514
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,990
Songstress Yingtao

515
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,800
eats three baked flatbreads at a meal.

516
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,320
Even I can't eat that much.

517
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,640
Songstress Xue Liniang

518
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,430
spends all her salary every month.

519
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,840
She has almost no savings.

520
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,710
She spent all her money on cosmetics, jewelry, and clothes.

521
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,190
She loves beauty.

522
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,750
Look at this.

523
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,080
Lady Huan

524
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,880
is the adopted daughter of the Huan family.

525
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,670
The Huan family made her a songstress

526
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,430
and used her as a cash cow.

527
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,600
Look at Songstress Cao and Songstress Wang.

528
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,920
All the famous songstresses in Yangzhou

529
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,510
are scolded.

530
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,800
Who did this?

531
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,600
Mr. Xu, please.

532
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,710
- Cheers. - Cheers.

533
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,320
Mr. Xu, it's an honor to have you

534
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,360
at the Qionghua Festival.

535
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,640
Mr. Xu.

536
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,030
I invited a top beauty

537
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,840
to entertain us.

538
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,190
You didn't have to do this.

539
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,160
The Qionghua Festival is Yangzhou's annual event.

540
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,230
Starting this year,

541
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,640
I will rejoice with the people every year.

542
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:30,160
Yeah.

543
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,840
Rejoice with the people.

544
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
Mr. Xu, please.

545
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,360
How about drinking it up?

546
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,920
Okay. Cheers.

547
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,600
Come on. Fill Mr. Xu's cup.

548
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,400
What is this all about?

549
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,920
Who wrote it?

550
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,080
It's mean.

551
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
You're all here.

552
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
What happened?

553
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,120
Come on.

554
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,640
Check this out.

555
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,360
Lady Bai, you are the top beauty.

556
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,030
This thing happened.

557
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,880
You must step up

558
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,840
and find out who did it.

559
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,600
Yan, you're a talented girl.

560
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,030
How do you have time to read this?

561
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,080
Why don't you spend your time

562
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,080
with poets and artists?

563
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,750
What are you doing here?

564
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,430
We came to you

565
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,430
to figure it out.

566
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,840
I don't know who did it.

567
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,270
If I find out who did it,

568
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,470
I'll rip her face off.

569
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,640
Why are you staring at me?

570
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,950
Are you doubting me?

571
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,510
What's wrong with you?

572
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,470
How could it be me?

573
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,360
You sent people to keep an eye on the Zheng family.

574
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,230
You pretended

575
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,640
to run into them.

576
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,030
But you didn't get Mr. Zheng to vote for you.

577
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,290
Did you see that?

578
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,720
I saw it in person.

579
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,160
Don't

580
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,840
talk nonsense.

581
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,770
All right.

582
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,510
We're friends.

583
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,950
Don't doubt each other.

584
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,640
We should prepare for the Qionghua Festival.

585
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,950
Lady Bai is older.

586
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:25,320
She's insightful.

587
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,710
Unlike her,

588
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,470
someone only knows making innuendo.

589
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,990
She's ridiculous.

590
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,640
You...

591
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,750
What?

592
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,990
Lady Yan, you're really talented.

593
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,430
You insult people with worded words.

594
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,430
Let me see.

595
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,430
Flower blooming. Peach and plum...

596
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,120
I don't know these words.

597
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,410
Yeah.

598
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,430
I dare you to say it again.

599
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,170
Flower blooming. Peach and plum...

600
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,230
I'll tear your throat out.

601
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,470
Come on.

602
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,540
- Tear my throat out. - Enough.

603
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,600
I need to talk to you.

604
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,120
If you're in trouble,

605
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,950
you can ask us for help.

606
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,160
You didn't have to pawn your stuff

607
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,510
to make yourself look good.

608
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,990
We felt sorry for you

609
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,070
when we found out.

610
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,630
Speaking of that,

611
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,880
the insult to you.

612
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,920
was not very harsh.

613
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,630
Why are you coming at me?

614
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,680
I didn't speak ill of you, Lady Bai.

615
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,470
I...

616
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,630
I have the support of the Zheng family.

617
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,280
Why did I do that?

618
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,430
It's useless.

619
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,110
Could it be Lady Huan?

620
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:40,320
She didn't even show up for this.

621
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,240
She's always been like that.

622
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,280
She's arrogant.

623
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,360
Who knows what will happen

624
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,430
in the current situation?

625
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,010
It's great.

626
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,120
Bravo.

627
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,060
Beautiful body.

628
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,360
Master Yan.

629
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,630
He was a big spender and a great merchant in Guangzhou.

630
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,030
Why did you come to Yangzhou

631
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,400
to do business?

632
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,360
Long time no see, Mr. Xu.

633
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,070
I didn't expect you to be promoted.

634
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,360
Congratulations.

635
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,720
You knew each other.

636
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,720
Before, Yan was in Guangzhou.

637
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,880
I held a poetry gathering in Guangzhou.

638
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
I was honored to have Mr. Xu.

639
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,200
Mr. Xu made a poem.

640
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,760
It's popular in Lingnan.

641
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,990
Mr. Xu, you're talented.

642
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,110
I'm flattered.

643
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,470
Master Yan.

644
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,680
Yangzhou is different from Guangzhou.

645
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,200
You have to operate in accordance with the law.

646
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,430
I'll keep that in mind.

647
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,030
Mr. Xu, please.

648
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,510
Please.

649
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,550
It's a big occasion.

650
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,030
He brought an unknown woman.

651
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,760
Don't worry.

652
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,720
He did it for fun.

653
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,110
He knows the limitations.

654
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,020
Bravo.

655
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,070
Muzhe.

656
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:01,920
Which one is better?

657
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,950
Let's try it out.

658
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,070
Is he Yan Zijing?

659
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,990
What kind of a person is he?

660
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,840
He's ruthless

661
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,470
and unscrupulous.

662
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,630
He's a vicious man.

663
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,760
I want to know him.

664
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,150
Yingtao.

665
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,800
Where are my dancing shoes?

666
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,880
Coming.

667
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:44,150
I put your dancing shoes away.

668
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,150
I'll get them for you.

669
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,430
Look.

670
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,070
Lady Xue...

671
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,200
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on them?

672
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,680
All you know is to eat.

673
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,150
- You ruined it. - What happened?

674
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,280
Ignore them.

675
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:29,450
- Bravo. - Bravo.

676
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,400
- Bravo. - Bravo.

677
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,800
It's Lady Yu.

678
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,110
She was the top beauty in Yangzhou 20 years ago.

679
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,630
She's really stunning.

680
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,760
You can't wait

681
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,280
to see the beautiful songstresses tonight.

682
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:49,680
Now, I declare

683
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,760
that the Qionghua Festival has officially begun.

684
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,470
Great.

685
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:56,400
Who did it?

686
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,920
Who took my shoes away?

687
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,430
Lady Bai, your dress...

688
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,630
Your dress is broken.

689
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,400
What should we do?

690
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,400
Xue.

691
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,990
My dress was ruined.

692
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,990
I've been here with Duanwu.

693
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,470
We haven't moved.

694
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,280
Can you show us

695
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,680
your pipa?

696
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,630
Lady Bai.

697
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:38,630
The pipa is our secret.

698
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,200
We can't show you.

699
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,430
If you don't show us,

700
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,070
you're the one who did it.

701
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,800
Yingtao.

702
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
I dare you.

703
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,590
Lady Huan.

704
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:50,550
I didn't expect you

705
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,070
to be so vicious.

706
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,110
My dancing shoes and Lady Bai's dress

707
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,280
are ruined.

708
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,030
Why are yours intact?

709
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,550
So what?

710
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,840
You didn't take care of your stuff.

711
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,920
What does it have to do with me?

712
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,920
You did it.

713
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,610
You ruined Lady Xue's dancing shoes

714
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,950
and Lady Bai's dress.

715
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,360
You're vicious.

716
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,580
Xuanji.

717
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,930
We didn't take good care of them?

718
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,890
I'll see it.

719
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,360
Xue Liniang, what do you want?

720
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,510
Huan.

721
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,150
Xue, don't be impulsive.

722
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:27,840
You have no proof.

723
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,240
We'll talk about it after the Qionghua Festival.

724
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,880
Don't mess around.

725
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,470
Xuanji.

726
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,990
Don't point fingers.

727
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,630
It's just a dress.

728
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,200
We have spare dresses.

729
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,150
What should I do?

730
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,680
Don't you have spare dresses?

731
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,990
Don't worry.

732
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,280
I have an extra dress.

733
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,470
Xuanji.

734
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,280
Lady Bai, Lady Xue may not fit

735
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,470
into your dress and shoes.

736
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,920
I was negligent.

737
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,280
You...

738
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,470
You ruined our stuff.

739
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,720
Are you not ashamed?

740
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,320
Let's report them.

741
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,200
Xue Liniang.

742
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,200
Lady Huan prepared

743
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,760
a few extra pairs of dancing shoes.

744
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,590
We can lend them to you

745
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,950
if you like.

746
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,360
Yunxiu.

747
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,470
Go get the dancing shoes.

748
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,280
Lady Xue, we have shoes.

749
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,630
Huan, why did you prepare so many shoes?

750
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,550
We did it to watch out for bad people.

751
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,110
There are a lot of bad people on this occasion.

752
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,720
Just in case.

753
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,920
Thank you, Su.

754
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,800
You're thoughtful.

755
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,470
