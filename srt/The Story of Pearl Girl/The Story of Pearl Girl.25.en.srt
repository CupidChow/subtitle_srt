12
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,330
Hurry up!

13
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,790
Keep a close watch on this shipment.

14
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:46,950
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,030
Huan.

16
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,470
Huan.

17
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,520
Huan.

18
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,800
Huan.

19
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,430
I've already retired now.

20
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,750
I don't wish to be disturbed anymore.

21
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,960
Please go back, Mr. Zheng Si.

22
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,430
Huan,

23
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,030
why are you treating me this way?

24
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,240
Have you forgotten how deeply I feel for you?

25
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,630
Have you forgotten all these years we spent together?

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,310
Don't you trust me anymore?

27
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,240
I don't trust you.

28
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Whatever you say, I won't believe it.

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,440
Go back.

30
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,630
Huan.

31
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,030
Look,

32
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,920
I had no other choice.

33
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,470
Zheng Wu

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,120
reported me.

35
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,400
My father beat me harshly.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,080
I had no choice, Huan.

37
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,470
I agreed to it,

38
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,800
only then did my father let me out.

39
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,680
I had no other way to see you.

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,430
You must believe me, Huan.

41
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,340
What about the letter?

42
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,120
What was that letter about?

43
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,000
I was forced.

44
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,400
My father found out our relationship.

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,190
He...

46
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,150
forced me to write it.

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,630
If I didn't comply,

48
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,870
he would've locked me up.

49
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,310
During those days he kept me locked away,

50
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,040
I thought about you day and night, Huan.

51
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,720
You must believe me, Huan.

52
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,560
You must believe me.

53
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,240
Huan, please believe me.

54
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,510
My father...

55
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,430
he's forcing me to marry a noble's legitimate daughter.

56
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,240
I swore I'd never obey.

57
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:47,760
I...

58
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,070
I, Zheng Si,

59
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,160
will openly and honorably bring you into the Zheng family.

60
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,280
You're the only one I want in this lifetime, Huan.

61
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,920
I want to take you far away.

62
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,110
I want the whole world to know

63
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,310
that you are my wife.

64
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,790
Huan,

65
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,160
I'm afraid I can't believe you anymore.

66
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,670
Is everything you say

67
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,600
really true?

68
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,080
Of course it's true.

69
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
Huan, you must trust me.

70
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,480
Huan,

71
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,990
I have even better news for you.

72
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,080
My mother has accepted you.

73
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
You know,

74
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,350
after the Cui family fell,

75
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,790
life hasn't been easy for her in the Zheng family.

76
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,280
She still has some dowry left to sell off

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,550
to raise some cash.

78
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
She mainly wants to leave us a way out.

79
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,400
My mother also said,

80
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,400
the price isn't important,

81
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,480
just don't let the Zheng family find out.

82
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,110
Huan, could you maybe

83
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,040
ask some of the songstresses around you?

84
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,720
I can look into it,

85
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,670
but I need to see those jewels first

86
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,600
before I make a decision.

87
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,790
Alright.

88
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,920
I will listen to only you in this life.

89
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,080
Huan...

90
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,520
The Zheng family?

91
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,480
Yes.

92
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,640
I followed the family servants to the Zheng estate

93
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,870
and met the man they called Steward Zheng.

94
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,040
On your journey to Yangzhou,

95
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,640
you carry a heavy duty.

96
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,120
If you have an urgent need,

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,520
you can seek aid from the Zheng family.

98
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,960
They've managed the Yangzhou Jewelry Guild for years.

99
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,920
They're a model of generosity and integrity among merchants.

100
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,920
From smuggling stolen goods on official ships to the Black Dragon Bandits,

101
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,480
the Zheng family

102
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,790
and Xu Nanying...

103
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,040
Prince Ying,

104
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,920
are you truly involved in this?

105
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,990
Go to Zhe Chong Fu overnight to request reinforcements.

106
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,790
Tomorrow, we'll enter Yangzhou.

107
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:34,950
And this one?

108
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,280
What does it mean?

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,000

[Clear Mind]
Today, I'll visit two more families.

141
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,240
Yes. Ms. Su,

142
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,670
today's gifts are two more than yesterday.

143
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,100
Alright.

144
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,980
Duanwu,

145
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,070
I'm waiting for good news from you.

146
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
Be careful, Ms. Su.

147
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,790
Alright.

148
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,470
Off you go.

149
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,240
I still have some stock in Zhenlang Pavilion.

150
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,520
You're welcome to use it for now.

151
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,550
Since when has Mr. Yan become so generous?

152
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,520
Partnering with the Zheng family

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
is like trying to get blood from a stone.

154
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,550
If this fails,

155
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,400
you'll have no place left in Yangzhou.

156
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,590
Do you want me to stay in Yangzhou

157
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,240
or not?

158
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,470
I don't understand what you want anymore.

159
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,430
And I won't bother guessing.

160
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,950
Thank you for your kindness.

161
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,190
Where are you taking me?

162
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Right here.

163
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,470
It's right here?

164
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

165
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,710
Mr. Si.

166
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,170
Well done.

167
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,040
Huan, it's alright.

168
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,310
How could there be so much jewelry?

169
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,830
After all, my mother is a legitimate daughter of the Cui family.

170
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
It's natural her dowry was generous.

171
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,920
These pieces are fine enough,

172
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,160
but...

173
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,040
But what?

174
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,550
In big families' marriages,

175
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,070
dowries are always in matching pairs.

176
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,400
Why is Lady Cui's dowry collection

177
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,880
so mismatched?

178
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,760
Cui and Zheng families were allied,

179
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,470
but my mother was a second wife.

180
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,950
Whatever the Cui family gave, she wore.

181
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,160
How could she dare to choose?

182
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:01,830
Huan,

183
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,590
I heard Su Muzhe is buying old jewelry.

184
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,640
There's a notice posted at Clear Mind.

185
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,190
You might as well call her here.

186
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,830
Let's not.

187
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,040
Don't I know how much money she has?

188
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,430
She's used to getting something for nothing.

189
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,160
We shouldn't let her have it cheap.

190
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,190
With so many fine jewels here,

191
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,950
if we lower the price just a little,

192
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,590
people will be eager to buy.

193
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,710
You're absolutely right.

194
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,400
Keep an eye on things.

195
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,360
I'll head out for some matters and be back soon.

196
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,550
It's blood!

197
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,760
Mr. Si,

198
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,000
how long will it take to sell all this?

199
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,830
We can't afford any delays.

200
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
The longer it takes, the greater the risk.

201
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,520
I'll find a way

202
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,280
to lure someone from Clear Mind.

203
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,670
The jewelry guild joins forces to suppress Clear Mind.

204
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,520
Why would you feed her?

205
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,430
Do you not know

206
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,040
who's backing Clear Mind?

207
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,400
Mr. Si, are you targeting Mr. Wu...

208
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,280
Steward Zheng,

209
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,400
after handling these matters for my father all these years,

210
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,040
aren't you afraid?

211
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,000
There always needs to be someone to blame.

212
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,590
Figure out a way to get the word to Clear Mind.

213
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,400
What's wrong?

214
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,560
Do you like it?

215
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,560
If you like it, then wear it.

216
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:54,920
Here.

217
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,950
Does it look good?

218
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,080
It looks beautiful.

219
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,800
Anything you wear is beautiful.

220
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,190
Then I'll look around some more.

221
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,560
Yunxiu, take a break.

222
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,030
We haven't had many customers these days.

223
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,470
Why keep wiping everything over and over?

224
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,360
Without new stock in our store,

225
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,230
it's hard to attract people.

226
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,120
We're not closing down, are we?

227
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:40,190
I feel like my life is just starting to look up.

228
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,880
What do we do?

229
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,180
Stop it!

230
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,840
Alright.

231
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,080
Stop saying such unlucky things.

232
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,030
I believe in Duanwu.

233
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,470
She's been through so much hardship.

234
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,230
We'll find a way.

235
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,170
Yes,

236
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,640
I was just complaining.

237
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,470
Lady Shiqi!

238
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,560
Shou!

239
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,430
You came by yourself?

240
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,950
Where's your leader?

241
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,560
He went to help my father move.

242
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,880
He's really such a good guy.

243
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,510
I'm here

244
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,750
because my leader has a message to you.

245
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,600
He said there's a family by the Riverside Alley selling jewelry.

246
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,880
They want you to take a look.

247
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,670
Really?

248
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,710
Here's the map he drew.

249
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,060
[Map]

250
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,990
Look,

251
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,320
here's our opportunity.

252
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,920
Didn't we say

253
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,230
to leave such tasks to the servants?

254
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,990
What if you tire yourself out?

255
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,430
You keep saying that,

256
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,160
but I'm locked up here every day

257
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,560
with someone following my every move.

258
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,880
If I don't find something to do,

259
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
I'd be bored to death.

260
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,270
It's only for your safety.

261
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,400
Don't go wandering around for now.

262
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,950
But with so much inventory,

263
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,950
how long will it take to sell it all?

264
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm going crazy.

265
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,270
It won't take long.

266
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,880
The big customer is coming.

267
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,670
Apologies, Master.

268
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,800
I heard there's jewelry for sale here,

269
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
so I came to take a look.

270
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,320
Where are you from?

271
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,920
I'm from Clear Mind.

272
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,080
From Clear Mind? Please, come in.

273
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,950
You keep explaining nothing.

274
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,880
I don't care, I'm going out for a stroll.

275
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,430
Tell your people not to follow me.

276
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,750
Shiqi!

277
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,270
Miss, Here.

278
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,190
Feel free to look around.

279
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,510
This is Hetian jade?

280
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,510
Yes.

281
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,270
Yes.

282
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,510
Such carving patterns are rare in Yangzhou.

283
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,750
Don't shout.

284
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,880
Don't shout.

285
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,670
These as well.

286
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,750
Here, take a look.

287
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,230
How is there so much jewelry from the Western Regions?

288
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,190
Don't worry about whether it's from the Western Regions or the Tang Empire.

289
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,640
It's cheap, anyway.

290
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,470
Didn't I say not to involve Clear Mind?

291
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,160
Why shouldn't I?

292
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,120
Because these things have a questionable origin!

293
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,800
Huan,

294
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,920
let's not spell it out.

295
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,670
Just help me dispose of these things quickly,

296
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,190
and I'll take you far away.

297
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,400
You're deceiving me into fencing stolen goods for you?

298
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,160
What do you take me for?

299
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,120
What do I take you for?

300
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,120
I should be asking you that.

301
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,560
Why did you accept Zheng Wu's support for the top beauty title

302
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,840
and even invest in Clear Mind?

303
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,030
You know full well that this illegitimate son

304
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,270
is always competing with me for the family assets.

305
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,120
I invested in Clear Mind because of Su Muzhe.

306
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,670
It has nothing to do with Zheng Wu.

307
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,750
Let Lady Shiqi go.

308
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,230
No.

309
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,160
You won't do it, right?

310
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,990
Fine, I will.

311
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,800
Huan!

312
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,360
Miss.

313
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,320
That's our manager.

314
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,270
Seems like he's upset again.

315
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,360
Here, look at this.

316
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,120
There's more here.

317
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,320
Miss, did you bring money?

318
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,510
I didn't bring money today,

319
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,360
but I can sign a contract.

320
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,360
You actually planned

321
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,750
to smuggle jewelry out through a food container?

322
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,950
Why?

323
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,710
Huan.

324
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,160
I'm sorry...

325
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,990
I'm sorry...

326
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,400
Why?

327
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,560
Why did you hide them?

328
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,160
Why did you lie to me?

329
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,840
Enough. Stop acting!

330
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm going to report you.

331
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,560
Report!

332
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,990
Is that Lady Huan?

333
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,430
I trusted you again and again,

334
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,160
but what are you doing?

335
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,320
What are you making me do for you?

336
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,400
I did all of this for you.

337
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,160
I wanted to marry you into the Zheng family quickly.

338
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,920
Marry me?

339
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,320
How many times have you said that over the years?

340
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,270
Ask yourself honestly.

341
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,400
Do you even believe yourself?

342
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,320
From now on,

343
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,710
I won't believe you anymore.

344
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,430
I can't stand watching you do these dirty deeds.

345
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,880
I'm going to report you!

346
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,710
Huan.

347
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,800
Huan.

348
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,400
Do you think I don't want to marry you?

349
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,430
What...

350
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,670
What choice do I have?

351
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,320
You know full well

352
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,670
this is a deal we both agreed upon.

353
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,230
You're the one living in a dream.

354
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,320
Speak up,

355
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,670
where did you hide the items?

356
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,120
How much did you hide?

357
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,270
If you tell me,

358
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,800
I'll spare your life.

359
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,920
Huan...

360
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,640
Huan...

361
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,360
Huan...

362
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,430
What happened?

363
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,510
Quickly, move the goods.

364
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,400
Clean up the place. Hurry!

365
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,270
Yes!

366
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,030
Get up, come with me.

367
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,710
Come on, get up!

368
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,030
Don't stay there. Come with me!

369
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,160
Move! Hurry!

370
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,670
Yingtao.

371
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,510
Shiqi.

372
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,270
Ms. Su, you're back!

373
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,710
Have all the gifts been delivered?

374
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,840
Finally, some good news today.

375
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,430
We're not shut up anymore.

376
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,670
That's great.

377
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,400
Ms. Su,

378
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,030
did you see Yunxiu

379
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,190
when you passed by Riverside Alley?

380
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,560
Gaoshou said there were people selling old jewelry there,

381
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,710
so Yunxiu went to take a look.

382
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,750
That's good news,

383
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,270
but I didn't see Yunxiu.

384
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,560
How long has she been gone?

385
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,400
Half a day.

386
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,640
She's been gone half a day?

387
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,880
I need to go look for her.

388
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,160
When I'm not around,

389
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,080
Yunxiu never leaves the shop for this long.

390
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,640
Hey...

391
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,950
How did it go?

392
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,270
The Zheng family received a shipment from the west.

393
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,920
It's been hidden in a residential house.

394
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,430
Lady Huan is selling that batch now.

395
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,270
Zhang Jinran arrived in Yangzhou this morning

396
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,190
and visited Zhe Chong Fu.

397
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,710
Seems like he's mobilizing troops.

398
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,430
Lady Huan...

399
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,270
What about Duanwu?

400
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,840
I don't know.

401
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,030
Are you worried Duanwu might...

402
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,400
go buy that jewelry?

403
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,920
If she buys that jewelry,

404
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,470
she'll be dealing in stolen goods.

405
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,750
We must find her immediately.

406
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,800
Is this the place, Gaoshou?

407
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,710
Yes, this is it.

408
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,670
Anyone here?

409
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,640
Yunxiu!

410
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,030
Yunxiu!

411
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,750
No one's here?

412
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,190
Could they have already left?

413
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,190
Don't worry, Ms. Su.

414
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,080
I'll go in and check.

415
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,120
How will you get in?

416
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,840
Don't worry.

417
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,510
Gaoshou!

418
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,640
Yunxiu!

419
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,270
Yunxiu!

420
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,510
Yunxiu!

421
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,430
Ms. Su, don't worry.

422
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,190
She's just unconscious.

423
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,880
It's alright. Don't worry.

424
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,560
Yunxiu...

425
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,990
Shiqi. Yunxiu. Wake up!

426
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,230
Ms. Su,

427
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,080
there's another lady lying over there.

428
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,560
Yunxiu...

429
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,670
Yunxiu...

430
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,030
Ms. Su,

431
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,080
come and look.

432
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,360
She doesn't seem to be breathing.

433
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,190
Go take a look.

434
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,880
Hurry, take a look.

435
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,990
Lady Huan...

436
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,880
Lady Huan...

437
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,840
Lady Huan...

438
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,880
Wake up, Lady Huan...

439
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,080
Gaoshou, quickly, call for help!

440
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,560
But...

441
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,470
she... she's not breathing.

442
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:29,950
Ms. Su...

443
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,950
Lady Huan...

444
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,600
Seal off this courtyard.

445
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,030
Search!

446
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,920
Yes, sir!

447
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Huan...

448
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,270
We have to go!

449
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,880
Ms. Su, we really have to go!

450
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
The guards are here. Ms. Su, let's go!

451
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,320
Search!

452
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,750
We have to leave now, Ms. Su.

453
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,080
It's just the two of us left alive here.

454
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,560
If we don't leave,

455
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,880
we couldn't clear our names!

456
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,120
Let's go!

457
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,360
Quickly, let's go!

458
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,360
Inspector Zhang, we found a woman's corpse.

459
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,720
Sir, looks like they escaped through the window.

460
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,110
It's not Duanwu.

461
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:40,150
Take it away.

462
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,760
Yes.

463
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,720
Send out everyone. Duanwu must be found.

464
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,030
Understood.

465
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,070
What's going on?

466
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,510
Are you close with that lady?

467
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,950
Listen,

468
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,380
put Yunxiu down now,

469
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,030
and just leave.

470
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,360
This has nothing to do with you.

471
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,360
No way.

472
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,070
I can't leave.

473
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,430
Lady Shiqi went there to buy jewelry

474
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,150
because of me.

475
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,030
I have to handle this!

476
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,110
This is no trivial matter.

477
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,400
Someone has already died.

478
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,150
I still can't leave!

479
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,280
I can't just abandon the two of you ladies here.

480
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,800
This isn't something I can ignore!

481
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,840
Inspector Zhang, what an honor!

482
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,150
Forgive me for not welcoming you sooner.

483
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,880
No need for formalities, Mr. Zheng.

484
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,590
Please, this way.

485
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Before I came to Yangzhou,

486
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,280
Prince Ying kept mentioning you.

487
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,280
He said the Zheng family of Yangzhou

488
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,430
is a model of generosity

489
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,240
and integrity among merchants.

490
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,880
Prince Ying truly flatters us.

491
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,630
The Zheng family hardly deserves such praise.

492
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,550
Inspector Zhang, your visit is sudden.

493
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,990
May I ask what brings you here?

494
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,510
If there's anything you need,

495
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,510
please say the word.

496
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,110
The entire Zheng family is at your service.

497
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,680
Well, Mr. Zheng,

498
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,280
I do indeed have a matter today.

499
00:35:59,150 --> 00:35:59,840
Please go ahead.

500
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,510
Take a look at this.

501
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Earlier today, at a residence in Yangzhou,

502
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,360
Lady Huan, the top beauty of the Qionghua Festival, was found dead.

503
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,990
Lady Huan is dead?

504
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,990
This was found in her hand.

505
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,360
So, I thought,

506
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,280
perhaps you could provide some insight.

507
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,630
After all, not just any family

508
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,950
could afford such material.

509
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:31,030
Inspector Zhang, based on just this sleeve,

510
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,280
I see no particular clues.

511
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,150
Of course.

512
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,720
But I asked the tailor,

513
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,360
and he said that Zheng Wu

514
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,920
specifically chose this material

515
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,320
for the edges of his sleeves.

516
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,590
Did the tailor say

517
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,760
that only my son Zheng Wu used this material?

518
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Not exactly.

519
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,240
However, the lead is there.

520
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,320
I'm newly appointed, and it's my duty to investigate.

521
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,760
I have to look into it.

522
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,720
I hope you understand.

523
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,950
It's only right to cooperate.

524
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,070
Then, forgive me for any offense.

525
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,200
Search!

526
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,360
Master Zheng,

527
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,150
may I ask where your son Zheng Wu is now?

528
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,470
Zheng Wu, he... he should be...

529
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,920
Where were you?

530
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,470
Reporting to Father,

531
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,590
feeling bored and alone,

532
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,950
so I went to the lakeside pavilion for a few drinks.

533
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,630
Were you... alone?

534
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,400
Master, I was with Mr. Wu.

535
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,070
Wu, if there was indeed someone else present,

536
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,070
you should say so now.

537
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,920
Today, Inspector Zhang is here

538
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,400
investigating a murder case.

539
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,800
Murder?

540
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,920
I was simply drinking with Garuda.

541
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,720
How could this have anything to do with a murder?

542
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,400
Zheng Wu, look closely at this garment.

543
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,200
Do you recognize it?

544
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,880
Responding to Inspector Zhang,

545
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,430
I have dozens of pieces,

546
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,950
worn or unworn.

547
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,550
I give away quite a few as well.

548
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,720
This one...

549
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,990
I don't remember it.

550
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,720
It was found at the crime scene,

551
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,070
and it was found in your trunk.

552
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,400
Do you dare say you don't recognize it?

553
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,950
I...

554
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,320
Inspector Zhang, Father,

555
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,430
maybe some thief secretly wore it.

556
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,280
How could Zheng Wu be a murderer?

557
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,360
So, you mean to say someone is framing him?

558
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,880
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

559
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,150
But given the severity,

560
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,360
Master Zheng, since the Zheng family is implicated,

561
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,050
I still need an explanation.

562
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,030
Master!

563
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,800
Master!

564
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,280
Master!

565
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,430
Master, bad news!

566
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:13,320
Two of the elders are causing an uproar in the ancestral hall.

567
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,240
Seems to be about Mr. Wu committing murder.

568
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,950
This matter hasn't been resolved yet.

569
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,280
What are they trying to do?

570
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,510
Father,

571
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,920
perhaps the elders

572
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,510
have been misled by outside rumors.

573
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,680
The Zhe Chong Fu handles cases

574
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,590
without leaking a trace of information.

575
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:27,760
Yes.

576
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,800
Master Zheng,

577
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,470
I shouldn't interfere in your family matters,

578
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,360
but since the two elders are here over this case,

579
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:44,360
might I visit the ancestral hall?

580
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,320
The ancestral hall is sacred ground.

581
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,320
Outsiders typically aren't allowed.

582
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,400
But as the Inspector of Huainandao,

583
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,510
you're both an esteemed official and honored guest.

584
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,630
This case is significant,

585
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,430
and it concerns the Zheng family.

586
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,510
Please, help us uphold justice.

587
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,280
Much obliged, Master Zheng.

588
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,030
After you.

589
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,030
Here they come.

590
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,430
The Zheng family has maintained its good name for centuries.

591
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,880
We can't let it be ruined by an unfilial son!

592
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,920
Brother, lower your voice.

593
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,110
This is hardly a point of pride.

594
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,060
This scoundrel,

595
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,760
who else could it be?

596
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,630
We don't know the full story yet,

597
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,920
and here you are making a scene in the ancestral hall.

598
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,400
Are you trying to give Inspector Zhang a show?

599
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,470
Inspector Zhang.

600
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,070
No need for such formality, elders.

601
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Eldest Brother,

602
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,680
the inspector is here.

603
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,070
If Zheng Wu is convicted,

604
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,510
what will people think the Zheng family,

605
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,550
the head of Yangzhou's Jewel Guild?

606
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,590
Second Uncle, please calm down.

607
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,150
Inspector Zhang is here.

608
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,720
Until we get to the bottom of this,

609
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,200
let's not speak recklessly.

610
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,800
For my father's sake,

611
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,950
please, you and Third Uncle, return for now.

612
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,510
Elders, please stay.

613
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,280
I'm puzzled by one thing.

614
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,550
Why did you arrive

615
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,030
right after Inspector Zhang?

616
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,680
Have you planted informants

617
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,680
in the government?

618
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:31,630
You...

619
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,760
How dare you slander your elders!

620
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,400
Zheng Wu wouldn't commit murder!

621
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,360
- Master. - Mom.

622
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,280
You can't let outsiders falsely accuse our son!

623
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,320
A mere concubine,

624
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,760
how dare you trespass in the ancestral hall

625
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,030
and call the family elders "outsiders"?

626
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,430
Such insolence!

627
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,630
Guards, drag her out!

628
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,470
Don't touch me!

629
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
I'm a rightful concubine!

630
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,680
Your Cui family committed fraud with tribute pearls.

631
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,400
Now that your family has fallen,

632
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,150
can you claim to be spotless?

633
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,990
You... such insolence!

634
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,360
Drag her out, now!

635
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:01,620
- Master... - Don't listen to her nonsense!

636
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,030
Enough, all of you!

637
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,070
Inspector Zhang is still here.

638
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,360
Do you realize how disgraceful you're acting?

639
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
Zheng Wu...

640
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,680
I believe you didn't commit murder.

641
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,070
But do you dare swear it before our ancestors?

642
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,800
Why wouldn't I?

643
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,240
By the honor of my ancestors,

644
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,720
Zheng Family's Zheng Wu...

645
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,800
Eldest Brother!

646
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,470
- The ancestors are angry! - By the ancestors...

647
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,680
The ancestors are angry!

648
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,250
The ancestors are expelling this illegitimate son!

649
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,030
Yes, indeed!

650
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,110
What should we do?

651
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:40,960
Eldest Brother,

652
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,990
make a decision!

653
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,680
This is a grave matter!

654
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,320
What should we do?

655
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,110
Quickly,

656
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,720
fetch the other elders!

657
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:47,470
Okay.

658
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,680
Ancestors, calm your rage!

659
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,510
Master Zheng, this is of utmost importance.

660
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,630
Since the Zheng family is all gathered here,

661
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,920
seal the doors.

662
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,030
I'll question each person, one by one.

663
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:00,880
Master, Mr. Xu from the Grand Governor's Office is here!

664
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,150
Jinran,

665
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,510
you've come to Yangzhou,

666
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,150
why didn't you inform me beforehand

667
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,800
so I could come greet you?

668
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,030
You see, I had to search high and low.

669
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,360
Something came up along the way,

670
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,630
so I've been in Yangzhou for two days.

671
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,990
This is the ancestral hall of the Zheng family, right?

672
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:23,630
