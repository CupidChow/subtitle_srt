00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,156
(This drama is fictional and
does not accurately depict...)

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,140
(actual people, incidents,
or a specific period.)

00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,580
(Violent scenes may appear,
so viewer discretion is advised.)

00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:15,119
(Episode 1)

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,099
(Hamju Fortress)

6
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:56,730
(Hamju Fortress:
Present day Hamheung Fortress)

7
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,969
(Tae Jong (Yi Bang Won):
3rd King of Joseon Dynasty)

8
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:21,779
Your Highness.

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,049
What we saw at Gaema Plateau...

10
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,370
If they get out of here,

11
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,630
Joseon will be no more.

12
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:44,769
We must find the leader and behead it.

13
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,290
Leave it.

14
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,450
Give up your lives...

15
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:03,290
and protect Joseon!

16
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,820
Protect the Majesty!

17
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,419
(Be our guardian against
the malice and tricks of Satan.)

18
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,919
(Disappear!)

19
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,790
(In the name of the Father, Son,
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.)

20
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,570
(Defend those in battle.)

21
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,070
(Be our guardian against
the malice and tricks of Satan.)

22
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,880
(Look at our Father's cross!)

23
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:04,709
(Look at our Father's cross!)

24
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,039
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

25
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,469
Bang Won.

26
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,380
Bang Won.

27
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:48,380
Bang Won.

28
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,050
Father?

29
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,860
Your Majesty, pull yourself together.

30
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:01,630
You must break from the ghost of Azazel.

31
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,170
Do not be stupid.

32
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,469
That is my father.

33
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,349
Your Majesty.

34
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,079
Bang Won.

35
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,620
This is your brother Bang Seok's blood.

36
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:32,619
(Lee Bang Seok: Tae Jong's youngest
brother whom he killed to become king.)

37
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,200
Azazel.

38
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:43,070
You dare insult my father?

39
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,010
I will kill you for this.

40
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:40,760
Bang Won.

41
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,469
You killed your brother
with your own hands.

42
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,839
The same will happen to your sons.

43
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,279
Your Majesty!

44
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,349
Please calm down!

45
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,749
That is not your late father!

46
00:08:36,589 --> 00:08:37,820
Your Majesty!

47
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,650
- Calm down!
- Your Majesty!

48
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:48,060
(Dear Father in heaven.)

49
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,369
(Your Name shines in glory.)

50
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,599
(May your kingdom come, )

51
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,739
(so your will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.)

52
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,509
(Give us this day our daily bread.)

53
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,050
(We forgive those who have wronged us.)

54
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,320
(Forgive us our sins, )

55
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,020
(do not let us fall into temptation, )

56
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,390
(and save us from evil. Amen.)

57
00:09:57,099 --> 00:09:58,099
I...

58
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:01,770
killed the undead.

59
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,910
To save Joseon...

60
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,640
I killed the undead.

61
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,040
(10 years later)

62
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:33,359
(Nearby Uiju, Near the frontiers of Ming)

63
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,020
Your... Your Highness.

64
00:11:59,349 --> 00:12:00,719
- Ji Gyeom.
- Your Highness.

65
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:09,129
- Why is this...
- Let... Let go...

66
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,700
Your Highness.

67
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:22,810
(Changdeokgung Palace, Hanyang)

68
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,379
Yang Nyung tells me to be strict.

69
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:30,020
And Choong Nyung tells me to be gentle.

70
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,589
I listened to them both.

71
00:12:34,859 --> 00:12:38,690
They say the father should be strict,
and the mother should be gentle.

72
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,959
You are right, Your Highness.

73
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,570
Today is the day my hawk
ends its training...

74
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,039
and goes hunting for the first time.

75
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,969
I wanted to go with both my brothers,

76
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:53,310
so it is a pity.

77
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,339
You can think of today as practice.

78
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,299
If your hawk successfully
finishes its hunt,

79
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,619
you can show it to them then.

80
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,079
Okay.

81
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,589
I cannot wait to find out
what they have to say about it.

82
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:13,729
There we go.

83
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,440
Okay, Haedong.

84
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,379
Go fly!

85
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:42,489
Your... Your Highness!
You... You are bleeding!

86
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,200
It is okay. I have been hurt a lot worse.

87
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,030
But still...

88
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,999
My hawk must have spotted a prey already.

89
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,209
Yes! Go on, Haedong!

90
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,310
- Go get it!
- Your Highness!

91
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,050
Your Highness!

92
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,060
Go and check what it is
that Haedong caught.

93
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,520
Yes, Your Highness.

94
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,050
What is it?

95
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,790
What did Haedong catch?

96
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:51,859
Is it a rat?

97
00:14:54,829 --> 00:14:55,859
Sa Gi.

98
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,550
Your Highness.

99
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:17,050
Your Highness, you must go.

100
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,229
What are you doing?
Escort his Highness right now!

101
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,709
Your Highness, you must run.

102
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:44,950
You must run away right now!

103
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,020
Your Highness, you need to go!

104
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,219
Your Highness!

105
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,390
How dare you!

106
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,330
Stay still.

107
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,920
Have you forgotten
that I am equivalent to the skies?

108
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,330
If you add...

109
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,469
a stroke to the word "sky",
it turns into the word "husband".

110
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,239
Today, I am your husband,

111
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,440
so you can be the one lying down.

112
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,979
Minister of War, you are here.

113
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,959
- Tell him I am here.
- The thing is...

114
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,559
You pathetic punk.

115
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,860
You should know what is best
for His Highness.

116
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,100
Your Highness, it is I,
the minister of war. I will go inside.

117
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,380
What brings my father-in-law
all the way here?

118
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:03,029
Did your daughter tell you to check...

119
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:04,979
whom I am having an affair with?

120
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,630
I am not here as my daughter's father.

121
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,356
I am here to see you
as the minister of war...

122
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,249
and your loyal subject.

123
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,566
Defending the fortress was the first thing
His Majesty ordered...

124
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,890
after he became King.

125
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,600
You have been spending the past year
pleasing His Majesty.

126
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,070
And now you are suddenly
acting like you are my loyal subject?

127
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,469
From how I see it,

128
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,110
it looks like you came
to keep an eye on me...

129
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,015
because you are scared
she might get pregnant with a prince...

130
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,215
and squeeze out the child
that your daughter gave birth to.

131
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:37,279
Is that correct?

132
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,219
It has only been two days
since His Majesty banned everyone...

133
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,120
from holding festivals
and drinking alcohol.

134
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,729
You talk as if you have
many lives to spare.

135
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,529
If you die
while taking His Majesty's side,

136
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,749
do you think anyone will be able
to help you come back to life?

137
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,779
I am not the person
you should be trying to kill.

138
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,500
If you want to inherit the throne
and become the king,

139
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,049
you need to kill those who have
disappeared from Bakseok hill.

140
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,350
A monstrous being...

141
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,690
that sucked the blood of its own child
has appeared in Bakseok hill.

142
00:20:21,719 --> 00:20:23,295
(Monstrous being: An unknown creature
that is hard to explain in words)

143
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,959
They are dead but alive,

144
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,190
so the commoners call it the "undead".

145
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,430
"The undead"?

146
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:30,029
That is not all.

147
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,176
The mother and children
who got bitten by the undead...

148
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,900
also turned into the same creatures.

149
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,269
They eventually sucked the blood
of their neighbors...

150
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,370
and turned the entire area
into a place filled with the undead.

151
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:46,370
Father.

152
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,529
Father...

153
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:39,360
Seok Joong.

154
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,370
No one...

155
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:50,739
should know about
what happened here today.

156
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:51,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

157
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,199
The first order my father gave
after returning...

158
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,479
was the reinforcement
of the fort security?

159
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,950
Yes, Your Highness.

160
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,190
Lord Choong Nyung sneaked out after him...

161
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,420
and was nearly harmed.

162
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,130
Why on earth would he...

163
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,799
So how is he? Is he all right?

164
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,529
From what I hear, His Majesty
ordered him to Uiju.

165
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,600
Uiju? Why there of all places?

166
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,739
It probably has to do with the undead.

167
00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:28,410
What do these so-called "undead"...

168
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,910
look like anyway?

169
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,009
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

170
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:36,380
- Gosh.
- My gosh.

171
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,890
- Was someone hurt?
- Goodness, me.

172
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:40,789
Are you all right?

173
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,890
You imbeciles must have a death will.

174
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:46,130
Have you forgotten
who occupies this carriage?

175
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,529
Forgive me, sir.

176
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,700
But the carriage kept getting heavier.

177
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:50,729
He's right.

178
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,069
I'd say we were carrying a mountain.

179
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,799
You idiots.

180
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,400
Only the lady
and her newborn are in there.

181
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Who could have added more weight to it?

182
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:00,715
Lift it back up this instant!

183
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,779
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:03,340
All right. Here we go.

185
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,950
1, 2, 3.

186
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,420
(Sookchung Gate)

187
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,890
- Where are you coming from?
- Yangju, Your Highness.

188
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:19,029
Where in Yangju?

189
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,090
Gupabal, Your Highness.

190
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,459
Gupabal right next to Bakseok Hill?

191
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,799
Yes, but why do you ask...

192
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,100
I am the butler for Minister Ha.

193
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,840
His daughter-in-law went to her parents'
to have her child...

194
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,769
and we were escorting her back.

195
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,140
Her condition worsened though,
so we were hurrying.

196
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,350
Even the noble are subjects of the nation.

197
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,150
Forgive me, Your Highness,
but the lady is tremendously sick

198
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,180
and her child's life is touch and go.

199
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:46,190
Please let us hurry through.

200
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,959
Ha Won Ik is the son of Lord Ha,
a founding contributor,

201
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,930
and a supporter of your abdication.

202
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:53,309
They should be let through.

203
00:24:56,499 --> 00:24:57,729
If that is the case...

204
00:24:57,769 --> 00:24:59,600
Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you.

205
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,440
Don't just sit there. Carry the lady in.

206
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,469
- 1, 2, 3.
- 1, 2, 3.

207
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:07,039
All right.

208
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,979
Stop right there.

209
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,259
This is the smell of a corpse's blood.

210
00:25:27,489 --> 00:25:29,209
Why would it be dripping
from this carriage?

211
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,600
Lower the carriage.

212
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:39,269
Your Highness, please.

213
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,269
Move! Your Highness!

214
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,549
- Your Highness.
- What are you doing here?

215
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,650
The Queen ordered your return
to Changdeokgung Palace.

216
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,289
My mother? What for?

217
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,029
His Majesty announced
the beheading of Lord Kang Nyung.

218
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,430
What?

219
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,999
Keep this carriage where it is...

220
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,529
and escort Eo Ri home.

221
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,870
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Come.

222
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,539
But Your Highness!

223
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,410
What will we do now?

224
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,979
My lady, bear a few moments.

225
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,479
I'll notify the Lord beyond the gates.

226
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,910
- Gi Bok.
- Yes?

227
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,180
Find the lord within the castle...

228
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,779
and notify him
of the lady's severe condition.

229
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,590
Ask him to make a path for her. Hurry.

230
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,650
Yes, sir!

231
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Father!

232
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,259
Please spare my life.

233
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,459
This is not because I do not love you.

234
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,529
But to save the entirety of Joseon,

235
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:44,799
this must be done.

236
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:47,370
Now, let me proceed.

237
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,269
No, you cannot do this, Your Majesty.

238
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,009
My Queen.

239
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,239
Mu Gu, Mu Ji, Mu Hyul,
and the youngest Mu Ui.

240
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,950
Has killing my brothers
not been enough for you?

241
00:28:00,249 --> 00:28:02,719
Must I witness you killing
my youngest son too?

242
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,519
You know very well
what happens to those...

243
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,459
bitten by the undead.

244
00:28:10,459 --> 00:28:11,459
Now, move.

245
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,959
Look at him, Your Majesty.

246
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,400
In what way does he look
like an undead to you?

247
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,269
See it with your own eyes!

248
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:23,299
Show her your hand.

249
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,709
Show her the back of your hand.

250
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:50,660
Mother, it is not true.

251
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,999
I was only scratched by Haedong.

252
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,469
When I set Haedong into the air,

253
00:28:57,739 --> 00:28:59,969
it accidentally scratched
the back of my hand.

254
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,979
Mother!

255
00:29:06,749 --> 00:29:09,920
Mother, I do not want to die. Mother!

256
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:11,450
Look, Your Majesty.

257
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,850
He was injured more than two hours ago.

258
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,759
All he has are bruises though. He's fine.

259
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,330
The undead is something
you can't possibly fathom!

260
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:21,559
You're wrong!

261
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,529
Back in 1408, I heard there were people...

262
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:27,269
who did not transform
after being exposed to the disease.

263
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,200
Am I wrong?

264
00:29:31,209 --> 00:29:32,269
Your Majesty,

265
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:35,640
we will soon be in the heart of winter.

266
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,650
Please give him until early spring.

267
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:43,680
We will have Choong Nyung bring
the western exorcist to the palace...

268
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:46,219
and have him cure our son.

269
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:48,319
If you cannot allow that,

270
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,759
then kill me first
if you wish to end his life.

271
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,660
Go through me first!

272
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:14,189
You have only until
Choong Nyung gets here.

273
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,390
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

274
00:30:22,719 --> 00:30:23,759
Mother...

275
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:26,959
It is all right, my son.

276
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,130
It will be all right.

277
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
My son.

278
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,380
Bring ice from the seobinggo to slow down
the progression of the disease.

279
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,410
No one is to be near him.

280
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Anyone...

281
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,880
who goes against my words will be
heavily punished regardless of rank.

282
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

283
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,080
I came as soon as I heard
of Kang Nyung's accident.

284
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:05,229
I ordered you to reinforce
the security of the fortress,

285
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,299
but you are still drunk on
wine, women, and dice.

286
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,170
How pathetic.

287
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
That is right.

288
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:19,569
This pathetic son indulged in a drink.

289
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,380
The undead surface out of nowhere...

290
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,850
to threaten the fate of this nation,

291
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,420
but its crown prince...

292
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,959
is kept in the dark
defending a mere fortress.

293
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,259
The humiliation manifested into anger,
so I drank.

294
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,759
Is that not allowed?

295
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,200
The undead that made it
into Changdeokgung Palace.

296
00:32:58,049 --> 00:33:00,049
It was a military officer from Yangju.

297
00:33:01,249 --> 00:33:03,850
If you had done your job
securing the gates,

298
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,719
this wouldn't have happened!

299
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:13,130
Your younger brother
was attacked by an undead!

300
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,840
If you had told me what the undead are,

301
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,670
I would have made sure
nothing got past me.

302
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,910
So today's event happened...

303
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,140
because I did not inform you
of the danger?

304
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:32,910
I am your son
and the crown prince of the nation.

305
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,549
Even if all I do is
drink, chase skirts, and hunt,

306
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,150
I should have at least been
the first brother to know...

307
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:41,789
about a danger that may threaten
this nation's existence.

308
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:45,789
That is one lousy excuse coming
from someone who fooled around...

309
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,700
with his grandfather's concubine
and with a noble's concubine...

310
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,569
named Eo Ri.

311
00:33:55,239 --> 00:33:56,299
Also,

312
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,910
whom I inform first is my choice to make.

313
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,460
Guard.

314
00:34:18,129 --> 00:34:19,160
Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:21,029
Find whoever opened the South Gate...

316
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,160
out of the guards
who were on patrol last night.

317
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,669
The same goes to anyone
who was involved or turned a blind eye.

318
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,700
I will slay...

319
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,739
each and every one of them.

320
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,129
This is Father John
who was sent by Pope Gregory XII...

321
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,200
upon the request of Father Nicholas...

322
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,560
and the King of Joseon.

323
00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:08,069
I am the interpreter Marco.

324
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:10,000
(Father.)

325
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,370
And this is a letter sent
by Pope Gregory XII himself.

326
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:23,680
Thank you for making
this long and exhausting trip.

327
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:27,210
I dare express my gratitude...

328
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,250
on behalf of the King and Joseon.

329
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,219
(He's grateful.)

330
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:39,919
- Is that it?
- Their language is kept simple.

331
00:36:46,899 --> 00:36:50,469
He wants you to tell him
about the recent events.

332
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:53,739
At a place called Bakseok Hill,
monstrous beings...

333
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,770
who suck the blood of people emerged.

334
00:36:55,969 --> 00:36:58,379
How is it that they wake up after dying...

335
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,250
and suck the blood of the living?
Please ask him.

336
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,719
I see you people
call them "monstrous beings".

337
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,189
How dare you.

338
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,630
You will speak with respect
when addressing His Highness.

339
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:15,790
How dare you!

340
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,100
You are the one
who is showing disrespect!

341
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,430
Father John and I
are messengers of the pope...

342
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:23,739
and have traveled
miles across land and sea...

343
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:26,600
upon the request of your king
to perform exorcism.

344
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:30,640
So who do you think
you are pointing your sword at?

345
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,779
Can I assume
you are acting as the King's proxy?

346
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,049
How dare you!

347
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:44,089
You dare yell at him?

348
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,319
Ji Gyeom.

349
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:51,930
The interpreter is right.

350
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,529
You will apologize, Ji Gyeom.

351
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,569
I am... sorry.

352
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,910
- Is that it?
- What?

353
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,080
I asked if that is all you have to say.

354
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,919
He is an exorcist of the Vatican
who traveled miles across land and sea.

355
00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:13,219
Your Highness?

356
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,890
(Marco.)

357
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,589
(That's enough.)

358
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,960
(Please tell him that we should hurry
to Hamju Fortress.)

359
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:23,960
Tell him that we should
go to Hanyang, not Hamju Fortress.

360
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:26,700
Hamju, Hanyang, or what not.

361
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,870
Do you really think you will get away
after treating...

362
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:31,969
the western exorcist like this?

363
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,450
I am finally here.

364
00:38:45,049 --> 00:38:48,219
I will be partying with
a couple of gisaengs by my side tonight.

365
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,149
(Father, )

366
00:38:50,189 --> 00:38:52,120
(let's hurry in. Come on.)

367
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:55,029
I am here. It is me, Mak...

368
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,129
I mean, it is me, Marco!

369
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,230
Here, here!

370
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,330
Is anyone here?

371
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:05,839
Did they all go for a walk?

372
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:09,040
Come hither!

373
00:39:20,219 --> 00:39:21,620
Call my mother.

374
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,560
I said call my mother!

375
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,290
Mother!

376
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,500
Choong Nyung!

377
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,899
The eunuchs and court maids
that were bitten.

378
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,870
Were there any other witnesses?

379
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:42,839
Fortunately, they were the only ones.

380
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,140
Seok Joong.

381
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,379
What do you think?

382
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,350
I am sorry to say this...

383
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:51,855
(Hong Seok Joong, Chief Royal Secretary)

384
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:54,049
But behead Lord Kang Nyung
before it is too late.

385
00:39:55,319 --> 00:39:57,919
The undead on Bakseok Hill
were eliminated swiftly,

386
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,800
so we were able to prevent
word from spreading.

387
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,960
But if you let Lord Kang Nyung live,
how will you control...

388
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:04,629
the numerous witnesses within the palace?

389
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:07,529
It is only a matter of time before
rumors that the plague is back...

390
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:08,799
spreads within Hanyang.

391
00:40:09,129 --> 00:40:12,439
Let us wait only until
Choong Nyung returns.

392
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,700
Your Majesty.

393
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,939
Do not think you can do what you did
at Hamju Fortress in 1408.

394
00:40:19,379 --> 00:40:20,609
These undead...

395
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,810
are different.

396
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,189
Do you have wine?

397
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,890
My mouth turns dry
if I do not have wine each day.

398
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:44,270
Your Highness. I heard Western exorcists
are like Buddhist monks.

399
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:46,969
They do not marry
and stay away from women and drink.

400
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,870
Could these two be frauds?

401
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:51,609
I am not sure about women,

402
00:40:52,109 --> 00:40:54,350
but I heard they drink alcohol
made with western grapes.

403
00:40:54,779 --> 00:40:56,850
That interpreter called Malko or Marco...

404
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,020
would even enjoy a gisaeng's company.

405
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:01,520
Shall I teach him a lesson?

406
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,089
He has been wandering foreign countries
after he lost his own.

407
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,040
How could he be favorable towards us?

408
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:09,089
Let that slide.

409
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:10,460
But how can you,

410
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:13,160
a prince, enter a gisaeng's room
with that interpreter?

411
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:14,846
My great-great-grandfather King Mokjo...

412
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:17,600
eloped to Samcheok
for the love of a gisaeng.

413
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,799
His blood flows in my veins.

414
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:26,540
Are you saying...

415
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:28,980
I can never come to power.

416
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:30,819
Before I get on Yang Nyung's bad side,

417
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:33,750
I am considering taking up
on alcohol and women.

418
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,259
Will you teach me a few things, Ji Gyeom?

419
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:43,759
I am not an expert,
but I know pretty much...

420
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,370
I apologize. This is my first time also.

421
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:13,489
Father. What are all those things?

422
00:42:14,089 --> 00:42:17,799
The one who knows that is coming to Uiju.

423
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,969
You will get the answer from him.

424
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,469
Am I allowed to go...

425
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,540
instead of Yang Nyung?

426
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,210
It is not a task...

427
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:30,239
for the Crown Prince.

428
00:42:34,049 --> 00:42:35,049
I understand.

429
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:39,520
I will bring that man safely to Hanyang.

430
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:30,299
Where is the next course?

431
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,609
Is there not enough food?

432
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,969
Why are you so old-fashioned?

433
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:38,739
Hey.

434
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:41,049
Call the head gisaeng.

435
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,000
(Head gisaeng: The gisaeng
with the highest rank)

436
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:04,040
What are you doing? Come on out.

437
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:43,189
Who is it?

438
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,040
Is the man who went to get the gisaeng
playing house with her?

439
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,549
Hey. You go and get her.

440
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,390
"Monstrous beings".

441
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,589
What does that mean?

442
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,730
Confucius said one must not speak of
monsters or insurgents.

443
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,930
A wise ruler should not...

444
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,299
speak of beings with strange powers
or those who disrupt order.

445
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,799
That is Confucius' teaching,

446
00:47:25,669 --> 00:47:28,870
and that is why
we call strange entities by that term.

447
00:47:31,439 --> 00:47:33,080
"Pater"?

448
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:37,080
Pater? Do you speak Latin?

449
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:39,520
That is what you say to him,

450
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,719
so I assumed he's called "Pater".

451
00:47:43,149 --> 00:47:44,359
So I said it.

452
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,759
I see. Anyway,

453
00:47:52,129 --> 00:47:54,299
you have a very quick mind.

454
00:48:05,609 --> 00:48:09,410
He thinks they are spirits
that came to Goryeo...

455
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:10,879
through merchants from the west.

456
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,020
Then if we catch the spirit,

457
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,089
can those who were possessed
return to normal?

458
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,859
- Of course.
- Is that true?

459
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,136
Then the people who were
bitten by the undead at Bakseok Hill...

460
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,469
can all be saved.

461
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,100
That is good. That is very good.

462
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,939
Hey. If you got what you wanted,

463
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,410
you should satisfy me now.

464
00:48:39,779 --> 00:48:43,649
Since no one will help,
I must find her myself.

465
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,319
Not you. The pretty one.

466
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:11,939
(Look at our Father's cross.
I command you.)

467
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,109
(Unclean spirit, disappear!)

468
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,850
(Unclean spirit, disappear!)

469
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:19,480
Right now!

470
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,819
(Show yourself, you demon!)

471
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,089
(Who are you?)

472
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,089
(Demon! Show yourself!)

473
00:49:31,629 --> 00:49:36,469
(I command you
in the name of Jesus Christ, )

474
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,299
(your impure soul does not belong to you!)

475
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:43,370
(Leave this body right now.)

476
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:54,390
Is this the same creature
from Bakseok Hill?

477
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,760
Yes, it seems so, Your Majesty.

478
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:57,689
How did it manage to come this far?

479
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,540
(My Lord, the creator
and protector of mankind.)

480
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,339
(Have mercy on your servants
whom you have created in your own form, )

481
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,640
(and protect us from this battle.)

482
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,710
(I command you in the name of God,
leave this woman's body!)

483
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,810
(Go burn in hell!)

484
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:37,560
Did you see that?

485
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,500
This is what you call exorcism.

486
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:43,770
Father John is a top-class priest
from the Vatican,

487
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:45,799
and it is something
that only he can perform.

488
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,149
Your Highness.

489
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:18,399
Your Highness!

490
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,239
Your Highness!

491
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:00,710
What did you just do?

492
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:03,710
Why did you behead this woman?

493
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:06,049
I saved you from trouble,

494
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,549
and you are asking me why?

495
00:52:09,549 --> 00:52:10,620
You fools.

496
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,160
You should have thought of a way
to save her!

497
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:17,730
Beheading them is the only way
to kill them.

498
00:52:18,029 --> 00:52:20,529
You talk as if you know another way
to save them.

499
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,509
Your Highness! Your Highness!

500
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,580
His Majesty is here.

501
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:01,140
Father.

502
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:03,910
I am scared, Father.

503
00:53:04,009 --> 00:53:05,509
Take the shaman away.

504
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,100
She is Mu Hwa,
the official shaman of the palace.

505
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:16,390
I asked the best shaman in Joseon
to cure him.

506
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:18,165
Why would you tell them to take her away?

507
00:53:18,189 --> 00:53:20,136
If the best shaman in Joseon
could get rid of them,

508
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,629
we would have done so already.

509
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,660
Then are you saying...

510
00:53:22,689 --> 00:53:24,529
Do not do anything...

511
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:26,830
until Choong Nyung comes back.

512
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,770
What are you doing?

513
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:30,700
Escort her back to her palace.

514
00:53:30,799 --> 00:53:31,939
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:39,640
Let us go, Your Majesty.

516
00:53:54,859 --> 00:53:57,899
What did you do to the bodies
of the court maids and eunuchs...

517
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,436
who got bitten in Changdeokgung Palace?

518
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,300
We beheaded everyone
and burned their bodies...

519
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:03,730
regardless of whether or not
they were still alive.

520
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:06,899
Then I ordered them to bury their bodies
10km away from the palace.

521
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:19,419
As of this moment,

522
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,489
I want you to shut all the city gates...

523
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:24,560
including the gates of the palace.

524
00:54:25,089 --> 00:54:26,819
Do not let anyone inside...

525
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:29,060
until Choong Nyung returns.

526
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,730
If anyone disobeys this order,

527
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,600
I will behead you first.

528
00:54:33,529 --> 00:54:36,700
So you had better keep that in mind.
Do you understand?

529
00:54:37,029 --> 00:54:40,870
But Your Majesty, if we ban the city
from letting in goods from the suburbs,

530
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,140
the people in the city will not
be able to last three days.

531
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,080
What is it that is inside
Lord Kang Nyung's body?

532
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:49,250
Why must you give such strict orders?

533
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,319
By any chance,

534
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,456
does this have anything to do
with the court maids and eunuchs...

535
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,040
that got bitten and lost their lives
inside Changdeokgung Palace?

536
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,689
Do not ask any more questions.

537
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,160
The fate of Joseon lies in this matter.

538
00:55:01,759 --> 00:55:03,160
I must go to Mount Samgak.

539
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:04,976
Hong Seok Joong,
I want you to come with me.

540
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,636
As for the chief state councilor
and Jo Hae Ryung,

541
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,476
I want you to strengthen
the security of the fortress.

542
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,100
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

543
00:55:12,669 --> 00:55:13,739
Father!

544
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:15,910
Father!

545
00:55:30,189 --> 00:55:36,390
(Gwanghwamun Gate)

546
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,240
What do you think you are doing?

547
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,200
Your Highness.

548
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,140
Are you okay?

549
00:55:51,839 --> 00:55:52,879
What?

550
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,250
Do you think your men will help you?

551
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,649
What have you done?

552
00:55:59,549 --> 00:56:01,120
What happened to our men?

553
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,919
By any chance, are they the creatures
that appeared ten years ago...

554
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:05,719
at Hamju Fortress?

555
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,036
I heard those who suffered
from the plague...

556
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,060
sucked the blood of humans
just like they did.

557
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:13,529
Who are you people?

558
00:56:18,299 --> 00:56:19,640
We saved your life,

559
00:56:19,899 --> 00:56:21,569
so let us take Wang Yu.

560
00:56:22,169 --> 00:56:23,739
You just need to stay out of it.

561
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,410
That will solve everything.

562
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:27,109
What are you talking about?

563
00:56:27,379 --> 00:56:29,109
Have you lost your minds?

564
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,910
He is not Wang Yu.

565
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,120
He is Lord Choong Nyung,
the third prince of His Majesty!

566
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,859
Cut the nonsense!

567
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:51,839
Do you think the king is dumb?

568
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,669
What kind of king...

569
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,779
would send his own son
off to chase those monsters?

570
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,609
You are being absurd, you punk.

571
00:57:01,779 --> 00:57:05,319
Listen to that fool talk nonsense.

572
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:06,520
What nonsense.

573
00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:09,620
Did you not hear what I just...

574
00:57:09,649 --> 00:57:10,649
Ji Gyeom.

575
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,589
Put your sword down. They have a point.

576
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:20,600
I am here because I am the third in line.

577
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,600
My eldest brother is the crown prince
who is courageous and brave...

578
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,500
and in the next line to take the throne.

579
00:57:28,509 --> 00:57:31,549
And my second brother is Lord Hyo Ryeong,
a brother who has a generous heart.

580
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,750
Therefore, as His Majesty's third son,

581
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,390
my job is to make sure
the crown prince stays safe...

582
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,680
so that he can safely
take over the throne.

583
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,149
That is my duty,

584
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:47,859
and I will be discarded after that.
That is why I am here.

585
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:53,359
Does that answer your question?

586
00:57:55,629 --> 00:57:57,299
How could you say that, Your Highness?

587
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:58,969
You are breaking my heart.

588
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,200
That is merely the truth.

589
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,270
If you are looking for Wang Yu,

590
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,680
you must be looking for the child
that was born between...

591
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,180
King Gong Yang and his concubine.

592
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,779
I am sorry to tell you
that I am not the man you are looking for.

593
00:58:15,049 --> 00:58:18,489
Judging by what he just said,
he must really be a prince.

594
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,160
Do you not agree?

595
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,129
Hye Yum.

596
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:50,350
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

597
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,319
He looks nothing like Wang Yu.

598
00:58:57,259 --> 00:58:58,660
I apologize.

599
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,040
We saved your life,
so I hope that makes up for this.

600
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:04,000
Watch how you speak to His Highness.

601
00:59:04,029 --> 00:59:05,040
That is enough.

602
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,310
He is right.
We owe him for saving our lives.

603
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,040
We were able to live thanks to you.

604
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:12,580
Thank you.

605
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,080
Thank you for your boundless generosity.
Your Highness.

606
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,695
- Thank you for your boundless generosity.
- Thank you for your boundless generosity.

607
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:20,319
Thanks.

608
00:59:22,419 --> 00:59:27,020
We will go back to where we belong,
Your Highness.

609
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:28,830
Come on!

610
00:59:30,189 --> 00:59:32,160
- I can't believe this.
- Unbelievable.

611
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,399
What is he blabbering at a corpse for?

612
00:59:39,569 --> 00:59:40,569
Let's go.

613
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,710
Ji Gyeom.

614
00:59:48,509 --> 00:59:50,980
(In the name of the Father, Son,
and the Holy Spirit...)

615
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:28,989
Brother.

616
01:00:30,219 --> 01:00:31,419
Don't you worry.

617
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,520
I'll figure out a way.

618
01:00:34,359 --> 01:00:37,060
Please. Please do so.

619
01:00:37,489 --> 01:00:40,529
Yang Nyung, I'm terrified.

620
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,870
Your Highness, there seems to be
an incident at Sookchung Gate.

621
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,370
What?

622
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,469
Marco.

623
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,640
(Defend those in battle.)

624
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:56,339
(Be our guardian against
the malice and tricks of Satan.)

625
01:02:02,879 --> 01:02:05,149
"Our guardian"?

626
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:13,319
Don't just stand there. Hold him down.

627
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,960
(Show yourself, devil.)

628
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,299
(Who are you?)

629
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:25,770
(May the evil spirit show itself.)

630
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,540
We are 1 and 10...

631
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,710
as well as 100 and 1,000.

632
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,279
(Enough with the nonsense. Show yourself!)

633
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:38,680
(Devil, tell me your name.)

634
01:02:43,919 --> 01:02:49,060
We are the soldiers of Azazel.

635
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:50,890
"The soldiers of Azazel"?

636
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,310
Your Highness, are you all right?

637
01:05:30,919 --> 01:05:31,960
Guard.

638
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:34,290
Yes, Your Highness.

639
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,629
Minister Ha's daughter-in-law is missing.

640
01:07:02,109 --> 01:07:06,250
(In the name of God,
I order you to leave his body!)

641
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:08,850
(Go burn in hell!)

642
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:54,700
Did you see that?

643
01:07:55,399 --> 01:07:57,100
This is what we call the "grand exorcism".

644
01:07:57,129 --> 01:07:58,375
(Grand exorcism: An exorcism
that only those selected...)

645
01:07:58,399 --> 01:07:59,445
(by the bishop can perform)

646
01:07:59,469 --> 01:08:04,069
I think I heard the word "Azazel."

647
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:06,540
What exactly is that?

648
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,450
Azazel is the alpha
of western evil spirits...

649
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,920
also known as the Devil of the Wind.

650
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:17,850
"The alpha of evil spirits"?

651
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:20,960
How did it make it to Joseon?

652
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:24,430
How did a western evil spirit...

653
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:27,029
make an appearance in Joseon?

654
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:30,529
The answer to that...

655
01:08:35,139 --> 01:08:36,309
will be better explained...

656
01:08:36,670 --> 01:08:38,790
by your grandfather
and your father, the current King.

657
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,010
(Joseon Exorcist)

658
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:13,115
(We thank Kim Roi Ha, Ahn Kil Kang,
Kim Jung Ho, and David McInnis...)

659
01:09:13,139 --> 01:09:14,379
(for their special appearance.)

660
01:09:26,389 --> 01:09:29,129
Rumor has it that His Majesty
summoned the undead.

661
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,990
Is that vile rumor actually true?

662
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:33,830
And still you expect to be
respectively treated as the crown prince?

663
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:36,129
Who would ever question
Lord Choong Nyung being chosen...

664
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:37,570
as the heir instead of you?

665
01:09:37,599 --> 01:09:39,670
You must regain His Majesty's trust first.

666
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,900
The alpha of evil spirits?

667
01:09:40,939 --> 01:09:42,610
What kind of a being is it?

668
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:44,485
It's the alpha of all evil spirits
that command the dead...

669
01:09:44,509 --> 01:09:45,780
as well as the living.

670
01:09:45,809 --> 01:09:47,540
I am sure you recognize this blade.

671
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:50,049
I do not follow. I am Kang Nyung, Father.

672
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,219
An undead seems to have
gotten beyond the gates.

673
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,420
(Tomorrow night 10pm)
