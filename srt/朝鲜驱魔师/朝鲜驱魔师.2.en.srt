1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,914
(Joseon Exorcist)

2
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:06,243
(This drama is fictional and
does not accurately depict...)

3
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:07,244
(actual people, incidents,
or a specific period.)

4
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:08,414
(Violent scenes may appear,
so viewer discretion is advised.)

5
00:00:09,571 --> 00:00:10,970
"Azazel"? What exactly is that?

6
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:14,071
Azazel is the alpha
of western evil spirits...

7
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,640
also known as the Devil of the Wind.

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,641
How did it make it to Joseon?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,880
The answer to that...

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,790
will be better explained...

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,490
by your grandfather
and your father, the current King.

12
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,691
The undead surfaced...

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,291
because of my father, the current king...

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,930
and my grandfather, the former king?

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,130
(Mount Samgak Temporary Palace)

16
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,340
(Tae Jong (Yi Bang Won):
3rd King of Joseon Dynasty)

17
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:44,361
Earplugs!

18
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:49,870
Put in your earplugs!

19
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,321
Surround him with bronze shields.

20
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:37,611
Hold up the bronze mirror!

21
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,180
Do not think that this is the end.

22
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,680
I...

23
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,611
am imperishable.

24
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,720
(Please save us from evil. Amen)

25
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,800
Could...

26
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,300
the alpha spirit have come back to life?

27
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,141
A few stones moved. That cannot mean
that it came back to life.

28
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,311
Please do not be concerned, Your Majesty.

29
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,741
The alpha is clearly dead.

30
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,241
Then who moved the undead?

31
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,751
If the alpha came back to life
and was headed to Hanyang,

32
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,751
you would have been the first to be
attacked, not the people at Bakseok Hill.

33
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:41,021
But what if it went there
to attack Kang Nyung?

34
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:42,691
I am sure it was just a coincidence.

35
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,391
A coincidence?

36
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:47,931
Then what is inside Kang Nyung now?

37
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:54,540
Go get the guards
at the temporary palace at once.

38
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:56,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

39
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:29,941
Your Highness!

40
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,040
(Sookchung Gate)

41
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:23,491
Why will they not die?

42
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,650
Behead them!

43
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:25,950
Master Cho, what brings you here?

44
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,950
His Majesty has ordered us
to tighten security at night.

45
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,991
(Cho Hwi Ryang: Crown Prince's teacher)

46
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:33,160
We have been advised not to let anyone
into the citadel at night.

47
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,361
How did you know
what to do to kill the undead?

48
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:38,430
His Majesty ordered us to behead them.

49
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:41,200
What are you waiting for?
Burn the undead at once.

50
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,771
And have more soldiers stand guard!

51
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,670
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

52
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,741
Chief Guard! Get my horse ready.

53
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,741
Yes, Your Highness!

54
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,540
Your Highness,
the curfew will commence soon.

55
00:10:50,771 --> 00:10:52,011
Where must you go so late?

56
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,851
I think one of the undead
went into the citadel.

57
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,891
Well done.

58
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:28,211
(Yim Tae Mi: Chief Magistrate
of the Capital District)

59
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:17,660
Your Highness.

60
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,330
Find the lady who was in the carriage.

61
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,241
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,231
Your Highness, she is not here.
Not in the guest room or the quarters.

63
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,830
(Naedang: Women's quarters)

64
00:12:55,001 --> 00:12:57,300
A woman, who seemed to be Minister Ha's
daughter-in-law, disappeared.

65
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,040
Search the entire area and find her.

66
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:01,101
Yes, Your Highness.

67
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,170
What about Eo Ri?

68
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:05,841
The thing is...

69
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:09,851
Your Highness!

70
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,221
Move all the dead bodies
to the storage room.

71
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:17,420
Take care of the other corpses first.

72
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,721
Once that is done,
you may join me in the search.

73
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,861
Make sure the word does not get out!

74
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:23,891
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

75
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:10,070
Your Majesty.

76
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:12,910
This man says
that he saw something strange.

77
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,180
Tell His Majesty what you saw.

78
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:24,450
Commoners cannot enter
the temporary palace.

79
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:27,261
How did a mere lumberjack like you...

80
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,690
get into this palace?

81
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:32,461
I was digging up kudzu roots
with Park in the woods.

82
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:36,271
But he suddenly lost his footing
and fell near the palace.

83
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,101
He hurt his head badly
and was on the verge of death.

84
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,910
You fool! Why are you so clumsy?

85
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:46,410
Park! Hey!

86
00:14:47,881 --> 00:14:48,881
Park!

87
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Park!

88
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,391
And for some reason, he kept trying
to get rid of the stones...

89
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,030
covering this well.

90
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:09,761
Then a snake crawled out of the well
and bit him on the neck.

91
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:13,131
But he did not seem scared,
nor did he try to run from the snake.

92
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:15,361
It seemed as if
he had been waiting to be bitten.

93
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,400
It was as if he was possessed
by the snake.

94
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,080
And then...

95
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,711
Park!

96
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,011
Park!

97
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:44,261
And soon after that,
blood started coming out from everywhere,

98
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,731
and he suddenly turned pale.

99
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,400
Then, he vomited blood and died.

100
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,341
And after that, he came back to life?

101
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,670
- Oh, dear.
- Goodness.

102
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,940
After I heard the news,
I went to take care of his dead body,

103
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,410
but he had already bitten
his children and wife...

104
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,611
and disappeared.

105
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:06,620
He disappeared after he bit them?

106
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:08,550
Did you find his body?

107
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,620
Not yet, Your Majesty.

108
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,961
Find Park's body.

109
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,560
If the alpha used Park's body
to come back to life,

110
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:21,130
he might have switched the host
to another merchant or soldier's body...

111
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,530
before he attacked Kang Nyung.

112
00:18:20,221 --> 00:18:21,221
Your Highness.

113
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,701
(Eo Ri: Yang Nyung's lover)

114
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,751
Why do you have your sword out?

115
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,120
It is nothing.

116
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,620
It is cold outside.
You should come on inside.

117
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:09,070
Chief Guard.

118
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:11,411
I will look for Minister Ha's
daughter-in-law.

119
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,110
I want you to search the women's quarters.

120
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:14,481
Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:19:14,511 --> 00:19:17,080
What is going on?
Why must you do this at this hour?

122
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,780
By any chance,

123
00:19:19,181 --> 00:19:20,820
does this have anything to do
with the undead at Bakseok Hill?

124
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,550
How do you know about that?

125
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,390
Everyone keeps quiet
because they are scared of His Majesty.

126
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,191
But all the wives of the aristocrats
are already aware of the rumor.

127
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:29,431
What?

128
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:34,461
Apparently, rumors say...

129
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,830
the undead actually existed
during the era of the late king.

130
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,671
And some even say that the late king...

131
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,411
and His Majesty were the ones
who brought them into the country.

132
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,110
The throne is at risk.

133
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:50,850
Do not get swayed by those rumors.
Now go on inside.

134
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:55,880
Please be careful.

135
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:07,161
You should go on inside.

136
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,350
- There we go.
- Here.

137
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:25,350
- It looks great.
- Yes.

138
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:26,751
Goodness.

139
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,451
Do you think Lord Choong Nyung...

140
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,491
is still alive?

141
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,860
Why do you even bother to ask
such nonsense?

142
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,491
Just pass on the meat.

143
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,830
Those who died at Hamju Fortress
due to the plague...

144
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:42,931
apparently came back to life
and are walking around...

145
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:44,701
looking like corpses.

146
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:47,040
"I need blood."

147
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,070
- "I need blood."
- "I need blood."

148
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,441
That is what the rumors say.

149
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,011
- My goodness.
- Shut your mouth, you punk.

150
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:58,550
You keep talking nonsense
with that darn mouth of yours.

151
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,120
People refer to us
as a bunch of ignorant clowns...

152
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,780
because you keep saying absurd things.

153
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:07,521
How in the world can a dead person
come back to life...

154
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,761
and walk around...

155
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:12,630
wanting to suck blood?
My goodness, that is absurd.

156
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,800
That is why they call it the "undead".

157
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,130
- A living corpse.
- My goodness.

158
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:19,401
Quit being absurd and sleep.

159
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:25,171
As for you, go back
to what you were saying earlier.

160
00:21:25,511 --> 00:21:26,441
Okay.

161
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:30,411
You know the magistrate's family
who was in charge of Jeongju?

162
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:34,981
Apparently, they have been buying
very expensive food recently,

163
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:37,021
and to keep their servants
from saying anything about it,

164
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,850
they have been banning anyone
from visiting them.

165
00:21:39,021 --> 00:21:40,491
You think the head of the family...

166
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:42,161
is helping Wang Yu hide at his house?

167
00:21:43,431 --> 00:21:44,790
That is the only thing that explains it.

168
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,161
Otherwise, why would that stingy man,

169
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:49,901
who never allowed anything expensive
at a village festival,

170
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:53,501
suddenly gather all kinds of meat
including lamb and beef...

171
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,870
and have them stacked up in his house?

172
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,911
It is strange.

173
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,511
As soon as the sun rises,
let us send someone...

174
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,840
to go there and check.

175
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,580
If that turns out to be true,
I will request to hold a festival,

176
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,651
so get ready.

177
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,521
I will quickly go and check myself.

178
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:11,951
But wait.

179
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:16,261
I heard he might be related
to the loyal subject, General Choi Yeong.

180
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:17,830
Do you think it will be okay?

181
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,761
"Loyal subject"?

182
00:22:20,961 --> 00:22:21,961
Goodness.

183
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:24,070
Loyal subject, my foot.

184
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,070
Those darn people from Goryeo
used the words of Buddha...

185
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,401
to make us butcher cows and pigs.

186
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,911
They treated us butchers
like we were trash.

187
00:22:31,941 --> 00:22:35,211
Nothing has changed even in Joseon.

188
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,310
I thought we would be free
to butcher meat as much as we wanted...

189
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,951
once it turned into a new country.

190
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:41,780
But they locked up all the butchers...

191
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,820
by creating a new government office
with regulations against butchering meat.

192
00:22:44,191 --> 00:22:46,151
That is why Byeo Ri's father
got locked up.

193
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,590
That is what I mean.

194
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,701
The authorities of Joseon and Goryeo
are all the same.

195
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,130
Those darn punks.

196
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:58,701
Yes.

197
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,140
- Let us catch them.
- What?

198
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,340
Let us catch them all...

199
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,941
whether or not they are
loyal subjects of Goryeo or Joseon.

200
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,741
Goodness, look at him. Now he is talking.

201
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,080
Let us catch them all. Get up.

202
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,580
- Go on. Get up.
- Okay.

203
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,951
- Let us get them all.
- All right.

204
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:17,550
No, not yet.

205
00:23:18,491 --> 00:23:20,021
- Go to sleep.
- Not now?

206
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,021
No. Not now.

207
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,261
Get down.

208
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:47,350
Where are you going?

209
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,751
Are you going to the bathroom?

210
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,921
I am going to visit that so-called prince
and his men.

211
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,021
What is the matter with you?

212
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,161
Why would you go there?

213
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:59,530
I guess that Western shaman...

214
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,030
reminded him of his parents.

215
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,271
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

216
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,100
Hey. Do not bother to go.

217
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,471
If we manage to get over the barley hump,

218
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:13,640
we will be able to gain so much gold.

219
00:24:13,981 --> 00:24:15,181
So why would you go there?

220
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,810
Goodness.

221
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,090
Good job. Nice one.

222
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:28,421
Do you really think that magistrate...

223
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:30,191
will let us hold a festival?

224
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,030
We need to find a way...

225
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,961
to barge into his house...

226
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,771
to find Wang Yu
or anyone else for that matter.

227
00:24:40,171 --> 00:24:41,870
Gold does not come so easily like that.

228
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:45,241
Byeo Ri is right.

229
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:48,411
Jeongju is on our way to Hanyang.

230
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,280
So if we go there with the prince,

231
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,050
they will have no choice but to let us in.

232
00:24:54,681 --> 00:24:57,290
He may be third in line,
but he is still a prince.

233
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,721
Do you not agree?

234
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:01,191
- You have a point.
- Yes, she does.

235
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:03,231
- She is right.
- Yes, I agree.

236
00:25:03,261 --> 00:25:05,390
- You are right.
- She is right.

237
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,600
If you want to catch Wang Yu,

238
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,271
just go to sleep.

239
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:20,441
- Where do you want to sleep?
- I will just sleep here.

240
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:21,981
- Go to bed.
- I will sleep here.

241
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,880
- Let us sleep.
- Go to bed.

242
00:25:23,911 --> 00:25:24,951
Sleep.

243
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,421
- Are you good?
- Yes.

244
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,221
Tell me.

245
00:25:29,951 --> 00:25:32,191
Why do you think the late king...

246
00:25:32,721 --> 00:25:36,491
and my father are responsible
for bringing in the undead from the West?

247
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:37,991
Pater!

248
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,231
Marco.

249
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,671
Pater.

250
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,540
Calm down. He will answer your question...

251
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,280
once he finishes
carrying out the exorcism.

252
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:03,921
Go on. Move his body.

253
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:06,661
Yes.

254
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,030
(Father.)

255
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,661
Why? What did he say?

256
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,471
It is already too late for them
and their throats should be slit.

257
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,741
What are you talking about?

258
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,610
Just a while ago,
you saved a man through exorcism.

259
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:35,421
That is because his wounds were not deep.

260
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,021
These other men
will be possessed by evil...

261
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,790
and become undead the moment they die,

262
00:26:40,691 --> 00:26:42,221
so their throats must be slit.

263
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:45,860
No. They are still alive.

264
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:48,860
They are still breathing and can be saved,

265
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:52,271
so perform the exorcism right this moment.

266
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,040
It is too late.

267
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,140
But they have served
and protected me for ten years!

268
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:01,080
I will do what I can to save them,

269
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,511
so perform the exorcism.

270
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,451
Pater, it is my order
as the prince of this nation.

271
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,360
(Marco.)

272
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:28,741
(In the name of the Father, Son,
and the Holy Spirit.)

273
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,620
Such insolence!

274
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:46,521
Why...

275
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,231
Your Highness.

276
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,671
(In the name
of the resurrected Jesus Christ.)

277
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,280
Your Highness.

278
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:17,590
(Defend those in battle.)

279
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:21,221
(Unclean spirit, disappear!
Go burn in hell!)

280
00:28:21,261 --> 00:28:23,120
(Save us from evil.)

281
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:27,761
(I beg you in the name of God.
Defeat those with the Holy Spirit.)

282
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,211
(Unclean spirit, disappear!)

283
00:28:40,241 --> 00:28:41,340
(Go burn in hell!)

284
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:53,790
How dare you!

285
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:57,860
Let go of Father John. Let go!

286
00:29:58,751 --> 00:29:59,751
Are you all right?

287
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:03,320
Pater?

288
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,630
Your Highness.

289
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:50,640
- Interpreter.
- Yes?

290
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:56,140
Why were the undead
all going after Father John?

291
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:57,981
They were probably following orders.

292
00:30:58,651 --> 00:30:59,711
Orders?

293
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,021
Are you saying that...

294
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,991
a certain evil spirit possessed
my men and the gisaengs?

295
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:05,050
Of course.

296
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,421
There is a reason why
the alpha of evil spirits exists.

297
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:09,661
"The alpha of evil spirits"?

298
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,060
What kind of a being is it?

299
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,030
It is the alpha of all evil spirits
that command the dead...

300
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,671
as well as the living.

301
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:21,671
"The alpha of evil spirits"?

302
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,370
Such insolence!

303
00:32:29,701 --> 00:32:32,310
The King ordered
this area to be off limits.

304
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,181
Where exactly am I?

305
00:32:36,241 --> 00:32:37,310
Your Majesty!

306
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,521
I do not deserve your mercy!

307
00:32:40,921 --> 00:32:41,921
Get her out of here.

308
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:46,050
Your Majesty!

309
00:32:47,021 --> 00:32:48,521
Your Majesty!

310
00:33:03,911 --> 00:33:05,211
(Kang Nyung: Tae Jong's youngest son)

311
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:06,241
Father.

312
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:07,780
Speak.

313
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,511
Are you back from the dead?

314
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:13,481
I do not quite follow.

315
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,820
It is me, Kang Nyung.

316
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:18,921
I asked if you are back from the dead.

317
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,060
I...

318
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:25,290
do not follow what you are saying.

319
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,501
I am sure you remember this sword.

320
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:36,570
Pretending not to will not work.

321
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:43,340
I cannot comprehend how you managed
to escape the temporary palace,

322
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:45,610
but if you wish to live,

323
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:51,221
you will prove so
by leaving my son unharmed.

324
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:54,021
Understood?

325
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,530
Do not go, Father.

326
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:07,441
If you must,

327
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,111
slay me with your sword first.

328
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,080
My life...

329
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,981
is not all they are after.

330
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:22,821
They are after...

331
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:25,051
you, my brothers,

332
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,560
and Joseon.

333
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:36,430
Please... Execute me right here...

334
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:38,771
to prevent future misfortunes.

335
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,341
Please...

336
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,140
kill me today...

337
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,271
and...

338
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:48,881
save...

339
00:35:01,591 --> 00:35:02,861
Do it!

340
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,091
Are you not curious to find out...

341
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,930
who you will have to kill next?

342
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,671
Do it!

343
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,410
Your Majesty, please end his life.

344
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,140
The Royal Family and our nation
depend on it!

345
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:45,901
I say this again.

346
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,200
Harm my boy...

347
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,611
and you will never
get to live another day.

348
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,390
What on earth?

349
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,370
You burned him.

350
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,401
That must mean he actually
came back to life last night.

351
00:36:30,401 --> 00:36:32,671
I smell face powder from the smoke.

352
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,940
Byeo Ri, I am right. Correct?

353
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:37,341
That is enough, guys.

354
00:36:38,511 --> 00:36:40,080
I was wondering where you went,

355
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:42,651
but you were here
playing with fire all night?

356
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:44,281
How silly of you.

357
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,431
This troupe is not one
you can come and go as you please.

358
00:37:01,071 --> 00:37:02,600
Disobey my words again,

359
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,640
and I will have your head.

360
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:09,710
So leave now, if that is what you want.

361
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,690
Come on. We are sorry, okay?

362
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,890
We will be careful from now on.

363
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,701
As if you have anyone better to perform.

364
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,500
You darn brat!

365
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,310
I was wondering where I could find you.

366
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:41,671
Thank you for coming back.

367
00:37:49,551 --> 00:37:52,020
I hope the men I sent were of service,

368
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,290
Your Highness.

369
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:55,120
Thank you.

370
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,861
I and those from the west
were only unscathed thanks to your men.

371
00:37:59,261 --> 00:38:01,060
Goodness, please do not mention it.

372
00:38:02,031 --> 00:38:04,660
It was our pleasure to help.

373
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,230
Am I right, Byeo Ri?

374
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,071
Byeo Ri.

375
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:15,111
Of course it was, Your Highness.

376
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,241
Since you are here,

377
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,111
could you perhaps escort us back
to Hanyang?

378
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,151
- What?
- What?

379
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:25,890
Your Highness.

380
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:27,120
All I have are you...

381
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:29,261
and the one whose demon was exorcised.

382
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:31,290
He can barely keep himself up.

383
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,960
Who will escort
the western exorcist safely?

384
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,801
But Your Highness...

385
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:37,460
Could I ask for your service?

386
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,301
Who are we to decline your request?

387
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,401
It is just that...

388
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,471
we are quite a large troupe...

389
00:38:46,011 --> 00:38:48,171
who have not been able
to properly perform.

390
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:51,241
We are all hungry, you see.

391
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:02,560
Once we arrive in Hanyang,
you will be more than generously paid.

392
00:39:04,991 --> 00:39:06,190
I would not doubt that.

393
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,500
We promise...

394
00:39:08,631 --> 00:39:12,330
to safely escort Your Highness
and the western exorcist to Hanyang.

395
00:39:13,571 --> 00:39:16,040
Byeo Ri, Hye Yum, off we go.

396
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:20,741
The sun is already up. Let us hurry.

397
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,910
Is this real?

398
00:39:28,781 --> 00:39:31,850
Your Highness, you must not trust them.

399
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,390
All they do is hunt down opportunities
to shake people for money.

400
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,261
You never know what their angle is.

401
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:38,790
Those who you call lowly...

402
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,560
already saved our lives twice.

403
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,100
Yes, but Your Highness...

404
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,431
Have a pigeon ready
to deliver my letter to the King...

405
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,870
and collect all identity tags
of the fallen soldiers.

406
00:39:50,901 --> 00:39:51,910
Yes, Your Highness.

407
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,821
Your Majesty,
I am here to greet you this morning...

408
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,091
I hear that the daughter-in-law
of Minister Ha who became an undead...

409
00:40:09,591 --> 00:40:11,721
walked past Sookchung Gate.

410
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,730
Was that not where you were stationed at?

411
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:21,431
Yes.

412
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:24,071
I was in charge of its security.

413
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:30,140
Even after seeing
what happened to Kang Nyung,

414
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:34,310
you must have been wining
with Eo Ri again.

415
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,190
And still you wish to be treated
as the crown prince of this nation?

416
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,861
Your Majesty,

417
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,361
he was the one who
first suspected the daughter-in-law...

418
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,261
and went after her all night.

419
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:49,131
He stayed up all night...

420
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,160
to search for her.

421
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,931
So, did you find her?

422
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,741
I asked if you found her.

423
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,341
I am ashamed, Your Majesty.

424
00:41:09,421 --> 00:41:11,620
Hwi Ryang, Assistant Councilor
of the State Council.

425
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:12,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

426
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,991
Sookchung Gate,
being at the base of Mount Baekak,

427
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:18,190
increases the negative energy
within the capital.

428
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,431
It will, therefore,
only attract more spirits and the undead.

429
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:24,761
Permanently seal off the gate...

430
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:26,330
so that it is never open again.

431
00:41:27,301 --> 00:41:29,841
As of this hour,
all castle gates will be closed...

432
00:41:30,241 --> 00:41:32,270
and the search
for the daughter-in-law will commence.

433
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,241
If she is not found,

434
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,111
you will pay with your head.

435
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,910
Understood?

436
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

437
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:46,020
Your Majesty!

438
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:48,020
Your Majesty.

439
00:41:49,991 --> 00:41:51,591
Lord Choong Nyung has sent
an urgent letter.

440
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,100
Father,

441
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:02,600
I witnessed the western exorcist
saving a man...

442
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,140
who was bitten by an undead
through exorcism.

443
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,571
I believe we will be able
to save our people even if...

444
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,281
another attack like in Bakseok Hill
may occur.

445
00:42:13,051 --> 00:42:15,281
While you were in Uiju,

446
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:18,451
Kang Nyung was bitten by an undead
and now an evil spirit possesses him.

447
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,491
Bring back the western exorcist
as soon as possible...

448
00:42:21,991 --> 00:42:23,290
and save your brother.

449
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,730
Your Highness,
that letter is from His Majesty.

450
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,921
Why has Father requested
the western exorcist?

451
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,451
(Queen Won Myung: Wife of Tae Jong)

452
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,721
I do not know.

453
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:55,051
Kang Nyung's life depends on this.

454
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,591
Mother?

455
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,830
Could...

456
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:05,701
Could the vile rumor about
Father and Grandfather being the ones...

457
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,341
who summoned the undead
in the first place be true?

458
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,511
Crown Prince...

459
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,181
So it is true.

460
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,111
That...

461
00:43:21,111 --> 00:43:23,850
you will learn once you are on the throne.

462
00:43:24,421 --> 00:43:26,991
So be patient for now
and trust your father.

463
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,250
No.

464
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:31,160
I am done being patient.

465
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,761
Father blames me in every matter...

466
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,931
and only accuses me of any wrongdoing.

467
00:43:36,901 --> 00:43:38,201
I am done playing his game.

468
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,600
I will find out where this all started...

469
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:42,901
and who summoned the undead into Joseon.

470
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,940
As the crown prince,

471
00:43:45,841 --> 00:43:48,410
I will hold the guilty party responsible.

472
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,651
No matter...

473
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,281
who it may be.

474
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,850
Crown Prince!

475
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:05,361
Your Majesty,

476
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,690
how will we overcome this?

477
00:44:15,971 --> 00:44:17,701
You must be hungry. Give it out.

478
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,741
Okay.

479
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:22,540
You get two.

480
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,250
Enjoy.

481
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:35,660
Here you go.

482
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:52,270
Let us eat!

483
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,310
- Oh, boy.
- Time to eat!

484
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:58,810
Hey, you. Where are you from?

485
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:02,681
It is not like an ignorant lowborn
like you would know if I told you.

486
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:09,120
I am from Vatican City.

487
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,591
"Vatican City"?

488
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:13,960
Is it a good place to live?

489
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Yes, it is nice there.

490
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:18,160
All the crops grow very well,
and even the grapes are huge.

491
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:21,500
And they eat bread instead of rice.

492
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:23,841
Do you know what bread is?

493
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,841
You grind wheat.
Then you ferment and bake it.

494
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:28,571
And you get huge bread.

495
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,241
You know what
barley rice cakes are, right?

496
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:32,451
Bread tastes 30,000 times better.

497
00:45:33,181 --> 00:45:34,750
Nonsense.

498
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,681
I am sure it is the same
where nobles get to enjoy the good life...

499
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:40,750
when slaves and lowborns like us...

500
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,921
are barely alive,
trying to eke out a living.

501
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,861
It is the same everywhere. Am I wrong?

502
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,960
You brat,
you keep dropping the honorifics.

503
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,600
You are all resentful
because your life is a mess.

504
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,270
It is different there.

505
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:59,011
Even slaves get to live comfortably
if they work hard.

506
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,810
And everyone has freedom.

507
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,881
Come on! You are lying to my face.

508
00:46:03,281 --> 00:46:05,850
A country like that does not exist.

509
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,980
What is wrong with you?
Is it because you look like a girl?

510
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:09,781
Why can you not trust anything I tell you?

511
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,690
Do you have everything down there?

512
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,560
Hey, Mr. Interpreter.

513
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,701
What will you give me
if mine is bigger than yours?

514
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,241
Shall I slit your throat
or cut off your thing down there?

515
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,940
Shall we both take our pants off and see?

516
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,111
You lunatic.
Get that thing out of my face.

517
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,011
Sickles scare me.

518
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:40,980
I said, get it out of my face!

519
00:46:41,011 --> 00:46:41,980
Enough.

520
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,491
Hye Yum has a feisty temper!

521
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,421
Your Highness.

522
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,131
There is a town called Jeongju over there.

523
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:58,361
The sun will set soon.
How about we find a place to sleep?

524
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,201
Let us do that.

525
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,171
Your Highness, we do not have time.

526
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:07,370
We do not know
when we could be attacked by the undead.

527
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:08,940
It will be dangerous to travel at night.

528
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,940
Ji Gyeom, we should just
go to bed early tonight...

529
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,611
and leave as soon as the sun comes up.

530
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,551
Yes, Your Highness.

531
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,091
Hey! Eat quickly!

532
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:24,761
The sun will set soon!

533
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,991
- Hey, Let us go!
- Let us go!

534
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:30,660
- Goodness.
- Let us go.

535
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,690
Who is it?

536
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:06,500
What is all this fuss about?

537
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,600
My goodness.

538
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:13,341
We heard you are holding a ritual
for the household deity today.

539
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:15,310
If you would kindly let us stay here
for the night,

540
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,580
we will get rid of all the evil spirits
for you...

541
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:19,651
and make sure
you live a long healthy life...

542
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:22,480
by holding a ceremony filled
with exciting performances!

543
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,151
- Yes!
- That is right!

544
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:27,991
You fools.

545
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,790
Winter is long gone.
We already held the ritual a while back.

546
00:48:30,821 --> 00:48:32,890
Stop talking nonsense and leave at once.

547
00:48:34,991 --> 00:48:38,201
- Hang on a second.
- How dare you!

548
00:48:38,701 --> 00:48:41,931
Do you even know whose residence this is?

549
00:48:42,031 --> 00:48:43,370
Leave at once!

550
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,600
Oh, dear.

551
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,480
Well, I am happy to leave.

552
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:55,850
But you should not kick out
Lord Choong Nyung.

553
00:48:56,051 --> 00:48:58,651
Lord Choong Nyung!

554
00:49:01,051 --> 00:49:05,120
Hey! How am I supposed to believe you?

555
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,801
Who are you?

556
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,040
Give me a moment.

557
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,381
Go and let the magistrate know...

558
00:49:27,511 --> 00:49:28,881
that royal guards are here...

559
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,281
with Lord Choong Nyung
disguised as traveling actors. Go!

560
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:32,321
Yes, sir!

561
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:35,651
Well...

562
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:40,761
If you are okay with staying
at this humble abode, please come on in.

563
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,330
Come on, guys.
Let us go inside, all of you!

564
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:47,230
Wait, all of them?

565
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:49,471
Hey, wait! Hey!

566
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,401
Not all of them! Hey, where are you going?

567
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,971
No! My goodness.

568
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:56,681
Anybody there?

569
00:49:56,741 --> 00:49:58,881
Gosh, come help me!

570
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:03,151
Goodness. Stop! Please stop!

571
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:08,991
You cannot barge in here like this.

572
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,290
Stop this, please!

573
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,390
Oh, no. The energy of the site
this house is built on is very strong.

574
00:50:15,801 --> 00:50:18,901
I suppose that is why only men
can live here.

575
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:21,730
I do not see a single female servant!

576
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,901
Oh, you are right!

577
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:26,940
What do you say?

578
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:30,910
The magistrate is kindly letting us
stay here for the night.

579
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,951
How about we tame
the household deity for him?

580
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,250
- Sounds good!
- Sounds good!

581
00:50:36,921 --> 00:50:39,651
Hey, you fools!

582
00:50:40,421 --> 00:50:44,660
Why are you guys just standing there,
wide-eyed?

583
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,330
Let us have some fun. Come on!

584
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:48,861
Here we go!

585
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,761
Gosh, you cannot do this. Stop.

586
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:54,230
My goodness! This is crazy.

587
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,201
No! You cannot come in. Stop!

588
00:50:57,241 --> 00:50:59,410
Hey! My gosh.

589
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,810
Goodness, no!

590
00:51:02,241 --> 00:51:03,210
What are you doing?

591
00:51:03,841 --> 00:51:05,781
We cannot just barge in
without the magistrate's permission!

592
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,651
We need to make a living, you know.

593
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,651
Please turn a blind eye to this,
Your Highness.

594
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:15,321
Thank you, Your Highness.

595
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:17,620
What are you waiting for?

596
00:51:18,221 --> 00:51:21,960
Set up the posts
so we can walk the tightrope!

597
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,000
That jerk...

598
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:25,631
Your Highness, what did I say?

599
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,100
I told you those clowns
would have another agenda.

600
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,741
How dare they...

601
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:34,471
use a prince to barge in here?

602
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,910
- I shall...
- Ji Gyeom.

603
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,511
Since this already happened,
I will just let them use me for the day.

604
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,951
I will speak with the magistrate.

605
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:48,890
Just find a room for Pater
so he can get some rest.

606
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:50,390
I need to ask him something.

607
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:51,890
Yes, Your Highness.

608
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,830
It does not look like they came here
knowing that you are here.

609
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:01,931
What should we do?

610
00:52:07,471 --> 00:52:08,540
What is that?

611
00:52:09,341 --> 00:52:12,210
General Choi Moo Sun
of the Firearms Directorate gave me this.

612
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:13,710
It is a grenade filled with gunpowder.

613
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,350
Do you plan to strike them first?

614
00:52:16,421 --> 00:52:18,750
That young man over there
is Lord Choong Nyung,

615
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:21,390
Yi Bang Won's favorite son.
Will this be okay?

616
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,361
It is actually a good thing.

617
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,890
I shall behead him
to avenge my royal families of Goryeo,

618
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:29,801
who were killed in Ganghwa Island.

619
00:52:30,631 --> 00:52:32,230
This is not enough to avenge their deaths.

620
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:36,000
Rumor has it that
the undeads have been seen in the area.

621
00:52:36,671 --> 00:52:39,971
The moment this grenade goes off,
they will flock here.

622
00:52:41,511 --> 00:52:43,080
I thought it was a groundless rumor.

623
00:52:43,241 --> 00:52:44,980
Do they actually exist?

624
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:48,910
Here. Do not worry about a thing
and just get ready.

625
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,951
I know how to handle them.

626
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:54,120
Understood.

627
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:11,500
What are you doing? Come gather around.

628
00:53:17,381 --> 00:53:20,850
Wang Yu must be hiding in
the main building or the inner quarters,

629
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,580
so we ought to do whatever it takes...

630
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,020
to drag out every single person
inside the house.

631
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:29,321
While you guys do that,
Ying Choon and I will get Wang Yu.

632
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,491
Got it?

633
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:31,921
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:37,761
Those punks...

635
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,971
Byeo Ri! Hye Yum!

636
00:53:43,401 --> 00:53:45,140
- Go.
- Your job is to drag out...

637
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:46,511
all of Wang Yu's guards.

638
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,040
What are you doing?

639
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:49,841
What is this?

640
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,640
Why are you fooling around here
looking like fish out of the sea?

641
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:55,111
Get yourself together.

642
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:00,991
Go all out.

643
00:54:03,421 --> 00:54:06,861
I know that you are planning to flee
to the West after the job is done anyway.

644
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:09,330
We will give you enough money
so you can get there.

645
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,531
Just go catch every single one
of Wang Yu's guards.

646
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,671
They will do fine.

647
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:24,281
- Let us go.
- Come on.

648
00:54:52,571 --> 00:54:54,770
I have heard many great things

649
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,540
About the great family in Jeongju

650
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,310
Let us go!

651
00:54:59,451 --> 00:55:02,821
Let us go have fun there!

652
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,480
Go!

653
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:06,051
Let us go!

654
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,020
Let us go, let us go

655
00:55:09,051 --> 00:55:12,190
Let us go to the family in Jeongju
and have fun

656
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:13,560
Let us go!

657
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,370
Have you still not found the man
who opened the gates?

658
00:55:22,071 --> 00:55:23,071
No, Your Highness.

659
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,710
Your Highness.

660
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,611
I do not want anyone following me.

661
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,620
Your Highness.

662
00:55:39,051 --> 00:55:40,520
The man who opened the gates
and let in the undead...

663
00:55:40,551 --> 00:55:41,921
turned out to be
a man named Kim Byung Soo.

664
00:55:41,951 --> 00:55:44,060
Apparently, he is the right hand man
of Chief Magistrate Yim Tae Mi.

665
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,421
Bring him to me.

666
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,660
Torture him if you have to.

667
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:50,301
I must know why he opened the gates.

668
00:55:51,261 --> 00:55:52,971
It will not be that easy, Your Highness.

669
00:55:58,971 --> 00:56:00,040
What?

670
00:56:28,401 --> 00:56:29,701
Hello, Your Highness.

671
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,500
Yim Tae Mi.

672
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:33,810
You are the chief magistrate
of the capital district...

673
00:56:33,841 --> 00:56:35,040
and my father-in-law's friend.

674
00:56:35,511 --> 00:56:38,080
Why are you trying to use the undead
to destroy Joseon?

675
00:56:39,011 --> 00:56:41,011
I did it for you, Your Highness.

676
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:42,611
It was for me?

677
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:45,281
How so?

678
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:47,821
Let me hear what you have to say.

679
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:50,591
You started fooling around
with the previous king's concubine...

680
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,390
and brought Eo Ri to the women's quarters.

681
00:56:52,821 --> 00:56:55,460
And I am sure you know
your actions have upset His Majesty.

682
00:56:56,401 --> 00:56:58,031
The previous king was the eldest son,

683
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,361
but only after two years,

684
00:56:59,401 --> 00:57:02,171
he stepped down
and passed on the throne to His Majesty.

685
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:05,401
The king of this country
is already the second son.

686
00:57:05,971 --> 00:57:08,671
So no one will be able to raise an issue
even if Lord Choong Nyung...

687
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:10,681
ends up taking over the throne
instead of you.

688
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:11,841
Are you...

689
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:15,310
trying to come between me and my brother?

690
00:57:15,651 --> 00:57:18,451
You have been the crown prince
for 13 years,

691
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:22,350
but have you ever thought of why
you still have not succeeded the throne?

692
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,020
What?

693
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:27,660
You must regain His Majesty's trust.

694
00:57:27,931 --> 00:57:29,931
You need to find out
whether they are humans or ghosts,

695
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,560
if they are dead or alive,

696
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,330
their strengths and weaknesses,

697
00:57:33,471 --> 00:57:35,071
and what you need to do
to get rid of them.

698
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,971
You must find out and save
Kang Nyung before Choong Nyung does...

699
00:57:38,341 --> 00:57:40,671
so you can finally become
the king of this country.

700
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:47,810
Your Highness.

701
00:57:49,011 --> 00:57:50,681
I understand your loyalty.

702
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:53,750
But winning my father's trust...

703
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,190
The reason I am going to listen
to your advice...

704
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:01,690
is not because I wish
to gain His Majesty's trust.

705
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,761
It is because I wish to find out...

706
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,471
who brought the undead into this country.

707
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:11,440
- You had better not forget that.
- Of course, Your Highness.

708
00:58:11,841 --> 00:58:13,040
Bring him out.

709
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,401
Good!

710
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:11,460
Listen up!

711
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,171
The two long-headed grasshoppers...

712
00:59:15,201 --> 00:59:16,901
are jumping like gray mullets!

713
00:59:18,301 --> 00:59:20,671
If they do well, then so be it.

714
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,870
But if they fail, they will die!

715
00:59:23,681 --> 00:59:26,781
Now, let us hear the drums!

716
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,721
Move, move!

717
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:38,390
Move aside, everyone!

718
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,460
Now, it is time for the highlight
of the festival.

719
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:45,761
The best talent of the show!

720
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:52,640
He will go ahead
and show you a great time!

721
00:59:58,810 --> 00:59:59,951
Hurry up and follow me.

722
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:03,721
He is totally absent-minded.

723
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:42,651
Did you see that?

724
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:48,451
Your Majesty.

725
01:01:49,991 --> 01:01:51,160
It has been a long time.

726
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:52,991
Yes, Your Majesty.

727
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:56,460
This is your first time coming here
after the incident at Hamju Fortress.

728
01:02:10,681 --> 01:02:12,410
Do not let anyone inside.

729
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,111
Yes, Your Majesty.

730
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:49,681
Is this...

731
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,350
the last mirror
that will kill the evil spirit?

732
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:56,020
Yes.

733
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:00,361
Then I guess this will help us find out
if Lord Kang Nyung is possessed...

734
01:03:01,761 --> 01:03:04,000
by the alpha
or just an ordinary evil spirit.

735
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,890
Are you Makchi?

736
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:32,120
No, I am not.

737
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,190
Makchi is locked up right now.

738
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,361
He is not here, Your Highness.

739
01:03:38,201 --> 01:03:39,201
Is that so?

740
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,931
Then you can do the job instead.

741
01:03:42,431 --> 01:03:43,440
Show him.

742
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:48,140
Goodness.

743
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,580
Have him stand up.

744
01:04:04,421 --> 01:04:05,460
Cut him open.

745
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,131
I apologize to say this, Your Highness.

746
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:10,931
But I am a mere blacksmith.

747
01:04:11,031 --> 01:04:13,431
I have never cut open a human before.

748
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:15,801
I humbly request your punishment.

749
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:18,741
I said, cut him open.

750
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:40,660
I will do it instead.

751
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:45,230
Go ahead.

752
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:47,671
If you fail,

753
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,540
you will end up gutted.

754
01:04:52,241 --> 01:04:54,241
I kill livestock for a living.

755
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,241
The corpse of an undead
will not be a problem.

756
01:05:40,651 --> 01:05:43,721
A non-beating heart
indicates no sign of life.

757
01:05:47,091 --> 01:05:50,060
Yes. That is right, Your Highness.

758
01:06:40,011 --> 01:06:42,250
How did a western evil spirit...

759
01:06:42,951 --> 01:06:45,080
make an appearance in Joseon?

760
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:46,921
The answer to that...

761
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,421
will be better explained...

762
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:55,361
by your grandfather
and your father, the current King.

763
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,140
Is it true...

764
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:09,770
that my grandfather, the former king,

765
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:12,640
and my father, the current king,
are responsible for bringing...

766
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:14,080
western undeads to Joseon?

767
01:07:15,181 --> 01:07:16,310
Please tell me.

768
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,020
If it is for my father and this nation,

769
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:21,551
I am willing to put forth my life.

770
01:08:04,401 --> 01:08:07,071
(Joseon Exorcist)

771
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,370
(We thank Yoon Je Moon, David McInnis,
Hong Seok Bin, and Hong Ji Hee...)

772
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:11,801
(for their special appearance.)

773

Subtitles by WeTV

774
01:08:23,381 --> 01:08:24,980
He will last three days at most.

775
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,120
Choong Nyung will not be back
with the western exorcist by then.

776
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:29,990
- The undead are coming.
- They are after something else.

777
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:32,790
- Kill her!
- Your Highness!

778
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,660
Rumor has it that dozens of undeads...

779
01:08:34,691 --> 01:08:36,731
are trapped in a mirror
at the official mudang.

780
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,960
Then obtaining the mirror will give you
the power to command the evil spirits.

781
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,370
- I am the next king of Joseon.
- Kill me.

782
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,441
You were ordered
to tighten security measures!

783
01:08:44,471 --> 01:08:47,311
How could you have let them
get past these walls?

784
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:49,641
Are you even aware
of the rumor going around?

785
01:08:49,771 --> 01:08:51,240
What is your take on it?

786
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:53,141
I asked if you believed the rumor too.

787
01:08:54,481 --> 01:08:55,648
