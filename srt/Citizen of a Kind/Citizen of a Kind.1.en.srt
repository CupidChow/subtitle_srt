I did, when he told me it

You really maxed it out.

77
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:28,103
So, the scam amount...

78
00:05:29,187 --> 00:05:30,561
was $3,200.

79
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:32,020
No.

80
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:33,437
What do you mean no?

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,727
You read it wrong.

82
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:36,477

83
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,520

84
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:41,937
$32,000?

85
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,728

it could be voice phishing?

93
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,020
Not even once?

94
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,894
I urgently needed the money.

95
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:20,728
Yeah, even so, they
asked for money 8 times.

96
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:25,687

Has your house ever burned down?

98
00:06:32,187 --> 00:06:35,228
Life savings burned to ashes,
but insurance didn't cover it,

99
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,312
and thrown to the curb?

100
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:40,144
I sympathize with you...

101
00:06:40,145 --> 00:06:42,895

Look, detective.

103
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,437
I don't have time to feel bad,

104
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,602
and I'm in no position to be patient.

105
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:05,353
Just... just tell me how
to get my money back.

106
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:08,103
Can you catch that bastard?

107
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,145
We'll investigate it right away,

108
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,520
but it takes time to track the account.

109
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,270
How long?

110
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:16,562

00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,020
Please...

182
00:14:20,103 --> 00:14:22,645
What are you staring at, idiot?

183
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,062
Hey!

184
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,770
Damn idiot.

185
00:14:26,895 --> 00:14:28,187
Look at this.

186
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:30,645
Look at it, dumbass.

187
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,894
<i>Seoul, Gwanak-ro 8-gil...</i>

188
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:36,478
I know your ID card
number and your address.

189
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:39,812
I know all your family phone numbers.

190
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,145
Should I give your
little sister a call?

191
00:14:42,728 --> 00:14:44,686
Should I Photoshop a
nude of her and torrent it?

192
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,937
Don't you fucking do it!

193
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,478
Look at this punk.

194
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,228
Don't you touch my family.

195
00:14:51,603 --> 00:14:54,227
I'll shred you up first.

196
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:57,978
Make your dirty
money and rot in prison.

197
00:14:58,395 --> 00:14:59,395
You fu...

198
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:05,103
There's no such thing as dirty money.

199
00:15:06,395 --> 00:15:10,561
5 zeros is $100K, 6 zeros is a million.

200
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:12,937
Even if you shit on
it, 7 zeros is $10M.

201
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:18,228
You couldn't even get a job,
so I took you in and fed you,

202
00:15:18,437 --> 00:15:21,228
you little wimp!

203
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:29,436
He's dead.

204
00:15:29,437 --> 00:15:31,020
I didn't even hit him much.

205
00:15:32,562 --> 00:15:36,562
Please let me live.

206
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:40,103
I'll take care of it.

207
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,270
Let him go.

208
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:43,436
Sorry?

209
00:15:43,437 --> 00:15:45,270
Let him go, I said.

210
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,228
Thank you.

211
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:54,603
Are you going to tell anyone
what happened today?

212
00:15:55,895 --> 00:15:58,270
I won't tell anyone, I swear.

213
00:16:01,478 --> 00:16:03,020
For sure?

214
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,145
Yes, I won't tell a soul.

215
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Open your mouth.

216
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:12,478
You better tell.

217
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:18,687
So that they know they'll
die if they try to run away.

218
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:24,142
<i>Should I get the car ready?</i>

219
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:26,853
<i>Break one leg.</i>

220
00:16:45,187 --> 00:16:47,270
<i>Chunhelou</i>

221
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:57,103
<i>Name.</i>

222
00:16:58,353 --> 00:16:59,769
Kwon Jae-min.

223
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,312
Louder!

224
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:05,603
If I run away...

225
00:17:05,728 --> 00:17:08,728
Stop crying and hurry up!

226
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:15,978
Then my family will pay for it...

227
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:27,103
I'm scared, mommy.

228
00:17:28,062 --> 00:17:30,812
Why are you scared? It's my workplace.

229
00:17:30,937 --> 00:17:33,562
We're living here forever?

230
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,895
No, just a little while.

231
00:17:37,353 --> 00:17:40,603
Until I find the bad guy
and get my money back.

232
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:43,270
How many more nights?

233
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,062
3 nights? 4?

234
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:49,812
I'll catch him quickly,
so we won't stay long.

235
00:17:52,145 --> 00:17:55,187
<i>$130.16</i>

236
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:15,187
It's all right, honey.

237
00:18:15,353 --> 00:18:20,103
Mommy's right here, did I wake you?

238
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:28,145
I told you not to play here!

239
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:33,728
It wasn't me, it was auntie,
auntie, auntie, auntie.

240
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,977
Don't be so harsh on them.

241
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:39,062
Stop fooling around with
the kids and get back to work.

242
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,978
I just thought they might be bored,

243
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,853
since they can't go to daycare.

244
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,769
It's okay, they play well together.

245
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:46,895
Hey.

246
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:51,103
So immature.

247
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:55,520
Can't you pay for the daycare?

248
00:18:56,312 --> 00:18:57,727
That's not it.

249
00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:00,353
You got the loan, what's the worry?

250
00:19:00,437 --> 00:19:01,437
Yeah.

251
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,145
I have to pay you back too.

252
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,894
Take your time.

253
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,978
You have more urgent matters.

254
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:12,728
Yeah, otherwise she'll waste it all.

255
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:17,020
What's wrong with
spending on my happiness?

256
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:20,478
You're nuts for buying
30 copies of the same CD.

257
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,227
No matter how much
you like K-pop idols.

258
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:26,270
Monsta X will be huge!

259
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,770
Everyone I picked became huge!

260
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:30,520
I have good instincts.

261
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:32,603
<i>Bullshit.</i>

262
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:34,645
Did you just swear?

263
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:37,020
<i>She catches on fast.</i>

264
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:40,477
It's better than wasting
it on those things.

265
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:42,769
- Hey, open your eyes!
- Hello?

266
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,937
- It's a designer stuff!
- Yes!

267
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:46,478
I'll be back.

268
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,853
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

269
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:52,228
They used a burner
account and a burner phone.

270
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:56,937
We suspended the account,
but the money was withdrawn.

271
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,394
Then how can we find it?

272
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,520
Well, it'll be difficult.

273
00:20:02,603 --> 00:20:06,562
I saw it online that people
got their money back.

274
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:09,311
Don't you have to
just catch the big boss?

275
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,395
How can we catch the big boss?

276
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:13,352
Even the Seoul Police can't do that.

277
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:14,477
Well, the article...

278
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:19,645
The article was published
because it's a rare occurrence.

279
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,395
Then what do I do?

280
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:26,145
Just think of it as a life lesson.

281
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:29,645
I'm sorry, but the
case has been closed.

282
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,937
Closed? It just barely opened.

283
00:20:33,603 --> 00:20:35,936
Let's talk in person.
Are you at the station?

284
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,895
Why, are you coming?

285
00:20:38,228 --> 00:20:40,102
I'll tell you the same thing in person.

286
00:20:40,103 --> 00:20:40,978
I'm on my way.

287
00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:42,020
<i>Mrs. Kim!</i>

288
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:46,895
<i>Hello?</i>

289
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:48,644
<i>Where are you? What about lunch?</i>

290
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,937
I have to take care of something.

291
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:52,602
Can you look after the kids?

292
00:20:52,603 --> 00:20:54,311
<i>Did you take the truck?</i>

293
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:55,977
<i>Supervisor is going nuts.</i>

294
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,770
<i>- What is it?</i>
- You crazy ass!

295
00:20:57,853 --> 00:20:59,228
<i>What did you just say?</i>

296
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:00,853
<i>Did you say crazy ass?</i>

297
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:03,145
No, Bong-lim, I didn't say it to you.

298
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:05,145
<i>Should I save your lunch?</i>

299
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,937
Don't worry about me.

300
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,394
It's a little hectic,
I'll call you later.

301
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:10,603
<i>Later when...</i>

302
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:16,352
Bong-lim, I'm driving!

303
00:21:16,353 --> 00:21:17,770
<i>Hello, Mrs. Kim.</i>

304
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:20,353
Who is this?

305
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:27,728
I'm Hwaseong Bank's Son Jin-young.

306
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,103
Where are you, you piece of shit!

307
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:37,645
Please calm down and listen to me.

308
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:39,228
Shut up,

309
00:21:39,645 --> 00:21:43,644
I borrowed from loan
sharks, I'm so screwed.

310
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:44,353
It's your fault!

311
00:21:44,395 --> 00:21:46,312
It's for real this time.

312
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:49,020
I'm going to be your informant.

313
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,353
Going to be what?

314
00:21:57,145 --> 00:22:00,395
I'm going to be your tipster.

315
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:08,478
You're a complete moron.

316
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:12,270
<i>Are you scamming me again?</i>

317
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:14,853
You're a real pro.

318
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:18,145
You fucking professional!

319
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:21,103
<i>It's for real, please believe me.</i>

320
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:23,562
I'm locked up here,
and forced to do this.

321
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:24,977
<i>Is that so?</i>

322
00:22:24,978 --> 00:22:27,186
Then you should call the police.

323
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:29,437
I can't do that!

324
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,812
They can see where I'm calling.

325
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,520
<i>I'm dead as soon as I call the police.</i>

326
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:50,312
Are you really going
to be an informant?

327
00:22:50,645 --> 00:22:52,478
I swear.

328
00:22:52,603 --> 00:22:53,812
Okay...

329
00:22:54,937 --> 00:22:57,603
Let's say it's for real.

330
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:00,395
But, why me?

331
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,937
You were the fastest
victim to send money.

332
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,227
<i>Others took over a week</i>

333
00:23:07,228 --> 00:23:10,312
to fill the paper work and
deposit, but you were instant.

334
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:14,603
It's a good thing, it
shows you're determined.

335
00:23:17,978 --> 00:23:22,478
And the cops won't ignore the victims.

336
00:23:22,562 --> 00:23:24,269
<i>I can't do this anymore.</i>

337
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,895
I really want to leave.

338
00:23:31,228 --> 00:23:33,520
<i>You expect me to believe you?</i>

339
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,812
Would you believe it if it were you?

340
00:23:38,728 --> 00:23:42,853
Yes, Mrs. Kim, believe
me. It's the truth.

341
00:23:43,603 --> 00:23:46,687
I can really make what
you want come true.

342
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,353
What do I want?

343
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:51,687
Money, you need money, don't you?

344
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:02,312
Mrs. Kim,

345
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:08,061
I'll tell you everything I know.

346
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,687
Please report it for me.

347
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:12,270
You have nothing to lose.

348
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:14,853
<i>Please, please.</i>

349
00:24:20,978 --> 00:24:22,520
Call back in 5 minutes.

350
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:23,478
What?

351
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,395
I'm driving, call me back in 5.

352
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:30,270
Hello? Mrs. Kim!

353
00:24:44,937 --> 00:24:48,020
Pick up, Det. Park.

354
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:51,478
Pick up the damn phone!

355
00:24:56,687 --> 00:24:59,687
Utterly useless!

356
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:14,603
<i>This is the police hotline,
how can I assist you?</i>

357
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:18,227
I can send you the link to our bank.

358
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:20,353
Goddamn idiots!

359
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,020
Stop slacking off and
keep calling until cutoff time!

5 minutes to go, hurry it up!

363
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:37,562
Son called to send me a tip,

364
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,770
but I don't know what to ask him.

365
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:47,061
Like his location?

366
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,937
- <i>Location?</i>
- Or an address?

367
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,812
<i>Any police station nearby can
help you with voice phishing.</i>

368
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,812
I'm unable to go there,

369
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:59,145
he's supposed to call me right back.

370
00:25:59,228 --> 00:26:02,520
Just tell me what I need to ask him.

371
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:03,978
What do I need from him?

372
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,769
<i>Well, go to the nearest
police station...</i>

373
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,561
I said I can't go there, am
I not making any sense?!

374
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:12,394
He will call me right now!

375
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:13,353
<i>Please calm down.</i>

376
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:16,186
<i>There's a patrol
station 7 minutes away.</i>

377
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:17,978
<i>- Please go there and...</i>
- I said I can't!

378
00:26:18,062 --> 00:26:21,478
He's going to call me right now!

Why are you following
me to the washroom?

407
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:39,562
- This is it.
- What is this?

408
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:43,395
At first, I didn't know
what he was saying,

409
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:46,520
but just in case, I tried typing this

410
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:49,062
on a Korean keyboard,

411
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,687
and this is what it said.

412
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,228
Near Chunhelou, 3-story
building, Qingdao, China.

413
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:58,353
I had the goosebumps,

414
00:28:58,562 --> 00:28:59,812
and realized he was for real.

415
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:01,187
When did he make the call?

416
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,937
On the way here.

417
00:29:03,062 --> 00:29:06,603
He said he's held captive
and to call the cops.

418
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,562
What's so funny?

419
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:13,561
Honestly, it's really odd.

420
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:17,478
Coming with a tip after I
told you the case was closed.

421
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:23,353
You can track the
location on the phone log.

422
00:29:23,437 --> 00:29:24,811
It's no use.

423
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:27,187
We can't re-investigate the case.

424
00:29:27,812 --> 00:29:29,103
Why not?

425
00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:32,437
There's no address for the call center.

426
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,020
Can't do it without it.

427
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:36,395
Then...

428
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:39,937
Then you can start looking!

429
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,269
What kind of a cop wants
everything served on a platter?

430
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,728
On a platter? You're crossing the line.

431
00:29:46,062 --> 00:29:48,144
Didn't you see the office?

00:29:48,145 --> 00:29:50,978

I have to deal with all
the sobbing victims!

434
00:29:54,187 --> 00:29:57,228
I'm also a victim!

458
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:32,228
But my fridge was empty

459
00:31:32,312 --> 00:31:34,102
They called from the bank number,

460

know how many accounts I had?

461
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:42,687
Of course, I believed them,
how can anyone doubt it?

462
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:46,937
They said my account
was used in a scam.

463
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:52,353
They needed my money and
account for the investigation.

464
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,728
I actually work at a bank.

Why can't they re-investigate?

502
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:51,269
According to Det. Park,
we need an address.

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,103
<i>Dammit! I really don't know.</i>

505
00:34:00,228 --> 00:34:01,978
Why is he so clueless?

506
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:03,812
That's what I'm saying.

507
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,937
He's really stubborn,

508
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:08,145
with a lot of suspicion.

509
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:13,769
He asked me how you can be trusted,

510
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:16,770
and why you wouldn't identify yourself.

511
00:34:16,895 --> 00:34:18,728

<i>In any case, it's important

Nope, I can't do it.

you can take pictures

538
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:51,645
or get a camera? I'm not even there!

539
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:57,228
Duk-hee! Why aren't you answering me?

540
00:35:57,395 --> 00:35:59,311
Go to your kids!

541
00:35:59,312 --> 00:36:01,437
Why? Are they hurt?

542
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:06,353
You don't want it? It's good.

543
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,978
- It's mommy!
- What are you doing to them?

544
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,978
Min-ji, Hoon.

545
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,895
Mommy!

546
00:36:15,896 --> 00:36:17,937
You shouldn't do this.

547
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,602
What do you mean I shouldn't?

548
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:23,270
You came to take my kids
away, should I just let you?

549
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:26,727
Min-ji! Hoon!

550
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,270
We received a report.

551
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,895
Someone was concerned
with their safety.

552
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:33,978
Who said that?

553
00:36:34,353 --> 00:36:36,019
Ma'am, you're too upset.

554
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:39,353
What kind of law is this?

555
00:36:39,478 --> 00:36:41,727
You won't even catch bad guys for me,

556
00:36:41,728 --> 00:36:44,437
but take my kids away? Is this lawful?

557
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,812
What are you looking
at? Came for a show?!

558
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:52,937
Piss off! Go!

559
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,895
I'll show you what
happens when I get mad!

560
00:36:57,353 --> 00:37:00,062
Ma'am, we're trying to help you.

561
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,187
The kids can't keep sleeping
in the locker room.

562
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,062
Assault isn't the only form of abuse.

563
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,519
What? Abuse?

564
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,728
No, the kids are the world to her.

565
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,228
We'll keep them safe at the
center until investigation is over.

566
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:21,062
You can visit them
after submitting a form.

567
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:29,853
Please, I'll protect them
and keep them safe.

568
00:37:30,062 --> 00:37:31,978
How will you do that?

569
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,478
You can't even pay for daycare.

570
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:37,937
I'll get some soon.

571
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,102
I got a crime tip.

572
00:37:40,103 --> 00:37:43,561
If we can catch the scammers,
I can get my money back.

573
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:49,937
Then I can rent a house,
and send the kids to daycare.

574
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,770
Ma'am.

575
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,770
Haven't you seen the poster?

576
00:37:55,853 --> 00:38:02,769
They're offering $100,000
for a voice phishing tip and...

577
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,978
Ma'am.

578
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:09,978
Please, I promised them
I'll always be by their side!

579
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,477
I'm sorry, but it's my
duty to protect the kids.

580
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:15,645
- Please!
- Officer.

581
00:38:16,437 --> 00:38:18,437
I don't want to go.

582
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:20,353
Mommy!

583
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:27,102
Min-ji, Hoon, I'll come get you soon.

584
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:28,145
Don't worry.

585
00:38:28,187 --> 00:38:29,520
Mommy!

586
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:33,645
Mommy!

587
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,645
Min-ji! Hoon!

588
00:38:38,895 --> 00:38:39,895
Sweetie!

589
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:43,728
Min-ji...

590
00:38:45,187 --> 00:38:47,478
What on earth...

591
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:50,228
What do I do...

592
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:54,312
<i>Up to $100,000</i>

593
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,436
- Hello?
<i>- Yes.</i>

594
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,645
Det. Park?

595
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:05,020
Hello? Detective?

596
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:07,645
Yes, this is Det. Shin Young-soo
of Hwaseong Police.

597
00:39:07,937 --> 00:39:10,978
Is Det. Park there?

598
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:12,603
Det. Park?

599
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:15,562
He's out at the moment.

600
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,603
Can I take your message?

601
00:39:19,687 --> 00:39:21,270
Yes, please.

602
00:39:21,978 --> 00:39:23,437
<i>Hold a moment.</i>

603
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:25,353
Yes, go ahead.

604
00:39:26,937 --> 00:39:28,478
You asshole.

605
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:32,562
It scares me that all
cops might be like you.

606
00:39:37,937 --> 00:39:39,437
What's with that face?

607
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:46,062
She begged you to get
the scammers, right?

608
00:39:50,437 --> 00:39:51,895
Look on the bright side.

609
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:57,395
You can get the money
back and your kids too.

610
00:39:58,353 --> 00:40:02,353
You just have to catch
the big wig, right?

611
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:04,478
You two got started without me?

612
00:40:04,562 --> 00:40:06,187
I brought some munchies.

613
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:08,937
Hey, is China far?

614
00:40:08,978 --> 00:40:10,603
Isn't it close?

615
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:14,186
Close places are close,
far places are far.

616
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:15,478
What about Qingdao?

617
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,770
It takes about an hour and a half.

618
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,978
My sister Ae-lim lives there.

619
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:24,145
That's so close, it's like
going from Seoul to Daejeon.

620
00:40:25,437 --> 00:40:28,519
Right, you mentioned she lives there.

621
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,186
I last saw her on the Lunar New Year.

622
00:40:31,187 --> 00:40:32,437
I miss her.

623
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,770
Something on my face?

624
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:41,978
Bong-lim.

625
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:45,103
Can you help me?

626
00:40:45,728 --> 00:40:48,187
Help you with what?

627
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:50,686
Yeah, go to China and
catch him yourself!

628
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:52,020
It'll be faster!

629
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,895
Are you drunk? You had enough.

630
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,437
You're right, I can't wait any more.

631
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,270
You both lost your minds.

632
00:41:00,812 --> 00:41:05,187
You'll go to Qingdao and
catch the head scammer?

633
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:09,395
You're serious.

634
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,770
Cops can't even catch
him, how will you?

635
00:41:12,853 --> 00:41:15,311
We just have to catch him, that's all!

636
00:41:15,312 --> 00:41:18,145
Let's go catch him!

637
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:20,187
Shut your trap!

638
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,520
Bong-lim, you can speak Chinese, right?

639
00:41:24,103 --> 00:41:27,812
Forget the head
scammer, just the address.

640
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,562
That's what Det. Park keeps saying.

641
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:33,103
Can't re-investigate
without an address.

642
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:36,937
I think finding the address
will get things rolling.

643
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,895
The hardest part is
finding the address.

644
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:41,853
What would an address do?

645
00:41:47,312 --> 00:41:50,478
They are offering reward for a tip.

646
00:41:51,145 --> 00:41:52,812
<i>Up to $100,000 For Your Tip</i>

647
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:55,978
Jackpot! $100,000!

648
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:57,645
$100,000...

649
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:00,978
Wake up.

650
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,103
How can you go to Qingdao off of this?

651
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,352
What about work?

652
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:05,894
We don't have to quit,

653
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:08,853
we can use the weekend
and one vacation day.

654
00:42:08,937 --> 00:42:10,812
I've never been to Qingdao.

655
00:42:10,937 --> 00:42:11,937
Hey!

656
00:42:11,978 --> 00:42:14,853
This isn't a vacation, you should stay.

657
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:18,228
Take me with you! I want to go too!

658
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:20,395
Bong-lim,

659
00:42:20,812 --> 00:42:22,687
please help me.

660
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:26,478
I can't live without Min-ji and Hoon.

661
00:42:26,895 --> 00:42:28,353
Just this once.

662
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:32,103
You're driving me crazy.

663
00:42:39,228 --> 00:42:40,687
Weekend plus one day.

664
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:42,437
Yes, it's enough.

665
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:44,437
Let's do it! Deal!

666
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,227
Me too! I'm in!

667
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:48,062
Hey!

668
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:50,270
I told you, this isn't a vacation!

669
00:42:50,353 --> 00:42:51,853
I won't have fun, I promise.

670
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,311
Hey! I won't go if she goes.

671
00:42:53,312 --> 00:42:56,395
- Bong-lim, come on!
- I have to go too!

672
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:14,395
You said it wasn't a vacation.

673
00:43:14,687 --> 00:43:16,436
Are you on a tour?

674
00:43:16,437 --> 00:43:18,645
This is how I usually dress.

675
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:20,353
Hillbilly.

676
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:24,520
Look at the scenery!

677
00:43:24,562 --> 00:43:26,520
You're so annoying.

678
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,520
Hurry up!

679
00:43:29,437 --> 00:43:31,728
- Where's your sister?
- I'll give her a call.

680
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:36,978
Ae-lim!

681
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,645
Bong-lim!

682
00:43:39,603 --> 00:43:42,478
- Ae-lim!
- Bong-lim!

683
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:46,770
You look good in those specs!

684
00:43:47,353 --> 00:43:48,977
Let me introduce you
to my friend, Duk-hee.

685
00:43:48,978 --> 00:43:51,603
I heard a lot about you.

686
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,102
Thanks for helping us.

687
00:43:53,103 --> 00:43:55,395
Don't worry, this is my turf.

688
00:43:55,478 --> 00:43:57,728
Trust me, we'll find the call center.

689
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,602
Hi! You're Ae-lim.

690
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:03,062
Nice to meet you, I'm Sook-ja.

691
00:44:03,312 --> 00:44:06,020
Let her go, give her some space!

692
00:44:06,562 --> 00:44:08,227
I wasn't going to bring her here.

693
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,228
I see...

694
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,811
Let's get going, can I ride in front?

695
00:44:10,812 --> 00:44:11,812
Sure.

696
00:44:13,437 --> 00:44:14,353
Let's go! Let's go!

697
00:44:14,437 --> 00:44:15,645
Let's get moving.

698
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,686
Ae-lim, I want to eat dim sum.

699
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:20,520
Come on, get in.

700
00:44:21,312 --> 00:44:23,520
Sook-ja, we're not here to have fun.

701
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:26,103
We could still have dim sum.

702
00:44:26,187 --> 00:44:28,978
Duk-hee, can we really
find it in 3 days?

703
00:44:29,062 --> 00:44:31,144
We just need to look at 9 factories.

704
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,436
There were sewing
machines at the call center.

705
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,103
I think it's a clothing factory.

706
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,520
<i>Chunhelou</i>

707
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,978
- Is this the place?
- Stop, stop.

708
00:45:01,437 --> 00:45:02,853
They're heading in.

709
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:23,062
- Duk-hee, wait!
- What is it?

710
00:45:23,103 --> 00:45:25,228
Here.

711
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:43,562
<i>What do you want?</i>

712
00:45:44,978 --> 00:45:45,978
<i>Hello.</i>

713
00:45:47,103 --> 00:45:49,520
<i>I want to show you some fabric.</i>

714
00:45:49,603 --> 00:45:52,395
<i>No need, I already got a supplier.</i>

715
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,477
<i>Can we meet your boss?</i>

716
00:45:55,478 --> 00:45:56,520
<i>He's not in right now.</i>

717
00:45:56,812 --> 00:45:58,395
<i>It won't take long.</i>

718
00:45:58,895 --> 00:45:59,937
<i>Go away! Go!</i>

719
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,228
<i>Go! Go!</i>

720
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:02,519
- Bong-lim!
- My finger...

721
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,520
Bong-lim.

722
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:06,437
My finger!

723
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,353
Buddy! Why the hell did you shove her!

724
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,020
<i>Speak Chinese!</i>

725
00:46:15,395 --> 00:46:17,437
<i>Don't touch! Fuck you! Okay?!</i>

726
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,770
Bastard!

727
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:23,603
Duk-hee, let's just go.

728
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:24,770
Are you all right?

729
00:46:24,771 --> 00:46:27,312
I think my finger is busted.

730
00:46:27,937 --> 00:46:30,394
That old fart was
wearing a hearing aid.

731
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:34,977
He couldn't hear a thing, I
called but he couldn't hear.

732
00:46:34,978 --> 00:46:36,728
Kept saying 'louder'.

733
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:39,270
What's with your face?

734
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:42,436
Where can I get a cell phone?

735
00:46:42,437 --> 00:46:43,728
Fat chance.

736
00:46:44,895 --> 00:46:46,437
Why do you need it?

737
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:50,228
I just want to text my friends.

738
00:46:50,603 --> 00:46:52,852
This isn't the military, they
won't let us use our phones.

739
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:53,936
I'm going nuts.

740
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,562
Give it up, it's pointless.

741
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:59,520
After my phone got taken
away, I had withdrawal symptoms.

742
00:46:59,978 --> 00:47:03,853
Why don't you go kiss
the manager's ass then?

743
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:06,812
Dammit!

744
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,436
What the hell?

745
00:47:08,437 --> 00:47:10,395
I'm sorry, my bad.

746
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:11,478
You wanna die?

747
00:47:11,479 --> 00:47:13,812
Leave him, he's high.

748
00:47:14,228 --> 00:47:16,812
Get the hell outta
here, goddamn junkie!

749
00:47:17,853 --> 00:47:19,644
Let him be, I feel bad for him.

750
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:21,520
His friend is dead and
got his leg is broken.

751
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,687
It's a hippo.

752
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:25,020
Hippo, hippo.

753
00:47:25,062 --> 00:47:26,895
What the shit, man!

754
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:28,812
I told you not to call me that!

755
00:47:28,895 --> 00:47:32,478
Stop calling me that, you asswipe!

756
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,019
Hippo, you say? You jackass!

757
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:40,728
I said not to call me that!

758
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:44,895
Hey, stop!

759
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:47,020
That's enough.

760
00:47:47,103 --> 00:47:49,145
What's enough?!

761
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:50,603
Asshole!

762
00:47:51,478 --> 00:47:53,020
You're the asshole!

763
00:47:58,562 --> 00:47:59,770
Get up!

764
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:04,145
Shit, you son of a...

765
00:48:06,395 --> 00:48:09,478
Buddy, you can't fight for shit.

766
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:12,437
Shut up and walk properly.

767
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:16,812
They offered you shit
ton of money, yeah?

768
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,895
I shouldn't have come here.

769
00:48:20,853 --> 00:48:21,937
There, there.

770
00:48:24,895 --> 00:48:26,187
Hey, hey.

771
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,353
Got any drug?

772
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:33,978
Can you give me some?

773
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,270
I can't sleep well nowadays.

774
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:44,395
Yes, I'll take care of it.

775
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:45,937
Good night, sir.

776
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:49,603
You shit faced monkey.

777
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,853
Sir.

778
00:48:53,687 --> 00:48:55,312
Why aren't you asleep, shit head!

779
00:48:55,812 --> 00:48:57,395
Well, I came to give you this...

780
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:58,937
Here.

781
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:01,395
I'll give you everything I make.

782
00:49:01,853 --> 00:49:02,937
What's this for?

783
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:05,812
I heard you can't
manage everyone properly.

784
00:49:05,853 --> 00:49:08,686
Shut up, get the hell out of here.

785
00:49:08,687 --> 00:49:10,811
Here, take it.

786
00:49:10,812 --> 00:49:12,062
Take what?

787
00:49:13,437 --> 00:49:15,644
Trust me and give me a
shot, I'll work really hard.

788
00:49:15,645 --> 00:49:17,769
Hard at what, you are a nut job!

789
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,852
Please! I'm tired of
getting the beating!

790
00:49:19,853 --> 00:49:21,353
I'll do anything you want.

791
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:23,020

How many calls did you make?

798
00:50:17,395 --> 00:50:19,437
Others make 2-300 calls!

799
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,937
The phone doesn't call itself.

800
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,145
Damn...

801
00:50:26,645 --> 00:50:27,977

802
00:50:27,978 --> 00:50:33,062
I was about to dial, sir...

803
00:50:35,353 --> 00:50:39,812
Hurry up and do it then!

804
00:50:39,895 --> 00:50:41,187

808
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,728
Okay, I'll bring it right down.

<i>The number you are

817
00:52:07,478 --> 00:52:10,562
What's the point of taking
pics if I can't send them?

818
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:14,812
Is this the last place?

819
00:52:15,103 --> 00:52:16,978
Yup, number 9.

820
00:52:21,145 --> 00:52:22,145
Damn.

821
00:52:25,895 --> 00:52:27,645
They were just making t-shirts.

822
00:52:27,687 --> 00:52:29,812
Maybe Son pranked you.

823
00:52:29,937 --> 00:52:31,353
No way.

824
00:52:31,603 --> 00:52:33,728
Who'd prank call while being so scared?

825
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:34,895
Then why can't we find it?

826
00:52:34,978 --> 00:52:36,645
We went everywhere.

827
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:40,145
I only exchanged enough
money for 3 days.

828
00:52:40,603 --> 00:52:45,812
To be honest, there are 72 places.

829
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,270
- What?
- What?

830
00:52:47,353 --> 00:52:49,352
- 72?!
- 72?!

831
00:52:49,353 --> 00:52:51,728
Why did you lie?

832
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:54,436
You said 9 and 1 vacation
day was enough!

833
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:58,436
He mentioned a sewing machine,
so, I assumed it was clothing factory.

834
00:52:58,437 --> 00:53:00,187
There's no way.

835
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,144
We can't do 72.

836
00:53:02,145 --> 00:53:03,394
It's not 72.

837
00:53:03,395 --> 00:53:06,311
We checked out 9 already,
it's just 63 more.

838
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:07,895
- Hey!
- Duk-hee!

839
00:53:08,228 --> 00:53:10,812
Duk-hee, I'm tired!

840
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:13,187
- Bong-lim...
- Stop it!

841
00:53:21,228 --> 00:53:22,770
Big boss' running a bit late.

842
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:25,312
He's always 30 minutes late.

843
00:53:25,562 --> 00:53:27,602
Then why make us come so early?

844
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:29,187
He must be busy.

845
00:53:29,478 --> 00:53:31,019
Isn't he opening up
another call center?

846
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,103
Yeah, instead of doing that,

847
00:53:34,687 --> 00:53:36,812
he should share more profit with us,

848
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,187
and promote our boys,
doesn't that sound better?!

849
00:53:39,395 --> 00:53:41,811
What's with all the complaints?

850
00:53:41,812 --> 00:53:43,895
I'm not complaining.

00:53:53,853 --> 00:53:56,270
<i>Should I take care of the managers?</i>

854
00:53:57,187 --> 00:53:58,311
<i>Let them be.</i>

00:53:58,312 --> 00:53:59,952
<i>I'll get rid of them

00:54:15,478 --> 00:54:18,270

here and get in single file.

00:54:18,353 --> 00:54:18,978
Okay.

863
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,227
No, it's close by.

864
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,187
I see.

865
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,769
Can you tell me the address?

866
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,436
My parents are worried.

867

900
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:42,394
Here? Now?

901
00:57:42,395 --> 00:57:43,478
Yeah.

902
00:57:44,353 --> 00:57:46,270
Dammit to hell.

903
00:57:49,603 --> 00:57:50,020
<i>Transferring 70%</i>

904
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:51,562
<i>Transferring 70%</i>
Why is it so slow?

905
00:57:52,395 --> 00:57:53,644
Hello, sir.

906
00:57:53,645 --> 00:57:54,645
Hey, what's up?

907
00:57:55,895 --> 00:57:56,978
Here.

908
00:57:57,478 --> 00:57:58,686
What is this?

909
00:57:58,687 --> 00:57:59,853
<i>For snacks?</i>

910
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,978
<i>Snacks aren't that expensive, sir.</i>

911
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,562
Where you going?

912
00:58:04,312 --> 00:58:05,812
To Glasses.

913
00:58:07,978 --> 00:58:10,353
Okay, go and buy me some time.

914
00:58:10,562 --> 00:58:12,062
Why should I?

915
00:58:12,728 --> 00:58:15,270
If I get caught, I'm
taking you with me.

916
00:58:15,312 --> 00:58:18,186
I'll tell them you're my accomplice.

917
00:58:18,187 --> 00:58:19,937
What the hell did I do?

918
00:58:22,478 --> 00:58:26,103
Come on, help me out just this once.

919
00:58:26,562 --> 00:58:28,145
You owe me one.

920
00:58:28,812 --> 00:58:30,269
Aren't you sick of all the beatings?

921
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,186
I'll cover for you from now.

922
00:58:32,187 --> 00:58:35,478
Please? All right?

923
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:49,978
Please, faster, faster.

924
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,273
I'll give it to you as
soon as I get it from him.

925
00:58:53,312 --> 00:58:54,853
Hustle up with it.

926
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,102
What the hell, when did you arrive?

927
00:58:57,103 --> 00:58:58,562
I was in the washroom.

928
00:58:58,937 --> 00:59:00,770
Wait here, I have to
get it from the office.

929
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:05,187
I actually don't have any money.

930
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,603
Can you put it on my tab?

931
00:59:06,687 --> 00:59:09,687
Asshole, are you out of your mind?

932
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,645
Did it freeze? Come on.

933
00:59:18,478 --> 00:59:21,520
Please, help me out here.

934
00:59:21,812 --> 00:59:23,687
I'll be good from now.

935
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,269
I bought a lot off you,
can you put it on my tab?

936
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,020
Let me go, dumbass!

937
00:59:29,103 --> 00:59:31,103
<i>Let go of me!</i>

938
00:59:33,062 --> 00:59:34,062
Almost!

939
00:59:45,812 --> 00:59:47,061
Where have you been?

940
00:59:47,062 --> 00:59:47,812
Did she pick up?

941
00:59:47,813 --> 00:59:48,853
Not yet.

942
00:59:49,437 --> 00:59:51,812
You sure the faxes were
for Mrs. Kim Duk-hee?

943
00:59:51,853 --> 00:59:54,228
Yes, by the time I came
in, there was already a pile.

944
00:59:54,437 --> 00:59:56,937
I think it was sent by her informant.

945
00:59:57,562 --> 00:59:59,020
Captain was shocked.

946
00:59:59,353 --> 01:00:01,937
He doesn't get shocked normally.

947
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,062
He was shocked?

948
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:05,687
You'll see what I mean.

949
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,395
You have to separate
the accounts and people.

950
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:12,853
- Get the victim statements.
- Yes, sir.

951
01:00:13,187 --> 01:00:15,311
What are you looking
at? Come and organize.

952
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,437
What's going on here?

953
01:00:24,478 --> 01:00:26,312
Bud, who's Kim Duk-hee?

954
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:29,269
That lady who works at the laundromat.

955
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:34,187
She got scammed $32,000
from voice phishing.

956
01:00:36,603 --> 01:00:38,062
This is her informant.

957
01:00:39,562 --> 01:00:40,437
<i>Kwon Jae-min, age 28</i>

958
01:00:40,438 --> 01:00:42,758
She really opened up the can of worms.

959
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:45,895
<i>Second tip
August 18th, 2016</i>

960
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,769
Here they come.

961
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,937
Over here, hurry!

962
01:00:55,687 --> 01:00:59,978
It takes so long even with 2 teams.

963
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:04,936
Here, try this.

964
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:06,561
You can't find it anywhere else.

965
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,228
You like this too.

966
01:01:09,562 --> 01:01:12,812
Come on, let's eat, we need the energy.

967
01:01:13,228 --> 01:01:14,603
It's not going down.

968
01:01:14,853 --> 01:01:16,478
It's blocked up right here.

969
01:01:16,853 --> 01:01:18,020
Upset stomach?

970
01:01:18,062 --> 01:01:19,353
No, it's not that.

971
01:01:19,437 --> 01:01:21,102
Wait here, I got an emergency kit.

972
01:01:21,103 --> 01:01:22,394
Ae-lim, don't worry about it.

973
01:01:22,395 --> 01:01:26,020
How could I not? I
can't see you get sick.

974
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:28,728
Bong-lim...

975
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,562
Can't you tell? She's faking it.

976
01:01:33,645 --> 01:01:37,437
I'm dying inside, how
could you say that?

977
01:01:37,645 --> 01:01:38,978
Because of the supervisor?

978
01:01:39,187 --> 01:01:42,020
Yeah, do you know how pissed he was?

979
01:01:42,103 --> 01:01:43,353
I would have too.

980
01:01:43,687 --> 01:01:47,145
He'll know something's up,
we all called in sick together.

981
01:01:50,687 --> 01:01:52,019
Aren't you gonna answer?

982
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,437
No, it's Det. Park.

983
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:55,227
Det. Park? Answer it.

984
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:57,144
- Yeah.
- I don't want to.

985
01:01:57,145 --> 01:01:59,312
Who knows what he'll say?

986
01:02:00,312 --> 01:02:02,062
Hello? Hello?

987
01:02:02,145 --> 01:02:03,602
<i>Mrs. Kim Duk-hee?</i>

988
01:02:03,603 --> 01:02:04,727
What do you want?

989
01:02:04,728 --> 01:02:06,645
Why is it so hard to reach you?

990
01:02:06,687 --> 01:02:08,853
I've been calling you all day.

991
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:13,103
I didn't know we were that close.

992
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:16,103
We can become that close from now.

993
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:19,478
You should come by today.

994
01:02:19,895 --> 01:02:21,520
I can't, good bye.

995
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:24,020
Wait, wait, are you busy?

996
01:02:24,562 --> 01:02:26,062
I'm in Qingdao.

997
01:02:26,978 --> 01:02:28,061
Where?

998
01:02:28,062 --> 01:02:29,603
Don't you know Qingdao?

999
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:34,228
I know where that is, but why?

1000
01:02:34,562 --> 01:02:36,937
You can't be serious,
you're on vacation, right?

1001
01:02:38,312 --> 01:02:39,978
I came to catch the big boss.

1002
01:02:40,062 --> 01:02:43,144
Are you nuts? It's too dangerous.

1003
01:02:43,145 --> 01:02:48,520
I'm more scared about the cost
of this long distance call, bye.

1004
01:02:48,687 --> 01:02:50,103
Wait a sec!

1005
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:51,895
<i>We received a fax.</i>

1006
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,978
What did you say?

1007
01:02:57,062 --> 01:03:00,769
About 400 pages of fax came in for you,

1008
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:05,645
they contain pictures of the
center, informant, and victim details.

1009
01:03:06,062 --> 01:03:09,020
<i>I don't know how he got a year's worth,</i>

1010
01:03:09,562 --> 01:03:16,103
but there's over 2,700 victims
and damages of at least $17M.

1011
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,562
<i>How did you do it?</i>

1012
01:03:19,687 --> 01:03:22,103
Did the informant really call you?

1013
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:24,977
I told you I got a call from him!

1014
01:03:24,978 --> 01:03:26,478
You ignored me then!

1015
01:03:27,853 --> 01:03:31,936
I'm sorry, it was crazy
here with the $10M case.

1016
01:03:31,937 --> 01:03:34,978
I was screaming and all, I'm sorry!

1017
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:36,812
What was that?

1018
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,853
Reception's bad in China,
can you say that louder?

1019
01:03:40,812 --> 01:03:43,437
I'm in the office right now.

1020
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,937
Say it louder!

1021
01:03:45,978 --> 01:03:47,187
Okay, all right.

1022
01:03:49,853 --> 01:03:50,937
I'm sorry!

1023
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:53,228
<i>It's all my fault!</i>

1024
01:03:54,062 --> 01:03:55,687
I'll do better from now!

1025
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:01,894
Then send those pictures
and files to me right now.

1026
01:04:01,895 --> 01:04:03,437
But...

1027
01:04:04,978 --> 01:04:07,811
investigation files cannot leak out.

1028
01:04:07,812 --> 01:04:10,186
Investigation my ass!

1029
01:04:10,187 --> 01:04:13,019
It was forwarded to Duk-hee,
so, you're not leaking it!

1030
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,394
<i>Send it right now!</i>

1031
01:04:14,395 --> 01:04:16,477
Who are you? Who's that?

1032
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:17,977
I heard it all.

1033
01:04:17,978 --> 01:04:20,270
What's wrong with this dimwit cop?

1034
01:04:23,353 --> 01:04:25,353
Send it over right now.

1035
01:04:25,812 --> 01:04:30,603
And when you have some
time, learn to not be an ass.

1036
01:04:32,645 --> 01:04:34,187
Duk-hee!

1037
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:39,312
Hello? Mrs. Kim?

1038
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:52,436
I better finish up and
punch out for the night.

1039
01:04:52,437 --> 01:04:53,728
I'm so tired.

1040
01:04:56,187 --> 01:04:57,687
<i>I'm sorry</i>

1041
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:02,645
<i>for being an ass.</i>

1042
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:12,062
<i>Send</i>

1043
01:05:22,228 --> 01:05:25,687
This isn't a good time to
eat, but it's so delicious.

1044
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,145
Do you like it?

1045
01:05:28,187 --> 01:05:29,437
Totally.

1046
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:32,728
Did we pass it? I don't see Chunhelou.

1047
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:40,061
Right there! Chunhelou, here!

1048
01:05:40,062 --> 01:05:41,520
That one?

1049
01:05:42,395 --> 01:05:43,978
That's the one!

1050
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,937
- Same as the picture!
- It's the same one!

1051
01:05:46,478 --> 01:05:47,937
We did it! We found it!

1052
01:05:57,478 --> 01:05:59,853
Can't we now get the
detective to take over?

1053
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,478
Call him up.

1054
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:04,020
I need to confirm Son's face first.

1055
01:06:04,103 --> 01:06:05,728
Confirm for what?

1056
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,687
You know how he is!

1057
01:06:08,728 --> 01:06:10,894
"Not sure about the
address, this, that,"

1058
01:06:10,895 --> 01:06:13,602
let's shut him up with pictures!

1059
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:14,562
Hey!

1060
01:06:14,563 --> 01:06:16,312
Someone's coming out.

1061
01:06:16,603 --> 01:06:17,812
Where?

1062
01:06:23,395 --> 01:06:25,603
That's Son, yeah? It's him, right?

1063
01:06:28,353 --> 01:06:31,519
Dang it, I can't see.

1064
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,978
My sight is blocked!

1065
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:34,728
Tell me to stop.

1066
01:06:37,103 --> 01:06:38,228
Stop!

1067
01:06:41,228 --> 01:06:42,353
Turn around.

1068
01:06:44,895 --> 01:06:48,395
Please, come on, turn!

1069
01:06:53,145 --> 01:06:54,394
Okay, got him!

1070
01:06:54,395 --> 01:06:55,228
Good job.

1071
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,187
Did you get him?

1072
01:06:56,228 --> 01:06:57,937
Of course, I did!

1073
01:06:58,603 --> 01:06:59,687
Let's see it.

1074
01:07:00,187 --> 01:07:01,187
<i>Please insert memory card</i>

1075
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,852
- What's wrong?
- I forgot to put in the memory card.

1076
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:08,895
Are you shitting me?

1077
01:07:09,228 --> 01:07:12,352
I'm so sorry, I thought I put it in.

1078
01:07:12,353 --> 01:07:14,478
Why did we bring you?

1079
01:07:15,437 --> 01:07:17,687
I knew this would happen, you moron!

1080
01:07:18,562 --> 01:07:19,894
It's not there!

1081
01:07:19,895 --> 01:07:22,937
If you inserted it, how
could it be gone?!

1082
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:42,395
<i>Here you go.</i>

1083
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:44,187
<i>Thanks.</i>

1084
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:45,228
<i>No problem.</i>

1085
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,478
<i>Thank your friend for lending it to us.</i>

1086
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:49,311
<i>We'll keep it clean.</i>

1087
01:07:49,312 --> 01:07:50,312
<i>Okay.</i>

1088
01:08:00,562 --> 01:08:01,312
Hello, sir.

1089
01:08:01,313 --> 01:08:02,728
I'm taking him to collect today.

1090
01:08:03,728 --> 01:08:04,728
Bong-lim!

1091
01:08:05,187 --> 01:08:06,562
Bong-lim!

1092
01:08:06,645 --> 01:08:07,937
What's wrong?

1093
01:08:08,353 --> 01:08:09,770
Son came out.

1094
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:11,520
Where?

1095
01:08:13,728 --> 01:08:14,852
Got it!

1096
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:17,062
Did you put in the card?

1097
01:08:17,978 --> 01:08:19,645
You forgot again?

1098
01:08:19,853 --> 01:08:21,645
I checked 5 times.

1099
01:08:22,062 --> 01:08:23,812
I almost pissed my pants earlier.

1100
01:08:23,853 --> 01:08:26,395
I almost pissed my pants too.

1101
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,437
What's wrong with them?

1102
01:08:29,645 --> 01:08:31,770
What are they doing?

1103
01:08:35,228 --> 01:08:40,145
<i>It's cheap!</i>

1104
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:44,395
Mr. Son!

1105
01:08:46,895 --> 01:08:49,520
<i>It's cheap!</i>

1106
01:08:50,687 --> 01:08:51,812
Getting in?

1107
01:08:52,103 --> 01:08:53,145
Yes!

1108
01:08:57,728 --> 01:08:58,895
What's with them?

1109
01:08:59,228 --> 01:09:01,603
Just advertising their
laundry business.

1110
01:09:02,603 --> 01:09:04,562
<i>It's cheap!</i>

1111
01:09:04,812 --> 01:09:08,228
They're working their
butts off for pennies.

1112
01:09:15,062 --> 01:09:19,770
<i>It's cheap!</i>

1113
01:09:19,812 --> 01:09:22,770
Oh man, it was upside down!

1114
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,103
There you are.

1115
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:30,853
Where's mine?

1116
01:09:30,895 --> 01:09:31,937
I ordered it.

1117
01:09:31,978 --> 01:09:33,312
Where did you go?

1118
01:09:33,562 --> 01:09:34,728
Foreign affairs.

1119
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,186
What the hell for?

1120
01:09:36,187 --> 01:09:37,478
To ask for their cooperation.

1121
01:09:37,603 --> 01:09:39,395
I didn't give you that order!

1122
01:09:39,437 --> 01:09:41,936
Following your orders is all I do?

1123
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:45,187
I finished all my work and
went on my own time.

1124
01:09:45,353 --> 01:09:48,437
You're not the only cop
here. What's with you?

1125
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:52,645
I think I'm still young.

1126
01:09:53,145 --> 01:09:58,937
After getting 400 pages of
fax, my heart started pounding,

1127
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:03,645
and all I could think of
was 'Let's catch the big wig.'

1128
01:10:03,728 --> 01:10:04,728
You got no address.

1129
01:10:04,729 --> 01:10:06,020
Come on, captain.

1130
01:10:06,145 --> 01:10:09,395
You can't expect everything
served on a platter.

1131
01:10:09,687 --> 01:10:12,352
Send me to China
and I'll get the address!

1132
01:10:12,353 --> 01:10:14,437
Shut up and eat.

1133
01:10:14,603 --> 01:10:15,770
Jesus Christ!

1134
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:19,395
I really don't like you!

1135
01:10:20,853 --> 01:10:23,353
Who's calling me?

1136
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:26,270
What's so hard about sending me there?

1137
01:10:28,270 --> 01:10:29,352
What's this?

1138
01:10:29,353 --> 01:10:31,187
<i>We're here. I think this is the place.</i>

1139
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,520
Soft tofu soup.

1140
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,270
Thank you.

1141
01:10:37,062 --> 01:10:39,103
Can I get more side dishes?

1142
01:10:40,562 --> 01:10:41,811
- Young-su.
- Yeah?

1143
01:10:41,812 --> 01:10:43,102
What do you think?

1144
01:10:43,103 --> 01:10:48,686
It isn't a bad idea to go to
China and look for the location.

1145
01:10:48,687 --> 01:10:49,603
Got that right.

1146
01:10:49,604 --> 01:10:52,520
Get me the address, then I'll send you.

1147
01:10:52,687 --> 01:10:56,562
If I bring him the address,
he'll change his mind.

1148
01:10:56,645 --> 01:10:57,478
I won't.

1149
01:10:57,479 --> 01:11:00,020
You heard him, you're witnesses.

1150
01:11:00,103 --> 01:11:01,187
- Yes, sir.
- Yup.

1151
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:04,603
Captain, sir.

1152
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:06,520
- What is this?
- Look at it.

1153
01:11:07,978 --> 01:11:08,978
Eh?

1154
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:12,186
Is this really the address
for the call center?

1155
01:11:12,187 --> 01:11:16,103
Got the address, now I can eat.

1156
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:19,187
- Young-su.
- Yes?

1157
01:11:19,395 --> 01:11:22,270
Get your passport,
we're going to China.

1158
01:11:26,228 --> 01:11:27,228
Are you okay?

1159
01:11:27,229 --> 01:11:29,645
I think it's something I ate.

1160
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:36,478
That catering service
is like clockwork.

1161
01:11:36,812 --> 01:11:38,853
Once in the morning and once at night.

1162
01:11:39,353 --> 01:11:42,353
They're busy scamming
and eating buffet.

1163
01:11:45,312 --> 01:11:46,895
Should I call Ae-lim?

1164
01:11:47,187 --> 01:11:49,644
It's okay, just need to stitch it.

1165
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:50,645
I'll be back.

1166
01:11:51,728 --> 01:11:53,395
<i>Break time</i>

1167
01:11:54,603 --> 01:11:55,812
<i>She'll do it.</i>

1168
01:12:07,187 --> 01:12:09,187
Good, good!

1169
01:12:23,728 --> 01:12:25,687
Go over there.

1170
01:12:26,395 --> 01:12:27,478
Move, move.

1171
01:12:28,312 --> 01:12:29,687
Go away.

1172
01:12:32,145 --> 01:12:33,187
Go, go.

1173
01:12:33,478 --> 01:12:34,978
Hurry up and go!

1174
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:38,228
Aren't you taking this?

1175
01:12:39,103 --> 01:12:40,728
You forgot this, idiot.

1176
01:12:42,437 --> 01:12:43,478
Go!

1177
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,895
Are you coming with me?

1178
01:12:46,937 --> 01:12:49,853
You've never been there before.

1179
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:02,353
<i>Hello.</i>

1180
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:04,062
<i>Hello.</i>

1181
01:13:05,437 --> 01:13:08,394
I need this fixed up a bit.

1182
01:13:08,395 --> 01:13:10,353
Hey, are you nuts?

1183
01:13:12,062 --> 01:13:13,437
You think you're in Korea?

1184
01:13:14,187 --> 01:13:16,312
Why are you speaking Korean?

1185
01:13:16,603 --> 01:13:17,728
Right.

1186
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,145
<i>This, cut.</i>

1187
01:13:23,937 --> 01:13:25,187
Give it here, dumbass.

1188
01:13:26,395 --> 01:13:29,270
<i>Shorten the sleeves, and iron this.</i>

1189
01:13:36,978 --> 01:13:38,437
<i>Are you on break?</i>

1190
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:42,020
<i>Yes.</i>

1191
01:13:42,603 --> 01:13:43,687
What the hell...

1192
01:13:46,562 --> 01:13:47,353
Let's go elsewhere.

1193
01:13:47,354 --> 01:13:48,478
Why?

1194
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:51,270
She's on a break, she
could've told me earlier.

1195
01:13:54,978 --> 01:13:57,353
<i>Reform, cut.</i>

1196
01:13:59,270 --> 01:13:59,895
<i>Cut.</i>

1197
01:13:59,896 --> 01:14:02,312
<i>So, can you do it now,</i>

1198
01:14:03,728 --> 01:14:04,728
<i>or not?</i>

1199
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:10,145
Should we go over?

1200
01:14:12,395 --> 01:14:16,144
Man, is she deaf or what?
Can't understand me?

1201
01:14:16,145 --> 01:14:16,978
Let's go.

1202
01:14:16,978 --> 01:14:17,978
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

1203
01:14:18,812 --> 01:14:20,353
<i>Will you stay until it's done?</i>

1204
01:14:23,603 --> 01:14:26,937
<i>You can pick it up later.</i>

1205
01:14:30,937 --> 01:14:32,103
<i>Does it take long?</i>

1206
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,270
<i>Only 5 minutes.</i>

1207
01:14:36,395 --> 01:14:37,645
Have a seat.

1208
01:14:38,603 --> 01:14:40,062
<i>We'll wait then.</i>

1209
01:14:40,978 --> 01:14:44,562
<i>Isn't she Chinese?</i>

1210
01:14:45,062 --> 01:14:46,478
<i>Why can't she talk?</i>

1211
01:14:48,895 --> 01:14:49,978
<i>She's...</i>

1212
01:14:53,103 --> 01:14:54,895
<i>dumb.</i>

1213
01:14:55,228 --> 01:14:56,645
For real?

1214
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:00,312
<i>Dumb, dumb.</i>

1215
01:15:02,353 --> 01:15:03,769
She's a bit slow.

1216
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,770
Sorry?

1217
01:15:07,895 --> 01:15:08,978
<i>Dumb?</i>

1218
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:10,937
<i>Dumb.</i>

1219
01:15:20,103 --> 01:15:21,895
She's good.

1220
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,562
Right?

1221
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:24,895
Yes.

1222
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:32,062
Feel like munchies?

1223
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,978
Go get some chips.

1224
01:15:35,478 --> 01:15:36,353
Me?

1225
01:15:36,354 --> 01:15:37,937
Who else, should I go then?

1226
01:15:38,812 --> 01:15:41,520
The one who wants to eat.

1227
01:15:44,687 --> 01:15:47,353
- What's gotten into you today?
- Sorry?

1228
01:15:48,228 --> 01:15:49,769
Go buy it when I tell you to!

1229
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:50,978
<i>Would you like some tea?</i>

1230
01:15:51,062 --> 01:15:52,353
<i>I got coffee too.</i>

1231
01:15:54,728 --> 01:15:55,728
<i>Coffee?</i>

1232
01:15:57,478 --> 01:15:58,520
<i>We have chips too.</i>

1233
01:15:59,145 --> 01:16:00,312
<i>What kind of chips?</i>

1234
01:16:08,478 --> 01:16:09,520
Mr. Son.

1235
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:11,728
Are you really Kim Duk-hee?

1236
01:16:12,853 --> 01:16:13,853
Why?

1237
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:16,352
Am I prettier than you thought?

1238
01:16:16,353 --> 01:16:17,937
You really are her.

1239
01:16:20,562 --> 01:16:21,978
Don't look over there.

1240
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:25,228
I have a cell phone in the basket.

1241
01:16:25,728 --> 01:16:26,978
Take it discretely.

1242
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:31,728
Password is the last
digits of my number.

1243
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:19,769
<i>Use this in emergency, call or
text when the big boss comes.</i>

1244
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:24,812
<i>Det. Park will arrive tomorrow,
he'll raid with Chinese cops.</i>

1245
01:17:25,603 --> 01:17:27,812
This is the earliest available flight.

1246
01:17:27,895 --> 01:17:31,770
What am I supposed to say
when there's no earlier flight?

1247
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:34,102
<i>It's a weird question, no?</i>

1248
01:17:34,103 --> 01:17:37,270
All right, so you'll be here by 3 AM?

1249
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:38,937
3:05 AM to be exact.

1250
01:17:39,478 --> 01:17:41,270
Shit, I forgot my passport.

1251
01:17:41,312 --> 01:17:45,937
You'll raid the call center tomorrow?

1252
01:17:45,978 --> 01:17:46,770
<i>Yes.</i>

1253
01:17:46,771 --> 01:17:48,894
We got the warrant and
the Chinese police are ready.

1254
01:17:48,895 --> 01:17:51,937
You got nothing to
worry about, so, pack up.

1255
01:17:52,187 --> 01:17:54,478
I'll take care of everything from now.

1256
01:17:54,687 --> 01:17:56,019
Can I really pack up?

1257
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:59,019
This operation is extremely
sensitive and dangerous.

1258
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:03,395
Mrs. Kim, let us meet again

1259
01:18:03,437 --> 01:18:05,437
<i>in good health and healthy mind.</i>

1260
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:07,103
I'm off then.

1261
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:11,478
Same bullshit every day.

1262
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:39,062
What's with the urgent summon?

1263
01:18:40,978 --> 01:18:42,687
Any word from the big boss?

1264
01:18:42,895 --> 01:18:45,437
He wants all the managers
to gather and wait here.

1265
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:49,853
Where you going?

1266
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:53,562
I'm about to shit my pants...

1267
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,728
- Hurry the hell up.
- Yup.

1268
01:19:10,937 --> 01:19:12,353
Why aren't you sleeping?

1269
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:14,478
Just came out for fresh air.

1270
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,187
Sit here.

1271
01:19:22,312 --> 01:19:23,562
Uncomfortable?

1272
01:19:23,687 --> 01:19:24,895
I'm all right.

1273
01:19:25,645 --> 01:19:27,478
Why don't you sleep inside?

1274
01:19:28,145 --> 01:19:30,187
I can't leave you alone.

1275
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:34,312
Sorry.

1276
01:19:35,728 --> 01:19:38,812
But I still want to see
them arrest the big boss.

1277
01:19:40,895 --> 01:19:42,895
I got everyone in this mess.

1278
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:47,728
Bong-lim called me

1279
01:19:48,437 --> 01:19:52,687
every day in tears when
she first went to Korea.

1280
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:54,978
Because she missed you?

1281
01:19:56,312 --> 01:19:57,812
She was sad.

1282
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:04,853
Remember when a wallet
went missing at the factory?

1283
01:20:05,603 --> 01:20:08,895
You don't know how happy she was

1284
01:20:09,562 --> 01:20:14,395
when you stood up for her
when everyone wanted

1285
01:20:14,562 --> 01:20:17,395
her to open up her purse.

1286
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:23,145
They were ganging up on
her, it wasn't even her fault.

1287
01:20:23,562 --> 01:20:25,728
You didn't do anything wrong either.

1288
01:20:32,062 --> 01:20:33,478
Thanks.

1289
01:20:38,645 --> 01:20:40,937
<i>Big boss is on the way here.</i>

1290
01:20:54,812 --> 01:20:56,019
- Duk-hee!
- What?

1291
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:57,020
Got a text!

1292
01:20:58,728 --> 01:21:00,145
The big boss is coming!

1293
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:03,062
Get in the car!

1294
01:21:08,687 --> 01:21:11,270
What's going on? Am I dreaming?

1295
01:21:11,353 --> 01:21:12,477
Wake up!

1296
01:21:12,478 --> 01:21:13,769
What the heck is going on?

1297
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:15,103
Big boss is coming.

1298
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:18,686
What do we do? When
are the cops coming?

1299
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:20,228
<i>Don't panic, act natural.</i>

1300
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:23,562
<i>Detective is on the plane.</i>

1301
01:21:27,437 --> 01:21:28,895
<i>I'll try.</i>

1302
01:21:31,228 --> 01:21:33,853
There's a car coming, could it be him?

1303
01:21:42,437 --> 01:21:43,603
What is that?

1304
01:21:48,228 --> 01:21:49,478
Are you on the way?

1305
01:21:50,812 --> 01:21:52,812
We're waiting for you.

1306
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:04,727
Shit, was this a trap?

1307
01:22:04,728 --> 01:22:05,728
Check it out.

1308
01:22:07,395 --> 01:22:08,353
Stop them!

1309
01:22:08,395 --> 01:22:09,645
What the hell?

1310
01:22:45,478 --> 01:22:46,895
Please save me...

1311
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,395
You asshole!

1312
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,228
Something's not right.

1313
01:23:05,437 --> 01:23:07,270
Then he would have called.

1314
01:23:34,395 --> 01:23:36,062
Something's definitely wrong.

1315
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:37,853
What's with the catering at this hour?

1316
01:23:38,103 --> 01:23:39,437
Someone's getting off!

1317
01:23:47,312 --> 01:23:49,602
Is that the big boss? Bucket hat.

1318
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:50,853
Where?

1319
01:23:52,228 --> 01:23:53,561
<i>All clear upstairs?</i>

1320
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:54,762
<i>Yes, sir, you can go upstairs.</i>

1321
01:23:55,187 --> 01:23:56,853
Hey, where are you going?

1322
01:23:57,187 --> 01:24:00,061
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

1323
01:24:00,062 --> 01:24:02,353
This will cost you more
than just your arm.

1324
01:24:02,603 --> 01:24:04,936
She's right, Mr. Son will call.

1325
01:24:04,937 --> 01:24:07,270
What if he's not able to?

1326
01:24:07,395 --> 01:24:09,353
And you want to jump into that fray?

1327
01:24:09,478 --> 01:24:12,728
She's right, we should
wait for Det. Park.

1328
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:21,228
What the hell are they doing?

1329
01:24:27,978 --> 01:24:29,228
They're running away.

1330
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:32,187
They're trying to run away right now!

1331
01:24:55,978 --> 01:24:57,895
<i>Cops are coming tomorrow?</i>

1332
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:00,187
<i>Yes, I got the intel from mole.</i>

1333
01:25:00,603 --> 01:25:01,520
<i>And the pawns?</i>

1334
01:25:01,521 --> 01:25:04,478
<i>Sent one load to Guangzhou,
and another to Chongqing.</i>

1335
01:25:09,103 --> 01:25:11,102
<i>Good job with the clean-up.</i>

1336
01:25:11,103 --> 01:25:12,103
<i>Don't worry, boss.</i>

1337
01:25:27,437 --> 01:25:28,478
Damn.

1338
01:25:58,937 --> 01:25:59,937
Hey!

1339
01:26:10,228 --> 01:26:13,394
D-de-de-detective, where are you now?

1340
01:26:13,395 --> 01:26:14,937
I just arrived.

1341
01:26:16,395 --> 01:26:18,187
They're all running away!

1342
01:26:18,228 --> 01:26:19,311
They won't ever leave<i>.</i>

1343
01:26:19,312 --> 01:26:22,187
What kind of a boss would
leave his shop behind and run?

1344
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,727
<i>And take that much loss?</i>

1345
01:26:23,728 --> 01:26:25,853
It doesn't look that way!

1346
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:27,894
<i>I figured out what's going on,</i>

1347
01:26:27,895 --> 01:26:28,936
They're running.

1348
01:26:28,937 --> 01:26:31,977
<i>So don't be hasty. If you
move on your own accord,</i>

1349
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:34,186
the operation can be jeopardized.

1350
01:26:34,187 --> 01:26:36,187
So, don't do anything
and stay safe, got it?

1351
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:37,977
Isn't this too dangerous?

1352
01:26:37,978 --> 01:26:40,769
- Which one should we follow?
<i>- Call center is dangerous,</i>

1353
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:43,811
<i>so don't even go near
it, did you get that?</i>

1354
01:26:43,812 --> 01:26:50,395
- Screw them, let's go home!
- Let's wait until cops arrive.

1355
01:26:56,187 --> 01:26:59,436
Ae-lim, let's go after that fancy car.

1356
01:26:59,437 --> 01:27:00,645
Okay.

1357
01:27:00,728 --> 01:27:01,812
Let's go!

1358
01:27:10,603 --> 01:27:12,103
<i>Wait, wait!</i>

1359
01:27:12,187 --> 01:27:13,645
Take us to the hospital!

1360
01:27:15,478 --> 01:27:16,520
Mr. Son?

1361
01:27:18,978 --> 01:27:21,145
Mr. Son? Is that you?

1362
01:27:21,228 --> 01:27:22,270
Mr. Son!

1363
01:27:22,645 --> 01:27:23,895
Are you Korean?

1364
01:27:24,395 --> 01:27:27,353
What happened to you?

1365
01:27:28,603 --> 01:27:29,562
Oh my goodness!

1366
01:27:29,563 --> 01:27:32,645
Son, what happened to you?

1367
01:27:33,187 --> 01:27:35,602
Call an ambulance!

1368
01:27:35,603 --> 01:27:36,811
Okay, I got it.

1369
01:27:36,812 --> 01:27:39,269
I can't remember the
number for ambulance.

1370
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:40,519
Let me call.

1371
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:44,103
What happened? We
were texting just now.

1372
01:27:44,145 --> 01:27:47,312
I don't know, I woke
up from my black out,

1373
01:27:47,478 --> 01:27:50,520
no one was in the dorm,
and he was covered in blood.

1374
01:27:53,395 --> 01:27:54,603
Mr. Son.

1375
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:57,728
Jae-min, ambulance is on its way.

1376
01:28:01,895 --> 01:28:02,978
I...

1377
01:28:04,478 --> 01:28:06,478
I took pictures of everything.

1378
01:28:09,687 --> 01:28:12,312
All right, I'll take a look.

1379
01:28:14,478 --> 01:28:16,478
I'm sorry...

1380
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:21,937
for scamming you...

1381
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:26,103
I didn't want to do it, I'm so sorry...

1382
01:28:27,228 --> 01:28:33,519
It's all my fault, all those
people I scammed...

1383
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,812
It's okay, stop talking.

1384
01:28:43,687 --> 01:28:45,687
Did you really see the big boss?

1385
01:28:45,812 --> 01:28:47,102
Yes, I'm sure.

1386
01:28:47,103 --> 01:28:49,103
I got a real good look.

1387
01:28:49,937 --> 01:28:53,312
How the hell are we supposed
to recognize him with this?

1388
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:00,270
I feel so bad for Duk-hee.

1389
01:29:12,728 --> 01:29:14,269
- Bong-lim.
- Yeah?

1390
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:16,103
What the hell is he saying?

1391
01:29:16,562 --> 01:29:17,645
Let's hear it.

1392
01:29:23,645 --> 01:29:26,312
"Make it look natural,
like it's a drug war."

1393
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,312
"Spread it here?"

1394
01:29:33,812 --> 01:29:35,312
"That's good."

1395
01:29:36,937 --> 01:29:38,270
"Did you book the flight?"

1396
01:29:38,978 --> 01:29:40,478
"Yes, we can leave now."

1397
01:29:41,603 --> 01:29:42,895
"Qingdao airport?"

1398
01:29:45,562 --> 01:29:47,353
Qingdao airport!

1399
01:29:47,728 --> 01:29:49,062
Qingdao airport?

1400
01:29:49,645 --> 01:29:50,562
What do we do?

1401
01:29:50,563 --> 01:29:51,853
What are we going to do?

1402
01:29:54,812 --> 01:29:59,062
<i>Third tip
August 21st, 2016</i>

1403
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:43,644
When's the translator coming?

1404
01:30:43,645 --> 01:30:45,019
He'll be here by 8.

1405
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:46,687
What? Tell him to hurry up!

1406
01:30:46,895 --> 01:30:47,770
He said he lives far away.

1407
01:30:47,812 --> 01:30:49,394
My house is further away.

1408
01:30:49,395 --> 01:30:50,770
Det. Park?

1409
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:54,603
Det. Park! It's really you!

1410
01:30:54,895 --> 01:30:58,353
I'm Duk-hee's friend, Bong-lim,
this is Mr. Son's friend.

1411
01:30:58,437 --> 01:31:01,394
This is really urgent,
let's chat later.

1412
01:31:01,395 --> 01:31:02,395
It was nice meeting you.

1413
01:31:02,437 --> 01:31:03,562
No, wait detective!

1414
01:31:12,437 --> 01:31:14,103
<i>I can't speak English, speak Chinese.</i>

1415
01:31:17,437 --> 01:31:20,978
<i>They're police from Korea and
want to meet your supervisor.</i>

1416
01:31:21,853 --> 01:31:22,853
<i>Okay.</i>

1417
01:31:25,728 --> 01:31:27,395
You can't speak Chinese?

1418
01:31:29,062 --> 01:31:30,437
You speak so well.

1419
01:31:30,978 --> 01:31:32,562
<i>Come this way.</i>

1420
01:31:32,812 --> 01:31:34,520
He wants you to go in.

1421
01:31:39,978 --> 01:31:40,978
Ms. Bong-lim.

1422
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:43,769
Oh my, why are you holding my hand?

1423
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:45,270
Please come with us.

1424
01:31:46,770 --> 01:31:48,270
You must be mad...

1425
01:31:50,187 --> 01:31:53,145
<i>It happened suddenly, we had no choice.</i>

1426
01:31:53,187 --> 01:31:55,227
Of course, it would happen suddenly.

1427
01:31:55,228 --> 01:31:55,978
<i>Hey!</i>

1428
01:31:56,228 --> 01:31:56,812
Huh?

1429
01:31:56,813 --> 01:31:58,093
<i>What's wrong with your attitude?</i>

1430
01:31:58,562 --> 01:32:01,603
Stop pointing that thing at her!

1431
01:32:02,687 --> 01:32:05,270
Please concentrate on translating.

1432
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,477
He pissed me off.

1433
01:32:07,478 --> 01:32:10,437
It's all right, so what'll happen now?

1434
01:32:10,478 --> 01:32:12,437
<i>Then what will happen now?</i>

1435
01:32:12,812 --> 01:32:15,395
<i>Narcotics will take over from here.</i>

1436
01:32:15,562 --> 01:32:17,770
He said narcotics will take over.

1437
01:32:18,062 --> 01:32:19,437
Narcotics?

1438
01:32:20,187 --> 01:32:22,519
How are they involved in this?

1439
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,395
<i>See what I told you?</i>

1440
01:32:24,437 --> 01:32:27,312
<i>You disgraced us internationally.</i>

1441
01:32:27,353 --> 01:32:31,062
How is following a lead a disgrace?

1442
01:32:31,687 --> 01:32:34,478
This isn't about drugs, the
big wig is cutting off his tail!

1443
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:37,228
<i>In any case, we have to fix it!</i>

1444
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:41,186
<i>How can you justify being there,
and come back empty-handed?</i>

1445
01:32:41,187 --> 01:32:43,227
But not the narcos!

1446
01:32:43,228 --> 01:32:46,270
Captain, this is all wrong!

1447
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:50,103
If they take over,
we'll lose him for good!

1448
01:32:50,145 --> 01:32:54,395
<i>Who cares, you'll never catch
him, he's too smart for you.</i>

1449
01:32:54,562 --> 01:32:56,186
<i>Book your return flight and come home.</i>

1450
01:32:56,187 --> 01:32:57,602
Qingdao, I'm right...

1451
01:32:57,603 --> 01:32:58,687
Stop! Stop!

1452
01:33:00,478 --> 01:33:01,520
<i>What do you want?</i>

1453
01:33:01,853 --> 01:33:04,312
Bong-lim, please translate for me!

1454
01:33:06,228 --> 01:33:07,437
<i>Wait a sec!</i>

1455
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,687
<i>What is with you people?</i>

1456
01:33:08,812 --> 01:33:10,145
<i>What the hell do you want?</i>

1457
01:33:10,895 --> 01:33:13,853
My informant tells me the
big boss is at the airport.

1458
01:33:13,895 --> 01:33:17,103
I'll head over there now,
so lend me 2 officers?

1459
01:33:17,145 --> 01:33:18,145
Let's go!

1460
01:33:27,395 --> 01:33:28,853
<i>I can feel your passion,</i>

1461
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,437
<i>but this is Qingdao.</i>

1462
01:33:30,853 --> 01:33:33,937
<i>You may be a detective
in Korea, but not here.</i>

1463
01:33:34,812 --> 01:33:36,228
It's okay, go ahead.

1464
01:33:36,853 --> 01:33:38,394
"What's wrong with you?

1465
01:33:38,395 --> 01:33:41,103
You may be a detective
in Korea, but not here,"

1466
01:33:43,062 --> 01:33:44,437
is what he said...

1467
01:33:51,145 --> 01:33:52,853
That's why I'm asking for this favor.

1468
01:33:52,978 --> 01:33:55,520
This isn't Korea and I can't catch him,

1469
01:33:56,728 --> 01:33:58,519
so please help me.

1470
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,395
<i>That's why I'm asking for this favor.</i>

1471
01:34:00,478 --> 01:34:03,519
<i>This isn't Korea and I can't catch him.</i>

1472
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,228
<i>Please help me.</i>

1473
01:34:06,478 --> 01:34:10,770
<i>If you don't move
now, I'll tell everyone</i>

1474
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:14,602
<i>that you lost the big
boss because of you.</i>

1475
01:34:14,603 --> 01:34:16,977
<i>I'll post it online,</i>

1476
01:34:16,978 --> 01:34:19,937
<i>and tell BCC news overseas!</i>

1477
01:34:19,978 --> 01:34:22,145
<i>Let's see who gets shamed!</i>

1478
01:34:25,687 --> 01:34:26,687
Done.

1479
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:31,603
<i>Brother, please.</i>

1480
01:34:48,145 --> 01:34:49,603
<i>Duk-hee! Wait for me!</i>

1481
01:35:27,103 --> 01:35:28,395
<i>Dad!</i>

1482
01:35:55,937 --> 01:35:56,937
Duk-hee!

1483
01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:58,519
I looked everywhere for you!

1484
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,562
Sook-ja...

1485
01:36:00,145 --> 01:36:01,728
- Yeah?
- That's him right there.

1486
01:36:01,812 --> 01:36:03,812
Big boss? Are you sure?

1487
01:36:03,937 --> 01:36:04,645
Yeah.

1488
01:36:04,646 --> 01:36:05,770
What should we do?

1489
01:36:05,812 --> 01:36:07,978
Should we call Ae-lim?

1490
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,603
She went to the airport security.

1491
01:36:12,020 --> 01:36:14,312
Wait, let's think while we follow.

1492
01:36:16,103 --> 01:36:17,478
<i>The Guangzhou center is open.</i>

1493
01:36:17,937 --> 01:36:20,062
<i>Qingdao kids will
arrive in the afternoon.</i>

1494
01:36:22,062 --> 01:36:24,770
<i>Have all of them re-educated.</i>

1495
01:36:26,312 --> 01:36:29,728
How can we do that? We can't catch him.

1496
01:36:29,812 --> 01:36:32,937
We have to buy some time
until Det. Park gets here.

1497
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:34,562
Is he even coming?

1498
01:36:34,645 --> 01:36:35,853
When?

1499
01:36:36,562 --> 01:36:37,812
He's looking this way.

1500
01:36:37,895 --> 01:36:39,270
Is he looking at us?

1501
01:36:44,312 --> 01:36:46,978
<i>Why are you following me around?</i>

1502
01:36:54,812 --> 01:36:58,269
I asked you a question,
why are you following me?

1503
01:36:58,270 --> 01:37:00,187
Are you a cop or a stalker?

1504
01:37:00,603 --> 01:37:04,353
It's nothing, we're really nobody!

1505
01:37:10,145 --> 01:37:11,687
I'm... a victim.

1506
01:37:11,937 --> 01:37:12,978
Huh?

1507
01:37:13,353 --> 01:37:15,686
You voice phished me.

1508
01:37:15,687 --> 01:37:18,062
A victim?

1509
01:37:19,687 --> 01:37:21,562
Don't laugh, you make me puke.

1510
01:37:21,978 --> 01:37:23,020
Hey.

1511
01:37:25,103 --> 01:37:27,395
Do I look like I'm laughing?

1512
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:33,270
How much did you lose?

1513
01:37:34,895 --> 01:37:36,062
$32,000.

1514
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:37,770
What a moron.

1515
01:37:38,895 --> 01:37:40,687
$32,000?

1516
01:37:41,645 --> 01:37:43,770
You followed me for that?

1517
01:37:56,228 --> 01:37:58,687
It's $100,000, worth
more in Korean currency.

1518
01:37:59,437 --> 01:38:01,728
Take this and piss off,

1519
01:38:01,812 --> 01:38:06,520
or I can get someone
to bury you quietly.

1520
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:14,103
It's a warning to stay
away, you got that?

1521
01:38:24,145 --> 01:38:28,062
And smile, you made some profit.

1522
01:38:32,937 --> 01:38:34,686
<i>Would threatening them be enough?</i>

1523
01:38:34,687 --> 01:38:35,895
<i>Them?</i>

1524
01:38:35,978 --> 01:38:38,103
<i>They were trembling.</i>

1525
01:38:38,478 --> 01:38:39,853
Let's get out of here.

1526
01:38:40,478 --> 01:38:42,145
I couldn't speak my mind.

1527
01:38:42,437 --> 01:38:45,145
You did so well holding back.

1528
01:38:45,312 --> 01:38:47,562
It's best not to get
involved with them.

1529
01:38:47,687 --> 01:38:50,728
You may feel bad, but at
least you got the money.

1530
01:38:50,895 --> 01:38:52,145
Let's go.

1531
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,312
Come on.

1532
01:38:57,103 --> 01:38:58,312
Sook-ja.

1533
01:38:58,770 --> 01:38:59,770
Yeah?

1534
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:02,895
Don't do anything stupid.

1535
01:39:03,853 --> 01:39:05,187
You stay right here.

1536
01:39:06,353 --> 01:39:08,478
Are you insane?!

1537
01:39:08,937 --> 01:39:10,895
What are you going to do?

1538
01:39:12,687 --> 01:39:16,394
<i>I swear, the head scammer
is in the airport right now!</i>

1539
01:39:16,395 --> 01:39:17,437
<i>Go away!</i>

1540
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:20,020
<i>I won't!</i>

1541
01:39:20,145 --> 01:39:21,270
<i>Do you want to be arrested?</i>

1542
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,187
<i>This is obstruction of justice!</i>

1543
01:39:24,312 --> 01:39:25,644
<i>Let's go catch the scammer!</i>

1544
01:39:25,645 --> 01:39:27,853
<i>Hurry!</i>

1545
01:39:27,937 --> 01:39:29,270
Ae-lim!

1546
01:39:31,437 --> 01:39:32,770
Sook-ja!

1547
01:39:34,728 --> 01:39:35,977
What happened?

1548
01:39:35,978 --> 01:39:39,811
I should've stopped
Duk-hee but I couldn't!

1549
01:39:39,812 --> 01:39:41,562
What are you talking about?

1550
01:39:41,603 --> 01:39:43,562
Did something happen to her?

1551
01:39:49,853 --> 01:39:51,020
<i>How much time left?</i>

1552
01:39:51,187 --> 01:39:52,270
<i>We can head over there now.</i>

1553
01:39:52,812 --> 01:39:54,062
Buddy!

1554
01:39:55,062 --> 01:39:56,645
Voice phishing!

1555
01:39:58,312 --> 01:40:00,353
Voice phishing big boss!

1556
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:05,895
Take this, asshole!

1557
01:40:07,812 --> 01:40:09,395
Is it my fault for being scammed?

1558
01:40:09,937 --> 01:40:10,728
What?

1559
01:40:10,729 --> 01:40:13,020
Am I dumb for being scammed?

1560
01:40:13,937 --> 01:40:15,187
No.

1561
01:40:16,603 --> 01:40:18,228
It wasn't my fault.

1562
01:40:19,312 --> 01:40:21,853
It's you, who's at fault,

1563
01:40:23,270 --> 01:40:25,312
for exploiting desperate people.

1564
01:40:30,603 --> 01:40:32,562
So, what the hell do you want?

1565
01:40:39,395 --> 01:40:43,437
Turn yourself in, before
I drag you there.

1566
01:40:54,603 --> 01:40:56,312
Turn yourself...

1567
01:40:57,353 --> 01:40:58,353
What did you say?

1568
01:41:02,187 --> 01:41:03,437
I can't hear you.

1569
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:11,478
I said I can't hear you, bitch.

1570
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:18,020
You're being so annoying.

1571
01:41:25,645 --> 01:41:28,395
You got blood on my hand.

1572
01:41:38,312 --> 01:41:39,603
Let go.

1573
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:42,270
Let go of me.

1574
01:41:44,895 --> 01:41:46,603
<i>It's time to board, sir.</i>

1575
01:41:51,395 --> 01:41:52,478
<i>Let's go.</i>

1576
01:42:26,103 --> 01:42:28,562

Did you lose something?

1587
01:43:06,937 --> 01:43:08,645
Last chance, give it back.

1588
01:43:39,687 --> 01:43:44,312
Myung-hwan, if you make someone cry,

1589
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:49,437
you'll cry a river.

happened to your face?

01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,228
That's why I told you to hurry up.

1603
01:45:22,978 --> 01:45:25,187
You're always a step behind.

I'm not a step behind,
you're always a step ahead.

1605
01:45:29,062 --> 01:45:31,645
I told you to stay back
because it's dangerous.

1606
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:33,811
Look at your face now.

1607

do? He was running away!

1608

01:45:52,145 --> 01:45:54,478
Damn, look at you.

1612
01:45:54,687 --> 01:45:56,020
Can you even get up?

1613
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,770
Do I still have my nose?

1614
01:46:00,812 --> 01:46:01,812
It's still there.

1615
01:46:02,103 --> 01:46:03,728
Duk-hee!

1616
01:46:08,978 --> 01:46:10,062
Are you all right?

1617
01:46:10,353 --> 01:46:12,353
I'm so fucking tired...

1618
01:46:13,937 --> 01:46:16,395
Let me carry you.

1619
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:21,603
Ae-lim, Sook-ja, I can still walk.

1620
01:46:21,645 --> 01:46:23,353
Duk-hee...

1621
01:46:23,645 --> 01:46:25,520
<i>Move it, move please!</i>

1622
01:46:26,145 --> 01:46:27,562
Oh, my Lord.

1623
01:46:29,395 --> 01:46:31,270
<i>My friend caught the scammer.</i>

1624
01:46:31,687 --> 01:46:33,645
<i>Please move aside.</i>

1625
01:46:35,395 --> 01:46:36,770
Move out of the way!

1626
01:47:05,062 --> 01:47:07,103
Is this you?

1627
01:47:08,645 --> 01:47:14,728
Yes, I wanted to escape,
but couldn't call the cops.

1628
01:47:15,937 --> 01:47:20,603
So, I called Kim Duk-hee
to report it for me.

1629
01:47:22,062 --> 01:47:24,603
- Can you hear me out?
- Here you go.

1630
01:47:24,645 --> 01:47:26,187
Isn't it your day off?

1631
01:47:26,603 --> 01:47:29,602
I have to make money, I'm
off after making a round.

1632
01:47:29,603 --> 01:47:31,895
- Okay, see you.
- Take care.

1633
01:47:31,937 --> 01:47:33,061
Here, Mrs. Kim.

1634
01:47:33,062 --> 01:47:36,353
<i>Settlement Agreement</i>
Just sign this and we'll pay you out right away.

1635
01:47:36,687 --> 01:47:38,520
My answer remains the same.

1636
01:47:39,062 --> 01:47:40,395
Don't ever come back.

1637
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:43,645
You're so stubborn, Mrs. Kim Duk-hee.

1638
01:47:43,687 --> 01:47:45,936
It's not because I
represent Oh Myung-hwan,

1639
01:47:45,937 --> 01:47:47,978
this is $300,000!

1640
01:47:48,103 --> 01:47:49,603
Chances like this isn't common.

1641
01:47:49,687 --> 01:47:52,937
You won the lottery, a jackpot!

1642
01:47:54,437 --> 01:47:56,978
You can shove the
jackpot up the jackass's ass.

1643
01:47:57,187 --> 01:47:59,686
Relay a message to Oh in prison for me.

1644
01:47:59,687 --> 01:48:00,894
Mrs. Kim!

1645
01:48:00,895 --> 01:48:04,602
Don't fuck around with victims' money.

1646
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:07,520
Mrs. Kim!

1647
01:48:26,937 --> 01:48:27,645
Hey.

1648
01:48:27,646 --> 01:48:29,602
<i>Mommy, when are you coming?</i>

1649
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:31,769
<i>We bought a cake.</i>

1650
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:35,728
<i>Why did you tell her?
It's a surprise party.</i>

1651
01:48:36,145 --> 01:48:38,562
<i>Right, mommy, it's a surprise party.</i>

1652
01:48:38,895 --> 01:48:40,478
All right, it's a secret.

1653
01:48:40,978 --> 01:48:43,645
<i>Where are you? Hurry up!</i>

1654
01:48:44,895 --> 01:48:47,228
<i>We'll finish it if you don't come soon.</i>

1655
01:48:47,312 --> 01:48:49,144
<i>I'm hungry, hurry!</i>

1656
01:48:49,145 --> 01:48:51,228
Okay, I'll be right there.
