Here, eat quickly.

Don't be afraid.

You. Come here.

Are you taking care

29
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,200
of all these children?

30
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,920
Since they got sick a few days ago,

31
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,630
it's only me left.

32
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,400
Even though they all need you,

33
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,960
I don't want you to be a thief.

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,240
Hongyi,

35
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,040
go find a doctor

36
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,590
to treat them

37
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,350
and bring some food over.

38
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,400
Miss, you are our great benefactor.

39
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Get up quickly.

40
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,630
From now on, I am your servant.

41
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,320
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,550
My servant?

43
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,040
What's your name?

44
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,710
I don't have a name.

45
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,070
I spent ten taels of silver to save you.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,480
From now on, your name is Ten.

47
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,120
Thanks for the name, Miss.

48
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,520
Remember to repay me.

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,760
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,710
My team found this in Nanzhao's archive.

51
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,000
- What is this?
- What is this?

52
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,150
This is Isolated Island's totem.

53
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,150
(Isolated Island)

54
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,480
Throughout the Longyuan Continent,

55
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,070
only Nanzhao represents each

56
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,920
of its territories

57
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,350
with a totem.

58
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,490
This one is the Isolated Island.

59
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,560
This is exactly the same as the totem

60
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,200
on the Liuguang Dagger
that my mother left to me.

61
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,990
Your Highness, could the totem on the dagger

62
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,280
be found by someone else?

63
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,800
Your Highness.

64
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,440
Your dagger is very special.

65
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
Are you interested in my dagger?

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,190
I just feel

67
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,190
that

68
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,070
when I was young

69
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,510
I saw this dagger.

70
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,680
Your Highness.

71
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,960
Can I have a look?

72
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,070
Don't worry.

73
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,680
I have been carefully keeping it
since I was young.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,840
No one has seen it.

75
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,800
- What's wrong?
- Your Highness.

76
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,440
You are finally back.

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,910
His Highness has been waiting for you
to have dinner for a long time.

78
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,560
Why is he waiting for me?

79
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,750
Can't he eat by himself?

80
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,280
- Does he want me to feed him?
- Your Highness.

81
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,590
Hongyi,

82
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,120
help her tidy up.

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,960
Yes.

84
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,030
Let's go.

85
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,750
Dinner's ready?

86
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,310
Why are you back so late?

87
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,350
Didn't you tell me to go out?

88
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,400
I just played a bit longer.

89
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,510
Since you are back now,

90
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,990
you must have had dinner outside, right?

91
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,280
I…

92
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,350
I'm full now.

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,280
Clear the table.

94
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,440
I haven't had dinner yet.

95
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,680
Don't clear it.

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,520
Leave some for me.

97
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,720
Fine.

98
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,560
Who cares?

99
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,560
I'll make my midnight snack.

100
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,160
Your Highness, is it edible?

101
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,840
Of course, it's delicious.

102
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:13,910
Come in.

103
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,400
Your Highness, Ten is here.

104
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,280
The little girl looks nice.

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,000
I have a good taste. Come here.

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,000
Your Highness.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Can I do something for you?

108
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,280
What can you do now?

109
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,190
Sit down and eat with me.

110
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,790
Your Highness, is it edible?

111
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,750
Of course, it is.

112
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,240
It's very delicious.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,960
Then let me serve you.

114
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,400
Are you not listening to me?

115
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
Sit down and eat with me.

116
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,510
Come on, sit down.

117
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

118
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,510
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Sit down.

119
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

120
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,680
I haven't eaten this in a long time.

121
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,350
Yummy.

122
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,560
Try it quickly.

123
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
It's really good.

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,120
Is it edible without frying?

125
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,870
Try it.

126
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,070
Your Highness,

127
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,470
it's so hot.

128
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,750
Blow on it, and it won't be hot.

129
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,880
You have to eat it like this.

130
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,150
It's delicious.

131
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,600
Here, for you.

132
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,590
Come over.

133
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,030
Shadow,

134
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,720
prepare it for me.

135
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,630
- Okay.
- You try it too.

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,960
Alright, Your Highness.

137
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,980
Your Highness, please change clothes.

138
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
Change what clothes?

139
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,310
I just changed,
and now I have to change again?

140
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,170
Your Highness, have you forgotten?

141
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,510
Today you're going to the palace
with the Fourth Prince.

142
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,350
For what?

143
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,590
I remember it now.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,680
Last time, when I was supposed
to express gratitude,

145
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,120
I ended up in the Judicial Office.

146
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,030
Do I have to go again this time?

147
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm not going.

148
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,630
Your Highness, you must go.

149
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,410
His Highness is already waiting
at the door.

150
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,910
Come on, let's go.

151
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,740
(Wanshou Hall)

152
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,190
(This is the palace
where the King lives.)

153
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,360
(It's even more luxurious
than Yiqing Palace.)

154
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,800
(How much money do they have to levy)

155
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,720
(to live such a lavish life?)

156
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Do you need me to remind you?

157
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,960
Your Highness, feel free to speak.

158
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,550
I'm also afraid
of not understanding the rules

159
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,590
and embarrassing you.

160
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,750
You are quite humble.

161
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,840
Ziqing and I

162
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,070
are greeting to Father.

163
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,600
From now on, we are all families.

164
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,040
No need for formalities.

165
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,150
Ziqing,

166
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,040
about the trial,

167
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,400
Beiyue should take the blame.

168
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,240
That day,

169
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,750
I didn't see him,

170
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,800
and I almost wronged you.

171
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,920
He knew that you're perceptive,

172
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,840
and would not wrong me.

173
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,360
That's why he didn't come.

174
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,720
Listen to what she said.

175
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,280
She's eloquent.

176
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,270
Beiyue,

177
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,480
it seems that back then,

178
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,110
it was right for me
to let you choose your consort.

179
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,510
By the way, Father,

180
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,510
the envoy from Xiling

181
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,840
has postponed their visit again.

182
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,510
Should the autumn hunt

183
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,960
proceed as scheduled?

184
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,510
Ziqing, this is your first time
coming in the palace, right?

185
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,360
Last time, the Queen invited me for tea.

186
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,070
But I haven't got to take a tour yet.

187
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,030
I see.

188
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,840
Let Beiyue

189
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,400
play a game of chess with me.

190
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,280
And you can take a good walk

191
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,000
in the Imperial Garden.

192
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

193
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,540
Someone.

194
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,760
Your Majesty.

195
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,550
Take the Fourth Princess Consort
for a walk in the Imperial Garden.

196
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,960
Serve her well.

197
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,430
Yes, Your Highness, please.

198
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,600
Don't wander around.

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
Understood.

200
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,510
Don't follow me.

201
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,560
Yes.

202
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,280
(Master?)

203
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,510
(I seem to have heard this somewhere.)

204
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,640
(It's strange.)

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,400
(I don't understand musical rhythm
at all.)

206
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,890
(Why do I seem to know
its rhythm and playing skills)

207
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,160
(when I listen to it?)

208
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,600
(What's going on?)

209
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,960
Only Mr. Lige
can play such beautiful music

210
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,430
for us to hear.

211
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,310
Today, we are truly honored.

212
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,720
Indeed.

213
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,240
Ziqing.

214
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,210
Hello, Beiyue.

215
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,720
Why don't you sit down and have a drink?

216
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,120
Beishen.

217
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,160
Your tastes are so unique now.

218
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,710
Let's go.

219
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,490
No, Beiyue. Well…

220
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,720
Just now, Beiyue

221
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,310
said our tastes are unique.

222
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,550
What does that mean?

223
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,110
From now on, stay away from Jun Beichen.

224
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,430
I was just passing by.

225
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,960
I said stay away from him.

226
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
Did you hear me?

227
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,630
Why are you being so angry?

228
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,720
I said stay away from him.

229
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,390
Did you hear me?

230
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,550
But that was close just now.

231
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,400
Luckily, he forgot that I got him drunk

232
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,720
and made him pass out.

233
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,400
He

234
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,480
doesn't take you seriously at all.

235
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,630
Really?

236
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,490
Beiyue is just like that.

237
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,070
He's the same way with Father.

238
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,680
Do you think Father likes him?

239
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Well…

240
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,840
Among us princes,

241
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,180
only Jun Beiyue's mother
has the lowest status.

242
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,360
Rather than saying Father likes him,

243
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,670
it's more accurate to say,

244
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,510
that he is using him.

245
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,920
Otherwise, why would he let him

246
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,480
lead troops into battle at 14 years old?

247
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,920
Jun Beiyue has no support in the palace.

248
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,240
It's hard for him to gain status.

249
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,110
Then Father must favor you the most,
Beichen.

250
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,010
I think Father likes you the most.

251
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,390
Me?

252
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:45,910
Forget it.

253
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:48,240
Father often says

254
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,870
I'm like a decorative pillow.

255
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,720
You invited the greatest qin master
of Longyuan Continent

256
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,480
to bring great honor to Tianque.

257
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,190
Father will definitely see you in a new light.

258
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,280
Beichen,

259
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,520
it was you who invited Mr. Lige,

260
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,920
yet you want to give me the credit.

261
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,600
I feel unworthy.

262
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,240
We are brothers after all.

263
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,110
You can try to repay me in the future.

264
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,840
Of course.

265
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,440
Ziqing.

266
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,470
What's the matter?

267
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,360
Do you know horse riding and archery?

268
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,760
No, I don't.

269
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,880
That's perfect.

270
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,720
I've arranged a specialist for you

271
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,990
to teach you horse riding
and archery these days.

272
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,070
You need to practice more.

273
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,990
Why do I need to learn these?

274
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,070
Don't worry about that for now.

275
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,840
I might have to leave the mansion

276
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,720
for a few days.

277
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,330
You need to practice more.

278
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,360
I'll test you when I'm back.

279
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,230
Let's go.

280
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,550
- Hongyi.
- Here.

281
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,910
What do you think of the Second Prince?

282
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,880
The Second Prince?

283
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,720
What's with him?

284
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,960
Nothing.

285
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,800
Just asking.

286
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,270
The Second Prince
is the Queen's only son.

287
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,690
Naturally, he sides with his mother.

288
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,880
He opposes our Fourth Prince's Mansion.

289
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,000
How are his martial arts skills?

290
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,430
His martial arts are okay.

291
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,550
But compared to the Fourth Prince,
he's far behind.

292
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,270
(My nightmare)

293
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,910
(started from that day
at Grandeur Palace.)

294
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,150
(Jun Beichen.)

295
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,640
(I must find an opportunity)

296
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,960
(to avenge Han Ziqing,)

297
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,070
(so my efforts here won't be in vain.)

298
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,270
(But right now)

299
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,550
(I have more important work to do.)

300
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,630
Your Highness.

301
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,480
Your Highness, you're back.

302
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,000
Today, Hongyi taught me to make soup.

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,520
It's delicious. Please try it.

304
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,790
(West Yard)

305
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,630
No need.

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,150
Let's skip the meal for now.

307
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,120
Let's pack up

308
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,640
and head to the training ground.

309
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,080
Yes.

310
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,700
(Yue)

311
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,560
Use some strength, come on.

312
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,870
One.

313
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,990
Two.

314
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,320
Harder.

315
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,390
One.

316
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,680
Good, not bad.

317
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
Two.

318
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,270
Keep going.

319
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,270
Use some strength.

320
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,110
Use some strength.

321
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,240
Use some strength.

322
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,080
One.

323
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,600
Two.

324
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,960
Your Highness, we've arrived.

325
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,360
One.

326
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,840
Next.

327
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,220
Come on, two.

328
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:03,880
- Three.
- Your Highness.

329
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,760
This is our Fourth Prince's horse field.

330
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,190
It's also the base
of his Thirteen Riders.

331
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,070
- Two.
- Look at this.

332
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,190
So grand.

333
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,190
Why is no one here to greet us?

334
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,240
Where is Sima Xun?

335
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,390
I've told him that you're coming today.

336
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,910
Where is your Commander Sima?

337
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,360
I'm asking you a question.

338
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,370
One.

339
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,330
- Use some strength.
- Two.

340
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,120
Well…

341
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,000
Use some strength.

342
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,030
Why is no one

343
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
paying attention to us?

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,840
Sima Xun!

345
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,360
Sima Xun!

346
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,240
One.

347
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,190
- Two.
- This grass is so annoying.

348
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,120
I can't see her anymore.

349
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,420
One.

350
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,930
Two.

351
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,800
Senior Brother.

352
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,880
Under this scorching sun.

353
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,600
- One.
- Do we really have to follow her?

354
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,490
Two.

355
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,790
I'm hot, too.

356
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,150
One.

357
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,000
When do you plan to make a move?

358
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,270
Two.

359
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,680
Soon.

360
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,480
The royal city is heavily guarded.

361
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
- It's hard to escape.
- One.

362
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,270
Look how nice it is in the field.

363
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,190
Two.

364
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,030
If you catch her,

365
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,190
we can escape anytime.

366
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,760
Field? Is it a field?

367
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,030
This is the training ground.

368
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,360
We're in the field now.

369
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,250
If we were inside,
we would have been discovered long ago.

370
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,310
Only we are in the field.

371
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,190
She won't come out.

372
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,360
Anyway, I can catch her.

373
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,630
Let's go.

374
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,320
One.

375
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,030
Two.

376
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,270
Shout it out.

377
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,840
Use your strength.

378
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:56,960
One.

379
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,480
Sima Xun, how dare you!

380
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,240
Where did this girl come from?

381
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,430
Shouting and yelling here.

382
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,760
This is the Princess Consort.

383
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,190
Hurry down and pay your respects.

384
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,880
In my mind,

385
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,390
no one is worthy of His Highness.

386
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,960
Is any random woman

387
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,640
worthy of being called

388
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,390
Fourth Princess Consort?

389
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,360
Sima Xun.

390
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,910
You are getting bolder.

391
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,430
Do you believe I will have you arrested?

392
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,990
Miss Hongyi.

393
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,030
This is the training ground,

394
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
not the mansion.

395
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,910
I have important work to do.

396
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,550
No time to accompany you for a trip.

397
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,960
His Highness ordered you

398
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,390
to teach the Princess Consort
horse riding.

399
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,840
Do you dare to disobey?

400
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,390
You.

401
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Take them to the dorm.

402
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,750
Don't make them get in the way here.

403
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,230
Yes.

404
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,960
Sima Xun, what do you mean?

405
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,190
Didn't His Highness tell me

406
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,440
to teach her horse riding and archery?

407
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,360
I'll send someone to teach her.

408
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,800
Sima Xun!

409
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,110
You horrid man!

410
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,150
You come here!

411
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,990
Come here!

412
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,360
Wait until His Highness returns.

413
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,540
I'll make sure you pay for this.

414
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,600
Use some strength.

415
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,440
Use some strength.

416
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,320
One.

417
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,840
Two.

418
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,310
Your Highness, don't be angry.

419
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,190
When His Highness returns,
I'll definitely tell him.

420
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,720
Don't be angry with them.

421
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,750
Let's go.

422
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,640
Your Highness, we have arrived.

423
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,110
Your Highness.

424
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,960
His Highness comes here s lot.

425
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,880
Sometimes he drinks and chats
with the soldiers.

426
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,550
So the living facilities here
are quite complete.

427
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,720
It's not too much of a hardship
to stay here.

428
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,430
I've sent everyone else away.

429
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,600
You can rest assured.

430
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,070
Your Highness, it's here.

431
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,120
Here?

432
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,480
Yes, we'll stay here tonight.

433
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,390
- Let me do it.
- It's okay.

434
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,870
Put it there.

435
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,030
Your Highness.

436
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,960
Although Sima Xun was rude,

437
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,430
we still need to practice.

438
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,310
Otherwise, it will be hard to explain
when His Highness returns.

439
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,360
I'll send someone back
to the Mansion of Fourth Prince

440
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,190
to invite a skilled instructor

441
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,520
to teach you horse riding and archery.

442
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,270
No need.

443
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,200
Help me prepare some things.

444
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,990
I'm listening, Your Highness.

445
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,390
Do you understand?

446
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,270
Yes.

447
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,360
I'll go prepare them right away.

448
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,200
Go ahead.

449
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,270
Your Highness.

450
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,840
I'll go help too.

451
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,760
Hurry and call them.

452
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,720
They're coming.

453
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,640
They're coming.

454
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,640
- Miss.
- Come out quickly.

455
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,820
- They're coming.
- They're coming.

456
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,720
They're coming.

457
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,880
They're coming.

458
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,240
Here, I brought food for everyone.

459
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,760
- Miss.
- There's enough for everyone.

460
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,900
- Miss.
- There's enough for everyone.

461
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,670
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

462
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,880
Thank you.

463
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,180
How are you? Are you recovering well?

464
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,060
- Thank you.
- Much better.

465
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,600
- We are fine.
- There's enough for you all.

466
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

467
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,070
Do you know

468
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,230
why I come this time?

469
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
To bring us food.

470
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,750
Yes.

471
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,630
No.

472
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,530
To treat our illnesses.

473
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,480
No.

474
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,760
To help us live well.

475
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,000
I came this time not just
to bring you food

476
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,790
to prevent you from starving.

477
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,150
More importantly, to teach you skills,

478
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,070
so you can live better,

479
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,310
and with more dignity.

480
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,120
Are you willing to do that?

481
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,310
Yes.

482
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,720
Alright.

483
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,520
Since you all say yes,

484
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,430
I will hold an exam.

485
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,120
Do you see that mountain?

486
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,480
Yes.

487
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,960
Climb to the mountaintop and return.

488
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,480
Within four hours,

489
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,360
whoever returns on time

490
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,520
will be the winner.

491
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,240
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

492
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,190
Alright, let's go.

493
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,030
Okay.

494
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,440
Run, run!

495
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,640
Quick, quick!

496
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,230
Hurry, hurry!

497
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,430
How many children are there in total?

498
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,360
Your Highness, there are ten.

499
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,570
Are you planning to bring them
into the Mansion of Fourth Prince?

500
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,680
No.

501
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,840
I want to form a corps.

502
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,000
What is a corps?

503
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,190
It is an organized,

504
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,790
and disciplined big family.

505
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,310
They'll trust each other
and work together.

506
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,760
Even if I am not
on this Longyuan Continent,

507
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,760
they can still survive independently.

508
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,600
How long has it been?

509
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,990
Almost there, Your Highness.

510
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,000
The time is almost up.

511
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,840
Here they come, Your Highness.

512
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:16,910
They are coming.

513
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,600
Quick, quick!

514
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,480
You all did very well.

515
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,030
What is your name?

516
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,240
Big Dog.

517
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,910
Big Dog?

518
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,870
Alright.

519
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,000
From now on,

520
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,360
your name is Gu Xi.

521
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,600
Gu Xi.

522
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,840
Thanks for the name.

523
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,670
You are all very brave.

524
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,510
Very good.

525
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,070
I want all of you.

526
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,600
Nice!

527
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,870
Climbing the mountain?

528
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,110
Yes.

529
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
These past two days,

530
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,480
she has either been staying at the dorm,

531
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,150
or gathering a group of little beggars

532
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,000
to climb the mountain.

533
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,480
Her behavior is quite strange.

534
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,360
Keep a close eye on her.

535
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,430
I want to see

536
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,640
what she is up to.

537
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,480
Yes.

538
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,000
Senior Brother,

539
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,270
be careful.

540
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,840
Don't poison yourself.

541
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
Don't worry.

542
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,960
My poison-making skills
are the best in the world.

543
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,310
If I poisoned myself,

544
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,000
I would feel shamed
to stay in the world.

545
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:06,870
Senior Brother.

546
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,910
Senior Brother.

547
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,030
Senior Brother. What's wrong with you?

548
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,630
Antidote.

549
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,430
- Quick, quick.
- Antidote.

550
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,880
The antidote is in the bundle.

551
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,000
The bundle is at the inn.

552
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,670
Senior, Senior.

553
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,480
Senior Brother.

554
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,670
Senior Brother.

555
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,390
Senior Brother!

556
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,230
You are here.

557
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,550
Your Highness.

558
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,360
I heard you've been having
a lot of fun these days.

559
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,510
Your Highness.

560
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,390
Since I came here,

561
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,150
Commander Sima

562
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,600
has only sent a small soldier to me.

563
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,430
He didn't sincerely want to teach me.

564
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,360
Sima Xun.

565
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,440
Your Highness, the Princess Consort is…

566
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,990
With the Princess Consort's foundation,

567
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,880
even if I taught her myself,

568
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,070
she might not be able to keep up.

569
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,840
That's right.

570
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,480
I know I am not talented,

571
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,120
and Commander Sima is very busy,

572
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,070
so I just stay at the dorm.

573
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,800
Your Highness,

574
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,910
is that wrong?

575
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,760
You are so eloquent, aren't you?

576
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,110
Let me ask you.

577
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,790
Have you practiced any horse riding

578
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,480
and archery skills?

579
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,240
In just three days,

580
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,980
what could I possibly learn?

581
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,270
Come here,

582
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,560
bring her a horse.

583
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,190
Your Highness, the Princess Consort
cannot ride a horse.

584
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,270
She will get hurt.

585
00:31:59,150 --> 00:31:59,990
Here.

586
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,600
Your Highness.

587
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,230
Don't worry.

588
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,840
His Highness won't punish her.

589
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:13,900
Don't worry.

590
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,450
The Princess Consort and His Highness
haven't seen each other for a few days.

591
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,990
They are just finding a place
to talk privately.

592
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,880
Some people just look down on others.

593
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,150
Our Princess Consort's skills

594
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,600
are not something
ordinary people can see.

595
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,430
Your horse is really beautiful.

596
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,670
I can tell

597
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,390
that it likes you so much.

598
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,800
Of course.

599
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,790
I am popular and charming.

600
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,960
Everyone who meets me loves me.

601
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,270
Of course the horse likes me.

602
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,150
You're talking nonsense again.

603
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,390
Let's go for two more laps.

604
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,270
Come on.

605
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,150
