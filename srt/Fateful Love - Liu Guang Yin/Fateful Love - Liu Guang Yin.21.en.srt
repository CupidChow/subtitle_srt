00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,460
Ziqing, how are you?

22
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,800
Fourth Princess,

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,960
- here, the blanket.
- Ziqing.

24
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:45,750
Thank you.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,990
Ziqing.

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,070
- Ziqing!
- Think of a way quickly.

27
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,260
What should we do?

28
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,050
Your Majesty, save me!

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,040
Your Highness.

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
Rope.

31
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,750
Be careful.

32
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,790
Hold the rope, Your Highness.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,790
- Ziqing.
- Your Highness.

34
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,220
- Hold the rope.
- Hold on.

35
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,930
- Hold on.
- Be careful.

36
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,070
Be careful.

37
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,630
Be careful.

38
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,550
Your Highness.

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,730
Your Highness, how are you?

40
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,430
Don't touch me.

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,240
- This water is poisonous.
- Move aside, move aside.

42
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
Move aside.

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,780
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

44
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,740
Your Majesty, save me.

45
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,860
Consort Qin, what happened?

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,300
I am about to die.

47
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,500
Your Majesty, quickly get the antidotes.

48
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,860
Is this river water poisonous?

49
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,420
Why did she fall into the water?

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,100
King of Nanzhao,

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,060
you need to give us an explanation.

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,380
Where are the antidotes?

53
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,060
Where are the antidotes?

54
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,740
Your Majesty, the antidotes
are on the carriage.

55
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,940
We didn't bring them on the boat.

56
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,780
Think about it carefully.

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,820
If something happens
to the two consorts,

58
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,990
and you don't have the antidotes,

59
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,660
you will die with them.

60
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,740
Think about it carefully again.

61
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,780
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,280
I remember now.

63
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,060
I specially prepared
an emergency medicine pouch

64
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,940
for Your Majesty.

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,160
There might be some antidotes inside.

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,660
Go!

67
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,580
Once the antidotes arrive,

68
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,820
the poison will be neutralized.

69
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,180
Don't worry.

70
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,860
King of Nanzhao,

71
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,740
I hope

72
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,100
that such disrespectful
and deadly incidents

73
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,620
will not happen again.

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,820
- My apologies.
- Your Majesty,

75
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,800
the antidotes have been found.

76
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,640
That's great.

77
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,740
Come on.

78
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,990
Everyone who touched the Princess
just now,

79
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,340
take one pill each.

80
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,180
Yes.

81
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,100
Come on.

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,940
Consort Qin,

83
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,380
sorry for the trouble.

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,420
I survived a great disaster.

85
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,900
Thank you, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,680
Fortunately, Ziqing was clever

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,060
and pulled Consort Qin into the water.

88
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,300
Only then did the King of Nanzhao
bring out the antidotes.

89
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,140
Otherwise, I don't know

90
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,820
how they would wrap this up.

91
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,580
Beiyue,

92
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,740
this trip to Nanzhao

93
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,220
is fraught with danger.

94
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,380
You all must be extra careful.

95
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,820
Didn't I tell you this earlier?

96
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,300
I don't know if Chu Feiyan

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,220
was involved or not.

98
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,300
Today, when she heard
there were no antidotes,

99
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,380
she almost burst out laughing.

100
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,300
Even if she wasn't involved,

101
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,440
she's still truly detestable.

102
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,420
Now that we are in Nanzhao,

103
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,780
we must be very cautious.

104
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,340
Are you feeling better?

105
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,740
Ziqing,

106
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,580
how are you?

107
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
I'm fine.

108
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,180
Haonan ran over there.

109
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,140
Consort Qin,

110
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,020
today's incident must have been hard
on you.

111
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,420
Seeing you fall into the water

112
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,580
scared me to death.

113
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,620
It was my fault
for not handling things well,

114
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,540
and almost ruining
Your Majesty's important plan.

115
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,260
Although Han Ziqing
didn't show any suspicious signs today,

116
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,380
I still feel something is off.

117
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,780
We should find another chance
to confirm it.

118
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,660
Just in case.

119
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,660
But next time,

120
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,780
we must plan more meticulously

121
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,420
and not let Jun Beiyue

122
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,460
catch any evidence.

123
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,260
Consort Qin,

124
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,380
have you arranged
for tomorrow's guqin competition?

125
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,220
Yes, it's ready.

126
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,980
Your Majesty, you have had a tiring day.

127
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,100
I have just learned a new piece.

128
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,180
Let me play it for you

129
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,820
to calm your nerves.

130
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,740
Consort Meng had the same idea.

131
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,180
She just said she wanted
to play a piece for me.

132
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,500
Isn't that perfect?

133
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:45,780
My dear consort,

134
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
you've been frightened.

135
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,620
You should rest well.

136
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,140
Consort Qin,

137
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,140
you must have been scared today.

138
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Thank you for your concern,
Princess Feiyan.

139
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,540
I'm fine now.

140
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,700
Today, you fell into the water.

141
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,740
I think that woman did it on purpose.

142
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,820
No one wants to fall into
Lingshui River.

143
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,990
Princess Feiyan, you're overthinking it.

144
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,380
That's because you don't know
Han Ziqing.

145
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,340
If we talk about malicious intent,

146
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,900
she's the best.

147
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,980
You and Fourth Princess
have always had a grudge.

148
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,620
Naturally, there is some prejudice.

149
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,420
However, what happened today
was an accident.

150
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,100
Princess Feiyan,
there's no need to dwell on it.

151
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,580
It's late at night.

152
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,980
Hurry back to the cabin and rest.

153
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,740
Was it really an accident?

154
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,300
I don't believe it.

155
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,820
Brother,

156
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,900
stop thinking about her.

157
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,820
Mind your own business.

158
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,180
Mother said,

159
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,860
this time in Nanzhao,

160
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,140
I am in charge of everything.

161
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,700
You don't believe it?

162
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,380
Go ask Mother yourself.

163
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,620
Since when

164
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,100
can you take charge
of Dongling's affairs?

165
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,660
This time, Mother appointed me
to Nanzhao.

166
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,140
You tagged along shamelessly.

167
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,620
You're here for your beloved,
aren't you?

168
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,990
Are you afraid she'll be eaten
by poisonous insects?

169
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,300
I warn you.

170
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,900
As long as I'm alive,

171
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,740
I am still the Crown Prince of Dongling.

172
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,620
I can help you rise to power,

173
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,140
and I can bring you down.

174
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,820
Master,

175
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,420
the competition is about to start.

176
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,300
Are you nervous?

177
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,140
Nervous about what?

178
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,260
I know what I'm doing.

179
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,940
Han Ziqing,

180
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,660
you must attend today's qin gathering.

181
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,100
Whether I attend it or not,

182
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,220
what's it to you?

183
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,140
It's none of my business.

184
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,620
I just wanted to remind you.

185
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,140
It's not going to be easy
to win me this time.

186
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,340
How do you know

187
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,220
you can beat me?

188
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,300
I'll meet you at the gathering.

189
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,020
Master, you must win her
to make her ashamed later.

190
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,860
Such a smug woman.

191
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,900
Today's competition will go

192
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,060
from Fanna

193
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,140
to Shunji,

194
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,300
Princess Xuanyuan,

195
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,180
Princess Feiyan,

196
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,020
Consort Qin,

197
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,140
and Fourth Princess.

198
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,500
How can Fourth Princess be placed last?

199
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,300
Her guqin skills are renowned

200
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,180
throughout Longyuan Continent.

201
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
This order was determined
by drawing lots by the judges.

202
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,060
- I have secretly put you to the last.
- As for who is the first or the last one,

203
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,860
- What is Consort Qin trying to do?
- I think

204
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,860
you all wouldn't mind.

205
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,970
- She just wants to be in the spotlight.
- Your Majesty, I signed up for fun.

206
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,440
- So she wants to be the last one.
- I wouldn't compete for first place.

207
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,780
How about I switch orders
with Fourth Princess?

208
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,180
Fourth Princess,

209
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,660
what do you think?

210
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,780
Consort Qin, you are too modest.

211
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,060
If you want to be the finale,

212
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,620
I'll give you that spot.

213
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,020
No, I'm just here for fun.

214
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,370
I heard that you received the Wuzheng
from Xuanyuan Lige.

215
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,340
Is this true?

216
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,660
Thanks for the appreciation
of Crown Prince Xuanyuan,

217
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,540
I am truly ashamed.

218
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,060
Back then, the competition
between you and Princess Feiyan

219
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,500
shocked Longyuan.

220
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,900
I have also heard of it.

221
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,900
Since Crown Prince Xuanyuan
is here today,

222
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,340
why not let him be the chief judge?

223
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,980
Your Majesty,

224
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,220
although Crown Prince Xuanyuan
is the best guqin master in Longyuan,

225
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,220
today is just a small competition,

226
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,900
so there's no need to trouble him.

227
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,740
Otherwise, we might all be intimidated.

228
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,340
Exactly.

229
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,540
Back then, I was also intimidated

230
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,980
by Crown Prince Xuanyuan

231
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,100
and couldn't perform at my normal level.

232
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,180
You were just not so skilled.

233
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,660
Using that as an excuse

234
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,500
is shameless.

235
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Crown Prince Xuanyuan,

236
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,620
what do you think?

237
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,060
It would be my honor

238
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,620
to judge for everyone,

239
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,060
but unfortunately
I'm not feeling well today

240
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,900
and cannot exert myself.

241
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,180
Please choose someone else.

242
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,180
I see.

243
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,540
Well, it has to be this way then.

244
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,820
Consort Qin.

245
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,260
The competition begins.

246
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,460
The first one is Fanna.

247
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,180
Her guqin skills are quite average.

248
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,420
The second one is Shunji.

249
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,020
This one is also...

250
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,740
The third is Xuanyuan Zhaoxi.

251
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,500
She's Xuanyuan Lige's younger sister.

252
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,260
She plays the guqin quite well.

253
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,500
Although they are siblings,

254
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,860
their guqin skills are worlds apart.

255
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,660
Do you have the confidence to win?

256
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,260
Don't worry about that.

257
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,220
What is

258
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,100
Han Ziqing up to?

259
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,340
Your Majesty, it seems

260
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,740
that no one in Nanzhao can match her.

261
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,100
Thank you for the praise, Consort Qin.

262
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,460
Next

263
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,620
is Princess Feiyan from Xiling.

264
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,100
Such a hypocrite.

265
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,260
Chu Feiyan's guqin playing is not bad.

266
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,620
It's not worse than Xuanyuan Zhaoxi.

267
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,020
Whom are you speaking for?

268
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,900
Do you like her?

269
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,100
Now we're in public.

270
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,300
Can you be more dignified?

271
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,620
How am I not dignified?

272
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,740
You were praising other women.

273
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,820
Can't I scold you?

274
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,860
Why can't I praise other women?

275
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,900
Don't forget. You still have to
go to Tieyan as a prince consort.

276
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,820
Who agreed to go to Tieyan?

277
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,700
This is outrageous.

278
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,580
Next,

279
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,940
the Fourth Princess of Tianque.

280
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,580
Since you have received a guqin
from Lige,

281
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,300
your skills must be extraordinary.

282
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,140
Just now, Princess Feiyan
performed to the utmost.

283
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,780
I wonder what kind of celestial music

284
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,860
you will play to match it.

285
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,780
I am looking forward to it.

286
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,460
What's going on?

287
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,500
I knew it.

288
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,100
Han Ziqing has some petty tricks.

289
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,700
That loud sound just now

290
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,740
was truly deafening

291
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,860
and quite unusual.

292
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,460
Don't misuse the words.

293
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,780
Can petty tricks be used here?

294
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,100
I just think that loud sound

295
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,260
was better than theirs.

296
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,100
So what?

297
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,860
At this moment, it's better
if you don't speak.

298
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,940
What does it have to do with you?

299
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,620
Just wait to lose Han Ziqing.

300
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,420
You should say lose to Han Ziqing.

301
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,420
She's playing like this.

302
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,990
Don't even think about
beating Princess Feiyan.

303
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,780
She is not even as good as anyone here.

304
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,500
Alright.

305
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,660
Apologize for my poor performance.

306
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,980
Next one,

307
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Consort Qin.

308
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,660
I have already told you

309
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,220
I am just here to join the fun today

310
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,380
and haven't prepared anything.

311
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,060
So I have waited until the end

312
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,820
and gotten to hear

313
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,180
so many beautiful pieces,

314
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,020
and learned such exquisite guqin skills.

315
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,060
Both His Majesty and I are very pleased.

316
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,660
Let's not waste everyone's time.

317
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,820
Tribal leaders,

318
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
please announce the result.

319
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,740
Clearly, she knows she can't beat
Chu Feiyan,

320
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,940
and doesn't want to embarrass herself.

321
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
In this guqin skills competition,

322
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,740
Princess Feiyan stands out as the best

323
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,420
and deserves the first place.

324
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,620
Princess Feiyan,

325
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,140
your guqin skills are truly outstanding.

326
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,100
I did not expect this at all.

327
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,180
I wonder if I have the honor

328
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,980
to invite you to Langya Lake

329
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,500
to lead the music of the Ceremony.

330
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,100
The music of the Ceremony

331
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,340
has always been led

332
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,660
by Consort Qin alone.

333
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,540
Your Majesty,

334
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,700
Princess Feiyan's guqin skills

335
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,980
are far superior to mine.

336
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,260
I am willing to step aside.

337
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,740
Princess Feiyan,

338
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,420
what do you think?

339
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,300
This is an honor for Xiling.

340
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,900
I will do my best.

341
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,380
Good.

342
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,260
It's a long journey
to get across Lingshui River.

343
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,220
I thought it would be tedious.

344
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,580
But I didn't expect Princess Feiyan
to be so talented.

345
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,340
So I won't be bored along the way.

346
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,260
Consort Qin,

347
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,220
why not invite Princess Feiyan

348
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,980
to join us in our cabin,

349
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,860
so we can have guqin music
as our companion along the way?

350
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,740
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

351
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

352
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,140
The competition is now over.

353
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,660
You may dismiss.

354
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,260
Alright.

355
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,340
Let's go.

356
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,500
What's going on with them?

357
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,740
You mean what's wrong with them?

358
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,300
Well, the young couple...

359
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,120
Let's not worry about others now.

360
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,060
You said you wouldn't go to Tieyan
to become a prince consort.

361
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Say that again if you dare.

362
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
- I just won't go.
- Situ Haonan!

363
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,920
- I will never go.
- You're running away again.

364
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,420
Explain yourself clearly.

365
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,820
It pissed me off.

366
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,100
That old and disgusting man

367
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,420
was trying to date me.

368
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,260
It pissed me off.

369
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,700
It pissed me off.

370
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,340
Princess Feiyan,

371
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,020
Consort Qin invites you to the main ship

372
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
to play chess with His Majesty.

373
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,500
Tell them I'm not feeling well.

374
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,860
Consort Qin said

375
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,220
since His Majesty is in a good mood,

376
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,420
please make sure to attend.

377
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,940
Am I their maid?

378
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,780
I won't go.

379
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,180
You have quite the attitude.

380
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,100
How dare you
to refuse His Majesty's invitation.

381
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,540
Consort Qin.

382
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,100
I am an unmarried girl.

383
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,420
His Majesty summoned me to play chess.

384
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
Isn't it inappropriate?

385
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,020
To avoid any gossip,

386
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,540
please refuse him on my behalf.

387
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,740
He has taken a liking to you.

388
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,460
Princess Feiyan,
you shouldn't have shown off

389
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,340
at the qin gathering.

390
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,220
You knew His Majesty was obsessed
with the guqin.

391
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,460
Why drew his attention?

392
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,220
I was focused on winning at that time.

393
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,540
How could I think of so much?

394
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,420
Besides, that Han Ziqing...

395
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,700
I understand now.

396
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,220
She did it on purpose.

397
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,300
I was wondering at the time.

398
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,580
How could Han Ziqing's guqin skills

399
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,660
fluctuate so much?

400
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,540
That wretched woman.

401
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,660
She set me up.

402
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,180
It's no use blaming anyone now.

403
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,100
Since His Majesty likes you so much,

404
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,420
I can't stop him.

405
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,340
After all, I can't be labeled as jealous.

406
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,500
Please come with me, Princess Feiyan.

407
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,940
Ziqing,

408
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,500
that move was ruthless.

409
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,580
They are mutually in love.

410
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,660
What does it have to do with me?

411
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,820
Besides,

412
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,340
Chu Feiyan loves to show off.

413
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,900
It is her own fault
that she has drawn the king's attention.

414
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,620
She deserves it.

415
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,300
You deliberately underperformed
at the qin gathering

416
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,260
to make her guqin skills seem superior.

417
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,660
And the King of Nanzhao loves
to join the art.

418
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
So he set his sights
on this Prairie Rose.

419
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,780
She won the competition
but lost the latter half of her life.

420
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,220
Her arrogant and domineering personality

421
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,860
should be controlled

422
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,260
by the King of Nanzhao.

423
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,980
You just don't want her clinging to you.

424
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,860
I don't fear her clinging to me,

425
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,540
but I worry she is pestering Ziqing

426
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,860
and setting traps for her everywhere.

427
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,100
What should we do then?

428
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,420
You two...

429
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,260
Langya Lake has arrived.

430
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,700
Envoys, please prepare to disembark

431
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,990
and take part in the ceremonial ritual.

432
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,420
In the pure water,

433
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,500
there is no distinction of status,

434
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,140
and age.

435
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,140
I hope you all

436
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,260
can use the pure water in your hands

437
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,860
to cleanse the person beside you

438
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,180
to wash away the dirt

439
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,260
and the sins.

440
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,780
Distinguished guests,

441
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,900
today we are all gathered together.

442
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,140
After the banquet ends,

443
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,940
please stay for a few more days.

444
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,260
Because His Majesty is happy,

445
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,900
he has decided to open
the hunting ground in Beast Tribe

446
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,700
for everyone to have fun.

447
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,100
You can form teams freely,

448
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,440
and showcase your prowess
in the hunting ground.

449
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,700
I hope you'll have a great time.

450
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,100
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

451
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,220
Why did you splash me?

452
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,420
Why can't I splash you?

453
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,300
I just want to splash you.

454
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,980
Do you know?

455
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,900
In Nanzhao, splashing me
means you like me.

456
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,300
I don't like you. Don't splash me.

457
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,340
Splashing you is a favor to you.

458
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,740
A favor, huh? Fine.

459
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,140
I'll show you

460
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,120

Why wipe?

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,340
Why wipe?

I'm so angry!

Princess, this is Nanzhao.

504
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,100
Princess, please...

505
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,340
I've already gotten myself into trouble.

506
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,340
A big trouble.

507
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,580
Why think so much?

508
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,300
If that old man dares
to take advantage of me,

I'll die in front of him.

510
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,660
Consort Qin is here.

511
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,500
Who made you so angry, Princess Feiyan?

512
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,540
Such a big temper.

513
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,460
Why still ask, Consort Qin?

514
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,660
I don't understand what you mean.

515
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,980
I'm here to deliver
His Majesty's decree.

516
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,740
The moonlight is beautiful tonight.

517
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,340
His Majesty wants to invite you
to enjoy the moon together.

518
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,860
I'm not feeling well.

519
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,700
Maybe another day.

520
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,500
His Majesty rarely has such interest.

521
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,180
Princess Feiyan, it's better
not to disappoint him.

522
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,820
Otherwise, it might cause a dispute
between the two countries.

523
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,540
That would be a great loss.

524
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,460
So you had planned all along

525
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,220
to use me to win His Majesty's favor.

526
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,660
Princess Feiyan,
your words are truly inappropriate.

527
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,020
His Majesty likes you,

528
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,260
and you earn it yourself.

529
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,340
What does it have to do with me?

530
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,740
If you are unwilling to accompany him
to admire the moon,

531
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,340
I will report it as it is.

532
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,020
Wait.

533
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,580
I never said I wouldn't go.

534
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,260
If it affects the diplomatic relation
between the two countries,

535
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,550
it would be your fault
for delivering the message improperly.

536
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,820
Where have you been?

537
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,180
I've been waiting for you to come back.

538
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,220
Can't you stop pestering me?

539
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,460
Don't you know
that after returning from Nanzhao,

540
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,220
my father is going to send me
to marry for alliance?

541
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,300
Marry for alliance?

542
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,460
Tieyan has been in constant turmoil
for years,

543
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,700
so its national strength is weak.

544
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,660
It may be annexed
by neighboring countries anytime.

545
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,060
I have to marry for an alliance

546
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,740
and leverage that country's power

547
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,100
to ensure the safety of my homeland.

548
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,060
So

549
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,860
are you willing to do that?

550
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,820
Of course not.

551
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,020
Unless you can marry me.

552
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,860
Nonsense.

553
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,020
The Situ City does not have the power

554
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
to ensure the safety of Tieyan.

555
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,380
This is the only thing
my mother left me.

556
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,060
Keep it.

557
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,060
Your mother left it to you.

558
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,420
You should keep it yourself.

559
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,340
This is my last memento for you.

560
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,700
Can you bear to refuse it?

561
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,180
Qianqian,

562
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,420
your marriage concerns
the people and the country.

563
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,460
You cannot act recklessly.

564
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,140
Even if it's me.

565
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,380
I dare not.

566
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,500
Coward.

567
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,900
When we return to the Royal City,

568
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,780
how about I personally escort you
to the border of Tieyan?

569
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,340
Who needs your escort
and insincere kindness?

570
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,420
You encouraged me to go hunting

571
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,220
to divert others' attention,

572
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,060
didn't you?

573
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,300
Smart girl.

574
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,980
I will set off tonight.

575
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,100
I have a task for you.

576
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,020
You help me cover.

577
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,420
You need to make everyone think

578
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,180
that I have always been here.

579
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,740
Covering for you?

580
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,580
No problem.

581
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,620
Tomorrow, I'll tell everyone
that you're sick.

582
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,700
Then I'll have Shadow guard the door.

583
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,890
No one will be allowed to enter.

584
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,460
How about that?

585
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,260
Very good.

586
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,780
But you must be careful.

587
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,740
Are you worried about me?

588
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,780
This is Nanzhao.

589
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,820
And you don't have any guards with you.

590
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,900
Of course I'm worried about you.

591
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,620
I just love seeing you worry about me.

592
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,060
So cheesy.

593
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,940
(No way.)

594
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,780
(I can't fall for him.)

595
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,220
(I still have to leave eventually.)

596
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,780
This time, there can't be any mistakes.

597
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,940
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

598
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,620
I have already set up the traps
in Miasma Valley.

599
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,540
If we can confirm Han Ziqing's identity
this time,

600
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,860
and eliminate the concern,

601
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,820
then I

602
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,980
can finally get some good sleep.

603
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,380
In Miasma Valley,

604
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,260
poisonous gas is released every day
at 3 to 5 p.m.

605
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,860
It won't dissipate
for less than four hours.

606
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,780
Within the hours,

607
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,380
we'll lure Han Ziqing into the valley,

608
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,980
and we'll know

609
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,460
whether she is immune
to all poisons or not.

610
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,580
Has the letter to Xiling been sent?

611
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,900
It was sent out long ago.

612
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,400
If Xiling is smart,

613
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,900
they won't refuse
Your Majesty's proposal

614
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,460
for marrying Princess Feiyan.

615
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,700
But it can't be delayed.

616
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,060
I'm afraid Xiling won't want

617
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,260
to part with their Princess Feiyan.

618
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,260
Your Majesty, rest assured.

619
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,540
The battle where Xiling was attacked
by Tianque and Dongling

620
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,090
has greatly weakened
their national strength.

621
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,100
They can't withstand
any more turmoil now.

622
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,380
How could they put their country at risk

623
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,700
for the sake of a princess?

624
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,100
Your Majesty,
just wait for the good news.

625
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,860
Look at your skin.

626
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,340
It's so smooth.

627
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,620
Chu Feiyan can't compare to you.

628
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,060
But

629
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,860
I just like her spirit.

630
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,460
As long as Your Majesty is happy,

631
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,900
I would even sacrifice my life.

632
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,980
Moreover, it's just accepting
a younger consort.

633
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,480
Let's go.

634
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,860
You look so good even in riding attire.

635
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,700
How can other women live up to that?

636
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,660
Watch your words or you'll get scolded.

637
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,860
Situ Haonan.

638
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,620
What?

639
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,620
Am I not good-looking?

640
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,460
Yes, you are.

641
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,420
You are even more beautiful

642
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,380
than the Queen Mother of the West.

643
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,220
Let's go.

644
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,380
Ziqing, let's compete later.

645
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,220
Let's see who hunts more.

646
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,100
Where's your bow and arrow?

647
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,980
I will not hunt.
I'm just going to play around.

648
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,820
Fourth Princess,

649
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,180
why are you alone?

650
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,580
Why isn't Fourth Prince with you?

651
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,180
Beiyue caught a cold
and is not feeling well.

652
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
So he didn't come.

653
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,500
It's said that his martial arts
are unparalleled.

654
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,260
I didn't expect his body to be so weak.

655
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,780
It's just a cold.

656
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,660
Yet he didn't attend
such a grand hunting feast.

657
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,180
He doesn't like hunting anyway.

658
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,060
If you want to compete with him,

659
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:24,900
maybe next time.

660
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,060
Princess Zhaoxi,

661
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,700
why didn't your brother attend?

662
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,660
My brother is weak.

663
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,740
And he's not good at hunting.

664
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,780
So he didn't come.

665
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,740
Exactly.

666
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,020
Your brother didn't come, either.

667
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,220
Why are you always focusing on others?

668
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,740
Stop arguing. Let's go quickly.

669
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,180
If we delay any longer,
the sun will set.

670
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,900
Weisheng,

671
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,860
where are you going?

672
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,380
Master, I was looking for you.

673
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,740
You've been staring at those people.

674
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,300
How is that looking for me?

675
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,180
Master, where are you going?

676
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,420
I heard that in Miasma Valley,

677
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,620
there's the Deer Ear Grass
I've been searching for.

678
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,820
I was planning to go check it out.

679
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,340
Then I must accompany you.

680
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,620
You wouldn't be using the excuse

681
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,300
of finding herbs with me

682
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,500
to sneak away again, would you?

683
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,900
What are you saying?

684
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,940
Am I that kind of person?

685
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,540
I'll protect you in Miasma Valley.

686
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,100
Let's go, Master.

687
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,420
Distinguished guests,

688
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,940
according to the rules of Beast Tribe,

689
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,500
when hunting,

690
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,540
you must ensure that the prey

691
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,580
is hunted but not harmed,

692
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,260
and is harmed but not killed.

693
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,220
Please follow the rules

694
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,940
and do not break them.

695
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,260
Alright.

696
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,140
Everyone, stay safe.

697
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,340
Go.

698
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,460
Qianqian, slow down.

699
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,860
Hurry up.

700
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,180
Are the little things ready?

701
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,400
They have been ready for a long time.

702
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,860
Can you ensure
they listen to your orders?

703
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,140
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

704
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,900
Making animals run towards
a predetermined target

705
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,780
is the most basic skill
of the Beast Taming Technique.

706
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,060
It's absolutely foolproof.

707
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,980
That's good.

708
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:32,980
Prepare for action.

709
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,820
Yes.

710
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,220
Beast Taming Technique?

711
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,260
What are they using this thing for?

712
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,100
Qianqian, slow down.

713
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,420
There are many wild animals here.

714
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,260
Be careful.

715
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,700
Quickly.

716
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,340
Hurry up.

717
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm about to catch it.

718
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,540
There's something wrong
with that rabbit.

719
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,460
Keep an eye on Qianqian.

720
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,140
Stop right there.

721
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,900
Qianqian.

722
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,140
Qianqian.

723
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,020
Qianqian!

724
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,740
Help!

725
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,380
Don't come over.

726
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,060
Don't come over.

727
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,700
- Qianqian.
- Help!

728
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,540
Qianqian.

729
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,500
Situ Haonan!

730
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,660
- Qianqian, are you alright?
- Qianqian.

731
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,300
You take Qianqian and leave first.

732
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,780
What about you?

733
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,740
I'll deal with them.

734
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,060
Go quickly.

735
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,860
Protect yourself.

736
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,700
Go.

737
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,580
Ziqing, be careful.

738
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:34,400
