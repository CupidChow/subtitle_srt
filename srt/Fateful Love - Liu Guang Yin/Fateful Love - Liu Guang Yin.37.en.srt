21
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,420
(Sheng Manor)

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,480
Your Highness,

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,630
two urgent military reports.

24
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
What's going on?

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,870
There is a civil strife in Tieyan.
The Eighth Prince has rebelled.

26
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,400
The Eighth Prince has rebelled?

27
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,510
How could this be possible?

28
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,870
After Qianqian and Haonan got married,

29
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,000
they have been
in charge of Tieyan's affairs.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,550
How could the Eighth Prince
have any opportunity?

31
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,360
Now Tieyan is also at war with Xiling.

32
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,440
This can't be a coincidence.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,160
It must be premeditated.

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,160
Will Qianqian and Haonan be in danger?

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,600
We have to go back
to Tianque immediately.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,000
- Then we can make further plans.
- Alright.

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,000
Xiaosheng,

38
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,720
you must listen to your mother,

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,800
and focus on your recuperation.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,390
You must come back to see me.

41
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,230
Don't worry.

42
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,300
Do I have to promise you
for you to believe me?

43
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,140
Yes.

44
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,030
I told you I would come back.

45
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,000
Xiaosheng, you should
focus on your recuperation first.

46
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,750
Once we finish our business,

47
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,000
Weisheng will come back to see you.

48
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,830
You must not deceive me.

49
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,000
When have I ever deceived you?

50
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,030
Chief,

51
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,030
we have to leave first.

52
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,770
Your Highness, be careful.

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,630
- Alright.
- Take care.

54
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,080
- Take care.
- You too.

55
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,920
Be careful.

56
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,630
- Please.
- Let's go.

57
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,390
Bye.

58
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,390
Bye.

59
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,110
Bye.

60
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,110
Your Highness.

61
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,540
(Xiling Army Encampment)

62
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,500
Your Highness, bad news.

63
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,700
The Tieyan army is counterattacking.

64
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,800
Our army is struggling to resist.

65
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,030
We have now retreated
from Tieyan's border.

66
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,310
You are useless.

67
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,110
Tieyan is dealing with its civil strife.

68
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,350
How could they possibly have the chance
to counterattack our forces?

69
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,470
Your Highness,

70
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,160
it is the Snow Region.

71
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,390
Snow Region?

72
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,520
Tieyan's attacking is extremely fierce.

73
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,270
When our troops retreated,

74
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,500
they were intercepted by Snow Region,

75
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,400
resulting in heavy casualties.

76
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,720
Could it be...

77
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Your Highness,

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,600
the Tieyan army has already
reached the encampment.

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,190
What about our defensive line?

80
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,030
It didn't hold.

81
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,160
Tieyan is attacking at the front.

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,830
Snow Region is flanking from the rear.

83
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,080
They have already entered the city.

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
You are so useless.

85
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,980
(Xiling)

86
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,190
How

87
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,760
did you get in here?

88
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,510
Your people let us in.

89
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,200
Our army is fighting against Tieyan.

90
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,200
What does it have to do
with your Snow Region?

91
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,600
You were bullying the weak.

92
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,790
Our tribe can't stand by to watch it,

93
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,270
so we lend a helping hand.

94
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,110
What?

95
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,560
Can't we?

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,920
Chu Tiange,

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
if you know what's good for you,

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,110
you should end your life
to atone for your sins,

99
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,480
so as not to sully tour sharp blades.

100
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,350
Except for Chu Tiange,

101
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,320
our army accepts the surrender
of all Xiling soldiers.

102
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,040
I will count to three.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,200
If anyone does not surrender,

104
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,790
they will be treated the same
as Chu Tiange

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,230
and face the same punishment.

106
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,720
Well...

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,550
Let's go.

108
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,000
Go.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
- Hurry up.
- Go.

110
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880
What are you doing?

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,600
Let's go.

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,600
Look at you all.

113
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,600
I have treated you well.

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,480
Is this how you treat me now?

115
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,200
You have always been
arrogant and conceited.

116
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,920
You have never shown us any respect.

117
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,670
It serves you right

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
with such a situation.

119
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,950
What are you talking about?

120
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,760
If you're smart enough,

121
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,800
you'd better take your own life.

122
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,670
At least it would leave us a way out.

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,230
Yes. Your Highness,

124
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,160
you should take your own life.

125
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,600
- Yes.
- Please take your own life.

126
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,300
- Please take your own life.
- Please take your own life.

127
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:07,790
That's right.

128
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,390
You should just take your own life.

129
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,300
You should end it yourself.

130
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,950
Your Highness,

131
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,720
if you don't die,

132
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
we will have to die.

133
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:30,950
Sorry about that.

134
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,860
Good.

135
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,720
Good!

136
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,420
(Linze Gate)

137
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,380
(Linze Gate)

138
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,270
Xuanyuan Lige,

139
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
today

140
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,640
even if Xiling perishes with this city,

141
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,110
I will never let you set foot in Xiling.

142
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,950
Ms. Qin,

143
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,550
do you want to go in and take a look?

144
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,040
Just like you, Your Highness,

145
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,040
I've been dreaming of going back
to our old capital.

146
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,810
Your Highness,

147
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,790
we're not going in,

148
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:39,640
but going home.

149
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,760
Alright.

150
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,110
Let's go home.

151
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,230
Archers, get ready.

152
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,780
(Linze Gate)
Release the arrows.

153
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,040
(I finally did it.)

154
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,000
Beiyue, you are finally back.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
Something happened in Tieyan.

156
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,480
I have already heard about it.

157
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,840
Madam, this way, please.

158
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,000
Is there any detailed information?

159
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,640
The battle of Tieyan and Xiling

160
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,670
is indeed peculiar.

161
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,520
Snow Region, the small tribal nation,

162
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,550
has intervened in it unexpectedly

163
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,840
and defeated the Xiling army.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
More strangely, Dongling

165
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,590
has occupied the Xiling Royal City.

166
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,320
I find this truly unbelievable.

167
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,550
Our army was stationed
in the Sanjie Region,

168
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,710
but they didn't notice any news.

169
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,150
Which route were they taking

170
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,640
to directly get to the Xiling Royal City?

171
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,350
Wherever they took the path from,

172
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,400
we would have noticed it,

173
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,030
unless they have wings

174
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,710
to fly over Wuxie Gorge.

175
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,080
Wuxie Gorge?

176
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,470
That was the only passable place.

177
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,870
This is impossible.

178
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,520
We have been to Wuxie Gorge.

179
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,190
It is extremely difficult

180
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,080
for one person to pass through it,

181
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,520
let alone an army of thousands.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,300
No matter how he managed
to get through,

183
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,510
but now

184
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
they have occupied Xiling,

185
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,550
which poses a threat to our Tianque.

186
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,230
We need to come up with a plan.

187
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,070
Uncle, don't panic.

188
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,710
I will gather the generals immediately

189
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,670
to discuss this matter.

190
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,570
I will go with you.

191
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,410
Alright.

192
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,550
Ziqing,

193
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,550
you've had a long journey.

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,280
Relax yourself

195
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
and have a good rest.

196
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,470
But I'm still worried about them.

197
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,760
Why didn't we get any news

198
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
about Tieyan's battle?

199
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,950
Don't worry.

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,150
As soon as I have news about them,

201
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,320
I will inform you immediately.

202
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,680
Don't worry.

203
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,510
Uncle,

204
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,750
let's go.

205
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,070
Your Highness,

206
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,790
Princess Qianqian has arrived.

207
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,390
Let's go.

208
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,510
Qianqian.

209
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,920
Qianqian.

210
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,510
Ziqing.

211
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,640
Qianqian, what's wrong with you?

212
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,350
What happened?

213
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,350
Haonan…

214
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,110
Haonan has died.

215
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,470
What happened?

216
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:07,630
Haonan.

217
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,430
Haonan.

218
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,120
Haonan.

219
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,720
- Qianqian.
- Haonan.

220
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,320
- Qianqian.
- Haonan.

221
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,800
You horrid woman.

222
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,520
Chu Tiange, what do you want?

223
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,910
You never expected that one day

224
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,550
you would become my prisoners,
did you?

225
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,840
Princess Qianqian,

226
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,520
look at your husband,

227
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,200
the supreme commander of Tieyan.

228
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,150
Now

229
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,760
he is so imposing.

230
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,650
- Bah.
- Chu Tiange.

231
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,350
If you have the guts, let me go

232
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,230
and let's have a duel.

233
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,030
You're

234
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,670
still showing off, huh?

235
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,640
Let me ask you.

236
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,000
When you forced me
to break off the engagement,

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,590
have you ever thought about today?

238
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,320
Chu Tiange,

239
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,520
you don't dare to compete with us
on the battlefield,

240
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,230
yet you resort to
such insidious tactics.

241
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,600
You are simply despicable and shameless.

242
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Princess Qianqian.

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
Chu Tiange, what are you doing?

244
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,880
Don't touch her!

245
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,280
Chu Tiange!

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,880
You horrid woman.

247
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,030
Chu Tiange, you...

248
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,710
Do you think you're so great?

249
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,760
I'm telling you,

250
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
I will not let you die.

251
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,110
I will make you watch

252
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,760
how your loved one dies.

253
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,280
What are you going to do?

254
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,670
No!

255
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,270
No.

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,680
No.

257
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,470
Mr. Lige,

258
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,880
you should show yourself.

259
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,110
Xuanyuan Lige, you...

260
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,760
You are all in this together.

261
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,120
That's right.

262
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,150
This civil strife in Tieyan

263
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,710
is the handiwork of Mr. Lige.

264
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,840
This battle

265
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,520
is also the result of the cooperation
between Dongling and Xiling.

266
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,910
Xuanyuan Lige,

267
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,080
we are friends, aren't we?

268
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,280
I have

269
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,080
never had friends.

270
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,920
Fine.

271
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,520
We mistook you, you scoundrel.

272
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,760
Kill me or torture me,

273
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,280
as you wish.

274
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,670
Look at him.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,910
Of course, I will kill you.

276
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,440
And this horrid woman will know

277
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,790
what a consequence it is

278
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,440
after she brought disgrace upon me.

279
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,280
No.

280
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,600
No.

281
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Mr. Lige,

282
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,720
how about

283
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,480
you do it?

284
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,710
So that I can believe

285
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,760
your sincerity in cooperating with me.

286
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,310
Xuanyuan Lige.

287
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,550
Xuanyuan Lige,

288
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,520
even if you don't take us friends,

289
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,840
what about Ziqing?

290
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,910
If you kill Haonan,

291
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,230
how will you face Ziqing in the future?

292
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,400
If Haonan dies,

293
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,030
Ziqing will be very sad.

294
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,870
Will she be sad?

295
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,520
If she is sad,

296
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,710
Jun Beiyue will be there to comfort her.

297
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,030
Well said.

298
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,520
There are only interests among countries,

299
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,590
but not friends.

300
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,150
Just like that Mr. Xuanyuan and I
were sworn enemies,

301
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,550
but with Jun Beiyue as our common enemy,

302
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,230
we can still cooperate.

303
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,310
Rest assured.

304
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,790
This time you have helped me
attack Tieyan.

305
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,790
I guarantee not to advance eastward
for the next five years.

306
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,110
Dongling and Xiling

307
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,280
will be in eternal peace.

308
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,440
Dongling is weak in national strength.

309
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,470
I hope you can show mercy.

310
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,680
Please go ahead.

311
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,880
Xuanyuan Lige,

312
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,230
I'm begging you. No.

313
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,280
- Qianqian, don't beg him.
- Come on.

314
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:06,950
Watch him!

315
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,190
No, Xuanyuan Lige!

316
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,950
No!

317
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,350
Please!

318
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,310
Isn't it just a life?

319
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,950
- Take it.
- No!

320
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,070
Haonan.

321
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,710
Haonan.

322
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,160
Good job.

323
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,000
Haonan.

324
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
Haonan.

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,840
Haonan.

326
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,550
Haonan.

327
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,520
Haonan.

328
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,920
Why did he kill Haonan?

329
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,070
How could he be so heartless?

330
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,520
Because he wanted
to gain Chu Tiange's trust

331
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,800
to delay Xiling's withdrawal

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,760
and increase Tieyan's hatred

333
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,470
to gain more time for attacking Xiling.

334
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,280
This person is truly insidious.

335
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,950
Qianqian, tell me,

336
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,950
how did you manage to escape?

337
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,110
Xuanyuan Lige asked Chu Tiange
to release me.

338
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,470
He told Chu Tiange,

339
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,590
if he truly wanted revenge,

340
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,880
he should make me live

341
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,230
to feel the pain

342
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,800
of losing a loved one in every second.

343
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,430
Ziqing,

344
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,520
Xuanyuan Lige is a monster.

345
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,150
Calm down first.

346
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,790
What happened next?

347
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,430
Then I fainted.

348
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,160
When I woke up,

349
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,640
I have already been sent back
to the Tieyan border.

350
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,280
In the Royal City, the Eighth Prince
has ascended the throne.

351
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,470
Father has been imprisoned.

352
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,830
But why would Snow Region help you?

353
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,310
I don't know.

354
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,040
But later I heard

355
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,310
Xuanyuan Lige
has occupied the Xiling Royal City.

356
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,000
All of this must be his plan.

357
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,030
Qianqian,

358
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,640
don't be sad.

359
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,350
When we find out the truth,

360
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
I will avenge Haonan.

361
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,000
No, I don't believe it.

362
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,560
Xuanyuan Lige
is not that kind of person.

363
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,950
- I don't believe it.
- You shut up.

364
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,000
I saw this with my own eyes.

365
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,400
Xuanyuan Lige, why did you do this?

366
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,840
Why?

367
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,470
I have to ask you in person.

368
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,230
Stop! Who are you?

369
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,830
I am friends with your master.

370
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,670
It's alright.

371
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:13,790
How did you get in?

372
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,110
It's not your fault

373
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,920
that the guards here are lax.

374
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,230
After all, you just occupied the city.

375
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,560
It must be hectic.

376
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,470
It's not your fault
that the guards are lax.

377
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,350
Why are you staring at me?

378
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,950
After all, we are friends.

379
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,470
It's fine if you don't
offer me a cup of tea.

380
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,310
Why are you staring at me?

381
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,830
What do you want to do?

382
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,310
Make a deal with you.

383
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,110
Give you this Xuezheng.

384
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,560
Tell me the truth.

385
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,230
Was it really you who killed Haonan?

386
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,070
Why?

387
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,350
Didn't I ask you to give it to Ziqing?

388
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,560
She asked me to bring it back to you.

389
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,550
Well...

390
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,400
Ziqing told me to ask you.

391
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:03,910
About what?

392
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,800
Were you the instigator of the battle
between Tieyan and Xiling?

393
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,640
Yes.

394
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,280
What about Situ Haonan?

395
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,830
I did all this.

396
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,950
What else do you want to know?

397
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,950
Have you ever thought about...

398
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,040
I haven't thought about anyone.

399
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,280
I only consider myself

400
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,280
and the restoration of Dongling.

401
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,600
Xuanyuan Lige,

402
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,070
Jun Beiyue

403
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,650
won't let it go easily

404
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,800
and will deploy troops against you.

405
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,600
I have always

406
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,800
been waiting for his troops.

407
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,430
Xuanyuan Lige,

408
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:46,000
is the restoration of Dongling
that important?

409
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,070
Is it even more important
than lives and friendship?

410
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,800
Do you know that I am worried about you?

411
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:50,790
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,880
Please go back and tell Jun Beiyue.

413
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,070
I am waiting for him here.

414
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,760
Xiaomeng,

415
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,160
send Mr. Baili out.

416
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,520
Yes.

417
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,350
Sir, please.

418
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,190
Take the guqin away.

419
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,640
Ziqing would never want it.

420
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll go by myself.

421
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,470
When did he become like this?

422
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,710
Was he bewitched?

423
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,310
Your Highness.

424
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,070
Your Highness,

425
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,760
Han Ziqing and others
request an audience.

426
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,950
She said if you refuse to meet,

427
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,400
they'll blow the city gate open.

428
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,350
Finally, they came.

429
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,670
Let them in.

430
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,150
Yes.

431
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,190
Xuanyuan Lige, I will kill you.

432
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,230
Ziqing, help me kill him.

433
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,000
Lige,

434
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,590
is there some misunderstanding
about Haonan's matter?

435
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,040
As long as you say it,
I will believe you.

436
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,920
Do you have any difficulty?

437
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,560
We can solve it together.

438
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,350
Why did you kill Haonan?

439
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,520
I saw it with my own eyes.

440
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,250
Why are you still listening to
his explanations?

441
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,160
I never regret

442
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,800
to what I have done.

443
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:13,310
I only regret that it was done too late.

444
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,000
My great cause of national restoration

445
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,880
has been delayed for too long.

446
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,560
Now I have finally completed it.

447
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,680
Shouldn't you congratulate me?

448
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,710
How would you become like this?

449
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,400
I have always been like this.

450
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,240
You...

451
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,230
I will ask you one last time.

452
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,000
You killed Haonan.

453
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,160
Is there another hidden truth?

454
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,710
Have you found

455
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,710
all the music scores of Lishang?

456
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,800
It's none of your business.

457
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,640
♪The emptiness left in me♪

458
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,910
♪Light and shadow intertwine,
no time to escape♪

459
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,000
Nothing is hidden.

460
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,710
Tell me the truth!

461
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,880
I am the one who killed him.

462
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,190
Well said!

463
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,160
I've been waiting for you to say that.

464
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,910
Han Ziqing,

465
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,800
I taught you the Sound Strike.

466
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,470
Is this how you repay me?

467
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,500
I won't stop you
from restoring your country.

468
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,400
But you hurt my friend.

469
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,760
So don't blame me.

470
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,310
It's a Barrier.

471
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,910
Qianqian.

472
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,030
Who is it?

473
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,480
Come out.

474
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,430
Mother.

475
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,830
Beiyue, my son.

476
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,310
It's been a long time.

477
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,880
Aren't you supposed
to be on Dream Island?

478
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,710
How did you end up here?

479
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,920
You have teamed up with the outsiders
to bully your mother.

480
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,350
How can you still ask me what I'm doing?

481
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,520
What are you trying to do?

482
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,360
You bratty girl!

483
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,310
You will soon find out

484
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,710
what the consequence

485
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,950
of taking my son away from me

486
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,800
and making him go against me will be.

487
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,120
Let him go.

488
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,280
What are you going to do?

489
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,710
Put Xuanyuan Lige down.

490
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,520
Stop arguing, all of you.

491
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,800
A Barrier has already been set up here.

492
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,360
We need to wait a little longer.

493
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,680
What are you going to do?

494
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,800
How did your mother escape?

495
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,310
Would Grandfather be in trouble?

496
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,880
Let's go.

497
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,520
We'll figure out a way later.

498
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,360
Ziqing,

499
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,920
I still need to make a trip
to Dream Island.

500
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,430
I'm so worrying about Grandfather.

501
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,760
Don't worry. Go ahead.

502
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,070
I will be in Tianque.

503
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,470
I will also send someone
to look for Lige.

504
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,950
Shadow, let's go.

505
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,000
Yes.

506
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,040
Your Highness, all have been arranged.

507
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,550
Good.

508
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:15,770
Everyone, look.

509
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,040
If we go from here

510
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,600
and come over here...

511
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:20,820
(Meng Mansion)

512
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,150
Why would you pass away suddenly,
Father?

513
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,030
Brother.

514
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,510
Beiyue,

515
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,000
you're here.

516
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,800
Your grandfather passed away suddenly.

517
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,280
What happened?

518
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,030
He

519
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,280
liked to take a walk
in the back mountain after dinner.

520
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,120
The doctor has checked on him.

521
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,710
It was a sudden heart attack,

522
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,600
so he fell off a cliff.

523
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,000
Yes, indeed.

524
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,710
My grandfather has always
been in good health.

525
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,230
How could he suddenly
have a heart attack?

526
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,070
Beiyue,

527
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,190
your grandfather was getting old.

528
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,630
It's all our fault
for not taking good care of him.

529
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,560
We didn't notice his illness.

530
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,870
That's why such an incident
happened today.

531
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,320
It's our fault.

532
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,000
He died suddenly

533
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,870
and didn't leave a single word behind.

534
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,840
Yes.

535
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,390
Can I see my grandfather one last time?

536
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,030
Alright.

537
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,830
No way.

538
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,470
Brother.

539
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,070
Beiyue,

540
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,630
you are close to your grandfather.

541
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,360
There is nothing wrong

542
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,910
that you want to see him one last time.

543
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,750
However,

544
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,080
our Meng Tribe has its own rules.

545
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:31,840
Now that he has been laid to rest,

546
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,950
if the coffin is opened again,

547
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,280
it will be extremely inauspicious.

548
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,790
Yes.

549
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,390
That's inauspicious.

550
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,230
Yes.

551
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,070
Grandfather,

552
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,360
I arrived late

553
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,150
and couldn't see you for the last time.

554
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,270
It's my fault.

555
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,800
Father.

556
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,560
Oh Father.

557
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,520
Beiyue has come to see you.

558
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,120
You can rest in peace.

559
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,600
Father.

560
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,030
Shadow,

561
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,310
we'll stay

562
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,900
to handle
Grandfather's funeral arrangements.

563
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,090
Yes.

00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,520
(In Memoriam)

565
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,120
Father.

566
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,600
Father.

567
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,710
May you rest in peace.

568
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,820
(In Memoriam)

569
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,380
(In Memoriam)

570
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,670
Who is it?

571
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,510
Brother.

572
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,750
Who?

573
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,600
- Shadow.
- Shadow.

574
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,840
- Beiyue.
- Beiyue.

575
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,910
Beiyue, what are you doing?

576
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,520
Let me ask you two.

577
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,280
How did my grandfather die?

578
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,520
Beiyue, didn't my brother tell you?

579
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,600
He had a sudden heart attack.

580
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,390
- Yes, right.
- And he fell off the cliff.

581
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,230
Yeah.

582
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,840
Heart attack?

583
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,800
Then why did the person
who fell off the cliff

584
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,150
not have a single scratch,

585
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,430
but a bite mark from a poisonous insect
on the neck?

586
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,320
Well...

587
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,430
I don't know.

588
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,080
Yes. We don't know.

589
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,910
Speak the truth!

590
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,630
We don't know.

591
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,880
Speak!

592
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,080
I don't know, Beiyue.

593
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,670
Beiyue.

594
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,960
I'll speak.

595
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,950
Brother, speak quickly.

596
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,790
It's

597
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,750
the Minister.

598
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,600
He wanted to go to Momentary Tower.

599
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,120
He forced us

600
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,470
to take him to see the Chief.

601
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,950
Are you referring to
the Minister of Nanzhao?

602
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,950
- Yes.
- Yes, it's him.

603
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,150
It's the Minister of Nanzhao.

604
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,700
What is his purpose
of going to Momentary Tower?

605
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,230
He said he was looking for
some kind of magical artifact

606
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,320
and its instructions.

607
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,160
Yes, yes.

608
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,390
- We didn't dare to resist him.
- We didn't dare.

609
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:05,520
We just watched as he killed Father.

610
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,120
You two monsters.

611
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,360
Considering you are the descendants
of Meng Tribe,

612
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,800
I will grant you a swift end.

613
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,950
- Beiyue.
- Beiyue.

614
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,870
Fourth Prince.

615
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,760
We are a family, Beiyue.

616
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,670
You can't do this.
