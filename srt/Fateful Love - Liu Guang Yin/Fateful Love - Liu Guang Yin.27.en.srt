=Episode 27=

21
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,540
So, Prince Xiang, tell us,

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,410
what secret do you know?

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,290
She's immune to all poisons.

24
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,330
Not everyone can be like that.

25
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,650
Do you have any evidence?

26
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,080
Prince Xiang, I suggest

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,230
that you tell the King of Nanzhao
about this matter right now.

28
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,100
Guess what he would think?

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,180
You kidnapped the person he wanted most

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,290
and tried to hide her in Xiling.

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,700
What do you think the King of Nanzhao
would think?

32
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,710
Prince Xiang.

33
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,470
Fourth Prince,

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,000
how about this?

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,900
Right now,

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,340
there are no outsiders here.

37
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,470
Why not

38
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,720
pretend that my sister and I

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,540
never kidnapped Han Ziqing,

40
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,390
and never saw any totems

41
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,980
on Han Ziqing's face.

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,850
Moreover, we don't know

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,820
that Fourth Princess

44
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,650
is an orphan from the Isolated Island.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,180
How about that?

46
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,340
As for Situ Haonan and Nangong Qianqian,

47
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,370
can you grant their wish, Prince Xiang?

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,520
Can you annul the engagement?

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,360
Han Ziqing,

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,490
it has nothing to do with you,
so don't get involved.

51
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,650
Since you're unwilling to grant it,

52
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,900
there's no need
to discuss anything further.

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,270
You can go ahead and report to Nanzhao

54
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,700
to accuse me of being an Islander.

55
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,990
By the way,

56
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,650
we will also follow the rules

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,100
and denounce the Princess Consort
of Nanzhao

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,110
for kidnapping me.

59
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,720
Let's ask for a fair judgment.

60
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,240
Han Ziqing...

61
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,210
What do you want?

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
Fine,

63
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,260
I will agree to your terms.

64
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,130
Three days later, at Sand Worship Ritual,

65
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,030
I will publicly announce

66
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,570
the annulment of the engagement
with Tieyan.

67
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,990
Good.

68
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,700
Then we will wait for three days.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,290
Chu Feiyan,

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,740
take a good look at yourself now.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,390
Everything you are suffering now

72
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,860
is serving you right.

73
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,240
Ziqing,

74
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,050
do you think we can call it even now?

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,890
Why are you looking at me?

77
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,540
Sha Qiuzi's medical skills

78
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,050
are indeed extraordinary.

79
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,450
This is just a cover-up.

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,210
The totem

81
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,580
is under the human skin mask.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,890
This totem belongs to your family.

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,540
It is a symbol of your identity.

84
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,700
Actually, in my opinion,

85
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,740
you don't need to make any disguise.

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,610
This totem will bring you trouble.

87
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,070
Don't you mind?

88
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,630
I don't care.

89
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,140
I only truly care about you.

90
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,700
As long as you promise me
to take good care of yourself

91
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,490
and stay safe.

92
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,170
That's what I want the most.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
Thank you.

94
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,990
This is the first time
you have hugged me voluntarily.

95
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,350
Let's go.

96
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
Let's go.

97
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,300
You are going to Xiling tomorrow, right?

98
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,720
Yes.

99
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,330
I have received the news

100
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
that Jun Beiyue,

101
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,110
Han Ziqing,

102
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,440
and Consort Yun

103
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,820
are all in Xiling now.

104
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Your Majesty,

105
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,070
there is another piece of news.

106
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,910
Speak.

107
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,700
Dongling was also involved

108
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,130
in the abduction of Han Ziqing.

109
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,240
What?

110
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,510
Dongling?

111
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,680
Yes.

112
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,060
I have not yet figured out why.

113
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,130
Only after arriving in Xiling

114
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,450
can I investigate it further.

115
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,440
No need.

116
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,890
After you arrive in Xiling,

117
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,940
find a way to capture Han Ziqing

118
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,570
and kill her on the spot.

119
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,180
Since Dongling was also involved in it,

120
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,940
it indicates that Han Ziqing's identity
is suspicious.

121
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,980
I don't want to waste any more time
on her,

122
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,980
nor do I want to investigate the truth.

123
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,420
The Isolated Island brings calamity.

124
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,400
Better to kill them mistakenly
than to let go,

125
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,620
thus eliminating future troubles.

126
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,540
However,

128
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,620
it's Xiling's territory.

129
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,860
It's not good to act too openly.

130
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,590
If necessary, Consort Yun

131
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,770
might be useful.

132
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,400
Consort Yun has a wild nature.

133
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,670
The dragon and phoenix candles incident

134
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,990
proves that she is an ominous person.

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,840
Fine. After the matter in Xiling is settled,

136
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,320
let her stay in Xiling.

137
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,440
There's no need for her to come back.

138
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,560
Yes.

139
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,150
Your Highness.

140
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,000
Send this letter out.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,130
Be careful not to let anyone see it.

142
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
Your Highness,

143
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,840
this is already the 17th letter.

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,080
But Mr. Xuanyuan has never replied.

145
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,300
Do you think something happened to him?

146
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,550
What nonsense are you talking about?

147
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,700
How could anything happen to him?

148
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,150
Mr. Xuanyuan is always concerned
about current affairs.

149
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,550
You have revealed
so much information to him.

150
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,760
If nothing had happened,

151
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,380
how could there be no news at all?

152
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,540
I just fed you the pill

153
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,440
to protect your heart meridian.

154
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,890
You won't die.

155
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,450
My family has been practicing medicine
in the northern desert for generations.

156
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,240
Don't worry.

157
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,860
You will get better.

158
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,640
Let's go.

159
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,700
(Sha)

160
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,120
Your Highness,

161
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,250
are you ready for Sand Worship Ritual?

162
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,800
Don't worry.

163
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

164
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,210
I originally wanted

165
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,250
to thank Sha Qiuzi properly,

166
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,200
but he went into the mountains
to gather herbs.

167
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,940
You knew all along

168
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,940
that you have a totem on your face.

169
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,710
Actually, since you came back
from Ice Pool last time,

170
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,980
I have wanted to tell you.

171
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,240
Also,

172
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,150
you said the totems on the faces
of those bodies in Ice Pool

173
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,080
are the same as mine.

174
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,890
They should also be Islanders.

175
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,060
It seems the marks on their faces

176
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,250
are different from yours.

177
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,940
The color is different.

178
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,550
Mine is black.

179
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,450
Theirs is red.

180
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,890
But what difference does it make?

181
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,570
I hope you understand,

182
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,210
no matter how you look

183
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,450
or who you are,

184
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,980
you will always be my princess consort.

185
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,080
Enough.

186
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,180
Things have come to this point.

187
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,640
What use is there in going mad?

188
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,740
I am so angry.

189
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,450
My face has already been ruined by them.

190
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,910
I want to kill Jun Beiyue.

191
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,440
I want to kill Han Ziqing.

192
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,650
I want to destroy Tianque.

193
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,180
I want to make them pay.

194
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,250
You should return to Nanzhao first.

195
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,420
We will plan this carefully.

196
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,470
No.

197
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,500
I can't go back

198
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,640
to Nanzhao.

199
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,210
It is not up to you.

200
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,550
The Minister of Nanzhao will attend

201
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,770
this Sand Worship Ritual.

202
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,380
Father has already given the order.

203
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,330
After the Ritual,

204
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,620
you will go back with the Minister.

205
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
Chu Tiange,

206
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,680
are you all

207
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,540
really planning

208
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,130
to abandon me?

209
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,210
I said we would discuss this later.

210
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,130
Now that Jun Beiyue and the others
are on guard,

211
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,110
in the short term,

212
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,100
we have no chance to act against them.

213
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,380
So you will just let them run wild
in Xiling,

214
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,710
let Jun Beiyue come and bully us,

215
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,670
and submit to Tianque?

216
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,570
When did I ever say such a thing?

217
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,200
But, Sis,

218
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,210
since you have been married to Nanzhao,

219
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,690
you should focus more
on your own affairs.

220
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,180
As for the affairs of Xiling,

221
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,570
even if you care,

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,990
you don't have the right to help.

223
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,180
Tiange, don't make me return to Nanzhao.

224
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,150
As long as you let me

225
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,540
stay in Xiling,

226
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,200
I will do anything you want

227
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,790
to deal with Jun Beiyue and Han Ziqing.

228
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,400
I can help you.

229
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,240
Trust me.

230
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,590
I can help.

231
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,100
Don't make me go back.

232
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,860
Tiange.

233
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,010
This is Father's will.

234
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,690
I can't interfere.

235
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,320
Tiange.

236
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,560
Tiange.

237
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,770
Tiange!

238
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,080
Princess,

239
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,130
the Minister of Nanzhao
requests an audience.

240
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,980
Minister?

241
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,650
I can't

242
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,270
see him.

243
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,150
Get out.

244
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,740
Whether you see me or not

245
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,210
is not up to you, Consort Yun.

246
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,200
Minister,

247
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,810
what brings you to me?

248
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,680
Consort Yun, what do you think

249
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,860
I'm here for?

250
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,680
I cannot return to Nanzhao.

251
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,810
I still have some work to do.

252
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,140
- I cannot...
- I'm not here to take to Nanzhao.

253
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,070
But you hid from His Majesty

254
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,100
and kidnapped Fourth Princess.

255
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,780
It is quite against the rules.

256
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,720
Have you

257
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,410
known about it?

258
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,290
Consort Yun, there's no need to panic.

259
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,330
In my view,

260
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,930
there was nothing wrong
with what you did.

261
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,720
I just wanted

262
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,260
to ease the worries of His Majesty.

263
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,040
I want to help him

264
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,800
get rid of Han Ziqing.

265
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,040
I have no personal motives.

266
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,500
I did it all for His Majesty.

267
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,900
I understand.

268
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,780
If that's the case,

269
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,380
is there any result?

270
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,720
Yes.

271
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,590
Han Ziqing is indeed an Islander.

272
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,640
Is this true?

273
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
It's true.

274
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,830
I saw the totem on her face
with my own eyes.

275
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,190
I also tested her with poisons.

276
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,380
She is truly immune to all poisons.

277
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,570
Immune to all poisons?

278
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,810
(She is indeed an Islander.)

279
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,190
You're awake.

280
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,690
I thought you wouldn't wake up.

281
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,860
Thank you for saving me, Miss.

282
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,680
I worked hard

283
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,920
to rescue you from the desert.

284
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,160
Of course, I had to save you

285
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,690
so my efforts wouldn't be in vain.

286
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,900
What's your name?

287
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,140
My surname is Xuanyuan.

288
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,840
First name

289
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,510
is Shang.

290
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,140
Xuanyuan Shang.

291
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,280
My name is Yu Xiaomeng.

292
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,660
You can just call me Xiaomeng.

293
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,280
My family runs a clinic.

294
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,930
I will treat your illness well.

295
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,210
Don't worry.

296
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,310
This is porridge I made for you.

297
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,150
No need.

298
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,410
What are you doing?

299
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,930
Thank you for your help, Miss.

300
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,390
But

301
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
I must take my leave now.

302
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,310
Do you want to leave?

303
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,070
How can you leave now?

304
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,020
Your wounds haven't healed yet.

305
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,020
You can't leave now, Sir.

306
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,920
My family runs a clinic.

307
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,570
My mother has gone up the mountain
to gather herbs.

308
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,980
Thank you for saving me.

309
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,720
I will

310
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,310
take my leave now.

311
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,950
In my house, you have to listen to me.

312
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,860
Your body hasn't recovered yet.

313
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,050
I worked hard to save you.

314
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,210
I can't let you ruin your body again.

315
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
Sir,

316
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,380
you're awake.

317
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,710
This is my mother.

318
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,330
She took care of you
while you were unconscious.

319
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:53,880
Take a look.

320
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,310
I gathered these herbs for you.

321
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,680
They are very nourishing.

322
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,880
Just rest here

323
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,860
and recover your health.

324
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,350
Sir,

325
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,020
your body is still so weak.

326
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,860
Quickly put on some clothes.

327
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,150
Xiaomeng,

328
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,680
help him back to his room to rest.

329
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,520
Alright.

330
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Go on.

331
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,740
What are you still standing there for?

332
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,270
Put it on.

333
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,150
Come on.

334
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,510
Let's go.

335
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,680
Thank you.

336
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,410
- Go ahead.
- I'll do it myself.

337
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,900
Your body is so weak.

338
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,620
You should eat something.

339
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,110
Be careful. It's hot.

340
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,840
Thank you.

341
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,660
(Dongling Palace)

342
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,910
Your Majesty.

343
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,810
Have you found the Crown Prince?

344
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,190
We've searched everywhere,

345
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,380
but there's no trace of him.

346
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,630
You are useless.

347
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,170
It's you

348
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,230
who have spoiled him so much
that he's become unruly

349
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,450
and recklessly.

350
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,500
He doesn't even listen to me anymore.

351
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,740
Now Zhaoxi
has caused such a big trouble.

352
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,170
If Tianque declares war on us,

353
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,330
and Lige doesn't return
with his Sound Strike,

354
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,660
how can we rely on the old forces alone

355
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,330
to resist them?

356
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,410
I will personally go
and bring His Highness back.

357
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,760
Such an ungrateful

358
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,430
and traitorous man.

359
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,160
If he hadn't taken the Tiger Tally

360
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,690
to prevent me
from mobilizing his troops,

361
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,720
would I be in such a passive position?

362
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,590
Your Majesty,

363
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,880
could Lige have already died
on the ship?

364
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,530
Even if he died on the ship,

365
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,900
what's there to regret?

366
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,140
He is already a dying man.

367
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,860
I have decided

368
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,480
to make Princess Yinyue

369
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,690
the successor.

370
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,660
Summon him back immediately

371
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,780
to spend the rest of his life
assisting his sister.

372
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,200
Your Majesty,

373
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,620
he is your biological son.

374
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,280
Sir,

375
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,120
your medicine.

376
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,170
Why is this burning?

377
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,290
What kind of map is this?

378
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,690
It's useless now.

379
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:57,230
Are you a general?

380
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,980
Then you must be going to war.

381
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,020
Even if war breaks out
on Longyuan Continent,

382
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,930
it has nothing to do with me anymore.

383
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,750
I'm tired.

384
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:09,270
I'm not going.

385
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,680
Really?

386
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,020
Are you willing to stay?

387
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,980
I want to go out for a walk.

388
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,360
Alright.

389
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,230
I'll accompany you.

390
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,840
Like this.

391
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,680
Compare hands?

392
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,660
Why are your hands so small?

393
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,630
Are you looking for us?

394
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,100
I thought I went the wrong way.

395
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,230
Ziqing, Fourth Prince,

396
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,930
I am here to bid farewell.

397
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,920
Aren't you going to Sand Worship Ritual?

398
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,000
Of course, I will go.

399
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,230
After all, it's
a once-in-a-century event

400
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,070
on the Jiazi day of the month of Jiazi.

401
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,020
How could I miss it?

402
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,230
But first, I need to go to Xiling Palace
to find Xuezheng.

403
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,380
And I am really worried
about Xuanyuan Lige.

404
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,690
Xuanyuan Lige is so ill.

405
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,620
What if he dies in the desert?

406
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,330
I have searched many times
but couldn't find him.

407
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,070
I had already sent people

408
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,860
to search for him
within a few hundred miles.

409
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,930
But there was no trace of him.

410
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,950
I still want to search for him again,

411
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,920
so that I can rest assured.

412
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,800
Alright.

413
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,740
If there is any news about him,

414
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,810
please let us know as soon as possible.

415
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,390
Of course.

416
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,630
Then,

417
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,840
you may go ahead.

418
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,760
Be careful.

419
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,170
Don't worry.

420
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,380
Consort Yun,

421
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,290
the Islanders bring disasters
to the world.

422
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,710
Before I came to Xiling,

423
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,410
His Majesty had given me an order.

424
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,330
Once Han Ziqing's identity
as an Islander is confirmed,

425
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,170
we should kill her without mercy.

426
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,780
What do you plan to do?

427
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,880
Han Ziqing is now guarded by Jun Beiyue.

428
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,260
It is not easy to kill her.

429
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,930
She is an Islander.

430
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,050
She was from Nanzhao originally.

431
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,100
So I have ways to deal with her.

432
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,740
But after all, this is Xiling.

433
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,330
It is inconvenient for me to act.

434
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,500
I hope you can assist me.

435
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:17,980
Once the matter is done,

436
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,680
I will report all of your contributions

437
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,140
to His Majesty.

438
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,070
I believe he will understand

439
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,520
your loyalty.

440
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,470
Rest assured, Minister.

441
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,860
I will do my utmost.

442
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,020
But what is the plan?

443
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,020
How should I cooperate?

444
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,740
Has the Princess gone to sleep?

445
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,710
She is seeing the guest
in the rear hall.

446
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,880
She specifically instructed

447
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,860
not to disturb her.

448
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,800
These are all top-quality materials

449
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,210
for the new clothes of the Princess.

450
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,260
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

451
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,560
Alright.

452
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,590
That thief Chu Feiyan

453
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,260
really wants to take Xuezheng
for herself.

454
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,100
Does she even think she's worthy?

455
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,510
Chu,

456
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,190
the Mingsha Mountain

457
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,620
is truly unparalleled in the world.

458
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,380
It is indeed the greatest wonder.

459
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,350
Thanks for the praise.

460
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,160
Being able to attend
your country's Sand Worship Ritual

461
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,170
makes this trip worthwhile.

462
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,450
- Please.
- Please.

463
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,600
Tiange,

464
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,280
all the distinguished guests
have arrived.

465
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,900
Why is the Fourth Prince of Tianque
still not here?

466
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,450
Father,

467
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,290
I have no idea of it.

468
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,980
The Fourth Prince of Tianque
is always busy.

469
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,980
Could it be
that he forgot about today's ritual?

470
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,760
Although he has not arrived,

471
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,160
the auspicious time waits for no one.

472
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,170
Sand Worship Ritual is about to begin.

473
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,660
The Fourth Prince of Tianque
has arrived.

474
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,560
Fourth Prince,

475
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,660
you finally made it.

476
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,140
I thought you would miss it.

477
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,050
Sorry to keep everyone waiting.

478
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,860
For such a grand event,

479
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,740
how could I miss it?

480
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,900
By the way, Prince Xiang,

481
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,900
before the ritual begins,

482
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,700
is there something

483
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,060
you need to announce to everyone?

484
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,740
Thank you for the reminder,
Fourth Prince.

485
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,340
Everyone,

486
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,140
I had an engagement
with Princess Nangong Qianqian.

487
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,500
But after spending some time together
these past few days,

488
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,980
I found
that our personalities do not match.

489
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,780
- Therefore,
- Well...

490
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,380
I have decided
to call off the engagement.

491
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,140
But rest assured.

492
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,580
Though the engagement
between Xiling and Tieyan is canceled,

493
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,440
it does not affect the harmony
between our two countries.

494
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,220
Tiange,

495
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,220
for such a big decision,

496
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,020
why didn't you discuss it with me?

497
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
Prince Xiang,

498
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,340
what mistake did my daughter make

499
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,460
to deserve being publicly rejected

500
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,820
and humiliated?

501
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,860
Father,

502
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,460
it happened suddenly

503
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,580
beyond my control.

504
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,500
I hope you can understand.

505
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,740
Well, you...

506
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,780
Shadow.

507
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,380
King of Tieyan.

508
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,700
Have you seen Chu Feiyan?

509
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,220
I can't explain it in public.

510
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,060
No, I haven't.

511
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,620
If you want to know the details,

512
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,380
you can ask Princess Qianqian.

513
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,060
Alright.

514
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,380
Fine.

515
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,380
It...

516
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
Prince Xiang is a responsible man.

517
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,740
I'm impressed.

518
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,820
(Don't get too complacent now.)

519
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,780
(There will be a time
when you two will cry.)

520
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,740
Why are you glaring at me?

521
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,740
Where is your sister?

522
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,700
She has returned to Nanzhao.

523
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,020
I see.

524
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,940
I was hoping to catch up with her.

525
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,020
Don't worry.

526
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,140
Haven't you returned to Nanzhao?

527
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,700
I have more work to do.

528
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,180
How could I go back?

529
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,300
Father,

530
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,300
distinguished envoys,

531
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,060
I believe everyone has heard

532
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,980
that Islanders can turn into
ruthless puppets

533
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,100
to bring disaster to the world.

534
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,060
How can we sit idly by

535
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,620
and let such demons mingle among us?

536
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,020
I have evidence to prove

537
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,420
that Han Ziqing, the Fourth Princess
of Tianque, is an Islander.

538
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,500
Do you dare to prove your identity?

539
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,860
If you have any evidence,
just present it.

540
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,660
Stop wasting words.

541
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,820
The evidence is on you.

542
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,940
Let us examine your face,

543
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,980
and then take some poisons in public.

544
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,780
The truth will be revealed.

545
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,260
I understand now.

546
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,740
You want to ruin my face,

547
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,700
and then poison me to death.

548
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,700
Do you think I'm stupid?

549
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,860
After all, people on Longyuan Continent

550
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,980
all know you've been eyeing
Fourth Prince for a long time.

551
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,420
If I do as you say,

552
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,260
wouldn't that benefit you?

553
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,180
Stop beating around the bush.

554
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,660
I just ask you

555
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,300
how do you prove yourself?

556
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,740
I was born in the Chancellor's Mansion
and grew up in Tianque.

557
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,820
That is the best proof.

558
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,780
How about

559
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,980
I question you too?

560
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,180
If I say you are an Islander,

561
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,980
how do you prove yourself?

562
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,420
Han Ziqing,

563
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,340
do you think you can get away with this?

564
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,500
Otherwise, I will grant you
a bowl of poisoned wine

565
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,340
to check.

566
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,020

567
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,500
- Father.
- Tiange.

568
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,340
Run.

569
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,980
Sandstorm.

570
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,540
- Run.
- Run.

571
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,860

573
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,180
Run.

574
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,260
(I haven't used the new move
Xuanyuan Lige taught me yet.)

575
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,940
(It's a good chance for me to practice.)

576
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,220
It's a Jiazi day in the month of Jiazi
and in the year of Jiazi.
