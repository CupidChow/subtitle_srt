21
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,760
Your Highness.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,440
The soldiers are toasting His Highness.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,760
Their movements are all in unison.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,600
Truly impressive.

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,520
Princess,

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,270
how can you still be in the mood
to play the guqin?

27
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,590
Look what time it is.

28
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,080
Fill it up, and drink.

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,380
- Pour more.
- Drink.

30
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,750
General Baihu, drink more.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Not a good drinker.

32
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,030
Miss Situ.

33
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,360
Why are you drinking alone?

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,320
Have some tea.

35
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,160
Go away.

36
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Brother Beiyue.

37
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,630
I want to find Beiyue.

38
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,130
The prince ordered you to rest here

39
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,000
and not to run around.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,840
Get out.

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,200
Miss Situ.

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,270
Miss Situ.

43
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,190
His Highness is asleep.

44
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,390
You should come back tomorrow.

45
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,630
Let me tell you.

46
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,630
Brother Beiyue asked me to come.

47
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,470
Well.

48
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,320
Miss Situ, then please come in.

49
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,160
Go away.

50
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,390
Princess, you've finally come to your senses.

51
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,910
The prince will definitely be happy.

52
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,440
I heard he was drunk,
so I came to check on him.

53
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
Brother Beiyue.

54
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,950
Xin'er, you...

55
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,350
I...

56
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,670
Why are you here?

57
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,070
Hongyi said you were drunk
and wanted me to check.

58
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

60
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,950
What do you mean?

61
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,790
Nothing.

62
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,230
You're the prince.

63
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,110
Do whatever you want.

64
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,320
There's no fire in this room.

65
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,130
Is it cold?

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
I'm not cold.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
Being by your side,

68
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,720
I don't feel cold at all.

69
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,630
Don't catch a cold.

70
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,390
I'll get you a cup of hot tea.

71
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
Brother Beiyue.

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,760
You've just woken up.

73
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,550
Drink it to warm up.

74
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,300
You two continue.

75
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
I'll leave first.

76
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,800
Wait a moment.

77
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,670
What's the matter?

78
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,320
Xin'er.

79
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,040
Please leave us.

80
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,230
I'll take my leave.

81
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,160
I want to thank you

82
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,830
for negotiating with Xiling.

83
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,040
You've secured five cities for Tianque.

84
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,700
So I want to grant you a title.

85
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,550
No need.

86
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,480
Princess, why did you come out so soon?

87
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,920
I just saw Situ Xin'er

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,160
coming out from inside.

89
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,000
Why would she come out
of the prince's tent so late?

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,950
Did she spend the night there?

91
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:13,810
Your Highness.

92
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,950
Has the Judicial Office been arranged?

93
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,110
Don't worry. Everything has been arranged.

94
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,040
You just need to return.

95
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,760
Just wait, Han Ziqing.

96
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,000
The best is yet to come.

97
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,920
Princess.

98
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,320
Are you really leaving?

99
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,950
You're angry,

100
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,920
but leaving isn't the best solution.

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Leaving now is

102
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,270
exactly what that woman wants.

103
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,070
Where are we going?

104
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,790
Don't you want to go?

105
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,790
I work for you.

106
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,110
I'll follow you wherever you go.

107
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,200
Go prepare the carriage.

108
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,040
Yes.

109
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,830
Princess, you can't go.

110
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,320
If you go now,

111
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,880
whether Situ Xin'er stayed
at His Highness's tent last night or not,

112
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,720
she now has an excuse to demand marriage.

113
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,720
You must find a way

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
to keep this from spreading.

115
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,480
We're just collaborators.

116
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,320
No need to do that.

117
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,390
Princess.

118
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,230
It's so late.

119
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,230
Where can you go?

120
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,410
The world is vast.

121
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,580
I can go anywhere.

122
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,950
Princess, you can't act impulsively.

123
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,000
Though His Highness has a strange temper,

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,760
he truly cares for you.

125
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,830
You can't just leave like this.

126
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Princess.

127
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,480
Princess, don't go.

128
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:30,730
Ten.

129
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,350
Your Highness, the carriage is ready.

130
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,700
Let's go.

131
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:34,840
Princess.

132
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,480
Princess.

133
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,000
Princess.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,150
Hongyi, farewell.

135
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,590
Princess, don't go.

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Ten, you...

137
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,250
Princess.

138
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,140
Princess.

139
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,070
Stop.

140
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,550
Second Prince.

141
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,230
How dare you barge into the commander's tent?

142
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,550
- Guards.
- Yes!

143
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,440
Watch this girl.

144
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,790
Don't let her disturb the Fourth Prince.

145
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,630
Yes.

146
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,000
Your Highness.

147
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,440
Where are we going?

148
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,390
To the Qinse Valley.

149
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,470
The Qinse Valley?

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,240
- Went south all the way?
- Yes.

151
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,020
Seemed there was a specific destination.

152
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,980
They haven't stopped.

153
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,500
When will the judicial officials arrive?

154
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,700
They're already on the way.

155
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
According to the time,

156
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,480
they should intercept them before dawn.

157
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,380
Han Ziqing,

158
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,370
we'll meet at the Judicial Office.

159
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,730
Let's see how you escape this time.

160
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,590
Your Highness.

161
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,010
Your Highness.

162
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,540
Why are you here?

163
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,060
Your Highness.

164
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,580
The princess left last night.

165
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,060
Should we send someone to bring her back?

166
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,780
If she wants to leave,

167
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,820
let her go.

168
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,020
Your Highness.

169
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,260
Your Highness.

170
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,220
Shadow.

171
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,540
Prepare the horse.

172
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,660
Your Highness.

173
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,380
Your Highness.

174
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,740
Your Highness.

175
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,580
The princess...

176
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,980
What happened to her?

177
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,740
We just walked a few dozen miles,

178
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,700
and she was taken away
by the Judicial Office.

179
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,020
Said she was involved in a case

180
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,030
and was fleeing.

181
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,030
Your Highness.

182
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,300
Jun Beichen is gone.

183
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,660
Beiyue.

184
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,180
Beiyue.

185
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,210
Long time no see.

186
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,310
Where is my sister?

187
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,740
Urgent. Talk to you when I return.

188
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,160
Where are you going?

189
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,540
(Judicial Office)

190
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,110
Greetings, Your Majesties.

191
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,920
Rise and speak.

192
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,130
Your Majesty.

193
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
The case of Mr. Chen has been concluded.

194
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,280
The murderer has been found.

195
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,980
Why another interrogation?

196
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,360
Summon the Judicial Office's
Minister Huang Shao.

197
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,220
I, Huang Shao, greet Your Majesty.

198
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,690
Rise.

199
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,330
Mr. Huang,

200
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,140
the Fourth Princess has
some doubts about the re-examination.

201
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,980
Please explain to her.

202
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,320
Your Majesty.

203
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,500
After my investigation, I found

204
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,140
the two people in purple
are indeed Imperial Guards.

205
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,980
They had no prior contact with Mr. Chen,

206
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,100
so they had no motive for the murder.

207
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,660
A large amount of banknotes
were found in their homes.

208
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,620
Thus, I suspect someone hired them to kill.

209
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,220
Mr. Huang,

210
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,620
what do you mean?

211
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,460
I suspect

212
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,300
that these two were bribed

213
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,380
to kill Mr. Chen.

214
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,220
Thus,

215
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,900
the Han family still has suspicions.

216
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,700
What's going on?

217
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,300
I don't know.

218
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,980
Do you have evidence?

219
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,180
I have found a witness.

220
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,540
What witness?

221
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,260
The case has returned to square one.

222
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,540
I reinitiated the investigation

223
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,460
to examine everything

224
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,540
and found a witness from Grandeur Palace.

225
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,260
Bring in the witness.

226
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,420
Who are you?

227
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,460
Your Majesty.

228
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,540
I am a servant from Grandeur Palace.

229
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,020
What evidence do you have?

230
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,060
I testify

231
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,100
that Mr. Chen was not

232
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,020
in the Fourth Princess's room that night

233
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,260
but was sleeping in the adjacent room.

234
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,700
When I went in to clean,

235
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,060
he was still asleep.

236
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,700
What's going on?

237
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,140
Your Majesty,

238
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,300
since Mr. Chen was not

239
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,100
in the Fourth Princess's room that night,

240
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,540
saying that I ordered him
to insult Han Ziqing

241
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,980
is a grave injustice.

242
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,380
So, according to you,

243
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,300
Han Ziqing wasn't insulted
at Grandeur Palace.

244
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,460
Is it a misunderstanding?

245
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,100
It's not a misunderstanding.

246
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,100
Because

247
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,740
that night, in Han Ziqing's room,

248
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,500
there was someone else.

249
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,740
Absurd.

250
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,820
What exactly is going on?

251
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,140
Since I was wrongly implicated,

252
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,700
I sought to clear my name

253
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,780
and privately inquired

254
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,380
among the workers of Grandeur Palace.

255
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,620
From the old woman's account,

256
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,620
I learned of this matter.

257
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,020
Coincidentally, Mr. Huang
was also investigating the case,

258
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,340
so I provided

259
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,420
all the evidence to him.

260
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,300
That's why

261
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,340
the Judicial Office decided
to reopen the case

262
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,830
to give the Han family

263
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,330
and all the people of Tianque an explanation.

264
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,860
Ms. Liu,

265
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,180
hurry and tell us everything you know.

266
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,380
Mr. Chen was indeed

267
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,620
not in the Fourth Princess's room that night.

268
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,820
However...

269
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,420
Speak freely.

270
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,740
In front of the King,

271
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,720
who would dare to threaten you?

272
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,700
I also saw a man in black

273
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,820
drag Mr. Chen

274
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,020
into the adjacent room

275
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,580
and then enter the Fourth Princess's room.

276
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,300
I am timid by nature

277
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,940
and do not dare to lie.

278
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,980
I don't dare to lie.

279
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,140
How improper!

280
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,620
Your Majesty,

281
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,260
Ms. Liu has worked as a servant

282
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,180
at Grandeur Palace for decades.

283
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,620
She is timid and afraid of trouble

284
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,540
and would not lie.

285
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,860
What is the relationship
between the Fourth Princess

286
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,340
and the man in black?

287
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,100
What conspiracy are they involved in?

288
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,900
Please give everyone
an explanation, Fourth Princess.

289
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,140
(This woman repeatedly)

290
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,340
(frames her sister.)

291
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
(She's truly vicious.)

292
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,300
Fourth Princess,

293
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,300
why did you conceal

294
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,900
such an important detail

295
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,820
in the previous trial?

296
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,580
What is the reason?

297
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,500
Fourth Princess,

298
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,340
I believe you wouldn't kill anyone.

299
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,340
You might have been wrongly accused.

300
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,460
Now it is time

301
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,980
to identify the true murderer.

302
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,020
If you do not identify,

303
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,660
the crime of killing Mr. Chen

304
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,260
will fall solely on you.

305
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,060
Fourth Princess,

306
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,180
how do you explain these new leads

307
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,740
from the Judicial Office?

308
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,780
Fourth Princess,

309
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,900
there are suspicions that there's another
hidden agenda regarding Grandeur Palace.

310
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,620
Since it involves the Chen family's case,

311
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,540
please explain in detail
what happened that night.

312
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,340
Fourth Princess,

313
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,980
please tell us the truth

314
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,900
and explain in detail
what happened that night.

315
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,340
Otherwise, you cannot
escape the suspicion of cover-up.

316
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,980
(They're framing me.)

317
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,540
(If I identify that person as Jun Beichen,)

318
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,500
(Jun Beiyue will be ridiculed by the world.)

319
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,100
(Jun Beiyue fought bloodily for Tianque)

320
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,140
(but was met with malicious calculation)

321
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,180
(from these people.)

322
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,140
(How sad.)

323
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,260
(But if I refuse to speak,)

324
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,780
(I won't be able to clear)

325
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,740
(the suspicion on me.)

326
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,540
(Any outcome)

327
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,740
(is a victory for these shameless people.)

328
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,980
Han Ziqing,

329
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,060
you should confess.

330
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,460
Who is the murderer?

331
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,300
Identify them,

332
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,420
so we can close the case early

333
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,500
and give Tianque peace.

334
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,260
(Han Ziqing,)

335
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,660
(you have no choice but to identify me.)

336
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,780
(I want to see)

337
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,860
(how Beiyue will face the world)

338
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,460
(after his woman was insulted
by his brother.)

339
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,620
(Will I have to act?)

340
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,740
Han Ziqing, you...

341
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,220
What are you doing?

342
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:33,740
Your Majesty.

343
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,420
Then I

344
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,740
confess.

345
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,860
Wait.

346
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,780
Who are you,

347
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,780
daring to intrude on the court?

348
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,300
Don't you want to know

349
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,740
who was in the scene that night?

350
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,060
I'm here to tell you.

351
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,220
Speak.

352
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,100
I am the manager of Grandeur Palace.

353
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,860
I was instructed by Miss Han

354
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,300
to find

355
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,820
Mr. Chen,

356
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,940
trying to tarnish Miss Ziqing's reputation.

357
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,620
Later, I

358
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,540
went to ask Miss Han for money,

359
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,020
but she refused

360
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,260
and even

361
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,100
wanted to silence me.

362
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,100
Fortunately, I was alert

363
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,140
and quickly escaped in fear.

364
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,540
I am well aware of my deep sins.

365
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,140
I'm willing to confess

366
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,980
and identify the killer.

367
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,820
Your Majesty.

368
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,980
Have mercy.

369
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,020
Your Majesty, have mercy.

370
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,500
The facts are clear now.

371
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,860
Miss Han bribed Mr. Chen

372
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,020
to do harm to her sister Han Ziqing.

373
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,700
I happened to be there

374
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,500
and knocked out Mr. Chen.

375
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,700
The man in black you saw later was me.

376
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,180
(So, it was you who poisoned me.)

377
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:57,840
♪Don't blame me if we never meet again♪

378
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:05,750
♪And don't blame me for saying nothing♪

379
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,300

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,300
I failed in parenting.

00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,140

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,460
The Second Prince

470
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,900
acted rashly.

471
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,580
Punish him with two years' salary reduction.

472
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:28,500
No, three years.

473
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,340
Father...

474
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,340
This should be acceptable.

475
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,420
The Fourth Prince has
handed over all military affairs to me.

476
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,700
Seeing this ring is like
seeing the Fourth Prince.

477
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,340
Yes.

478
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,020

479
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,580
Return to your posts.

480
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,460
Guard the royal city.

481
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,580
Yes, yes.

482
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:33,990
How is he?

483
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,460
Tell me how he is.

484
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,260
What good does it do you
to worry about him now?

485
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,780
- Shadow.
- You injured him.

486
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,300
- I'll kill you.
- What are you doing?

487
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,140
Get out of the way.

488
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,540
Are you mad? She's the princess.

489
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,060
That night,

490
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,500
it wasn't his fault.

491
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,300
He was poisoned and unconscious.

492
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,740
Gu and I carried him to Grandeur Palace.

493
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,220
If you want to kill someone,
it should be me and Gu.

494
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,940
If you want to blame someone,
it should be me and Gu.

495
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,380
He was unaware of the entire affair.

496
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,740
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

497
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,740
His Highness had his concerns.

498
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,340
Even if told earlier,
you might not have accepted it.

499
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,540
Though the poison was my decision

500
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,820
to be redirected to you,

501
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,900
His Highness still felt guilty towards you.

502
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,540
He chose you

503
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,820
and protected you.

504
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,380
He has been trying to make amends.

505
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,660
Even when he later learned
you were immune to poison

506
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
and might be an Islander,

507
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,700
he kept you by his side
to investigate the truth,

508
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,820
but he never harmed you.

509
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,980
He protected you in every way.

510
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,040
You must understand.

511
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,820
Your status is so special.

512
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,540
Staying by his side

513
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,940
is undoubtedly a huge risk.

514
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,300
But he never wavered in the slightest.

515
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,900
