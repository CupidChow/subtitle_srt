21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,080
Princess, go!

22
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,350
Your Highness!

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,270
- Prince.
- Prince.

24
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,440
Are you okay?

25
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Chase her!

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
Chase her!

27
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,070
Stop!

28
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,630
Stop!

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,200
Stop!

30
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,630
Who are you?

31
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,990
How dare you harm the Prince's men?

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,880
Prince, be careful.

33
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,840
What are you trying to do?

34
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,510
- Prince!
- Prince!

35
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,070
Your Highness.

36
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,720
What kind of skill is this?

37
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
Shall we chase them?

38
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,000
This is the legendary Sound Strike.

39
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,400
Retreat!

40
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Stop the carriage.

41
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,680
Stop, stop, stop.

42
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,310
Your Highness.

43
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,240
Let's go.

44
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,150
Your Highness.

45
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,910
Open the door.

46
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:12,750
Get in.

47
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,630
Who are you?

48
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,230
The Fourth Prince's inspection.

49
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,070
Move aside.

50
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,030
Princess Feiyan.

51
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,910
The Prince's guards need a search.

52
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,880
Darn it.

53
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,720
We're suspected.

54
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,000
Routine inspection.

55
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Please forgive us.

56
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,000
Why search the envoy's convoy out of nowhere?

57
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,560
Did our Xiling offend

58
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
the Fourth Prince's mansion somehow?

59
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,230
You misunderstood.

60
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,790
You're near the city gate.

61
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,510
It's just a routine check.

62
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,190
Please step out for inspection.

63
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,230
Prince Xiang got drunk yesterday.

64
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,070
He can't get out.

65
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,720
Then may we take a look inside?

66
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,030
That would violate diplomatic protocol.

67
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,190
Are you

68
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,910
treating Xiling's envoys like thieves?

69
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,960
I'm just following orders.

70
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,960
If you have objections,
you can file a complaint.

71
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,630
His Highness will

72
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,070
give your country an explanation.

73
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,120
He got drunk yesterday

74
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,190
and still hasn't woken up.

75
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,910
Is the search over?

76
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,000
Sorry for this.

77
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,960
Please continue.

78
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,720
Sir, the princess isn't in Xiling's convoy.

79
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,560
What do we do now?

80
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,070
Keep following them.

81
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,030
Yes.

82
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,880
Alright, everyone, get out.

83
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,070
- Father! Father!
- Yes.

84
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,910
Father!

85
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,600
Father, you must stand up for me.

86
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,310
I was sent by you
to the Tiger Army to take command.

87
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,350
Beiyue returned.

88
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,910
He had someone point a sword at me,

89
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,440
accusing me of seizing
military power, Father!

90
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,350
The order to take command came from me.

91
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,440
The Tieyan army is invading.

92
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,680
The situation is urgent.

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,160
General Ouyang's troops...

94
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,000
His uncle is

95
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,070
probably drinking
and making merry at Xiguan right now.

96
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,440
Nonsense!

97
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,030
Father.

98
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,120
Uncle is loyal to Tianque.

99
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,910
Beiyue is slandering him!

100
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
There's no war at Xiguan.

101
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,030
Is it wrong for your uncle to drink

102
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,870
and make merry?

103
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,560
What?

104
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,910
No war?

105
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,310
What's going on here?

106
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,190
Beiyue, you...

107
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,840
Jun Beichen.

108
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,480
Take a good look.

109
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,280
Tieyan's 100,000 troops aren't at our border.

110
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,400
They have only 10,000,

111
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,310
bluffing their way in.

112
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,920
As for the so-called Dugu Xianyun

113
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,190
leading 3,000 elite soldiers,

114
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,960
only fifty miles from our western border,

115
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,920
that's pure nonsense.

116
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,800
Your uncle falsely reported
the situation from the border.

117
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,920
What is his crime?

118
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,960
And you colluded with him

119
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,190
to seize my military power.
What is your crime?

120
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,510
What on earth is going on?

121
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Father!

122
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,110
I only knew the situation was urgent.

123
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,240
I requested command

124
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,510
for the safety of Tianque.

125
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,040
I don't know anything else.

126
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,550
Please investigate!

127
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,280
- Father!
- Please investigate, Father!

128
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,960
My Tiger Army got the most

129
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,750
accurate military report from the frontline.

130
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,590
Please, Father,

131
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,600
give me justice.

132
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,160
How dare you!

133
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,710
Father.

134
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,800
I truly don't know.

135
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,280
I only knew the situation was dire,

136
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,510
so I asked for command.

137
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,600
I know

138
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,240
nothing else, Father!

139
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,270
Jun Beichen.

140
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,750
This was all your uncle's doing.

141
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,110
Without your help,
he couldn't have succeeded.

142
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,430
And now you're trying

143
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,630
to wash your hands of it?

144
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,830
Father.

145
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,410
I'm also a member

146
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,400
of the Jun family.

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,540
How could I do something

148
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,280
that would ruin the kingdom

149
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,550
and disgrace my name forever?

150
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
I...

151
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,240
I did it for Tianque

152
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,190
and the people of Tianque,

153
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,710
so I didn't stop

154
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,310
to discern the truth.

155
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,430
Father, see this clearly!

156
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,630
Please see this clearly!

157
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,550
Ouyang Yibo dared
to falsify military reports!

158
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,950
Eunuch!

159
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,870
Go to Xiguan at once,
bring him back to the royal city,

160
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,990
and execute him publicly!

161
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

162
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,590
Father.

163
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
What should we do

164
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,240
with Second Brother?

165
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,630
You reckless fool!

166
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,800
Guards!

167
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,390
Take him away!

168
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,630
Father!

169
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,550
Quickly!

170
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm innocent, Father!

171
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,270
Father!

172
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,470
Forgive me.

173
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,320
Endure it.

174
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,510
Come on.

175
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,830
Come on.

176
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,320
Let me help you up.

177
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,910
Come on.

178
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,440
Drink.

179
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,560
Drink some wine.

180
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,030
It'll ease the pain.

181
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,470
One more sip.

182
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,510
Come on.

183
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Rest a bit.

184
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,680
(Something's off.)

185
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,070
(Why does her blood smell fragrant?)

186
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,710
(Moxun?)

187
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,020
(She's been poisoned?)

188
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,030
(But)

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,310
(if she's really poisoned with Moxun,)

190
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,400
(how is she still alive?)

191
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,510
Can you hear me?

192
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
Calm down.

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,840
Han Ziqing.

195
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,680
Don't hurt yourself.

196
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,400
Don't move. Hold on!

197
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,670
You've been poisoned with Moxun.

198
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,960
Cold water can ease the toxin.

It'll be over soon.

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,160
(that activated the residual toxin.)

213
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,310
(The cold water is)

214
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,960
(suppressing the toxin temporarily.)

215
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,760
(But)

216
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,030

217
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,160

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,240
(Could it be)

219
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,160
(she's immune to all poisons?)

220
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,560
(Is she...?)

221
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,820
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

222
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,870
The Princess was abducted.

223
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,800
I believe Xiling is the most suspicious,

224
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,960
so we immediately searched their convoy.

225
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,070
But we didn't find her.

226
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,280
If it wasn't Chu Tiange who did it,

227
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,870
could it be the Second Prince?

228
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,840
It shouldn't be.

229
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
Our men surrounded
the Second Prince at that time.

230
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,750
No time for him.

231
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,360
Shadow, you said Chu Tiange was injured.

232
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,630
How did he get hurt?

233
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,280
What about the musician?

234
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,750
Isn't he just a musician?

235
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,120
Is he also a suspect?

236
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,870
He left right after the music gathering.

237
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,550
It's hard to trace him.

238
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
Your Highness.

239
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,240
The Princess has a unique constitution.

240
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,360
I worry that someone with ill intentions

241
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,670
might use her to threaten us.

242
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,190
With her abilities,

243
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,750
she shouldn't be easily exploited.

244
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,140
Now, Xiling is still the most suspicious.

245
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,400
Spread the word.

246
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,550
Say that our Fourth Princess

247
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,550
was abducted
by Xiling's Prince Xiang, Chu Tiange.

248
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,750
Your Highness, we have no evidence
to back that up.

249
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,190
I'm going to Xiling to find the evidence.

250
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,920
Old traitor!

251
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,840
Traitor!

252
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,800
Execute him!

253
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,360
Old traitor!

254
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,990
- Old traitor!
- Traitor!

255
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,160
He should be cut to pieces!

256
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,720
- Smash him!
- He should be cut!

257
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,560
Traitor!

258
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,750
Smash him to death! Smash him to death!

259
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,720
Smash the traitor!

260
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,000
Eunuch Yin.

261
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,390
Well.

262
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,600
Is the King still unwilling to see us?

263
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,400
Eunuch Yin, please.

264
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,800
Go talk to the King again.

265
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,920
Please let us see him.

266
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,800
We beg you, Eunuch Yin, please.

267
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,430
Eunuch Yin, please help us.

268
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,080
Queen.

269
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,510
Princess.

270
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,360
It's not that I don't want to help.

271
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,430
But the King is in a rage.

272
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,960
I truly don't dare to persuade him.

273
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,720
It's best if you both return for now.

274
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,310
Wait until the King calms down.

275
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,360
If we wait,

276
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,640
the lives of the dozens of people
in the Ouyang family

277
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,550
will be long gone!

278
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,480
My father has already been beheaded.

279
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,030
His life was taken for a great crime.

280
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,520
Can't the King spare our family?

281
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,670
Lower your voice, Princess. Stop crying.

282
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,270
Your Highness.

283
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,430
Fourth Prince, Fourth Prince.

284
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,390
We wronged you in the past.

285
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,360
I now offer my apologies.

286
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,960
Please, speak to the King

287
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,720
on our behalf.

288
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,270
Spare the Ouyang family.

289
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,110
Beiyue.

290
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,360
You're a noble person. Don't hold grudges.

291
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
We were wrong in the past.

292
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,550
Please don't take it to heart.

293
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,000
My father was guilty,

294
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,190
but the dozens of people in the Ouyang family

295
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,000
are innocent!

296
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,360
With the Fourth Princess now missing,

297
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,240
you have no right to ask me for mercy.

298
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,640
From now on, you'd better pray every day

299
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,720
that the Fourth Princess returns safely.

300
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,310
If anything happens to her,

301
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,670
you'll all join her in death.

302
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,190
Guards, take the Queen and the Princess back.

303
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,030
Your Majesty.

304
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,430
The Fourth Prince has arrived.

305
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,600
Greetings, Father.

306
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,310
Beiyue.

307
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:51,480
That old traitor Ouyang Yibo
has been executed.

308
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,910
The military power has been returned to you.

309
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,960
As for your brother,

310
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,030
Ouyang Yibo confessed
to everything before his execution.

311
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,480
It was all his doing.

312
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,430
Your brother knew nothing.

313
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,390
What do you think?

314
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,640
Father, no need to worry.

315
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,670
As long as Ouyang Yibo has been punished,

316
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:14,600
justice has been served for the kingdom.

317
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,270
My brother and I
are blood brothers after all.

318
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,190
He would never harm me.

319
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,680
Well.

320
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,430
I understand this.

321
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,390
I'm relieved that you can

322
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,280
consider the bond of brotherhood

323
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,970
and forgive your brother this time.

324
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,480
Father.

325
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,910
I now face a difficult matter

326
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,120
and seek your guidance.

327
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,800
What is it?

328
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,670
Ziqing has been kidnapped
by Xiling's Prince Xiang, Chu Tiange.

329
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,390
Have you heard about this, Father?

330
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,240
I've heard about it.

331
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,720
Chu Tiange is too outrageous!

332
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,760
He must resent the Fourth Princess
for defeating Chu Feiyan,

333
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,270
which caused Xiling to lose face.

334
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,240
That's why he did something so despicable.

335
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:08,880
Tieyan's surprise attack

336
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,150
was also a trap set by Chu Tiange

337
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,600
and Ouyang Yibo.

338
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,120
Chu Tiange dares
to humiliate Tianque like this.

339
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,670
I can't

340
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,310
stand it.

341
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,600
You're right.

342
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,910
We, Tianque,

343
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:31,390
cannot tolerate this.

344
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,070
Father, I ask for your permission

345
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,900
to lead the troops and punish Chu Tiange.

346
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,360
Very well. Do you need me
to send reinforcements?

347
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,720
My Tiger Army will be enough.

348
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,570
But I have one request, Father.

349
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,030
Could I take my brother

350
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,530
with me on this campaign?

351
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,720
Your brother?

352
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,140
Though he's stayed
in the royal city for a long time,

353
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,140
he's always had a heart
for serving the country.

354
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,820
This campaign would be

355
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,940
a good opportunity to train him.

356
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,020
When brothers work together,
they can accomplish anything.

357
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,060
I approve.

358
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,500
Thank you,

359
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,620
Father.

360
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,020
Goodbye, Your Highness.

361
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,980
You're awake.

362
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,140
It's you.

363
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,220
You remember me.

364
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,580
Why am I here?

365
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,100
I saved you.

366
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,940
Saved me?

367
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,950
Why did you save me?

368
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,180
For a musician,

369
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,060
the hardest to find

370
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,260
is a kindred spirit.

371
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,100
Your talent.

372
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,620
I witnessed it myself.

373
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,580
So I want you

374
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,260
to stay and learn from me.

375
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,220
I won't learn it from you.

376
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,060
I want to go back.

377
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,740
It's just a temporary retreat from the world.

378
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,140
From what I see, the troubles at your home

379
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,460
aren't really worth clinging to.

380
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,970
And your injuries

381
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,580
need time to heal.

382
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,300
Since I've chosen you,

383
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,060
I won't change my mind.

384
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,700
So you'll learn,

385
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,860
whether

386
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,660
you want to

387
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,910
or not.

388
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,820
It's not up to you.

389
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,980
Your playing can even influence the mind.

390
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,860
Fourth Princess, don't worry.

391
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,980
With your talent,

392
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,260
you won't be controlled.

393
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,920
Do you wanna imprison me?

394
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,260
I only want to teach you about guqin.

395
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,580
I've said I won't learn it.

396
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,900
How about this?

397
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,260
A month.

398
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,660
In one month,

399
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,240
I'll teach you

400
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,000
everything I know.

401
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,290
Are you okay?

402
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,820
I'm fine.

403
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,880
Listen carefully.

404
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,460
(This melody sounds)

405
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,780
(like the one I heard
before I fell into the cave)

406
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,730
(and passed out.)

407
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,500
Mother, what is this melody?

408
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,580
You'll know when you're older.

409
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,420
(Han Ziqing's mother used to play this.)

410
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,380
(How strange.)

411
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,620
(Why did I hear the same melody)

412
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,200
(when I fell?)

413
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,860
So?

414
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,740
Do you like it?

415
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,420
Come on.

416
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,660
I'll teach you.

417
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,780
To be honest,

418
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,540
I'm dying.

419
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,100
Before I die,

420
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,020
I want to pass on my skills

421
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,180
to someone worthy.

422
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,300
Han Ziqing.

423
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
You must understand.

424
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,060
I have no choice.

425
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,020
Do you know why I gave you Wuzheng?

426
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,900
Why?

427
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,140
Because that guqin

428
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,620
can only be played by you.

429
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:47,900
What do you mean?

430
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,700
Sit down.

431
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,540
Come on.

432
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,620
I'll show you some skills.

433
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,700
I'll play.

434
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,180
You listen.

435
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,500
(This melody.)

436
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,980
(Is it the key to my return?)

437
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,420
Mr. Lige.

438
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:39,940
How about this?

439
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,940
I'll learn from you,

440
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,460
but you must agree to one condition.

441
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,260
For every song I learn,

442
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,460
you have to answer one of my questions.

443
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,300
Alright.

444
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,900
I agree.

445
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,820
Good.

446
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,500
Now,

447
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,820
learn this technique first.

448
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,740
For every song you play later,

449
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,180
I want you to use this technique.

450
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,220
Show me first.

451
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,700
Let me play, and you listen.

452
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,780
What is this?

453
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,180
Sound Strike.

454
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,100
Sound Strike?

455
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,460
Killing with sound.

456
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,660
You're very talented.

457
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,500
Want to try it?

458
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,420
Give it a try.

459
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,820
Don't rush.

460
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,140
Try a few more times.

461
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,260
I told you you were highly gifted.

462
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,180
Once you've mastered Sound Strike,

463
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,420
you won't even need a guqin.

464
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,940
What's the difference
between it and Wind Strike?

465
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,820
Are you talking about the Wind Strike
that Jun Beiyue uses?

466
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,020
To the untrained,

467
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,540
they might seem the same.

468
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,620
But Sound Strike comes
from the sound of the strings.

469
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,780
It harms not only the body

470
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,460
but also the mind.

471
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,700
Practice more, and you'll understand.

472
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,300
Yiqing Palace said

473
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,100
the Second Prince accepted the order

474
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,420
and was ready to follow you.

475
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,900
He's learned to behave.

476
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,340
Keep an eye on him.

477
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,740
Yes. I'll make sure to follow him closely

478
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,140
and ensure his moves

479
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,380
are under our control.

480
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,820
Could it be that you've suspected
the Second Prince,

481
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,460
and that's why you've acted this way?

482
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,660
Issue my order.

483
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,060
The Tiger Army will fully mobilize.

484
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,060
We won't return

485
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,360
until we capture Chu Tiange.

486
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

487
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,540
Mother, now,

488
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,980
you should avoid coming here

489
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,700
lest Father gets suspicious.

490
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,220
I'm just worried about you.

491
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,820
I fear that Beiyue will
make things difficult for you.

492
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,660
Uncle has lost his life.

493
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,300
All the members of the Ouyang family,

494
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,660
except for you and Jingqin,

495
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,500
are gone.

496
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,380
What I've suffered is nothing.

497
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,220
But don't worry, Mother.

498
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,950
I'll definitely avenge this.

499
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,810
But, Beichen,

500
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,360
you must take more men with you.

501
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,510
Don't worry, Mother.

502
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,340
I've spent all my time in the palace.

503
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,680
It's been difficult to act freely.

504
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,340
This is an opportunity.

505
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,180
By the way, Mother,

506
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,500
have you asked Nanzhao about Han Ziqing

507
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,340
surviving the poison?

508
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,800
I wrote to them a long time ago.

509
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,820
In Nanzhao,

510
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,620
they're alert to the idea
of being immune to poisons.

511
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,860
They will investigate it for us.

512
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,620
Plus, your aunt has her plans.

513
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,580
All we need to do

514
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,860
is wait patiently.

515
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,700
Mother.

516
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,060
Though there have long been rumors

517
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,340
about the Isolated Island,

518
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,380
this matter is too strange.

519
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,040
Are the rumors true?

520
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,260
It doesn't matter.

521
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,420
As long as the King of Nanzhao
wants to eradicate

522
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,540
those immune to all poisons,

523
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,620
we can benefit from it.

524
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,760
Mother, you're right.

525
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,940
Once it's confirmed that Han Ziqing

526
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,460
is immune to all poisons,

527
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,580
there will be quite a show.

528
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,940
Indeed.

529
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,220
We can't deal with Beiyue,

530
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,740
but surely the King of Nanzhao can.

531
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,140
You truly are gifted.

532
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,620
I'm very pleased.

533
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,260
My mother

534
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,420
used to play this song.

535
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:36,940
I know.

536
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,020
How do you know?

537
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,100
Your mother was my master.

538
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,260
Is that true?

539
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,940
When you played just now,

540
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,580
you looked like your mom.

541
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,620
What else do you know?

542
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,500
You promised me.

543
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,060
For every song I learn,

544
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,820
you'd answer one question.

545
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,300
Once you've mastered all ten volumes,

546
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,940
you'll know everything.

547
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,620
Humph.

548
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,780
Jun Beiyue believes

549
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,540
Han Ziqing is in Chu Tiange's hands.

550
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,940
In a fit of rage, he has

551
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,300
already declared war on Xiling.

552
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,300
He even personally named me to go with him.

553
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,940
How do you think Jun Beiyue

554
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,060
will deal with me?

555
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,140
Fortunately, I was prepared.

556
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,380
With Han Ziqing in my hands,

557
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,940
why should I fear Jun Beiyue?

558
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,180
Your mission is complete.

559
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,460
Hand Han Ziqing over to me.

560
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,300
I'm taking her.

561
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,900
Didn't you bring her down?

562
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,420
I can't give her to you now.

563
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,980
What do you mean?

564
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,020
We had a deal.

565
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,580
Are you getting attached to her?

566
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,420
So you want to quit?

567
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,100
Helping you ascend as Crown Prince

568
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,140
is not a problem.

569
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,980
But Han Ziqing is now my bargaining chip,

570
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,900
not yours.

571
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,420
Your bargaining chip?

572
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,460
Your Highness, our army is ready.

573
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,780
We await your orders.

574
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,820
Got it.

575
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,980
Who exactly are you?

576
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,860
My surname is Xuanyuan.

577
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,500
Xuanyuan?

578
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,420
You're the Crown Prince of Dongling?

579
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,060
So you've been deceiving me all along.

580
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,940
If you're the Crown Prince,

581
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,220
then our cooperation...

582
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,580
We can still work together.

583
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,500
But

584
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,300
how we cooperate

585
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,860
is up to me.

586
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,700
You...

587
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,940
What are you planning to do with Han Ziqing?

588
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,980
That's my business.

589
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,940
Your Highness,

590
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,700
it's best if you return now.

591
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,060
Your Highness,

592
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,380
Lige is Dongling's Crown Prince.

593
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,300
Her Highness is in his hands.

594
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,140
It's not good.

595
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,620
Should we attack now?

596
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,000
For now, she should be safe.

597
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,300
Did you

598
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,540
know his identity all along?

599
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,300
Issue my orders.

600
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,700
Mobilize 20,000 troops

601
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,540
to attack Xiling.

602
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,060
Let Jun Beichen lead.

603
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,820
Yes.

604
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,540
I gave you Wuzheng

605
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,980
because Wuzheng and Xuezheng

606
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,060
originally belonged to your mother.

607
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,220
I was returning them to their owner.

608
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,100
Besides that,

609
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,780
there's one more thing

610
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
I want to tell you.

611
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,700
What is it?

612
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,140
Your constitution is special.

613
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,300
Are you aware of that?

614
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,780
What do you mean?

615
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,540
Do you know

616
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,860
that you're poisoned with Moxun?

617
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,740
Moxun Poison.

618
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,180
I discovered it in your body

619
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,220
the night I saved you.

620
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,340
It's quite unique.

621
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,420
The victims

622
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,540
have no cure

623
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,740
and are certain to die within four hours.

624
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,340
Someone poisoned you.

625
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,780
(That's what happened.)

626
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,180
(It couldn't have been Han Xi'er.)

627
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,140
(Her goal was to be the Princess.)

628
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
(It's Jun Beichen.)

629
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,020
(He's truly vicious.)

630
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,740
(I must catch him.)

631
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,620
I've always been weak.

632
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,460
I've searched everywhere for good physicians.

633
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,820
I accidentally learned about this poison,

634
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,460
but I never expected to find it in you.

635
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,540
The strange thing is

636
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,380
despite being poisoned,

637
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,340
you're still alive and well.

638
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,460
The only explanation is

639
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,900
you're immune to all poisons.

640
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,300
So what if I'm immune

641
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,020
to all poisons?

642
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,460
Immunity to all poisons

643
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,220
is a unique trait of the Islanders.

644
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,780
The Islanders?

645
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,780
What are you talking about?

646
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,660
Stop being mysterious.

647
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,460
What's going on?

648
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,300
Explain everything.

649
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,660
The Isolated Island

650
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,060
is a tranquil island in the South Sea.

651
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,460
The Islanders

652
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,060
have always been reclusive,

653
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,620
rarely interacting with the continent.

654
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,020
But twenty years ago,

655
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,460
the reclusive Islanders

656
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,900
suddenly became puppets somehow.

657
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,060
They went on a rampage in Nanzhao Royal City,

658
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,020
killing countless people.

659
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,020
They were indestructible.

660
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,660
The Nanzhao royal family

661
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,780
had to mobilize all their forces

662
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,420
to drive them back to the Island.

663
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,180
Since then,

664
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,540
the Islanders have become a source of fear

665
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,820
on Longyuan Continent,

666
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,100
a presence as ghostly as a specter.

667
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,060
Are you saying

668
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,180
that these Islanders
were living peacefully on the island

669
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,940
and one day suddenly became puppets

670
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,900
to kill people?

671
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,700
Exactly.

672
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,260
That's too strange.

673
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,820
I also

674
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,460
find it very strange.

675
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,220
How are the Islanders now?

676
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
No idea.

677
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,100
After that,

678
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,940
the island mysteriously
disappeared overnight.

679
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,220
Could such a large island

680
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,660
disappear just like that?

681
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,140
What happened?

682
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,580
Nobody knows.

683
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,660
Over the years,

684
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,580
King of Nanzhao has sent people

685
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,940
to search for the Islanders,

686
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,300
but they've returned empty-handed.

687
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,740
However, it's heard

688
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,020
that they haven't given up.

689
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,260
If they find you,

690
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,540
it'll be very serious.

691
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,020
Don't worry.

692
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,980
It's safe to practice the guqin here.

693
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,860
What else do you know?

694
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Practice one more piece.

695
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:47,020
I'll tell you another secret.

696
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,100
Your Majesty.

697
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:01,980
Your Majesty.

698
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,320
Your Majesty, there's news.

699
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,980
- There's news.
- Hurry!

700
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,100
Your Majesty, there's news.

701
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,780
The Fourth Prince has sent the Second Prince

702
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,020
to attack Xiling.

703
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,860
Unexpectedly,

704
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,660
the Second Prince

705
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,340
was defeated

706
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,540
and has retreated twenty miles

707
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,460
outside Xiling.

708
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,940
This is bad.

709
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,820
This is terrible.

710
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,860
If Tianque is defeated,

711
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,860
will Xiling take the opportunity

712
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,700
to attack our royal city?

713
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,540
Shut up.

714
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:36,940
What is

715
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,660
Beiyue doing?

716
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,540
You're

717
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,500
immune to all poisons.

718
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,300
Immunity to all poisons

719
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,780
is a unique trait of the Islanders.

720
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,940
The Islanders have become a source of fear

721
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,220
on Longyuan Continent,

722
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,020
a presence as ghostly as a specter.

723
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,780
King of Nanzhao has sent people

724
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,820
to search for them.

725
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
If they find you,

726
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,620
it'll be very serious.

727
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,780
Mother,

728
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,580
why do you always play this song?

729
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
Because

730
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,500
it can take us home.

731
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,940
Isn't our home here?

732
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,620
I can't give you much.

733
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,900
I only hope

734
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,020
you grow up safely and healthily.

735
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,620
But you must remember.

736
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,500
Never reveal this mask.

737
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,340
Never let others

738
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,220
see your true face.

739
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:23,860
(So, I am truly an Islander.)

740
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,740
(Why does the dagger have this pattern too?)

741
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,220
(What connection does it)

742
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,220
(have with the Islanders?)
