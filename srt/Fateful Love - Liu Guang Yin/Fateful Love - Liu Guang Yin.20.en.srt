00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,410
They also came to join in the fun.

22
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,290
By the way, give the order.

23
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,080
Our Xiling's horse team

24
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,860
are all fine horses.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,160
Ask them to take good care of the horses

26
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,680
and feed them the finest fodder.

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,050
Don't neglect our horses.

28
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,310
Chu Feiyan

29
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,500
is indeed as arrogant as the rumors say.

30
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,910
Let me remind you.

31
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,100
On this mission to Nanzhao,

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,540
you should restrain yourself.

33
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,900
Don't act recklessly.

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,340
Otherwise, you will drag Dongling down.

35
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,820
Talking about causing trouble,

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,460
I think you're much better at it than I am.

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,460
I wonder if Han Ziqing
will come along this time.

38
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,110
She and Jun Beiyue
are a harmonious couple.

39
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,670
I suppose she will come along.

40
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,510
So?

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,620
So,

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
Brother,

43
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,290
as the saying goes,
beauty brings disaster.

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,100
I advise you not to get involved
in their affairs.

45
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,060
Last time Chu Feiyan

46
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,180
suffered a big loss in Tianque.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,320
I suppose she will

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,730
seek revenge for that on Han Ziqing.

49
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,900
Let's just watch the show.

50
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,100
(Nanzhao Envoy Courtyard)
This is the place for the Fourth Prince.

51
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,430
This is the bedroom.

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,710
This is the garden.

53
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,030
Fourth Prince,
you have had a hard journey.

54
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,470
Rest here for a while.

55
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,620
I will take my leave now.

56
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,070
Thank you.

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,570
This way, please.

58
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Situ Haonan.

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,760
Situ Haonan.

60
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,720
Stop right there.

61
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
Don't run if you have guts.

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,820
Situ Haonan, stop right there.

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,910
Tell me, why do you run when you see me?

64
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,390
Do you think I will cut you?

65
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,000
Cut me? With what?

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,110
- Machete, hatchet,
- Cut...

67
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,950
or bone cleaver?

68
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,240
Cut means to eat.

69
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,110
What would I do with a knife?

70
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,030
Where is this girl from?

71
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,000
- Her dialect is so interesting.
- Didn't you say you would cut me?

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,390
Do you think you're that delicious?

73
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,850
I won't cut you.

74
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,560
- I just want to ask you.
- She is the Princess of Tieyan.

75
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,990
- Why are you hiding from me?
- Nangong Qianqian.

76
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,900
I can't afford to offend you.

77
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,990
But I can still hide from you, can't I?

78
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,130
Can you let me go?

79
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
King of Tieyan.

80
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,240
Situ Haonan.

81
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,520
Stop right there.

82
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,370
Don't run.

83
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,880
Master, look quickly.

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,760
Nanzhao prepared it for you specially.

85
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,230
Please go to bathe
and change your clothes.

86
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,480
Why change clothes?

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,540
It's not a beauty contest.

88
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,260
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

89
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,650
Freshen up and dress up a bit.

90
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,030
Put it on.

91
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,760
Who are you?

92
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,270
Did Situ Haonan come with you?

93
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,350
What's your relationship?

94
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,190
Move aside.

95
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm asking you.

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,820
Why are you ignoring me?

97
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,920
Answer me.

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,210
Why aren't you answering me?

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,520
Open the door.

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,890
Open the door.

101
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,370
Open the door.

102
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,310
Qianqian.

103
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,100
Come here, have a banana.

104
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,200
Fourth Prince,

105
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,140
who is that woman?

106
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Sit down first.

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,540
I'll explain it to you slowly.

108
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,420
Princess Feiyan, please come this way.

109
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,140
Fourth Prince,

110
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,580
who is that woman?

111
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,780
Why is she with you?

112
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,380
She is your sister-in-law.

113
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,740
Sister-in-law?

114
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,460
She is my princess.

115
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,310
Are you still worried
she'll steal Haonan from you?

116
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:36,980
Eat quickly.

117
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,170
After you finish, I'll take you to find him.

118
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,300
Thank you, Fourth Prince.

119
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,420
Master.

120
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,930
With the outfit,

121
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,180
you are simply the most beautiful woman
in Nanzhao.

122
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,830
You look much prettier
than those princesses downstairs.

123
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,900
Well...

124
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,700
Where is Beiyue?

125
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,380
I don't know.

126
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,440
He's probably wandering around.

127
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,940
Wandering around?

128
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,540
You dare let him wander around?

129
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,780
Aren't you afraid
he'll run into Chu Feiyan

130
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,220
and get dragged into a dark room?

131
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,660
You should worry more about yourself.

132
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,900
That girl chasing you just now.

133
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,740
Beiyue said

134
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,620
she is Nangong Qianqian,
the Princess of Tieyan.

135
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,660
Yes.

136
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,340
We are not

137
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,620
the kind of relationship you think.

138
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,020
Your romantic history
has nothing to do with me.

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,540
What do you mean by romantic history?

140
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,980
It's all a misunderstanding between us.

141
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,980
She was the one chasing after me.

142
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,620
What does it have to do with me?

143
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
What does it have to do with me?

144
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,460
You're truly a cold-hearted woman.

145
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,740
I don't know what Beiyue sees in you.

146
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,500
I go to find Beiyue.

147
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,140
Is it done?

148
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,860
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

149
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,900
Everything has been arranged.

150
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,460
Make sure there are no mistakes.

151
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,460
I have made thorough arrangements.

152
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,980
At that time, the divine beings
will surely point to Fog Valley.

153
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,860
There will be no mistakes.

154
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,780
Fog Valley is an excellent choice.

155
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,100
There are many poisonous creatures.

156
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,420
One of them will reveal the truth.

157
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,420
Just make sure there are no mishaps.

158
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,700
Otherwise, you will be held responsible.

159
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,220
Your Highness, you jest.

160
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,900
It's the tenth ceremony.

161
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,580
It has always been guided
by the Snake Bone.

162
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,020
I have done it many times.

163
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,780
So I can make it

164
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,780
point to wherever I want.

165
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,460
That's good.

166
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,060
Thank you for your hard work.

167
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,340
Did you find out?

168
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,240
They say the direction
of the annual sacrifice

169
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,580
is always guided by divine beings.

170
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,620
No human interference is allowed.

171
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,580
Guided by the divine beings?

172
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,140
How do they guide?

173
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,540
I still need to ask Shadow

174
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,460
to go and find out more.

175
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,740
There are no divine beings.

176
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,460
They're just playing tricks.

177
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,580
By the way,

178
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,980
where

179
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,820
is Ice Pool?

180
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,180
(Ice Pool)
Get across Nanzhao's central border,

181
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,860
and we'll find it in the southwest.

182
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,980
How do we get there?

183
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,340
Ever since we came to Nanzhao,

184
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,420
our every move has been monitored.

185
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,700
It's impossible to act privately.

186
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,220
Then we need to find a way

187
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,300
to go there openly.

188
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,140
Openly?

189
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,740
These sacrificial places in Nanzhao

190
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,540
are nothing but some sacred mountains
and temples.

191
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,980
For example,

192
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,620
Langya Mountain.

193
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,100
(Ice Pool)
Langya Mountain

194
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,220
is in the southwest of Ice Pool.

195
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,900
If the sacrificial site

196
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,100
can be set at Langya Mountain,

197
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,500
we

198
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,220
could go there openly.

199
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,100
Your Highness, the King of Nanzhao
wants to meet you.

200
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,780
Alright, wait for me a moment.

201
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,500
You should rest early.

202
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,720
(Since that's the case,)

203
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,860
(let the divine beings)

204
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,870
(guide us to the path we should take.)

205
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,250
Your Highness.

206
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,820
You've arrived.

207
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,740
I didn't expect you to come too.

208
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,860
Am I not allowed to come?

209
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,280
The Crown Prince of Dongling

210
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,740
is on a diplomatic mission to Nanzhao.

211
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,580
It's rightful.

212
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,140
Recently,

213
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,500
how have you
practiced your guqin skills?

214
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,260
I've finished the seven volumes.

215
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,500
Very good,

216
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,700
but...

217
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,900
I've tried my hard.

218
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,020
Keep up the good work.

219
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,060
Alright.

220
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,060
You should rest early.

221
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,460
What's wrong?

222
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,380
Weren't you just having
a lively conversation with my brother?

223
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,500
Why do you fall silent

224
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,420
when you see me?

225
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,580
If Jun Beiyue saw this scene,

226
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,100
what do you think he would do?

227
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,500
If it were me,

228
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,620
I wouldn't be able to tolerate it.

229
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,460
Zhaoxi,

230
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,740
I warn you.

231
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,140
If you speak disrespectfully
to Han Ziqing again,

232
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,100
don't blame me for sending you back
to Dongling immediately.

233
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,940
What gives you the right?

234
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,700
Like you, I am an envoy sent

235
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,780
by our mother to Nanzhao.

236
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,740
You don't have the right.

237
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,620
I do.

238
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,460
But you were just with Han Ziqing...

239
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,300
Enough.

240
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,860
If you say one more word,

241
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,940
I'll send you back
to Dongling immediately.

242
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,140
Xuanyuan Lige!

243
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,260
The Earth King of Lingshan Temple

244
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,100
is the only deity worshiped in Nanzhao.

245
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,980
It is said that the Nanzhao Royal Family

246
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,220
are descendants of the Earth King.

247
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,180
We have checked all historical records
before coming here.

248
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,140
No need for you to show off
your knowledge.

249
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,830
I'm just worried you might not know.

250
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,180
Why do you two start arguing

251
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,240
the moment you see each other?

252
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,140
Han Ziqing,

253
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,220
I've known who you are.

254
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,780
Why did Situ Haonan come to Nanzhao
with you?

255
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,460
He's right over there.

256
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,980
You can ask him yourself later.

257
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,740
He ignores me.

258
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,860
I just want to ask you.

259
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,740
Please tell me.

260
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,380
I'm just asking you a question.

261
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,700
Hurry up and tell me.

262
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,340
Do not push me
on such an important occasion.

263
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,300
I don't understand what they are saying.

264
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Tell me.

265
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,780
Answer me quickly.

266
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,100
Princess,

267
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,500
we are not friends.

268
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,220
If you keep pestering me,

269
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,540
I won't be polite to you.

270
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,400
If you don't answer me,
you must have an ulterior motive.

271
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,180
Why did you push me?

272
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,340
I didn't do it on purpose.

273
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,540
Why are you so angry?

274
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,500
Do you believe
that I won't lend you Tieyan's path

275
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,780
to return to Xiling?

276
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,460
You still dare to threaten me?

277
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,300
Stop!

278
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,300
Guards!

279
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,980
- Here.
- Send them out of the territory.

280
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,820
Yes.

281
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,820
King of Nanzhao,

282
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,780
I was sincerely paying my respects.

283
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,420
It was Nangong Qianqian

284
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,580
who pushed me to the ground.

285
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,740
Now I am covered in dust.

286
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,780
Your Majesty,

287
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,060
please allow me to go back to bathe
and change my clothes.

288
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,220
Guards,

289
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,380
escort Princess Feiyan to bathe
and change her clothes.

290
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,230
Yes.

291
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

292
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,100
Princess Nangong disregarded the rules,

293
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,260
disrupted the order,

294
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,360
and should be expelled from the venue.

295
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,140
Indeed,

296
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,260
her crime is unforgivable.

297
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,540
King of Nanzhao,

298
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,940
I am not very familiar
with the etiquette and rules.

299
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,780
I wanted
to ask the Fourth Princess,

300
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,000
but I lost my balance for a moment,

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,620
and accidentally bumped into
Princess of Xiling.

302
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,860
I didn't do it on purpose.

303
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,620
If you don't believe me,

304
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,660
you can ask them.

305
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,820
I didn't see anything.

306
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,540
Guards,

307
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,420
escort the Princess out.

308
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,260
Yes.

309
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,340
Wait.

310
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,780
King of Nanzhao,

311
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
please wait a moment.

312
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,580
It's true that just now Princess Qianqian

313
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,820
did not understand the etiquette

314
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,660
and came to ask me.

315
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,140
She accidentally bumped into
Princess of Xiling.

316
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,220
It was not intentional.

317
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,900
Please retract your order, Your Majesty.

318
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,260
Fourth Princess,

319
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,100
do you intend to take over the situation
on my behalf?

320
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,060
I dare not.

321
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,180
I just don't want anyone to be wronged.

322
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,940
Moreover,

323
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,340
just now you dealt with

324
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,660
Princess Feiyan leniently.

325
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,620
You are quite imposing,

326
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,460
daring to give orders
on Nanzhao's territory.

327
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,660
Ziqing,

328
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,380
don't be disrespectful.

329
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,620
When the King of Nanzhao is speaking,

330
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,700
how can you interrupt?

331
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:45,980
Your Majesty,

332
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,980
I apologize

333
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
on behalf of my princess.

334
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,380
Fourth Prince,

335
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,220
for your sake,

336
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,740
I won't hold it
against the Fourth Princess.

337
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,180
But please restrain her.

338
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,420
All esteemed guests,
please rest here for a while.

339
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,660
We will seek divine guidance later.

340
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,900
How could Ziqing
speak for Nangong Qianqian?

341
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,140
You really meddle in a lot of things.

342
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,660
What if she clings to us in the future?

343
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,060
Han Ziqing,

344
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,780
thank you for helping me just now.

345
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,020
Otherwise, if I were thrown out,

346
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,780
it would be a disgrace to all of Tieyan.

347
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,380
Not thrown out,

348
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,260
but driven out.

349
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,300
You don't need to thank me.

350
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,580
It was my mistake just now.

351
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
I was the one

352
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,700
courting death first.

353
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,940
A real man takes responsibility
for his actions.

354
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,700
It's not courting death,

355
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,660
but looking for trouble.

356
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,020
Where is Situ Haonan?

357
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,740
He ran away again.

358
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
If you chase him so fiercely,

359
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,620
of course he will run.

360
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,660
I'm telling you,

361
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,540
he owes me,

362
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,100
and he won't be able to repay it
in this lifetime.

363
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,940
Fear is useless.

364
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,980
Han Ziqing,

365
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,860
let's date.

366
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,540
What do you mean by that?

367
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,780
I believe you are a good person.

368
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,980
So I'm willing to be friends with you.

369
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Most people really can't understand

370
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,660
your language logic.

371
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,180
What language logic?

372
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,820
Don't think
that because Jun Beiyue protects you,

373
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,100
you can do whatever you want.

374
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,780
This is Nanzhao,

375
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,940
not your Tianque.

376
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,340
No need for you to remind me,
Princess Feiyan.

377
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,180
I know where this is.

378
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,580
Exactly.

379
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,620
What does it have to do with you?

380
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,940
Let me tell you.

381
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,900
Han Ziqing is my friend now.

382
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,990
You are not allowed to bully her.

383
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,860
Can you do well

384
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,900
at seeking divine guidance?

385
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,620
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

386
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,900
The Leader of Medicine Tribe

387
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,740
is always reliable.

388
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,220
You must be careful.

389
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,620
Especially be wary of Jun Beiyue.

390
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,620
Do not let him notice anything.

391
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,340
My plan is flawless.

392
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
You just wait and see the result.

393
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,140
What is this thing?

394
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,700
Isn't this just a snake?

395
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,260
What divine beings are they seeking?

396
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,540
What guidance are they asking about?

397
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,180
The so-called seeking divine guidance

398
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,740
is to pray for divine beings' guidance

399
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,020
to find a river, a lake

400
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,100
or sea area of pure water.

401
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,740
Because pure water appears

402
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,980
in different places every year.

403
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,860
So they need to ask the divine beings.

404
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,260
How do they ask?

405
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,280
The High Priest will place the Snake Bone,

406
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,500
the heirloom of the Earth King Temple,

407
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,580
on the Great Stone Plate.

408
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
The Great Stone Plate

409
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,940
is inscribed with maps of all regions
in Nanzhao.

410
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,580
Wherever the Snake Bone moves to,

411
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,860
that place is the location indicated
by the divine beings.

412
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,380
(Langya Mountain)

413
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,860
- Langya Mountain.
- Langya Mountain?

414
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,300
- Langya Mountain?
- Where is Langya Mountain?

415
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,780
- Langya Mountain.
- Langya Mountain? Where is it?

416
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,180
Divine beings have shown the way.

417
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,700
This year's source of pure water

418
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,900
is at Langya Mountain.

419
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,180
I didn't expect it to be
at Langya Mountain.

420
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,820
In previous rituals,

421
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,340
it has never appeared.

422
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,300
Since it is the will of the divine beings,

423
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,020
it must be followed.

424
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,860
The will of the divine beings

425
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,820
needs no further explanation.

426
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,460
This year's source of pure water

427
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,380
is at Langya Mountain's Langya Lake.

428
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,540
Choose a date

429
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,820
and let's all go together.

430
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,490
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

431
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,820
What's going on?

432
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,420
How would it be?

433
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,260
How dare you!

434
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,100
How did you promise me?

435
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Your Majesty,

436
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,460
I was directing the Snake Bone
towards Fog Valley.

437
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,860
But I don't know why it went wrong.

438
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,980
This time, the Snake Bone
just wouldn't obey.

439
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,140
I didn't expect it to be like this either.

440
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,780
The traps to test Han Ziqing
were all set in Fog Valley.

441
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,740
Now we can't go there.

442
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,060
What should we do?

443
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,340
Your Majesty, please calm down.

444
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,580
I do have an idea.

445
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,940
What idea do you have?

446
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,060
Stand up and speak.

447
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

448
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,220
Your Majesty,

449
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,540
although we planned

450
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,460
to lure Han Ziqing to Fog Valley,

451
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,620
now the plan has changed.

452
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,740
We can't go to Fog Valley anymore.

453
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,260
However, on the way to Langya Mountain,

454
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,420
we have to pass by Lingshui River.

455
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,020
It's the same.

456
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,940
Consort Qin is absolutely right.

457
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,620
Even though we can't go to Fog Valley,

458
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,300
the water in Lingshui River
is also poisonous.

459
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,580
If an ordinary person touches it,

460
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,860
within an hour,

461
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,220
he will die.

462
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,260
It's an excellent testing ground.

463
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,700
So, in that case,

464
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,100
we need to take a boat.

465
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,700
It's even better if we were on a boat.

466
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,180
If that woman's identity is confirmed,

467
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,580
even if Jun Beiyue tries to protect her
with his life,

468
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,660
they won't be able to escape.

469
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,420
It was a close call today.

470
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,780
If I hadn't prepared a larger magnet,

471
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,220
I almost couldn't compete
with the Leader.

472
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,740
How will the sacrificial site end up

473
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,460
being set at Langya Mountain?

474
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,980
You can think about

475
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,180
the direction the Snake Bone leads.

476
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,060
The Snake Bone leads the way...

477
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,140
- Ten.
- Yes.

478
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,300
Prepare a few magnets.

479
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,360
Master, how big do you need them?

480
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
Half the size of a palm.

481
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,220
Yes.

482
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,340
Prepare a few more.

483
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,020
Your Highness.

484
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,020
Come in.

485
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,860
Your Highness.

486
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,860
Mr. Chang Ming has reported.

487
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,450
He said we will go to Langya Mountain
tomorrow.

488
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:12,700
We will take the water route instead.

489
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,020
I have checked the map before.

490
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,820
It shows all the mountain paths.

491
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Where is the water route?

492
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,220
If I'm not mistaken,

493
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,580
they will take a detour

494
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,780
(Lingshui River)
to get across Lingshui River.

495
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,060
But the King of Nanzhao

496
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,500
suddenly changed route
to Lingshui River.

497
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,300
Why?

498
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,300
Stop hiding.

499
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,500
Come out, Weisheng.

500
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,060
You

501
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,460
haven't come back for days.

502
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,680
Where have you been wandering off to?

503
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,700
I missed you.

504
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,980
So I came back to see you.

505
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,940
I just went out for a while.

506
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,740
When I first found you,

507
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,620
you were this small.

508
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,620
When you grew up,

509
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,700
you never liked studying medicine.

510
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,700
You insisted on treating mules
and horses.

511
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,860
So I sent you to the Beast Tribe
to learn veterinary medicine.

512
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,740
But what happened?

513
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,860
You still slacked off.

514
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,460
You said you wanted
to catch the Islanders for bounty.

515
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,060
Did you catch any?

516
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,660
The Islanders are not weeds.

517
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
They're not that easy to catch.

518
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,380
Every time I come back to see you,

519
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,500
you nag.

520
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,660
If you keep this up, I won't come back.

521
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,380
Who cares about you?

522
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,460
I'm just trying

523
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,700
to make sure you have a good life.

524
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,860
That's why I became a bounty hunter.

525
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,900
I think you're just seeking revenge.

526
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,380
I don't want money.

527
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,220
I just want you to be safe.

528
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,780
You should know,

529
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,900
if your true identity is discovered,

530
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,740
then...

531
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,540
Then what?

532
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,500
I only know that when I found you,

533
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,500
you were glowing with golden light.

534
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,580
It was clear
you weren't an ordinary child.

535
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,780
Until I read all the books
in the Archive Pavilion,

536
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,940
I found out that you

537
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,060
belong to Golden Merfolk, an extinct race.

538
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,660
You've said it before.

539
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,700
I just want to know
why my race was exterminated.

540
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,580
I only heard that the Islanders

541
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,260
killed all the Golden Merfolk

542
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,540
and used the red-gold scales
from their chests

543
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,900
to forge a powerful dagger.

544
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,460
Where is that dagger?

545
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,900
I've never seen it.

546
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,340
And in all the books
in the Archive Pavilion,

547
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,260
there is no record

548
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,660
of this event.

549
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,820
Isn't that Weisheng?

550
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,500
Haven't seen you for days.

551
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:20,460
Today you came to your master

552
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,620
to freeload again?

553
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,220
When have I ever freeloaded
from my master?

554
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,140
Who still owes money?

555
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,340
You...

556
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,660
You rascal

557
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,700
show no respect for elders.

558
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,420
Where are your manners?

559
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,860
Alright, alright.

560
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,100
Weisheng.

561
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,220
Master Jin

562
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,860
is an elder.

563
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,660
Don't talk back.

564
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,220
Master Jin.

565
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,100
Don't mind him.

566
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,140
Have you returned 100 taels of silver

567
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,190
- from last year?
- You...

568
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,660
Money is external.

569
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,780
Don't spoil him.

570
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,620
He bullies you because you're easygoing.

571
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,060
Don't worry.

572
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,500
As long as I am alive,

573
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,980
you will definitely have good times.

574
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,820
Come on.

575
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,500
Tell me.

576
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,180
Have you encountered anything new

577
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,700
during your travels?

578
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,860
Yes, I have.

579
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,900
But in front of you,

580
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,620
they are not new at all.

581
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
I do have something to ask you.

582
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,340
What is it?

583
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,900
Have you seen the Islanders?

584
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Well, I haven't.

585
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,620
But I've heard

586
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,380
those Islander Puppets

587
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,940
all have a blue face and fangs,

588
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,740
and are extremely terrifying.

589
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,220
That doesn't seem right.

590
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,300
What are you murmuring about?

591
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,500
Nothing, nothing.

592
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,340
Nothing.

593
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,420
Alright.

594
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
You came just in time.

595
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,780
Help me pack up.

596
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,220
I'm about to go out.

597
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,260
Where are you going?

598
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,580
His Majesty is taking the noble guests

599
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,060
to Langya Mountain
to pray for blessings.

600
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,100
Medicine Valley received the order.

601
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,540
We also need to accompany them.

602
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,780
(Then Ziqing must be going too.)

603
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,260
Alright, I'll go with you.

604
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,380
Okay.

605
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,860
But I must warn you.

606
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,860
When you're in the royal team,

607
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,860
you must follow the rules.

608
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,780
When have I ever broken the rules?

609
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,460
Let's go, Master.

610
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,300
Alright.

611
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,140
Slow down, Master.

612
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,220
You finally came.

613
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,620
Is there

614
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,140
any new information this time?

615
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,580
You came here

616
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,260
just to gather intelligence?

617
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,500
Isn't it always like this?

618
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,180
Of course.

619
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,220
If you are unwilling to take more risks
to help me,

620
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,220
I won't blame you.

621
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,060
When did I say

622
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,780
I wouldn't help you?

623
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,100
I just

624
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,740
haven't seen you for a long time,

625
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,140
and wanted to talk to you more.

626
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,820
This is the Nanzhao Palace.

627
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,780
There are many eyes around.

628
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,060
If you don't have
any important information,

629
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,340
please go back first.

630
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,580
If it's the information
about Han Ziqing,

631
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,540
do you want to hear it?

632
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,420
Are you two close?

633
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,700
Why do you say that?

634
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,020
At today's celebration,

635
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,420
I saw you looking at her all the time.

636
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,980
Dongling and Tianque are at odds.

637
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,980
How could I be close to her?

638
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,140
Then I am relieved.

639
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,940
Actually, that woman's identity
is suspicious.

640
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,700
His Majesty suspects

641
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,020
that her body is immune to all poisons,

642
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,220
and that she is related
to the Isolated Island.

643
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,700
What does the King of Nanzhao
plan to do?

644
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,140
He wants to test her true identity.

645
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,380
With poison?

646
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,900
Yes.

647
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,660
How will he test her?

648
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,700
It has nothing to do with Dongling,

649
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,780
so you don't need to ask.

650
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,260
I need to know

651
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,300
anything related to Tianque.

652
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,860
Just tell me what you got.

653
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,780
I don't know more specific information,

654
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,820
but I can help you.

655
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,500
Alright.

656
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,380
Once you have more news,

657
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,820
inform me immediately.

658
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,660
You...

659
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,220
So it was Consort Qin.

660
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,260
Greetings, Consort Qin.

661
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,860
You are as beautiful as the moon,
Princess Feiyan.

662
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,800
People will forget the mundane world
upon seeing you.

663
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,260
I really don't understand.

664
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,420
Is Jun Beiyue blind?

665
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,180
Why does he only have eyes
for Han Ziqing?

666
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,460
What is Han Ziqing anyway?

667
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,580
Last time in Tianque,

668
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,460
if it weren't for Xuanyuan Lige
going easy on her,

669
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,600
how would such a concubine's daughter
have a chance to win me?

670
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,420
You are right.

671
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,380
Which man wouldn't be moved

672
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,180
when they see a beauty like you?

673
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,740
What a pity.

674
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,500
Han Ziqing got there first.

675
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,780
It's just bad luck.

676
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,340
But Princess Feiyan,
don't be discouraged.

677
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,660
There are many good men in this world,
not just Jun Beiyue.

678
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,300
Perhaps

679
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,540
this time in Nanzhao,

680
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,780
you might find a good husband.

681
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,580
I have no intention of getting married.

682
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,180
Consort Qin,
please don't worry about it.

683
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,300
Why is this woman acting so arrogantly?

684
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,540
Who does she think she is?

685
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,340
Your Majesty, please.

686
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,180
Alright.

687
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,740
Fourth Prince,

688
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,580
this way, please.

689
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,820
I'm Chang Ming, the Reception Officer.

690
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,140
Greetings to the Fourth Prince.

691
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,780
Come in.

692
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,180
Fourth Prince,

693
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,340
His Majesty invites you to play chess.

694
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,580
I wonder

695
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,500
if you can give us the honor?

696
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,260
Sure.

697
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,500
Wait for me outside for a moment.

698
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,020
Be careful.

699
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,180
Don't worry.

700
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,580
To play chess?

701
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,900
How far is it

702
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,180
to Langya Mountain?

703
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,700
About one or two days.

704
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,540
Situ Haonan.

705
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,460
Situ Haonan.

706
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,300
Are you there?

707
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,100
Ziqing, have you seen Situ Haonan?

708
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,740
I want to see

709
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,820
how long he can hide.

710
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,060
If he has the guts,
he can hide for a lifetime.

711
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,060
Move aside.

712
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,300
You scared me to death.

713
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,060
- Ouch ouch!
- Keep running.

714
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,060
Let's see where you can run to.

715
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,700
Let go, let go!

716
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,700
What are you looking at?

717
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,140
Do you still want to run?

718
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,220
Let's see where you can run to.

719
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,460
Girls should be reserved.

720
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,460
Don't you know that men and women
should not touch each other?

721
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,380
What do you mean by men and women
shouldn't touch each other?

722
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,340
But you watched me bathe.

723
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,180
Well,

724
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,420
I am a decent man.

725
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,820
What do you mean by watching you bathe?

726
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,060
I didn't do it on purpose.

727
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,820
I accidentally walked in.

728
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,990
Whether you were intentional or not,

729
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,500
you saw me anyway.

730
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,940
Princess Qianqian,

731
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,940
I beg you.

732
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,380
Please spare me.

733
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,180
I can spare you.

734
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,580
But you have to gouge out your eyes.

735
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,140
Then I'll pretend nothing happened.

736
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,260
There's a saying that goes well.

737
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,180
It says a woman dresses up
for the one she loves.

738
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,220
She remains reserved
for the one she loves.

739
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,100
She knows shame for the one she loves.

740
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,380
She cultivates herself
for the one she loves.

741
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,460
What a mess.

742
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,340
It's too long.

743
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,860
- I can't remember it.
- Don't come closer.

744
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,460
Can't remember, huh?

745
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,660
Go back and write it a hundred times.

746
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
I won't write it.

747
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,260
Hypocrite.

748
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,740
- What?
- I said you're a hypocrite.

749
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,060
You don't hate me.

750
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,180
But you always avoid me.

751
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,020
You're just a hypocrite.

752
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,420
I do hate you.

753
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,980
I do want to avoid you.

754
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,820
So what?

755
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,100
- Help!
- Stop right there.

756
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,500
Who?

757
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,580
What's wrong?

758
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,580
Be careful. It might be a trap.

759
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,340
It might be a trap?

760
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,900
What's wrong with you?

761
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,740
Don't you think he's a coward?

762
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,900
Coward?

763
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,780
Yes.

764
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,380
Situ Haonan always avoids me.

765
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,420
Such a coward. He's not a man at all.

766
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,220
Cowardly, right?

767
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,300
Yes, cowardly.

768
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,700
Boring.

769
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,900
Let me tell you.

770
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,380
I noticed Chu Feiyan

771
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,980
seems to have hard motives
towards you.

772
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,780
Ulterior motives.

773
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,340
Whenever she looks at you,

774
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,740
it's as if she wants to cut you
into pieces.

775
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,540
Could it be that she likes your husband?

776
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,620
I am a maid of Consort Qin.

777
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,580
Greetings, Fourth Princess.

778
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,820
What's the matter?

779
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,140
Consort Qin invites the esteemed guests
to the deck for tea.

780
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,820
Fourth Princess and Princess Nangong,

781
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,700
please move over there.

782
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,860
I'm not feeling well.

783
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,700
I won't go.

784
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,220
Consort Qin said

785
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,300
only female guests are invited.

786
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,820
Fourth Princess, please accept it.

787
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,060
You may leave now.

788
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,380
Go.

789
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,700
You should
accept Consort Qin's invitation.

790
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,740
Otherwise, be careful
she might make trouble for you.

791
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:06,940
Will I be afraid of her?

792
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,260
Fourth Princess, you have arrived.

793
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,300
Consort Qin.

794
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,700
The men went to drink and have fun.

795
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,820
As the host,

796
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,700
I can't just sit idle.

797
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,340
So I invite everyone

798
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,340
to come to the deck

799
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,900
to drink some tea and get some fresh air,

800
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,460
and also to enjoy the beautiful scenery
of the river.

801
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,780
The scenery is truly beautiful.

802
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,620
This place is really nice.

803
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,620
Do you all know

804
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,900
the origin of Lingshui River?

805
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,940
I heard the river water is poisonous.

806
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,060
If you accidentally fall in,

807
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
you definitely won't survive.

808
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,620
The upstream of Lingshui River

809
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,460
are where the Medicine Valley is located.

810
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,660
They discharge medicinal toxins
into the river all year round.

811
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Over time,

812
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,500
the water plants and fish in the river

813
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,420
have also become poisonous.

814
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,820
So the water flowing through here

815
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,020
is also contaminated with poison.

816
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,140
If you accidentally fall in,

817
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:08,980
it would be disastrous.

818
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,780
Be careful. There might be a trap.

819
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,100
This is strange.

820
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
If the fish are poisoned,

821
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,100
are they still alive?

822
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,780
Princess Qianqian,
if you don't believe me,

823
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,640
then look,

824
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,620
isn't that a big fish swimming

825
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,860
in the river?

826
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,940
Where is it?

827
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,780
Where?

828
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,060
Ziqing, did you see it?

829
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,140
Why didn't I see it?

830
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,500
- Your Highness!
- Ziqing!

831
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,780
- Your Highness!
- Someone, come quickly!

832
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,340
- Ziqing!
- Someone, come quickly!

833
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,060
- Someone, come quickly!
- Save our princess!

834
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,540
- Someone, Ziqing fell into the river.
- Quick, quick!

835
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,140
Someone, save her!

836
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:41,980
Quick!

837
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,140
Fourth Prince!

838
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,060
Situ Haonan!

839
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,020
Someone, come quickly!

840
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,860
Move aside!

841
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,360
- Move aside!
- Don't touch!

842
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,380
The river water is poisonous.

843
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,380
It can be fatal.

844
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,860
What should we do then?

845
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,300
We can't just leave Ziqing there.

846
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,140
But...

847
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,820
If you keep shouting,

848
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,340
- she will drown.
- Help!

849
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,060
Ziqing, are you okay?

850
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,500
Ziqing, hold on!

851
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,300
- Move aside!
- You can't go over there!

852
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,420
- Help!
- You can't go over there!

853
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,340
- Think of a way quickly.
- Help!

854
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,180
Save Ziqing.

855
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,340
Ziqing!

856
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,460
- Ziqing!
- Your Highness.

857
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,820
- Ziqing, are you alright?
- Fourth Princess.

858
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,860
Your Highness, are you alright?

859
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,340
Ziqing.

860
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,940
Go get a blanket
for Fourth Princess.

861
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,820
- Ziqing, are you okay?
- Where are the antidotes?

862
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,100
- You must have the antidotes.
- How are you?

863
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,400
- Go get it quickly.
- Who has the antidotes?

864
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,180
- Antidotes? Someone!
- Yes.

865
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,580
- Get the antidotes.
- Who has the antidotes?

866
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,020
Ziqing.

867
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,020
Your Highness, the antidotes
are on the carriage.

868
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,180
We forgot to bring them on the boat.

869
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,620
What? You didn't bring the antidotes?

870
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,540
How could you be so careless?

871
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,180
You knew we had to
get across Lingshui River today.

872
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,740
How could you forget to bring the antidotes?

873
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,820
Your Highness, please calm down.

874
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,100
I will turn back immediately to get it.

875
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:42,990
There should still be time.

876
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,160
Your Highness, it's too late.

877
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,660
Once someone
touches this poisonous water,

878
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,980
within an hour,

879
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,060
they will die.

880
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,420
Consort Qin,

881
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,380
quickly think of a way
to save Fourth Princess.

882
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,260
You fool, how could you forget

883
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,220
the important antidotes?

884
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,900
If it were me who fell into Lingshui River,

885
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,900
what would you do?

886
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,860
Someone!

887
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,340
Drag the Imperial Physician out

888
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,260
and beat him to death!

889
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,740
- Yes.
- Your Highness.

890
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,780
Your Highness, spare me.

891
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,060
Your Highness.

892
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,380
- Spare me, Your Highness.
- If anything happens to her,

893
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,200
- I will have you all buried with her.
- Spare me, Your Highness.

894
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,300
I'm so cold.

895
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,140
I feel so uncomfortable.

896
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,940
Am I going to die?

897
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,780
Don't talk if you're poisoned.

898
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,640
Be careful the poison will spread faster.

899
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,500
Shut up.

900
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,260
Your Highness, the blanket is here.

901
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,820
Fourth Princess,

902
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,860
here, the blanket.

903
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,780
Thank you.

904
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,660
