It's time.

22
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,790
Go and invite His Majesty.

23
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,690
We should set off now.

24
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:10,950
Yes.

25
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,430
Be careful.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,470
Haonan,

27
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,590
Ziqing is still on the valley floor.

28
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,430
What should we do?

29
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,780
I'll go down to find her.

30
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,340
You wait here for me.

31
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,590
Wait.

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,690
Crown Prince Lige.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,590
What happened?

34
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,430
Where is Ziqing?

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,500
Ziqing is still on the valley floor.

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,820
- The valley floor?
- Brother.

37
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,540
Why are you here?

38
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,460
Ziqing is still on the valley floor.

39
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,100
What are you doing here?

40
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,780
We just fell into the valley floor.

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,410
We encountered a swarm of scorpions.

42
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,220
Ziqing saved Qianqian.

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,040
She is still down there.

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,950
Please help take care
of Princess Nangong.

45
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,790
I need to go save her.

46
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,150
You can't go down.

47
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,040
This is Miasma Valley.

48
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,950
Every day at 3 to 5 p.m.,
poisonous miasma will arise.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,590
It is deadly if you go down there.

50
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,430
What did you say?

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,650
Poisonous miasma?

52
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,070
Look.

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,540
The poisonous miasma is already rising.

54
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,260
But just now Mr. Situ said

55
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,620
Fourth Princess is still down there.

56
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,140
What? She is still down there?

57
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,580
Oh no, she will be poisoned.

58
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,740
What should we do?

59
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,780
Brother, you can't go down.

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,300
- Let go.
- Do you want to die?

61
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,420
She is down there now.

62
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:54,900
Let go.

63
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,780
This is Nanzhao.

64
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,340
If something happens to you,

65
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,740
how will I explain to Mother?

66
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,740
It's none of your concern.

67
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,220
Let go.

68
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,940
No one is allowed to go down.

69
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,620
You are all my honored guests.

70
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,380
I am responsible for your safety.

71
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,900
(Alright.)

72
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,140
(If Ziqing's identity is exposed,)

73
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,340
(I will kill the King of Nanzhao)

74
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,860
(and all these who wish her dead.)

75
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,260
(None of them will live.)

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,820
How long has Fourth Princess
been down there?

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,540
Almost two hours.

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,420
Once the poisonous miasma in the valley
has been inhaled,

79
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,580
she is likely to be dead.

80
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,100
Doesn't that mean...

81
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,620
We have to wait for the poisonous miasma
to completely dissipate

82
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,940
before we can go down to rescue her.

83
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,780
Exactly.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,940
Otherwise, not only will we fail
to save Fourth Princess,

85
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,660
but even the rescuers
won't make it back.

86
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,980
(Oh no.)

87
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,100
(If Ziqing comes up
from the valley floor)

88
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,020
(and isn't poisoned,)

89
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,980
(everyone will know)

90
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,160
(that she is immune to all poisons.)

91
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,060
Ziqing,

92
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,940
there's poison down there!

93
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,780
Don't shout.

94
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,700
If you disturb the poisonous creatures,

95
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,020
they will attack in swarms.

96
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,100
The Fourth Princess' situation
will become even more dangerous.

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,100
What are you doing?

98
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,940
If Han Ziqing dies there,

99
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,980
it's her fate.

100
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,820
You can't save her.

101
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,580
With so many of us here,

102
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,020
why only Han Ziqing
keeps encountering danger?

103
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,140
It seems that she should be punished.

104
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,420
If you keep talking,

105
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,540
I'll push you down too,

106
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,880
and let you ascend to eternal damnation.

107
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,140
Do you mean to suffer?

108
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,700
That's what I meant.

109
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,100
You can't even speak properly.
Just shut up.

110
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,460
You dare say one more word...

111
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,420
Enough.

112
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,460
The Fourth Princess is in danger.

113
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,180
His Majesty and I
are already extremely anxious.

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,700
You should stop arguing.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,340
The poisonous miasma is getting thicker.

116
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,860
I'm afraid Fourth Princess is...

117
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,580
What are you looking for?

118
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,460
With that look in your eyes,

119
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,700
are you looking for me?

120
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,300
Ziqing, are you alright?

121
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,140
I'm fine.

122
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,100
Are you hurt?

123
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,060
No, I'm fine.

124
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,300
Just a twisted ankle and some scrapes.

125
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,140
Thanks to you,

126
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,380
for saving me and Haonan.

127
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,220
Otherwise, we would have been a feast
for the scorpions.

128
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,340
It's a hearty meal.

129
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,540
You just appeared from nowhere,

130
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,460
and you seem unscathed.

131
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,660
We worried for nothing.

132
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,140
Did you worry about me, Princess Feiyan?

133
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,060
I didn't notice.

134
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,020
Fourth Princess,

135
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm quite curious.

136
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,540
You were down there just now.

137
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,940
How did you suddenly appear
in front of us now?

138
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,260
The original path was blocked just now.

139
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,660
So I took a detour.

140
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,700
I came from the back mountain.

141
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,540
Is that hard to understand?

142
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,300
Such a trivial matter,

143
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,940
yet it alarmed the King of Nanzhao
and Consort Qin.

144
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,820
My apologies.

145
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,180
Fourth Princess, you are mistaken.

146
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,580
Do you know that there is
filled with poisonous miasma?

147
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,100
It can be fatal if you inhale it.

148
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,140
You have stayed there
for a long time,

149
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,620
yet you are unharmed.

150
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,220
Even the poisonous miasma
can't harm you.

151
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,540
It's truly strange.

152
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,740
You are unaffected
by the poisonous miasma.

153
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,300
Why is that?

154
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,860
Fourth Princess,

155
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,740
could it be that you have

156
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,220
some miraculous elixir
that can neutralize all poisons,

157
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,660
or are you immune to all poisons?

158
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,300
What are you talking about?

159
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,780
I don't understand a word.

160
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,060
Someone saved me just now.

161
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,300
My head is still a bit dizzy.

162
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,740
Someone saved you?

163
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,100
Yes.

164
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,140
As the saying goes,

165
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
better to save one life

166
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,420
than build a seven-storied pagoda.

167
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,020
I saved Fourth Princess.

168
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,140
It's a kind of fate anyway.

169
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,980
Sorry, Fourth Princess.

170
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,380
Pharmacist Changning.

171
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,340
My master is old,

172
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,860
and walks slowly.

173
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,980
I almost got you to be misunderstood
by others.

174
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,100
Pharmacist Changning,

175
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,020
you...

176
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,060
Greetings, Your Majesty,

177
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,620
and Consort Qin.

178
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,900
Greetings, Your Majesty,

179
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Consort Qin,

180
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,980
and all the distinguished guests.

181
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,700
Pharmacist Changning,

182
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,780
why are you here?

183
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,740
Your Majesty,

184
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,260
Pharmacist Changning and I
were gathering herbs down in the valley,

185
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,020
and we happened to find Fourth Princess
unconscious from the poisonous miasma.

186
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,140
Fortunately, Pharmacist Changning
had an antidote,

187
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,980
which revived her.

188
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,500
Indeed,

189
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,420
if it weren't for me,

190
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,820
the consequence
would have been disastrous.

191
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,860
Thank you both.

192
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,300
I will visit to express my gratitude
when we go back.

193
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,620
Fourth Princess, don't mention it.

194
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,420
You are a distinguished guest from afar,

195
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,620
and I am serving
to put Your Majesty's mind at ease.

196
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,340
There was a misunderstanding earlier.

197
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,580
I hope you can forgive us.

198
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,980
You all are so concerned about me.

199
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,860
How could I hold a grudge against you?

200
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,020
As soon as you had danger,

201
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,660
someone happened to rescue you.

202
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,860
How could it be such a coincidence?

203
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,580
When Fourth Princess was in danger,

204
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,780
I rescued her.

205
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,660
Although it was a coincidence,
it is the truth.

206
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,020
I dare not lie.

207
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,460
Please believe me, Your Majesty.

208
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,180
You are highly respected
in Medicine Tribe.

209
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,980
How could I not believe you?

210
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,700
Thanks to your timely rescue,

211
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,780
Fourth Princess was able to survive.

212
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,420
Otherwise, I really wouldn't know

213
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
how to explain
to the Fourth Prince of Tianque.

214
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,740
It's getting late.

215
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,660
We should all go down the mountain.

216
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,060
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

217
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,860
This time, she can't escape.

218
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,700
This Deer Ear Grass likes damp places.

219
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,100
Weisheng, we should go.

220
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,780
Coming. I'm coming.

221
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,860
Baili Weisheng?

222
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,300
You,

223
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,060
you...

224
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,700
What are you doing here?

225
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,380
I-I am gathering herbs.

226
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,300
Ziqing,

227
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,140
ar-are you alright?

228
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,140
Shouldn't I be alright?

229
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,940
How come after a few days,

230
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
you've become a stutterer?

231
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,580
You-you still say that about me.

232
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,660
Look at this.

233
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,300
What is it?

234
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,660
I'm looking for a way out.

235
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,580
I don't know why a thick fog
suddenly appeared.

236
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,420
It made me lose my way.
Do you know the way?

237
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,260
Thick fog?

238
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,300
Miss,

239
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,740
this is miasma.

240
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,460
Miasma is poisonous and fatal.

241
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,900
Miasma?

242
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,900
Then why are you not affected?

243
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,930
My master has an antidote.

244
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,860
No wonder I feel so dizzy,

245
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,340
and nauseous.

246
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,100
Alright, stop pretending.

247
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,940
Really.

248
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,620
- I feel terrible.
- In front of me,

249
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,600
you don't need to hide anything.

250
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,820
I feel terrible right now.

251
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,860
I can't take it anymore.

252
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,420
Someone up there is waiting for you
to reveal your true identity.

253
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,060
How do you know that?

254
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,260
Come on.

255
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,580
- What are you doing?
- Playing dead.

256
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,420
Playing dead?

257
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,060
Smart move.

258
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,940
Thank you.

259
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,260
Master, come quickly.

260
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,100
Master!

261
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,540
- Who is she?
- Well...

262
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,500
Look, she's dressed like this.

263
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
She's a distinguished guest.

264
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,660
She fainted.

265
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,880
It-it's miasma. Quick, quick.

266
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Give me an antidote.

267
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,900
It seemed suspicious.

268
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,460
What's suspicious?

269
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,020
Is it that Han Ziqing doesn't die,

270
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,260
and you are very disappointed?

271
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,500
Aren't you disappointed?

272
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,100
If she doesn't die,

273
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,180
your brother will always think of her.

274
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,860
That's not good for you, is it?

275
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,420
Sorry

276
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,780
for the disturbance.

277
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,900
May I ask who you are?

278
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,700
Oh no.

279
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,700
Has Beiyue returned?

280
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,940
I don't know either.

281
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,300
Do you really believe Jun Beiyue

282
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
is staying in because of a cold?

283
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,020
Could he be pretending to be sick,

284
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,760
but actually plotting something else?

285
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,620
We'll know once we go to check it out.

286
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,460
If he takes action in Nanzhao,

287
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,420
let's see how Tianque will explain it.

288
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,020
There will be a good show to watch soon.

289
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,220
His Majesty has arrived.

290
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,900
Fourth Princess,

291
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,620
this time you encountered danger,

292
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,580
it was our Nanzhao's lack of care.

293
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,260
Your Majesty said

294
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,580
he wanted to personally explain
to Fourth Prince

295
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,600
to ask for his understanding.

296
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,580
Consort Qin, you are too kind.

297
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,820
My husband has caught a cold.

298
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,940
For the sake
of the King of Nanzhao's health,

299
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,620
it's better to avoid contact.

300
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,900
Fourth Princess,

301
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,620
since you came to Nanzhao as guests,

302
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,980
we should take good care of you.

303
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,980
But today, you were in danger.

304
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,300
Is this not important?

305
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,780
If we don't personally explain
to Fourth Prince,

306
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,860
it would be
against diplomatic etiquette.

307
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,580
Could it be that Fourth Prince
is not in the room?

308
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,420
Otherwise, how would he know
that His Majesty is here,

309
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
yet not come out to greet him?

310
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,620
Fourth Princess,

311
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,780
please announce our arrival.

312
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,500
Physician Gu,

313
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,300
how is His Highness?

314
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,140
Fourth Princess,

315
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,300
His Highness just took the medicine

316
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,620
and was asleep.

317
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,940
He's sleeping.

318
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,140
Sleeping?

319
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,020
When we left,

320
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,060
he was bedridden.

321
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,380
Now he is still sleeping.

322
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,020
Is it more serious?

323
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,900
Let's go and check on him.

324
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,740
No, no.

325
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,420
His Highness has caught a cold.

326
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,380
Han Ziqing.

327
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,620
He's afraid that you may get infected.

328
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,580
Han Ziqing.

329
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,020
Let's wait...

330
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,900
Han Ziqing.

331
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,980
Until His Highness recovers.

332
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,460
How could he be so weak?

333
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,300
It's just a cold.

334
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
Fourth Princess, please

335
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,540
let us go in and visit him.

336
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
There's an assassin!

337
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,740
Someone, come quickly!

338
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,660
Shadow,

339
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,940
go catch the assassin.

340
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,780
Yes.

341
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,900
- Go.
- Go.

342
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,820
This way.

343
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,220
Your Majesty,

344
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,580
there is an assassin in the courtyard.

345
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,780
Please step outside the courtyard

346
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,460
for safety.

347
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,300
No need.

348
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,020
I want to see

349
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,340
what this assassin looks like.

350
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,220
Stop!

351
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,060
Don't run!

352
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,580
Stop!

353
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,300
Stop pretending.

354
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,100
Your Majesty, they are blocking us.

355
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,420
They must be hiding something.

356
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,940
Let's force our way in.

357
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,460
Move aside.

358
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,620
Princess Zhaoxi,

359
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,260
your face.

360
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,380
My face.

361
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
My face!

362
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,540
Jun Beiyue,

363
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,340
how dare you hit my face.

364
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,500
I have caught a cold

365
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,580
and have said I won't see anyone.

366
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,420
Princess,

367
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,980
I apologize.

368
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,580
I thought you were the assassin.

369
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,420
You...

370
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,820
King of Nanzhao,

371
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,620
there was an assassin
at the envoy's residence.

372
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,260
Isn't this a bit too negligent?

373
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,100
Well.

374
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,580
Have you caught the assassin?

375
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,020
Your Majesty,

376
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,860
we have searched the entire residence

377
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,780
and found no assassin.

378
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,420
It's my fault

379
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,820
for startling you, Fourth Prince.

380
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,620
How are you feeling now?

381
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,500
King of Nanzhao,

382
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,060
Jun Beiyue injured my face.

383
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,260
Shouldn't you seek justice for me?

384
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,740
Your Majesty,

385
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,420
Fourth Prince has caught a cold.

386
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,940
Although he will recover
after a few days of rest,

387
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,100
this cold is contagious,

388
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,180
and you should be careful.

389
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,660
Since you are unwell,

390
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,620
let's wait until you recover.

391
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,900
We will take our leave for now.

392
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,060
You...

393
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,380
Be careful. I might infect you.

394
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,220
You...

395
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,140
Ziqing.

396
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,180
It serves you right.

397
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,180
How is it?

398
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,060
Did you find anything?

399
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,020
I found many corpses below,

400
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,140
hideous corpses.

401
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,100
They all have the totem
of the Isolated Island on their faces.

402
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,100
Totem?

403
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,860
And some are red,

404
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,140
while others are black.

405
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,620
Those with red totems on their faces

406
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,820
all have hideous expressions.

407
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,780
They must be related to the Island.

408
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,420
(Since they have the totem
on their faces,)

409
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,660
(they must be the Islanders.)

410
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,180
(But why do some have red totems?)

411
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,860
Beiyue, my face...

412
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,700
And this,

413
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,540
take a look.

414
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,180
What is this?

415
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,620
You found it after all.

416
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,980
If we follow the totem to find the place,

417
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,900
we might find the remaining scores.

418
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,300
How many are left?

419
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,580
Six volumes.

420
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,820
Previously, we found some
in Qinse Valley,

421
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,460
and you brought some back
from Ice Pool.

422
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,780
We have a total of four volumes.

423
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,620
They correspond

424
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,820
to the first four volumes we have.

425
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,820
So we can know

426
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,900
that Lishang has two major chapters.

427
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,220
Each chapter consists of ten volumes

428
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,820
to correspond to each other.

429
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,740
Besides the scores we already have,

430
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,940
we are still missing six volumes.

431
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,820
As long as we find all the music scores,

432
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,860
we can find the answer.

433
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,420
(Music Scores)

434
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,060
Sis,

435
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,660
where are you going?

436
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,700
When did you arrive?

437
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,660
I came by Father's order,

438
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
to discuss important matters
with Nanzhao.

439
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,820
Father sent you?

440
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,500
To take me back to Xiling?

441
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,220
It's about your marriage
with the King of Nanzhao.

442
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,540
I don't agree.

443
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,060
Father has already agreed.

444
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,140
Does it matter if you disagree?

445
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,980
I have fought battles all over
for Xiling

446
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,060
and have mediated in court affairs.

447
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,860
In the end, Father just agreed

448
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,740
to have just sold me off.

449
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,860
Am I really that worthless in his eyes?

450
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,940
It's because you are worth something

451
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,340
that Father made this decision.

452
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,220
Why don't you understand?

453
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,660
What did you say?

454
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,700
You know it too.

455
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,900
Ever since our battle
with Dongling and Tianque,

456
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,660
Xiling's national strength
has greatly declined.

457
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,180
Now that the King of Nanzhao is willing
to ally with us through marriage,

458
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,060
this is a great opportunity

459
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
for Xiling to rise again.

460
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,540
Do you really want to see your country

461
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,580
keep declining

462
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,140
and not be willing to sacrifice yourself?

463
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,500
Why should I sacrifice

464
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,860
for your kingdom?

465
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,580
Because you are a princess of Xiling.

466
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,140
Sis,

467
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,860
I know you are frustrated

468
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,420
and I know you like Jun Beiyue only.

469
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,900
But now Father has made up his mind.

470
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,140
Moreover,

471
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,140
your marriage directly affects

472
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,900
the survival of Xiling.

473
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,020
So you have no choice.

474
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,060
Fine.

475
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,820
I agree.

476
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,940
I know you are a sensible person.

477
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,620
It is Han Ziqing

478
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
who got me into this situation.

479
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,860
I want her dead.

480
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,380
Rest assured.

481
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,820
Once there's an opportunity,

482
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,940
I will kill her for sure.

483
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,180
(Lishang)
This marriage alliance

484
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
between Xiling and Nanzhao

485
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,620
is like grabbing a lifeline
in a desperate situation.

486
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,900
No wonder the King of Xiling
agreed so quickly.

487
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,100
He even sent Chu Tiange
to make preparations.

488
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,940
Beiyue,

489
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,620
this is not good news for Tianque.

490
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,940
Even if Xiling convinces Nanzhao
to be enemies with Tianque,

491
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,020
so what?

492
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,860
I will prepare for the war.

493
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,700
If the King of Nanzhao is smart enough,

494
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,060
he won't start a war easily.

495
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,860
Stop.

496
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,540
Princess Feiyan,

497
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,980
is there something you need from me?

498
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,500
I'm about to marry the King of Nanzhao.

499
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,060
You must be very happy, right?

500
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,140
Not really.

501
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
I don't feel much about it.

502
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,300
Don't be smug.

503
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,100
For what you have done to me,

504
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,780
one day I will repay you
a hundredfold, and a thousandfold.

505
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,460
Han Ziqing, just you wait.

506
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,820
Alright.

507
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,060
Princess Feiyan,

508
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,420
you will settle here for now.

509
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
After the wedding,

510
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,020
you will move to the official bedroom.

511
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,420
My beloved,

512
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
tonight you look

513
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,220
even more radiant and captivating.

514
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,340
Tomorrow is the wedding.

515
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,660
Your Majesty, you came over
late at night.

516
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,300
Is there something you need?

517
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,100
Nothing.

518
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,060
I just came to see you.

519
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,260
My beloved,

520
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,580
I know you are unwilling,

521
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,060
but I admire your beauty and talent,

522
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,180
I can't help myself.

523
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,340
In time, you will understand

524
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,700
my sincere intentions.

525
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,060
Don't be afraid.

526
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,100
From now on, I will love you,
protect you,

527
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,900
and ensure you a life of glory.

528
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,420
Your Majesty,

529
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,140
I have a request.

530
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,180
Please grant it, Your Majesty.

531
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,620
Speak.

532
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,140
I grow up on the grasslands,

533
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,820
and I dislike being confined.

534
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,820
After the wedding,

535
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,300
please do not treat me

536
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
like the other concubines

537
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,380
and imprison me in the palace,

538
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,060
but allow me to have the run of Nanzhao.

539
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,580
Do you intend to escape back to Xiling?

540
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,820
With Xiling's national strength,

541
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,780
I doubt they would dare to shelter me.

542
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,580
I just don't want to be a caged bird.

543
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,820
Your Majesty, if you agree,

544
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,260
I can run your errands,

545
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,540
and I am willing

546
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,340
to bear children for you

547
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,140
to continue the lineage.

548
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:57,980
Alright.

549
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,980
I agree.

550
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,540
However,

551
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,500
I want to know one thing.

552
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,020
Do you still think of Jun Beiyue,

553
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,740
and that's why you oppose Han Ziqing?

554
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
To be honest with you,

555
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,700
I did have feelings for Jun Beiyue,

556
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,020
but now I no longer have such thoughts.

557
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,100
As for Han Ziqing, I just detest her.

558
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,700
I detest her arrogance and conceit.

559
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,020
I don't want to see her so pleased.

560
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,820
Please allow me to ask a question.

561
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,140
Does she concern you?

562
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,860
Why do you ask?

563
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,140
At Lingshui River and Miasma Valley,

564
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,260
you and Consort Qin

565
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,580
seemed to be testing her intentionally.

566
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,100
Please don't misunderstand me,
Your Majesty.

567
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,740
I am not trying to pry into anything.

568
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,700
I just hate Han Ziqing.

569
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,380
Therefore, I pay special attention

570
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,550
to everything that happens to her.

571
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,100
That's why I find it peculiar.

572
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,340
Your Majesty,

573
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,460
I'm about to marry you,

574
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,900
so I want to share your worries.

575
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm willing to help if you need me.

576
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,660
You may rise.

577
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,500
I'm glad to see your keen perception

578
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
and observation.

579
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,340
I won't hide it from you.

580
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,500
I do suspect Han Ziqing

581
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,380
is special.

582
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,740
Do you know...

583
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,980
What's the matter?

584
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,140
It's Lishang.

585
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,020
This music.

586
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,740
I heard this piece in Qinse Valley.

587
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,260
So he recognized it too.

588
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,060
It seems so.

589
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,340
You two really are kindred spirits.

and Fourth Princess.

615
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,460
By the way,

616
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,820
there is something I would like
to ask you.

617
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,340
What does this totem represent?

618
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,420
I have seen this totem
in Guyue Cave.

619
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,700
And the Guyue Cave

620
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,660
has always been a forbidden area
of the Earth King Religion in Nanzhao.

621
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,460
Unless there is a major event

622
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,860
to pray for protection
from the Earth King,

623
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:33,300
no one is allowed to enter.

624
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,060
What if we want to go there?

625
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,540
You also recognized

626
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,990
the tune played
at today's wedding ceremony.

627
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,780
It is Lishang.

628
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,740
The music scores I currently have
for Lishang

629
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:13,620
does not include this tune.

630
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,060
I came to tell you,

631
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,300
no matter how talented a musician is,

632
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,140
it is impossible to write

633
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,580
so many music scores at once.

634
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,380
Unless...

635
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,380
These music scores came
from the sounds of nature,

636
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,340
and were recorded.

637
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,860
So it's a fact

638
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,180
that we must find all the music scores

639
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,220
and play them completely.

640
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,900
Otherwise, we cannot decipher Lishang.

641
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,100
Alright. Thank you for telling me this.

642
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,060
