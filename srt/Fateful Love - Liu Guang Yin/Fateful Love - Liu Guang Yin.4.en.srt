What's wrong?

00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,560
I have an itch here. Scratch it for me.

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,770
- Let me.
- Your Highness.

24
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,120
Your Highness.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,000
Your Highness.

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,810
You should lie down.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,770
What kind of tea did the Queen give you?

28
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,450
Autumn White Dew.

29
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,800
Gu, take a look at her.

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
Yes.

31
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,250
No need.

32
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,490
Physician Chen has already treated me.

33
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,770
It's nothing serious.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,050
I'll be fine in a couple of days.

35
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,130
Are you really fine,

36
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,690
or is there another hidden illness?

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,520
Thank you, Physician Gu.

38
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,670
Your Highness.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,570
She just had a sudden tuberculosis.

40
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,570
Physician Chen must have already
administered acupuncture yesterday.

41
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,210
The condition has stabilized.

42
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,890
That's good.

43
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,250
You all may leave now.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,600
(What is he planning to do now?)

45
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,800
(Just try to lay a hand on me.)

46
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,050
Your Highness.

47
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,210
I have tuberculosis.

48
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,490
Being too close

49
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,290
might cause infection.

50
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,290
You're already so seriously ill.

51
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
I'm very worried about you.

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
I'm not afraid.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,410
How did you suddenly

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,160
get tuberculosis?

55
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,000
Maybe it's because the temperature
dropped these past few days.

56
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,640
I might have caught a cold.

57
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:00,690
Your Highness.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Your dagger

59
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,330
is so unique.

60
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,880
Are you interested in my dagger?

61
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,250
I just

62
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
feel like

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,610
I've seen this dagger

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,290
when I was a child.

65
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,530
Your Highness.

66
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,040
Can you lend it to me for a look?

67
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,480
No.

68
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,570
Why not?

69
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,480
(Are you forcing me to rob it?)

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,170
This is a keepsake
from my mother.

71
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,640
If you really want to see it,

72
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,080
wait until you are officially conferred
as the Fourth Princess Consort.

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,730
Then I will show it to you.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,290
(So I have to finish the act.)

75
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,640
Although she might have been poisoned

76
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,320
by the Queen's Huajin poison that day,

77
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,980
there's only a small amount left
in her body now.

78
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,760
She's fine now.

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,760
If she can detoxify herself,

80
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,920
then could she have detoxified

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,520
the Moxun Poison herself too?

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Impossible.

83
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,570
Why?

84
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,450
The Huajin Poison might be cured
by someone with profound skills,

85
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,520
but this Moxun Poison,

86
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,290
is not ordinary at all.

87
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,200
Your Highness was poisoned
by the Moxun Poison a few days ago,

88
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,130
and I transferred it to her body
through medical techniques,

89
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,450
which allowed Your Highness
to be freed from it.

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,890
Very few people know this method,

91
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,360
perhaps the Queen is not aware of it.

92
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,080
The most important thing is,

93
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,010
the person who receives the poison
will undoubtedly die.

94
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,170
It's just a matter of time.

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Then why hasn't
the Princess Consort died?

96
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,730
I suspect that the poison in her body

97
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,360
was not neutralized,

98
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,170
but rather that the poison
didn't affect her.

99
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,290
In other words, she is not afraid
of poison at all.

100
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,160
Gu,

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
are you saying…

102
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,920
Your Highness,

103
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,520
on the Longyuan Continent,

104
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,850
only people from one place
have this body constitution.

105
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,420
(Western Garden)

106
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,260
Hongyi.

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,080
Your Highness.

108
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,730
Did you accompany Ziqing
to Yiqing Palace that night?

109
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,450
Yes.

110
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,130
Did anything special happen?

111
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,800
I dare not hide from Your Highness,

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,130
but the Princess Consort instructed,

113
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,570
not to let me talk too much.

114
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,240
Your Highness, why don't you
ask her yourself?

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,080
You may rise.

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

117
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,040
Your Highness.

118
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,880
Your Highness.

119
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,730
It's okay. No need to support me.

120
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,890
Greetings, Your Highness.

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,850
Why did you vomit?

122
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,170
I haven't recovered yet.

123
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,130
I can't eat much.

124
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,240
It seems your appetite is poor.

125
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,130
In that case,

126
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,480
take good care of your strength,

127
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,480
and return to your home
to receive the decree.

128
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,010
Alright,

129
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,570
then I

130
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,040
will leave.

131
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,600
Your Highness.

132
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,260
Return to the Chancellor's Mansion.

133
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,280
Wait.

134
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,730
Do you have any other instructions?

135
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,930
Since you're so ill,

136
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,050
I will escort you back home.

137
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,330
Let's go.

138
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,980
(Chancellor's Mansion)

139
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,120
This carriage looks so grand.

140
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:36,140
(Chancellor's Mansion)

141
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,970
What are you doing?

142
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,610
Your Highness.

143
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,520
Quick, quick!

144
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,840
Come on.

145
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,100
Your Highness, welcome.

146
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,540
Today, the Fourth Princess Consort
will receive the decree.

147
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,220
I accompany her back together.

148
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,780
Chancellor Han, you don't mind, do you?

149
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,900
How dare I.

150
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,180
My daughter's ennoblement is an honor
for the Chancellor's Mansion.

151
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,220
Your Highness, please come in.

152
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,540
Be careful. Take it slow.

153
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,940
Alright.

154
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,620
Come.

155
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,860
What does she mean by this?

156
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,340
Is she coming back on purpose
to show off?

157
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,180
Be quiet.

158
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,180
Didn't you see?

159
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,580
She's so sick that she can't even walk.

160
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,820
Let's go.

161
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,140
Your Highness.

162
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,740
The time has not yet come.

163
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,580
I heard that Eunuch Yin
has not left the palace yet.

164
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,180
You will have to wait a little longer.

165
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,260
No rush.

166
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,660
This decree and ennoblement
cannot be delayed past noon.

167
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,140
I

168
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,780
will wait here.

169
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,340
Ziqing,

170
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,980
I heard you were ill a few days ago.

171
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,460
I wonder if you are feeling any better
today.

172
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,540
You seemed so weak.

173
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,220
You must have not fully recovered.

174
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,020
I wonder if you will have the strength
to receive the decree later.

175
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,860
You don't need to worry about that.

176
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,100
I still have the strength

177
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,380
to kneel and receive the ennoblement.

178
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,660
It's not just because of you.

179
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,860
I'm also worried for His Highness.

180
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,980
The marriage between the Fourth Prince
and the Chancellor's Mansion

181
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,220
is a good thing.

182
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,980
If you can't hold up,

183
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,020
wouldn't that disappoint His Highness?

184
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,860
Shut up.

185
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,860
The Second Princess Consort has arrived.

186
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,420
By mother's order,

187
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,420
I have come to witness
Ziqing's ennoblement.

188
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,420
I didn't expect Brother Beiyue
is here as well.

189
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,500
My daughter's ennoblement

190
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,180
has troubled Her Majesty
and Your Highness.

191
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,060
It is truly my fault.

192
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,740
From now on, Ziqing and I
will be like sisters.

193
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,300
Chancellor, no need to be so polite.

194
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Someone, quickly prepare a seat
for Her Highness.

195
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
Your Highness, please.

196
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,500
So it's the Second Princess Consort.

197
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,580
I am not feeling well,

198
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,340
and cannot get up to greet you.

199
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,260
It's alright.

200
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,340
Your health is more important.

201
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,060
My Brother Beiyue

202
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,380
has never been so attentive to anyone.

203
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,260
Ziqing, you are truly fortunate.

204
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,540
Sis.

205
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,700
Didn't they say this woman
wouldn't survive the night?

206
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,500
How is she able to talk
and breathe again?

207
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,060
Is there something wrong
with the poison?

208
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,900
Don't talk nonsense.

209
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,500
Mother would never make a mistake.

210
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,420
This...

211
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,220
Drink some more water
to moisten your throat.

212
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,480
Today, I saw Brother Beiyue and Ziqing

213
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,580
are so affectionate.

214
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,220
It really makes one envious.

215
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,820
Brother Beiyue has always
been very selective.

216
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,030
I didn't expect

217
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,120
he would still fall for a beauty.

218
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,380
I think Ziqing

219
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,940
won't get better anytime soon.

220
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,220
Don't miss out on such a great blessing.

221
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,940
No need to worry for me, Miss Jingshi.

222
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,060
Tuberculosis is no joke.

223
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,940
Once contracted, it's quite dangerous.

224
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,580
You must take care of yourself.

225
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,420
Yes.

226
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,700
I heard that tuberculosis is incurable.

227
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
And it can be contagious.

228
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Miss Jingshi,

229
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,140
are you alright?

230
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,940
A few days ago, I coughed up blood
all over you.

231
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,460
I felt very sorry about it.

232
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,580
I asked the imperial physician.

233
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,780
He said

234
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,260
it's very easily infected

235
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,500
with this disease.

236
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,140
No, no.

237
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,620
I took a bath as soon as I got back.

238
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,020
I even bathed several times.

239
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,380
I won't get infected.

240
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,780
You can't say that.

241
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,260
You have to be careful.

242
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,260
If you get infected,

243
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,900
like how I look now,

244
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,940
it would worry everyone.

245
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,620
That wouldn't be good.

246
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
Sis.

247
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,780
Alright, alright.

248
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,900
The Second Prince has arrived.

249
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,580
No need for formalities.

250
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,700
We're not in the palace.

251
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Just lie down comfortably.

252
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,540
Brother Beiyue,

253
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
is Ziqing alright?

254
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,620
Your Highness,

255
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,780
I'm not feeling good now.

256
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,990
So I can't perform the formalities.

257
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,020
We will all be one family.

258
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,460
Ziqing, please don't care about it.

259
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,980
Brother Beiyue,

260
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,020
no need to hold her so tightly.

261
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,140
No one is going to take her from you.

262
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,060
I can't say that.

263
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,780
Right now,

264
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,700
isn't there someone

265
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,620
who came uninvited?

266
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,940
That's not the right thing to say.

267
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
I know Ziqing
has contracted tuberculosis.

268
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,020
To prevent from getting infected,

269
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,580
I came to take Jingqin back
to the palace.

270
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,980
Then take care, see you next time.

271
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,900
Since I've already been here,

272
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,700
it doesn't hurt to sit for a while

273
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,220
to prevent you from saying

274
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,220
that I've become timid

275
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,660
after staying cooped up in the palace
all day.

276
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,940
Hasn't Eunuch Yin arrived yet?

277
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
No rush.

278
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,580
What is meant to come
will come eventually.

279
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,100
Yes.

280
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,220
Ziqing is a lucky girl with great fortune.

281
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,100
She will wait to receive the decree
and ennoblement.

282
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,340
Your Highness.

283
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,460
It's better to call an imperial physician
to take a look.

284
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,220
No need.

285
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,820
Brother Beiyue.

286
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,460
I already said there's no need
to hold her so tightly.

287
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,460
Hasn't that Mr. Chen

288
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,380
already died?

289
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,820
No one is competing with you.

290
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,740
Brother Beichen, I suggest you return
to the palace immediately

291
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,100
and find the Queen.

292
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,460
What do you mean?

293
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,620
Let the Queen teach you how to behave
and speak properly.

294
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,060
You…

295
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,340
This…

296
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,860
Are you humiliating your elder brother?

297
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,500
What if I am humiliating you publicly?

298
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,380
Say that again!

299
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,620
Do you want to fight me?

300
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,460
Brother Beiyue, you…

301
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,340
Your Highness.

302
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,580
Please don't get angry.

303
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,500
We are all brothers.

304
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,340
Peace is precious.

305
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,460
Your Highness.

306
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,020
At this critical moment,
we can't afford any trouble.

307
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,340
Take good care of Ziqing.

308
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,340
Let's return to the palace.

309
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,820
Sis.

310
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,620
Aunt said we must see with our own eyes

311
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,130
to confirm the woman has died.

312
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,340
If you want to stay, you stay here.

313
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,860
Jun Beiyue openly disgraced my husband.

314
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,500
How can I stay here?

315
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,340
He holds military power

316
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,700
and our father
also holds military power.

317
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,580
I want to see

318
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,860
whom His Majesty will favor.

319
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,500
Shadow, water.

320
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Sis.

321
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,580
Why are you coughing up blood?

322
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,700
- Shadow.
- Here.

323
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,620
Summon Physician Gu here.

324
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,460
Yes.

325
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,100
Find more imperial physicians.

326
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,260
I told you
she doesn't have this fortune.

327
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,860
She fell ill at this critical moment.

328
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,940
I'm telling you.
This fortune is still yours.

329
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,100
At a time like this, just stop talking.

330
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,620
You two, lower the curtain.

331
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,500
Yes, yes.

332
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,550
Where is the imperial physician?

333
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,140
Quick, summon the imperial physician.

334
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,340
You two are so foolish.

335
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,580
The most important thing right now

336
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,280
is to wait for Han Ziqing's poison
to take effect.

337
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,480
As long as she dies from the poison,

338
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,220
the marriage alliance
between the two mansions

339
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
will naturally be called off.

340
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,740
But you two

341
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,980
went to cause trouble,

342
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,260
and almost ruined everything.

343
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,220
Mother,

344
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,860
Jun Beiyue humiliated me in public.

345
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,100
How can you expect me to endure this?

346
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,220
What can you do if you don't endure it?

347
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,100
Jun Beiyue
is deliberately provoking you,

348
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,680
so that you will disrupt the ennoblement

349
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,940
to give your father a reason to take action
against the General's Mansion.

350
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,980
Beichen,

351
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,040
why don't you understand this?

352
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,140
Now listen carefully,

353
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,540
once Han Ziqing dies,

354
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,420
have the Judicial Office
arrest Han Xi'er immediately.

355
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,060
Mr. Chen's death

356
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,660
is definitely related to her.

357
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,780
Once the Judicial Office sentences her,

358
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
by then,

359
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,980
both daughters of the Han family
will be in trouble.

360
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,900
I want to see

361
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,140
how the Chancellor's daughter will marry
into the Mansion of Fourth Prince.

362
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,020
Make way.

363
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:25,980
Quickly.

364
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,020
Your Highness, Gu is here.

365
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,020
Come and check
the Princess Consort's pulse.

366
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,500
Yes, Your Highness.

367
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,220
Quickly.

368
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,100
Your Highness,

369
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
I still need to discuss
with the imperial physicians.

370
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,020
The Imperial Edict has arrived.

371
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,260
The Imperial Edict has arrived.

372
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,380
Han Ziqing,

373
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,060
please receive the edict.

374
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,980
Your Highness,

375
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,780
what happened to Miss Ziqing?

376
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,380
Can't you see?

377
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,540
Ziqing is ill.

378
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,180
Then this Imperial Edict…

379
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,620
Well…

380
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,900
Eunuch Yin,

381
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,640
why haven't you announced the edict?

382
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,740
Well…

383
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,860
(Imperial Edict)

384
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,860
(Imperial Edict)

385
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,260
The edict states,

386
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,140
Han Ziqing, the second daughter
of Chancellor Han Shiqing,

387
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,980
is diligent and obedient

388
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,780
with a gentle and kind nature.

389
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,540
She is hereby ennobled
as the Fourth Princess Consort.

390
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,900
By the King's command.

391
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,380
Thank you,

392
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,500
Your Majesty.

393
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,260
Thank you, Your Majesty.

394
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Long live Your Majesty.

395
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,980
Do not accept it.

396
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,180
Ouyang Jingshi, you are obstructing
the acceptance of the edict.

397
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,660
Do you want to rebel
with the General's Mansion?

398
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,260
No, I don't.

399
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,780
Someone, take her down.

400
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,780
Wait for Father's decision.

401
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,860
That's not what I meant.

402
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,780
Your Highness,

403
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,260
that's not what I meant.

404
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,980
Your Highness, Your Highness!

405
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,380
Eunuch Yin.

406
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,260
Please.

407
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,380
Han Ziqing, please receive the edict.

408
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,540
Yes, here.

409
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,500
Congratulations to the Fourth Prince.

410
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,180
The Fourth Princess Consort is blessed.

411
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,740
She is feeling better now

412
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,780
and will recover in no time.

413
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,220
Thank you, Eunuch Yin.

414
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,000
You just recover so quickly.

415
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,780
I don't know what's going on either.

416
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,020
As soon as I received the edict,

417
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,500
I felt completely refreshed.

418
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,140
Isn't it amazing?

419
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,660
Indeed, health

420
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,020
can be influenced by mood.

421
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,620
- Congratulations!
- Yes, indeed.

422
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,500
Congratulations to the Fourth Princess Consort!

423
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,220
Eunuch Yin.

424
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:55,980
Your Highness.

425
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,060
Congratulations, Your Highness.

426
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,020
I'm returning to the palace to report.

427
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,860
Eunuch, take care.

428
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
I take my leave.

429
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,260
Then let's return to our mansion.

430
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,660
Let's go, Your Highness.

431
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,620
Your Highness.

432
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,380
Now the wedding date hasn't been set.

433
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,740
Why not let my daughter stay
at the Chancellor's Mansion first?

434
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,620
I never care about these formalities.

435
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,660
Let's hear Ziqing's opinion.

436
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,660
Ziqing, do you want to stay
at the Chancellor's Mansion

437
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,780
or come back to the Mansion
of Fourth Prince with me?

438
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,380
I am the Fourth Princess Consort now,

439
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,500
so I'll just follow you

440
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,420
wherever you go.

441
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,260
Mother.

442
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,980
Your Majesty, please take care
of your health.

443
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,380
Don't get angry and harm your body.

444
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,380
How did you promise me?

445
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,260
I, this...

446
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,020
Your Majesty,

447
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,540
I can't take the whole blame.

448
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,500
The imperial physician had diagnosed it.

449
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,620
The edict also arrived at a perfect time.

450
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,860
I don't know how she just...

451
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,020
Shut up.

452
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,860
Useless, all of you are useless.

453
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,620
Your Majesty,

454
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,660
the Queen has always acted prudently.

455
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,020
Since she saw Han Ziqing

456
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,780
drink that bowl of poisoned tea,

457
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,860
there should be no mistake.

458
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,700
This…

459
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,620
But we don't know why…

460
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,460
She had drunk

461
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,540
the poisoned tea.

462
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,860
Why didn't she die?

463
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,570
Moreover,

464
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,900
that day I had already detained Beiyue

465
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,140
and his subordinates.

466
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,540
Han Ziqing was helpless
in the Mansion of Fourth Prince.

467
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,540
How did she

468
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,620
neutralize this poison?

469
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,620
Well…

470
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,780
I don't know why either.

471
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,620
Your Majesty,

472
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,660
the Fourth Prince knew
that you don't like

473
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,540
the person he chose,

474
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,740
yet he insisted on opposing you.

475
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,150
Your Majesty,

476
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,380
you must not indulge the Fourth Prince
any longer.

477
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,620
Then tell me,

478
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,900
how can I not indulge him?

479
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,860
Revoke the Imperial Edict,

480
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
and execute Han Ziqing.

481
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Such foolishness of a woman.

482
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,500
Your Majesty.

483
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,300
With my golden words,

484
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,180
I cannot just revoke an edict
after it has been declared.

485
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,740
Or where would my dignity be?

486
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,500
Moreover,

487
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,260
the King of Xiling is about
to visit Tianque.

488
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,300
If Beiyue is not here,

489
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,980
how can I handle it?

490
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,780
Have you thought about that?

491
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,020
Your Majesty, please forgive

492
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,180
my foolishness.

493
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,260
You may rise.

494
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
Rise.

495
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,020
Let me tell you all,

496
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,660
Beiyue is the pride of our Tianque

497
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,060
and so is the Fourth Princess Consort.

498
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,740
In the future,

499
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,380
if I hear anyone gossiping
behind their backs,

500
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,740
I will not spare them!

501
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Yin Zhong said the Judicial Office

502
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,140
is reviewing the Chen Family's case.

503
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,220
Do you know?

504
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,710
I have heard.

505
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,460
Then pay more attention to it.

506
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,380
Why is there still no news?

507
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,500
Mother has already gone there.

508
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,900
Just wait patiently.

509
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,380
- Mother.
- Mother.

510
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,780
How is it going?

511
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,380
Although His Majesty was very angry,

512
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,780
the situation is not irreparable.

513
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,780
His Majesty
will not revoke the Imperial Edict,

514
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,900
but he mentioned
the Chen Family's murder case.

515
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,060
So what does His Majesty mean?

516
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,020
He does not want to confront Jun Beiyue,

517
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,990
nor does he want Han Ziqing
to become the Princess Consort.

518
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,020
So he wants to start
with Mr. Chen's murder case.

519
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,980
It aligns with our thoughts.

520
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,860
Beichen.

521
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,420
Quickly submit that lawsuit
to the Judicial Office.

522
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:06,260
Yes.

523
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,620
Mother.

524
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,540
With this handwritten lawsuit
from Mr. Chen,

525
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,020
the accusation that Han Xi'er
instructed Shopkeeper Chen

526
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,420
to bribe Mr. Chen will be solidified.

527
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,900
This will also give Han Ziqing a motive
for murder.

528
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,500
This move can be described

529
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,760
as killing two birds with one stone.

530
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,060
It is certainly true that Han Ziqing
drank the poisoned tea.

531
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,860
How could she be fine?

532
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,420
Jun Beiyue was confined by Father
for six days,

533
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,620
so he didn't have time to detoxify her.

534
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,620
Indeed.

535
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,760
Investigate them thoroughly.

536
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,380
Your Highness.

537
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,980
How is

538
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,660
the investigation on her case going?

539
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,020
There are no other clues
on the Princess Consort for now.

540
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
What about Chancellor Han?

541
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,020
Chancellor Han is a native of Tianque

542
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,320
and has lived here for a long time,

543
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,830
and never left.

544
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,380
What about her mother, Mu Ci?

545
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,770
Mu Ci was a qin master
at the Music House

546
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,620
with no relatives or connections,

547
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,780
and was very reticent.

548
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,860
It was only because of
her exceptional qin skills

549
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,340
that she caught the eye
of Chancellor Han.

550
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,900
After marrying
into the Chancellor's Mansion,

551
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,870
she became even more reclusive.

552
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,760
Moreover, she has been deceased
for many years,

553
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,500
so there's no way
to trace her true background.

554
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,630
Your Highness,

555
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,690
a person immune to all poisons
is indeed rare.

556
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,500
If the Princess Consort
truly has such a body constitution,

557
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,530
then

558
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,940
it must be related
to the Isolated Island.

559
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,820
Your Highness,

560
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,380
the Isolated Island is a major taboo
in Longyuan.

561
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Islanders…

562
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,620
Your Highness, I am not certain either.

563
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,820
It is said that the Isolated Island
is located south of the South Sea,

564
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,100
and the Islanders are immune
to all poisons.

565
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,740
However, they are self-sufficient,

566
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,980
and live in peace.

567
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,220
They never interacted
with the Longyuan Continent.

568
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,980
I remember when I was young,

569
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,900
I heard about the human puppets
of the Islanders.

570
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,340
Do you know about it?

571
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,260
That was 20 years ago,

572
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,860
there were rumors
that the Islanders suddenly mutated

573
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,740
and turned into human puppets.

574
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,860
They used their immortal bodies
and supernatural abilities

575
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,860
to invade the Longyuan Continent,

576
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,420
until the King of Nanzhao took action

577
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,260
to drive them back
to the Isolated Island.

578
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,660
Thus, the Longyuan Continent

579
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,260
avoided a catastrophe.

580
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,900
However, later it was heard

581
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,740
that the Isolated Island disappeared

582
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,380
from the sea overnight.

583
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,620
Since then, no one

584
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,260
has seen any trace of the Islanders.

585
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,660
But did anyone witness the chaos

586
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,540
caused by the human puppets back then?

587
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,660
Many from the Nanzhao royal family
saw it.

588
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,740
I think this rumor is not without basis.

589
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,780
What exactly do these humanpuppets

590
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,660
look like?

591
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,260
I don't think the Princess Consort
looks like

592
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,660
a demon that would bring chaos
to the Longyuan Continent.

593
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,140
These Islanders mutate themselves

594
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,380
through their physical abilities
in a special way.

595
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,620
Before this mutation,
they are merely immune to all poisons,

596
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,380
and indistinguishable
from ordinary people.

597
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,260
But after they mutate,

598
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,020
they become hideous like living corpses.

599
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,990
They're impervious to blades and bullets
and resistant to water and fire.

600
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,260
- In an instant…
- Gu.

601
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,220
Rumors

602
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,740
should not be taken as truth.

603
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,620
Yes, Your Highness.

604
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,060
But I do have a thought.

605
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,540
If she is from the Isolated Island,

606
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,060
she should stay by my side even more.

607
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,180
The Longyuan Continent
is in constant turmoil.

608
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
It seems that

609
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,500
only the Tianque, Dongling, Xiling,
and Tieyan

610
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,340
are fighting each other.

611
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,420
Nanzhao always stays out of it.

612
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,860
That's because their national strength
is formidable,

613
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,340
and they have many tribes.

614
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,300
The King of Nanzhao

615
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,990
is not a man without ambition.

616
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,820
You must have heard

617
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,540
that the King of Nanzhao
has been searching for

618
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,580
the Islanders for many years.

619
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,580
What is his purpose?

620
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,780
There must be something fishy about it.

621
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,740
If the Islanders appear
in Tianque,

622
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,380
wouldn't that be a great opportunity?

623
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,100
Your Highness,
we will investigate further.

624
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,100
When I received the decree today,

625
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,100
Eunuch Yin's face turned green.

626
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,100
- Your Highness.
- Quickly take it away.

627
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,620
Say that I am asleep.

628
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,500
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

629
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,580
You all may leave.

630
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

631
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,300
What does this guy mean?

632
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,380
(This is the Western Garden,)

633
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,620
(not his sleeping palace.)

634
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,980
(Could it be that he wants
to sleep here?)

635
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,140
I've slept so well.

636
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Your Highness.

637
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,620
Why are you here?

638
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,400
Of course, I am here
to consummate the marriage.

639
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,500
Consummate the marriage?

640
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,140
Consummate the marriage…

641
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,140
I remember now.

642
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,680
Since the decree
has already been issued,

643
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,620
then, Your Highness,
please fulfill your promise

644
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,540
to lend me the dagger for a look.

645
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,100
I will fulfill the promise.

646
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,820
But what I said

647
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,200
was to wait till you officially
become the Fourth Princess Consort.

648
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,180
That will be after the consummation.

649
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,770
Your Highness, urgent report
from the border.

650
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,100
You should rest early.

651
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:48,140
Accompany me to the palace tomorrow

652
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
to thank for the royal grace.

653
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,980
No way.

654
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,660
I need to think of another way.

655
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
I'll go steal it.

656
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:38,980
(Notebook)

657
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
This should be it.

658
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,380
You need to handle the task
I assigned you quickly.

659
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,300
Yes, Your Highness.

660
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,620
I'm exhausted.
