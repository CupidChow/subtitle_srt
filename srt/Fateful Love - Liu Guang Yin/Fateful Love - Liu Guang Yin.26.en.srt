Open the door.

You geezer.

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,190
Sha, open the door quickly.

24
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,630
Shh.

25
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,470
Be quiet.

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,630
I told you I would not
take any patients.

27
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,830
Just go away.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,870
Sha, I am Baili Weisheng.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,680
Baili Weisheng?

30
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,760
Are you getting senile?

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,510
Pharmacist Changning
introduced me to you.

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,630
We've met before, you forgot?

33
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,270
How many times have I told you?

34
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,400
Human doctors and veterinarians

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,540
are very different though they have
similar healthcare science.

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,240
Though Changning recommended you,

37
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,600
I have nothing to discuss with you.

38
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,470
Just go away.

39
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,600
Not to discuss.

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I need you.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
You idle around all day.

42
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
It can't be good news.

43
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
Go away.

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,670
It's really good news.

45
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,630
Great news.

46
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,470
What good news?

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
Complex disease.

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,600
Complex disease?

49
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,440
Human or animals?

50
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,270
If it's an animal, why would I need you?

51
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,360
I can keep it to myself.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
It's a human being.

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
A human being?

54
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,110
Tell me about it.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,030
A complex disease
that only allows living up to 30 years.

56
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,160
Only live up to 30 years?

57
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,520
Let's go to take a look.

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
Look,

59
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,390
I said it's a human being.

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Pick him up, and follow me.

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,910
- Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

62
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,030
- Let's go.
- Put me down.

63
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,470
This way.

64
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,720
- You haven't paid yet.
- Later.

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,600
Wait for me to come back.

66
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,990
Sha, are you hiding someone
in your house?

67
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,800
Where did you bring us?

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,320
- Here?
- Here.

69
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,960
Are you sure?

70
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,640
Fine.

71
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,950
Don't run around.

72
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,160
Where are you going?

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,360
Take his pulse first.

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,200
I'm busy.

75
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,280
Such a geezer.

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,440
Don't mind the place being shabby.

77
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,520
It's good enough that he let us in.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,080
Though he's a geezer,

79
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,470
his medical skills

80
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,080
are very advanced.

81
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm the best veterinarian,

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,190
and he's the best doctor.

83
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,660
On Longyuan Continent,
we are equally famous.

84
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,960
Look at this wall.

85
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,750
It's full of prescriptions
for complex diseases.

86
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,830
I've never seen them before.

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,880
Your illness is a minor issue.

88
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,160
It can be cured quickly.

89
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't worry.

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,190
Cheer up. I'll get you something to eat.

91
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,030
Wait for me.

92
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,280
Your Highness.

93
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,720
That's great.

94
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,110
It's finally cleaned up.

95
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:06,230
A special membrane covered the face.

96
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,440
Although it was corroded by poisons,

97
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,480
it did not damage the underlying skin.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,550
But is there a good way to cover it?

99
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,260
(Sha)

100
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,390
Ziqing,

101
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,450
I didn't expect

102
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,810
to see you again.

103
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,980
How have you been?

104
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,510
That person

105
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,540
didn't take good care of you,

106
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,540
did he?

107
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,420
He made you suffer so much again.

108
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,760
Ziqing,

109
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,890
before I die,

110
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,940
I can see you one more time.

111
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,940
I feel content now.

112
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,540
But why?

113
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,180
Why

114
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,010
am I a person who is about to die?

115
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,690
I really

116
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,100
want to

117
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,980
be by your side

118
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,100
and accompany you forever.

119
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,690
Who are you?

120
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,150
Gu Xi,

121
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,350
he is Xuanyuan Lige,
the Crown Prince of Dongling.

122
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,740
He saved Fourth Princess.

123
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,590
No matter who he is,

124
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,690
trespassing here is a capital offense.

125
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,500
I just want to check

126
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,420
how she is doing.

127
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,550
Why did you come out?

128
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,640
Sha Qiuzi,

129
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,710
what's going on?

130
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,150
Didn't you say

131
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,280
that we're your only patients here?

132
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,950
Get out.

133
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,280
This is my clinic.

134
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,450
It's not your place to speak.

135
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,940
Didn't I tell you not to run around?

136
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,650
You really caused me trouble.

137
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,520
If Fourth Prince blames me,

138
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,320
how can I bear the responsibility?

139
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,160
Doctor Sha,

140
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,060
can you tell me

141
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,670
how she is now?

142
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,570
You two know each other?

143
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,030
We're old acquaintances.

144
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,210
But you still can't...

145
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,030
She's fine.

146
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,300
She'll wake up soon.

147
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,740
What about the mark on her face?

148
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,810
Is there a way to cover it?

149
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,980
I'm also worried about that.

150
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,650
Unless I can find suitable human skin.

151
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,770
If I want to cover it flawlessly,

152
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,420
I can only take skin
from a living person.

153
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,940
Taking skin from a living person
is not easy.

154
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,710
Doctor Sha,

155
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,000
use mine.

156
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,270
You?

157
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,940
Use the skin from my body.

158
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,470
Is that feasible?

159
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,510
No, no.

160
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,770
Taking skin from a living person
is excruciatingly painful.

161
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,350
You are already seriously ill.

162
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,770
How can you endure it?

163
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,570
Anyway, I'm a dying person.

164
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,280
If I can be of some use before I die,

165
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,540
wouldn't that be a worthy death?

166
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,130
No, no.

167
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,130
I can't do something
that trades one life for another.

168
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,030
Doctor Sha,

169
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,890
if you don't agree,

170
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,500
I'll die here in your clinic today.

171
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,060
Losing a valuable case is nothing,

172
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,890
but if people find out

173
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,380
that the Prince of Dongling
died in your clinic,

174
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,130
can you bear the consequences?

175
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,540
Fine.

176
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,710
I agree.

177
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,520
Xuanyuan Lige,

178
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,110
you are terminally ill now.

179
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,030
If you hurt yourself like this,
you'll die.

180
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,000
That's my business.

181
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,090
If Ziqing knew you were doing this,

182
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,980
she would never agree.

183
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,150
That's also my business.

184
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,990
You...

185
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,380
Baili Weisheng,

186
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,820
we are just ordinary friends.

187
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,100
You don't need to feel sorry for me.

188
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,340
I don't have much time left.

189
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,980
This is my last wish.

190
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,780
Baili Weisheng,

191
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,060
Doctor Sha,

192
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,140
I have one more request.

193
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,540
Go ahead.

194
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,100
My body is beyond cure.

195
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,980
Staying here

196
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,140
is unnecessary.

197
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,620
After I'm gone,

198
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,900
don't tell Ziqing this.

199
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,940
I don't want her to know

200
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,620
and feel guilty towards me.

201
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,420
Alright, I promise you.

202
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,180
There's one more thing.

203
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,060
Chu Feiyan took my Xuezheng.

204
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,980
If there's a chance,

205
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,980
please help me get it back.

206
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,420
Aren't we just ordinary friends?

207
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
If we can't meet again in the future,

208
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,060
please give it to Ziqing, okay?

209
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,380
Alright, I promise you.

210
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,980
I will help you get it back.

211
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,220
Thank you.

212
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,500
Doctor Sha,

213
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,100
let's begin.

214
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,420
Alright.

215
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,100
Have a drink?

216
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,460
No need.

217
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,700
Have they searched all the places?

218
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,220
The Crown Prince secretly
sent out hundreds of people

219
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,780
to search around the city.

220
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,840
But we haven't found any trace
of the Fourth Princess of Tianque.

221
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,780
That's strange.

222
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,620
Where could Jun Beiyue have hidden her?

223
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,620
Did they get any information
from Nangong Qianqian?

224
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,220
Princess Qianqian
seems to know nothing about it.

225
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,820
She only wants to see Situ Haonan.

226
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,220
She's about to marry into Xiling,

227
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,700
yet she's still thinking about
another man.

228
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
Such a woman is not fit

229
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,020
to be the Princess Consort of Xiling.

230
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,340
Keep a close eye on her.

231
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,140
Report any news to me immediately.

232
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,380
Yes.

233
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,940
Your Highness,

234
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,860
you guessed right.

235
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,260
Chu Feiyan has been keeping an eye
on Princess Qianqian.

236
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,900
Every word and action of hers
is reported to Chu Feiyan.

237
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,740
Good.

238
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,660
Then let them hear this news.

239
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,380
Yes.

240
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,500
Haonan,

241
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,420
everything is arranged.

242
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,980
Arranged?

243
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,740
Arranged what?

244
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,220
Arranged for you
to help Qianqian regain her freedom.

245
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,100
What are you hesitating for?

246
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,220
If you miss this chance,

247
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,540
you will regret it
for the rest of your life.

248
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,300
Take her away.

249
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,380
Really?

250
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,580
Does he really want to meet me?

251
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,660
Mr. Situ asked you

252
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,940
to keep it quiet

253
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,260
and be careful.

254
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,940
Also, tomorrow at noon,

255
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,540
I will take you to the agreed location

256
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,740
to meet Mr. Situ.

257
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,140
Alright, don't worry.

258
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
I won't tell anyone.

259
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,660
Then I will take my leave.

260
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,220
I heard it with my own ears.

261
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,020
When Nangong Qianqian heard
that Situ Haonan

262
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,100
privately invited her to meet,

263
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,020
she immediately agreed.

264
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,340
Situ Haonan

265
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,580
should know where Han Ziqing is.

266
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,820
Why not go and listen to
what they will say?

267
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,500
As you command.

268
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,260
You may leave.

269
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,100
Yes.

270
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:26,120
(Linze Gate)

271
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Everyone, please look.

272
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,740
This is Mingsha Mountain.

273
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,020
It is the holy land of Xiling,

274
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,180
and also our pride.

275
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,060
Everyone, listen carefully.

276
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,540
This is the sound of singing sand.

277
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,460
It sings once a year,

278
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,540
and the sound is loudest

279
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,420
on the Jiazi day of the month of Jiazi.

280
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,420
Distinguished envoys,

281
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,580
our country's Sand Worship Ritual
will be held in three days.

282
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,260
Please return to your residence first

283
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,340
to take a short rest.

284
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,780
When it's auspicious time,

285
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,580
please join us in the ritual.

286
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,660
Everyone,

287
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,660
please feel free.

288
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,100
The sound of the singing sand

289
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,500
of Mingsha Mountain is the loudest

290
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,900
on the Jiazi day of the month of Jiazi.

291
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,460
It will appear this year.

292
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,820
The Sand Worship Ritual is held
at this time,

293
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,020
which is quite a coincidence.

294
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,060
How is everything?

295
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,900
Your Highness, everything is ready.

296
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:53,940
Go ahead.

297
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,340
I am a bit worried about Ziqing.

298
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,990
You should return to the clinic
immediately

299
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,140
and check the situation.

300
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,100
But Your Highness, what about here?

301
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,980
I have my plan.

302
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,420
Mr. Situ,

303
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,780
this is the entrance to Sand Cave.

304
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,860
Princess Qianqian
has been waiting inside for a long time.

305
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,420
Your Highness.

306
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,460
Your Highness, you are awake.

307
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,180
Her Highness is awake.

308
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Your Highness, you are awake.

309
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,460
Fourth Princess, you are awake.

310
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,660
That's great.

311
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,500
Are you feeling better?

312
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,700
Where am I?

313
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,980
This is my clinic.

314
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,620
Who are you?

315
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,460
I am a doctor.

316
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,140
Thank god,

317
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,620
you're awake.

318
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,620
I've lived up
to Fourth Prince's expectation.

319
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,180
Where is Jun Beiyue?

320
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,300
His Highness is in Xiling
to attend Sand Worship Ritual.

321
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,900
He instructed us
to take good care of you.

322
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,860
If he knew you were awake,

323
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,020
he would be very happy.

324
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,340
Ziqing, do you remember what happened
before you fell unconscious?

325
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,060
Your Highness, look.

326
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
What is going on here?

327
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,740
I have made a human skin mask for you

328
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,700
to completely cover the original mark.

329
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,580
Others won't be able to see it at all.

330
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,200
Fourth Princess, please rest assured.

331
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,340
Whose skin is it?

332
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,540
An old acquaintance of yours.

333
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,220
Someone who was willing to die for you.

334
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,620
Who is it?

335
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,980
Tell me quickly.

336
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,300
Someone who wouldn't live
past 30 years old.

337
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,740
Your Highness.

338
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,180
Stop searching for him, Ziqing.

339
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,020
Don't pull me.

340
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,340
Stop searching for him.

341
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,180
He is already gone.

342
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,660
He said he wouldn't live long anyway.

343
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,780
He just wanted to do something
for you one last time.

344
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,660
He was also the one who saved you
on the ship in Dongling.

345
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,020
I was just wandering around

346
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,660
and heard something happened
in the East Sea.

347
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,740
I happened to save him.

348
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,860
(I heard you were captured by Chu Feiyan,)

349
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,940
(so I wanted to rescue you.)

350
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,500
(But I ended up saving him instead.)

351
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,460
Your Highness,

352
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,620
you're better now.

353
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,980
Where is Fourth Prince?

354
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,900
Why did you come back alone?

355
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,020
His Highness
went to capture Chu Feiyan himself

356
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,260
to retrieve what was snatched.

357
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,980
What did you say?

358
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,780
Qianqian.

359
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,900
Qianqian.

360
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,940
I'm here.

361
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,020
Right here.

362
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,260
Why are you there?

363
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,260
Why did Beiyue choose such a place?

364
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,140
Don't you have anything to say to me?

365
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,220
What do you want me to say?

366
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,380
Don't you know what I want to hear?

367
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Don't you know

368
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,060
what's on my mind?

369
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,620
Situ Haonan,

370
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,180
I regret knowing you.

371
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,580
Chu Tiange treats me well too.

372
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,380
I will have many children with him.

373
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,380
I will be very happy.

374
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,260
I also wish you happiness.

375
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,660
Qianqian,

376
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,580
I don't want you to marry Chu Tiange.

377
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,700
I don't want to marry Chu Tiange either.

378
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,580
You adulterous couple,

379
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,580
since you like being together so much,

380
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,380
then stay in there forever.

381
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
What's going on?

382
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,580
Open the door.

383
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,020
Who is it? Open the door.

384
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,620
- Open the door.
- Is anyone there?

385
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,740
Is anyone there?

386
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,140
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

387
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,380
Open the door!

388
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,620
Chu Feiyan,

389
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,740
you finally appeared.

390
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,940
Jun Beiyue.

391
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
Open the door.

392
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,460
It seems like Beiyue's voice.

393
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,100
Beiyue, we are here.

394
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,180
- Beiyue!
- Fourth Prince!

395
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,580
What if I don't?

396
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,420
You're still so stubborn
at the brink of death.

397
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,660
Then today, let's settle

398
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,020
both new and old scores.

399
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,900
What scores

400
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,180
do I have with you?

401
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,220
You don't know what scores we have?

402
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,320
Under your arrangement,

403
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,180
Situ Haonan had a secret meeting
with Nangong Qianqian.

404
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,220
Princess Qianqian is supposed
to marry into Xiling.

405
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,300
If this matter gets out...

406
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,780
At this point,

407
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,340
do you think

408
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,420
you can still leave here alive?

409
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,500
This is Xiling.

410
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,460
If something happens to me in Xiling,

411
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,060
my father

412
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,940
will not let it go.

413
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,780
Are you threatening me?

414
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,900
Take her down.

415
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,540
Kill me

416
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,460
if you have the guts.

417
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,940
Do you think I will let you die
so easily?

418
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,700
Fine.

419
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,620
Since you won't let me go,

420
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,420
let's perish together.

421
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,340
Why did it suddenly collapse?

422
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Let's get out first.

423
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,860
Oh no, what about Fourth Prince?

424
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,980
Didn't see him inside.

425
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,540
Quick, call someone to help search.

426
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,380
Go.

427
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,820
Catch them.

428
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,740
- Catch them.
- Oh no.

429
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,990
- Don't let them escape.
- Someone's coming.

430
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,740
If they discovered

431
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,990
I was meeting with you in private...

432
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,300
Don't be afraid. We can elope together

433
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,180
- to wander the world.
- I can't.

434
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,500
This will implicate you all.

435
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,860
Father will hunt us down.

436
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,220
I can't betray Tieyan.

437
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,300
Silly girl,

438
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,660
do you think
that by marrying into Xiling,

439
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,420
Tieyan will no longer have any wars?

440
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,940
Once the western defense line
is established,

441
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,880
your father will definitely
plan an eastern expedition.

442
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,860
You are just a pawn to them.

443
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,420
Go with me. I will never abandon you.

444
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,300
Go.

445
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,940
Be careful.

446
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,060
Go.

447
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,980
That way.

448
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,300
Catch them.

449
00:32:59,060 --> 00:32:59,900
That way.

450
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,100
Qianqian, come on. Get up quickly.

451
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:19,660
Hurry, hurry.

452
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,540
Chase them.

453
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,220
Quickly.

454
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,700
Quickly.

455
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,220
Chase them.

456
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,420
Ziqing?

457
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,780
Chu Tiange,

458
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
hello again.

459
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,460
Han Ziqing.

460
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,940
What are you doing here?

461
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,940
Surprised, aren't you?

462
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,380
Release them immediately.

463
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,180
What if I don't?

464
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,020
Han Ziqing,

465
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,300
you dare to blow up
the walls of Xiling's border?

466
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,340
Does Tianque want to declare war
on Xiling?

467
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,100
So what if we declare war?

468
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,220
Do you dare to accept the challenge?

469
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,740
You are

470
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,380
simply too much.

471
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,700
What exactly do you want?

472
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,540
What do I want?

473
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,340
You and Chu Feiyan kidnapped me.

474
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,260
What did you intend to do?

475
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,100
- Shadow.
- Here.

476
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,340
Take them away.

477
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,180
Yes.

478
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,580
- Capture them for me.
- Go.

479
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,540
Yes.

480
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,100
Hurry up.

481
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,220
Go.

482
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,420
You...

483
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,260
Stop.

484
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,460
If you don't want your walls
to be blown to pieces,

485
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,820
ask Chu Feiyan to see me.

486
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,260
If you want to find her, go to Nanzhao.

487
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,340
Why come to me?

488
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,260
I know

489
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,260
she is in Xiling now.

490
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,540
If you refuse to admit it,

491
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,660
I will find her on my own.

492
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,260
What is this place?

493
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,580
The ancestors of Xiling

494
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,100
built this secret chamber
to imprison rebels.

495
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,940
I knew before I activated the mechanism

496
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,780
that we wouldn't be able to get out.

497
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,340
Do you see those bones?

498
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,300
It has only one passageway here.

499
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,860
It's the way of coming in

500
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,380
but not getting out.

501
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,860
Your Highness,

502
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,860
this is the place Mr. Situ mentioned.

503
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,820
Master, I have arranged for them
to set off the firebombs

504
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,820
to delay Chu Tiange.

505
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:11,300
I can't open it.

506
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,500
Explode it.

507
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,620
Come on.

508
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,700
Everyone else, retreat.

509
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,500
Do you think I'll spare you?

510
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,460
You're blown out.

511
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,260
Where is Jun Beiyue?

512
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,780
Why are you here?

513
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,980
Why are you here?

514
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,620
Your face.

515
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,540
Your face...

516
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,660
Surprised?

517
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,420
Han Ziqing,

518
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,460
you are an Islander.

519
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,580
If you have the guts, don't rely on men.

520
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,220
Fight me one-on-one.

521
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,340
You're in such a state
and still want to duel?

522
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,420
Where is Jun Beiyue?

523
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,420
You should be torn to pieces.

524
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,780
I will kill you.

525
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,100
I will kill you!

526
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,500
Beiyue,

527
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,540
are you alright?

528
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,460
I'm glad to see you're fine.

529
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,980
She is

530
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,740
from the Isolated Island.

531
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,300
The totem on her face...

532
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,460
Why is your totem gone?

533
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,980
What totem?

534
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,660
What are you talking about?

535
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,420
I saw it with my own eyes.

536
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,580
I saw a big and ugly totem

537
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,740
on your face.

538
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,780
I saw it with my own eyes.

539
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,140
When did you see it?

540
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,860
That day

541
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,340
when I kidnapped you.

542
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,300
Shut up.

543
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,700
Chu Feiyan,

544
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,580
haven't you caused enough trouble?

545
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:04,020
Just now, Chu Feiyan admitted

546
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,660
she had kidnapped Ziqing.

547
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:08,500
Prince Xiang,

548
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,260
how should we

549
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,340
settle this?

550
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,420
Fourth Prince,

551
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,180
Fourth Princess just blew up

552
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,660
the walls of Xiling.

553
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,660
I think it can be even.

554
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,460
Even?

555
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,260
Do you think I don't know

556
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,940
why you kidnapped Fourth Princess?

557
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,380
That's right.

558
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,900
We did kidnap her and intended

559
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,940
to use her to blackmail you.

560
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,380
But so what?

561
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:49,900
It seems

562
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,900
you don't have any leverage
to negotiate with us.

563
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,420
After all, we hold a huge secret
