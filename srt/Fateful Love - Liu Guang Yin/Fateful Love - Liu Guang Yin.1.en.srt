(Jungle at the border of Cong)

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,480
What happened?

23
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,810
What is it?

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,890
- Gu Xi?
- Over there.

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
What happened?

26
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,610
Are you okay?

27
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,410
That giant snake was terrifying.

28
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,600
It didn't even give me a chance to react.

29
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,810
If it weren't for you,

30
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,330
I'd be done for this time.

31
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,490
Thanks to you, everyone is safe.

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
She's had professional training.

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,130
No wonder she's so quick and agile.

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,520
I was so scared that my legs went weak.

35
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,240
A biotech company has commissioned me

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,360
to assist in finding rare biological resources.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,930
This place is dangerous.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,160
We should move quickly.

39
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,490
Get the job done and get out of here soon.

40
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,410
I'll lead the way.

41
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,640
Gu Xi, you cover the rear.

42
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
All right.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
What's going on?

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,880
Why is there such a strong abnormal signal?

45
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Look over there.

46
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,330
Is that a cave ahead?

47
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,050
Wait here.

48
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,200
I'll go in and check it out.

49
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,880
Gu Xi, protect them.

50
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,170
Got it.

51
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,730
(Why is there a dagger here?)

52
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,610
Why is she lying here in broad daylight?

53
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,360
Who is she?

54
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,760
Why is she lying here in such a mess?

55
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,450
She's pretty.

56
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,690
Let's go. Stop staring.

57
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,570
So indecent.

58
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,540
(Looks like I've been saved.)

59
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,790
Han Ziqing.

60
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,130
You wretched girl.

61
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,730
Just wait till I...

62
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,800
Madam.

63
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,640
Are you all right?

64
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,690
You dare kick me?

65
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,410
(Where am I?)

66
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,530
Who are you?

67
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,760
Who am I?

68
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,260
Don't play dumb.

69
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
Han Ziqing,

70
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,240
(Han Ziqing?)

71
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,040
how could you dress like this

72
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,970
in broad daylight

73
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,130
and engage in such shameful behavior
at Grandeur Palace?

74
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,760
Don't you have any decency left?

75
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,410
What's wrong with you?

76
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,610
What's wrong with me?

77
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Everyone,

78
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,730
please judge for yourselves.

79
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,640
Even though she's not my own daughter,

80
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,970
my husband and I have treated her

81
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,570
with love and care,

82
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,130
providing her with a sufficient life.

83
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,520
Now look at what you've done today.

84
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,690
Such a shameless act.

85
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,800
How could you face your father

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,610
or your deceased mother?

87
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,450
How could she do this?

88
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,480
Today, I'll discipline you

89
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,290
for your father.

90
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,040
Take her back.

91
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,290
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

92
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,500
(Yunlai Inn)

93
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,290
Go.

94
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,600
She's good.

95
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,410
Hurry back and get someone.

96
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,730
- Quickly, go.
- Yes, ma'am.

97
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,250
What are you doing?

98
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:39,890
Don't come any closer.

99
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,760
Stay back.

100
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,760
Who are you?

101
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,600
Still pretending?

102
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,130
Don't come near me.

103
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,320
Stop crying.

104
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,440
I'm punishing her right now.

105
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,010
Go to sleep.

106
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,320
Sleep well now.

107
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,010
(Am I)

108
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,170
(dreaming?)

109
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,880
This is getting interesting.

110
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,040
Well done.

111
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,370
Let's see how your father will punish you.

112
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,370
(Even if this is a dream,)

113
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,440
(no one gets to bully me.)

114
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,000
What are you doing?

115
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:10,690
Madam.

116
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,610
Let go of me.

117
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,560
Where's Han Xi'er?

118
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,400
Take me to her.

119
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,730
I don't know.

120
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,050
- Move.
- Miss Ziqing,

121
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,970
let go.

122
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,050
Is she Miss Ziqing?

123
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,520
She doesn't even dare to raise her voice.

124
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,880
How could she suddenly change so much?

125
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,410
No time for that.

126
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,760
Hurry, go find the Chancellor.

127
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Right away.

128
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
(Chancellor's Mansion)

129
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,250
Something's wrong.

130
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,680
Miss Ziqing has gone mad.

131
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,850
She hit the Madam.

132
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,760
Easy. Easy.

133
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,930
Go get help.

134
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,770
Hurry.

135
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,810
Quickly.

136
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,200
Miss Xi'er ordered us to close the gate.

137
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Open up.

138
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,610
The Madam's back.

139
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,450
Open up.

140
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,640
The Madam's outside.

141
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,130
Open up.

142
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,720
Madam.

143
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,010
- Madam.
- Open the gate.

144
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,930
Dear,

145
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
Xi'er, open up.

146
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,930
Han Ziqing,

147
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,390
how dare you lay hands on me?

148
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,490
Wait until your father gets back.

149
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,930
He will teach you a lesson.

150
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,770
Stop talking nonsense.

151
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,200
Xi'er, are you in there?

152
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,610
Xi'er, help me.

153
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,810
Come out quickly.

154
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,250
(This Han Ziqing is really pitiful.)

155
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,970
(She lost her mother at a young age,
and is bullied)

156
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,930
- ( by her stepmother and sister.)
- Xi'er,

157
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,880
- open up now.
- (Her father just stands by and does nothing.)

158
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,440
- Xi'er.
- (Since they think I'm her,)

159
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,410
- (today,)
- Xi'er.

160
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,120
(I'll stick up for you.)

161
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,250
Han Ziqing,

162
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,560
let me go,

163
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,410
or I'll...

164
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:34,890
Or you'll what?

165
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,170
Aren't you tired from all that acting?

166
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,250
Should I help you cool off

167
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,610
- by taking off another layer?
- No. Don't.

168
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,050
- Please.
- Take it off.

169
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,490
Take it off.

170
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,330
Take it off.

171
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,890
Please don't.

172
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,490
How is Han Ziqing supposed to be chosen

173
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,930
as a Princess Consort after this scandal?

174
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,760
I bet Han Xi'er has something to do with this.

175
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,420
Han Xi'er,

176
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,520
open the gate,

177
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,880
or I won't let your mother off easily.

178
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,370
- Xi'er.
- Miss Xi'er,

179
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,680
you should go check on her.

180
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,250
The Madam might be in danger.

181
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,760
Ziqing is acting terrifyingly.

182
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,730
Help your mother.

183
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,880
She's trying

184
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,580
- to drag me down with her.
- Xi'er, open up.

185
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,250
- I'm not falling for it.
- Help.

186
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,900
The Fourth Prince is about
to select his consort.

187
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,880
Xi'er.

188
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,850
If I ruin my reputation over this...

189
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,970
Open up.

190
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,080
How will I ever be chosen?

191
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,880
But she's screaming your name

192
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,000
in front of the whole town.

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,450
That's going to damage your reputation too.

194
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,560
- I...
- Yes.

195
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,080
Where's Father?

196
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,970
Why isn't he back yet?

197
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,890
My Lord.

198
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,060
Be careful.

199
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:41,290
Dear.

200
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,080
Please help me.

201
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,490
Why are you dressed like this?

202
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,730
Let go of your mother, Ziqing.

203
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,520
She took my outerwear.

204
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,770
What are you standing there for?

205
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,640
Didn't you hear me?

206
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,990
Do you want to embarrass yourself more?

207
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,210
Embarrass myself?

208
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,050
You don't even know what happened,

209
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,610
so how do you know it's me who's embarrassed

210
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,170
and not them?

211
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,010
You...

212
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,880
Why don't you ask your wife and daughter

213
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,520
what they did to me

214
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,810
last night?

215
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,640
What are you staring at me for?

216
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,610
I don't know anything.

217
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,850
I didn't do anything.

218
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,440
She's holding me hostage right now.

219
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,280
Ziqing,

220
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,730
let go of your mother.

221
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,730
Let's go inside and talk.

222
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,610
You must maintain some dignity
in public.

223
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,440
Dignity?

224
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,970
After all they've done to me,

225
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,120
you still care about your dignity?

226
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,960
You...

227
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,730
How dare you speak to me like that?

228
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,880
She humiliated me
and falsely accused me in public.

229
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,320
It got ugly.

230
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,250
It's too late

231
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,970
to talk about dignity.

232
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,850
No matter what happened,

233
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,200
it doesn't justify you holding her hostage.

234
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,120
Release her and get in now.

235
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,610
- Let go. Let me go.
- Did you hear me?

236
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,760
And if I don't?

237
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,170
If you don't,

238
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,490
don't blame me for not being considerate.

239
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,440
When have you ever been considerate?

240
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,880
Look at her.

241
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,410
My whip.

242
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,520
Will you let go or not?

243
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,610
What are you waiting for?

244
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,640
Strike her.

245
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,610
Bring Han Xi'er out,

246
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,370
or I won't let her go.

247
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,370
Ziqing,

248
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,640
this is a family matter.

249
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,520
Let us not settle it in public.

250
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,320
Let's go inside and discuss it.

251
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,760
Release her,

252
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,250
and I'll get

253
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,250
to the bottom of this.

254
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,120
I promise not to take sides.

255
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,250
Bring out Han Xi'er,

256
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,520
and the truth will be clear.

257
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,970
Get her out.

258
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,810
Open the gate

259
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,730
and let Xi'er out.

260
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,370
Quickly, come out.

261
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,090
Father,

262
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,500
what's going on?

263
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,890
Mother.

264
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,800
- Mother, what happened to you?
- Don't call me that.

265
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,810
Han Ziqing,

266
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,280
what did you do to my mother?

267
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,410
Tell everyone

268
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,970
what you did.

269
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,330
I...

270
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,170
What happened?

271
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,010
Speak up.

272
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,520
I didn't do anything.

273
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,120
Yesterday, you took me to Grandeur Palace

274
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,290
and forced me to drink.

275
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,250
After I passed out,

276
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,410
you left me there alone.

277
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,520
What were you planning?

278
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,560
That's what happened.

279
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,810
What was that about?

280
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,570
Father,

281
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,810
I indeed took Ziqing to Grandeur Palace

282
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,250
to check the accounts.

283
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,930
The night was cold,

284
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,760
so I offered her a few drinks to warm up.

285
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,250
She couldn't hold her liquor

286
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,540
and passed out after just a few cups.

287
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,290
So I had Shopkeeper Chen arrange a fine room

288
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,560
for her to rest

289
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,200
and left after making sure
everything was in order.

290
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,880
I have no idea

291
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,080
why she ended up like this today.

292
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,050
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

293
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,970
If you don't believe me,

294
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,170
you can ask the shopkeeper.

295
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,070
- Yes.
- That's right.

296
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,850
Ask the shopkeeper.

297
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,810
- That's right.
- Just ask him.

298
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,650
Yes.

299
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,290
My Lord.

300
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,900
My Lord,

301
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,520
kill me now.

302
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,680
It's my fault.

303
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,730
I'm to blame.

304
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,200
What's the matter?

305
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,640
Speak up.

306
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,810
Last night, the inn was full.

307
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,640
The son of Lord Chen

308
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,340
demanded a room,

309
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,680
and not knowing Miss Ziqing was inside,

310
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,440
so I let him have it.

311
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,560
This morning, when they cleaned up,

312
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,930
they didn't recognize Miss Ziqing,

313
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,020
so,

314
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,450
they...

315
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,160
they just threw her out.

316
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,930
Please, my Lord.

317
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,370
Show mercy.

318
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,210
The son of Lord Chen?

319
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,560
Who is this Chen?

320
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
Chancellor.

321
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,120
Chancellor.

322
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,320
Chancellor.

323
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,310
Chancellor.

324
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,490
Chancellor.

325
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,160
I'm the one to blame.

326
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,770
I deserve to die.

327
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,610
Who are you?

328
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,650
I'm Chen Xu.

329
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,640
I was assigned the room last night.

330
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,160
I thought

331
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,040
the woman inside was an escort,

332
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,610
so I was disrespectful.

333
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,250
I didn't know

334
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,320
she was your daughter, my Lord.

335
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,160
You...

336
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,210
You...

337
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,490
You vile creature.

338
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,160
Chancellor.

339
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,400
Please punish me.

340
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,910
But I didn't know anything about it.

341
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,250
Spare my life, Chancellor.

342
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,280
(That's not right.)

343
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,680
(That wasn't the man I saw last night.)

344
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,490
(What are they playing at?)

345
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,330
My Lord,

346
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,770
please,

347
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,850
marry your daughter to me.

348
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,400
- I promise...
- Shut up.

349
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,130
(So dramatic.)

350
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,040
This is all about

351
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,650
being the Princess Consort.

352
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,240
(So it's about the Princess Consort selection.)

353
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,770
Even if she's illegitimate,

354
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,370
how could she do that to her?

355
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,210
Xi'er,

356
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,320
look at what you've done.

357
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,650
Don't you feel sorry for your sister?

358
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,520
Father,

359
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,650
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,970
I caused her trouble.

361
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,130
Ziqing,

362
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,490
please forgive me.

363
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,890
It is all my fault.

364
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,530
Go ahead and be mad at me.

365
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,370
Is that so?

366
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,970
- You...
- Miss Xi'er.

367
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,010
What a big slap.

368
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,010
Your father is right.

369
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,640
All of this

370
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,370
is indeed your fault.

371
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,800
Did you not see that?

372
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,080
That's right.

373
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,440
It is all my fault.

374
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,850
It is all my fault.

375
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,920
Ziqing,

376
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,400
after you marry into the Chen family,

377
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,770
I will definitely make it up to you.

378
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,850
You want me to marry into the Chen family?

379
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,330
Forget it.

380
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
Ziqing,

381
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,070
now,

382
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,250
you can only preserve your reputation

383
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,040
by marrying into the Chen family.

384
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,850
Ziqing,

385
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,280
Xi'er already apologized.

386
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,560
Could you

387
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,180
spare her some face in public?

388
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,080
I did spare her face.

389
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,040
You heard it just now

390
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,530
she told me to do it.

391
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,250
I just did what she wanted.

392
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,080
My hand hurts from the slapping.

393
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,370
So be it.

394
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,730
What are you looking at? Just leave.

395
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,920
Get out of here.

396
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,080
- Just go.
- Go away.

397
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,520
It's over now.

398
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,280
Just leave.

399
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,400
Go.

400
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,010
Go away.

401
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,040
Miss Ziqing,

402
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,970
I'm sorry for what I've done to you.

403
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,200
But I have a true heart for you,

404
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,040
Miss Ziqing.

405
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,760
A true heart?

406
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,000
Give him a knife.

407
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,160
Take out your heart and show it to me.

408
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,000
Get lost.

409
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,690
I'm hungry.

410
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,780
I need to eat.

411
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,160
Han's legal daughter tried
to set her sister up.

412
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,370
How despicable.

413
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,610
It's odd.

414
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,730
She survived the Moxun Poison.

415
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:42,810
Investigate her.

416
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,280
(Even the mansion is luxurious,)

417
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,680
(but for the poor Han Ziqing,)

418
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,560
(it's like a living hell.)

419
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,010
- Ziqing.
- Mother.

420
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,340
- Don't call me Mother.
- Tell me, what exactly happened?

421
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,890
Did you have an improper relationship

422
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,010
with Chen?

423
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,320
Why didn't you come out earlier?

424
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,730
I'm really worried.

425
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,200
What exactly happened?

426
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,570
You…

427
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,040
- Ziqing.
- My face hurts so much.

428
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,330
You deserve it.

429
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,490
I…

430
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,490
Why are you still here?

431
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,330
Get out.

432
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,640
Yes, Madam.

433
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:22,730
Go.

434
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,160
Just leave.

435
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,220
Ziqing,

436
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,900
I...

437
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,980
- Go on.
- Your behavior.

438
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,900
Ziqing,

439
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,100
it was all Xi'er's fault today.

440
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,100
She made a mistake.

441
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,860
But you have to think about the reputation

442
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,820
of our family, right?

443
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,740
Since Chen is willing to marry you

444
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,460
and you have already...

445
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,700
He seems sincere,

446
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,620
so why not...

447
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,340
You want me to marry Chen

448
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,220
to cover up

449
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,100
for Han Xi'er's scandal?

450
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,980
How is this my scandal?

451
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,820
Clearly,

452
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,980
it's yours.

453
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,980
Being schemed against is disgraceful,

454
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,980
but the schemer remains respectable?

455
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,100
Enough.

456
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,460
Stop arguing.

457
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,380
Say no more.

458
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,460
I...

459
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,340
Ziqing,

460
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,340
at this point,

461
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,500
even if you don't
consider our family's reputation,

462
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,340
you must think about your own future.

463
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,620
I think

464
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,460
marrying Chen

465
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,220
would be the best outcome for you.

466
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,060
Don't you think so?

467
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,500
If it's such a wonderful outcome,

468
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,940
why don't you let your own daughter marry him?

469
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,780
You...

470
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:14,940
It's you who had
an improper relationship with Chen.

471
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,620
A virtuous woman is loyal to one man.

472
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,060
It's for your own good.

473
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,860
Exactly.

474
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,140
Besides, everyone knows

475
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,020
that Chen will be your husband.

476
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,660
You'll have to marry him

477
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,740
whether you want to or not.

478
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,580
Enough.

479
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,740
Ziqing,

480
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,140
don't be stubborn.

481
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,860
I'll prepare a generous dowry for you

482
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,660
to ensure you'll be well off in the future.

483
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,380
It's nothing

484
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,620
for you to worry about.

485
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,020
Worry about your own.

486
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,860
You...

487
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,260
Dear,

488
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,260
it came up so suddenly.

489
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,900
We should give Ziqing

490
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,840
some time to prepare.

491
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,620
Xi'er,

492
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,620
get your sister a cup of tea to calm her down.

493
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,640
Quickly.

494
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,700
Ziqing,

495
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,420
it was just

496
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,500
a misunderstanding.

497
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,990
Drink this tea

498
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,380
and let it go.

499
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,140
When you're married into the Chen family,

500
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,620
remember to visit us often.

501
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,140
We've always treated you well,

502
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,980
haven't we?

503
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:47,740
Exactly.

504
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,900
She accepted it.

505
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,180
It's okay now, dear.

506
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,180
- You...
- I don't know if it's poisoned.

507
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,020
You...

508
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,620
All these years,
you never treated me like a person,

509
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,180
insulting me as you pleased.

510
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,060
Yesterday, you humiliated me,

511
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,740
and today you think

512
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,060
a cup of tea can settle everything?

513
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,440
You may not be self-aware,

514
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,900
so I'll make it clear.

515
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,170
From now on, I'll make my own decisions.

516
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,240
Don't try to manage me.

517
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,870
This place is luxurious.

518
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,780
Miss Ziqing,

519
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,970
what are you doing here?

520
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,020
Hurry back,

521
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,900
or you'll be punished again.

522
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,020
Hurry and leave.

523
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,340
Miss Ziqing.

524
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,660
Are you all right?

525
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,460
This is where I live?

526
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,020
Yes. We always live here.

527
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,820
Miss Ziqing,

528
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
have some rest.

529
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,060
I'll prepare the meal.

530
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,260
(This maid named Yun Xi)

531
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,260
(seems to be the only one here)

532
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,060
(who genuinely cares for Han Ziqing.)

533
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,980
(I never thought)

534
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,260
(I'd have a mother, even in a dream.)

535
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,500
(Han Ziqing's birth mother must have)

536
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,380
(been a gentle and kind person.)

537
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,180
Miss Ziqing, the meal is ready.

538
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,260
Just this?

539
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:18,500
Yes.

540
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,260
I secretly added an egg for you.

541
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,260
Do you have any silver jewelry
or a silver needle?

542
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,150
Why do you need that?

543
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,000
To test for poison.

544
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,260
Poison?

545
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,780
I made this bowl of noodles for you.

546
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,060
How could there be poison?

547
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,060
Miss Ziqing,

548
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,940
if you don't trust me, I'll try it for you.

549
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,300
No need.

550
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,540
Look at the time.

551
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,060
Second Prince,

552
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,900
why hasn't the Fourth Prince arrived yet?

553
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,460
(Anyone who took the Moxun Poison)

554
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,660
(is certain to die.)

555
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,820
(He won't show up for sure.)

556
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,700
If you have something to say,

557
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,120
just say it.

558
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,780
Yes, Your Majesty.

559
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,700
We already sent someone for him
from his mansion.

560
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,460
Perhaps the Fourth Prince
got drunk last night

561
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,580
and overslept.

562
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,660
Father,

563
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,180
I believe we should reconcile

564
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,180
with Xiling.

565
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,100
In your opinion,

566
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,180
how should we reconcile with Xiling?

567
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,900
Through marriage.

568
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,460
The Fourth Prince arrives.

569
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,300
Greetings, Father.

570
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,340
I was handling some official business
this morning,

571
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,190
so I'm late.

572
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,540
I beg for your forgiveness, Father.

573
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,340
Rise.

574
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,340
I just overheard the Second Prince

575
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,220
mentioning the idea
of forming an alliance with Xiling by marriage.

576
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,420
We won the battle,
and now we need that to secure peace?

577
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,780
Could it be that the Second Prince

578
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,820
has taken a liking to the princess of Xiling?

579
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,420
There's no need to be embarrassed.

580
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,580
If you truly desire this,

581
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,820
I'll flatten all of Xiling

582
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,300
to fulfill your wish.

583
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,820
Enough.

584
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,180
Since we've won the battle,

585
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,900
let's discuss the terms

586
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,460
for negotiating with Xiling.

587
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,460
Useless.

588
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,180
Mother.

589
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,350
Please, calm down, Mother.

590
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,740
Mother,

591
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,260
how could this be?

592
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,900
He took the Moxun Poison,

593
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,260
but how is he still alive and well

594
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
in the palace today?

595
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,620
Could the poison

596
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,900
have been fake?

597
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,260
Impossible.

598
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,260
It was specially sent by your Aunt

599
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,740
Consort Qin from Nanzhao.

600
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,780
Once taken,

601
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,620
it should kill within a few hours.

602
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Could he have used some trick

603
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,740
to avoid drinking it?

604
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
That's unlikely, Mother.

605
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,540
I saw him drinking the poisoned liquor

606
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,180
and staggering out of the palace yesterday.

607
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,100
Could it be

608
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,380
that he found an antidote?

609
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,020
No way.

610
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,140
Consort Qin told me

611
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,380
that this poison has no cure.

612
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,740
Mother,

613
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,180
if Jun Beiyue

614
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,140
chooses the Chancellor's daughter
as his consort in a few days,

615
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,860
and allies with the Chancellor...

616
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,660
Mother.

617
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,620
Have you heard

618
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,980
that there was quite a scene

619
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,660
at the Chancellor's today?

620
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,540
What happened?

621
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,300
I heard that Han's illegitimate daughter

622
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,340
was thrown out of Grandeur Palace

623
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,100
in broad daylight.

624
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,900
She was in disarray,

625
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,140
and her reputation is ruined.

626
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,900
Rumor has it

627
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,520
that she is stunningly beautiful.

628
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,610
In fear of being outshined

629
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,580
and to secure her position
as the Fourth Prince's consort,

630
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,580
Han Xi'er schemed
to ruin her sister's reputation.

631
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,020
If this is true...

632
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,090
If it's confirmed,

633
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,340
Han Xi'er won't
be the Fourth Prince's consort for sure.

634
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,500
Mother,

635
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,340
we mustn't ignore this.

636
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,500
We should

637
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,300
help solidify this accusation.

638
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,100
Excellent.

639
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,260
(It seems like)

640
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,140
(I'm in a state similar to being hypnotized.)

641
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,300
(The paintings and inscriptions in the cave)

642
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,420
(have created a kind of suggestion.)

643
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,260
(Guided by the green light,)

644
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,780
(I've fallen into this designated dream.)

645
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,180
(So, once Gu Xi and the others find me,)

646
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,780
(they should be able to wake me up.)

647
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,300
(Yes, that must be it.)

648
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,340
(But what if they can't find me?)

649
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,820
(How long will this dream last?)

650
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,340
(No way.)

651
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,420
(I can't just sit back and do nothing.)

652
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,140
(I have to save myself.)

653
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,580
(But what's the key command to wake up?)

654
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,260
(The cave paintings...)

655
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,700
(The green light...)

656
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,020
The dagger.
