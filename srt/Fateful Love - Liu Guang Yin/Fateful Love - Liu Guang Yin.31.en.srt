(Yue)

22
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,140
(Yue)
It's late at night.

23
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,480
Why are you sitting here?

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,770
Aren't you afraid of catching a cold?

25
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,400
Greetings, Madam Wan.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
You may rise.

27
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,320
Did I scare you?

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,720
No.

29
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,020
(Yue)

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,560
This is

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,160
Beiyue's handkerchief.

32
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,600
This was used to bandage his hand
when he was injured last time.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,960
(Yue)
I have washed it clean.

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,190
I haven't had the chance to return it
to His Highness yet.

35
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,030
Why are your eyes red?

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,320
Did you suffer any grievances?

37
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Don't be afraid.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,030
Tell me, and I will stand up for you.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,240
It's nothing, Madam Wan.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,520
I just got some sand in my eyes.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,910
It will be fine in a moment.

42
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,910
Thank you, Madam Wan.

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,720
It's so late. Why haven't you rested?

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,080
I can't sleep,

45
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,270
so I just take a walk in the yard.

46
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,360
If you are not sleepy either,

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,750
would you like to chat with me?

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
I am new here.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,270
There are many things
I need to learn from you.

50
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,240
Please don't say that, Madam.

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,770
I am just a maid.

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,670
There's no need to talk about learning.

53
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,110
Madam Wan, just feel free to ask me.

54
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,110
Come on, sit down to talk.

55
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,000
I've been away for so many years.

56
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,470
I don't know Beiyue

57
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,720
as well as you people around him do.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,390
But as his mother,

59
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,630
I want to know more about him.

60
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,320
I want to do something for him.

61
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,080
If you

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,960
want to help me,

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,550
why don't you tell me
about Beiyue's past?

64
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,200
Madam Wan,

65
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,470
it was Fourth Princess
who saved me and brought me in

66
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,670
when she's already in the Mansion.

67
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,320
I am not very clear
about His Highness' past.

68
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,670
But after being in the residence
for so long,

69
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,600
I have gone through a lot
with Fourth Princess.

70
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,160
His Highness...

71
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,720
There's not much unusual,

72
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,110
except that Miss Situ
is quite troublesome.

73
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,350
Who is Miss Situ?

74
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,040
She is the daughter
of the Lord of Jian'an City.

75
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,790
Situ Haonan is her biological brother.

76
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,290
She likes His Highness.

77
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,230
Therefore, she always targets against
Fourth Princess.

78
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,640
Every time she is present,

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
it becomes very lively.

80
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
This is quite interesting.

81
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,110
Ziqing was betrothed to Beiyue

82
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,110
by the King.

83
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,440
What more tricks
could she possibly play?

84
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,480
Madam, you might not be aware

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,880
that Miss Situ

86
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,720
was ill-mannered.

87
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,200
She once spent the night
in His Highness' military tent

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,880
and got caught red-handed
by Fourth Princess.

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,670
She just used this as an excuse

90
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,790
to badger His Highness often.

91
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,670
Although Fourth Princess was upset,

92
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,950
she didn't stoop to her level.

93
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,550
I see.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,070
Madam Wan,
please do not tell anyone else.

95
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,440
Otherwise, if my master finds out,

96
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,770
it's my fault for talking too much.

97
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,160
Don't worry.

98
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,040
I won't tell anyone.

99
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,600
Thank you, Madam Wan.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,070
Well,

101
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,950
you're such a considerate
and clever child.

102
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,510
If you ever feel wronged in the future,
come to me,

103
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,440
and I will stand up for you.

104
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,350
Thank you, Madam Wan.

105
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,390
Let's go. Accompany me for a walk.

106
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,230
Greetings, Mother.

107
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,830
Son, there's no need to be so formal.

108
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,670
Come on, Beiyue.

109
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,350
Mother, what are you doing?

110
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,110
Beiyue, look.

111
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,480
Is this good?

112
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,440
I don't know

113
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,480
much about women's belongings.

114
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,720
This is my favorite piece of jewelry.

115
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,070
I want to give it to Ziqing.

116
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,950
Mother,

117
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,670
Ziqing

118
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
doesn't like these things.

119
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,760
Since it is your cherished item,

120
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,720
you should keep it well.

121
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,160
I want to discuss something with you.

122
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,350
What is it?

123
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,270
You and Ziqing haven't had
the wedding ceremony, right?

124
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,000
This is your fault.

125
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,230
Ziqing is such a wonderful girl.

126
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,040
We must not treat her unfairly.

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,880
How about this?

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,070
I will arrange the wedding for you.
Is that alright?

129
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,760
Actually, this is also
a bit of my selfishness.

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,000
I couldn't be by your side
when you were young.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,110
I always felt that I owed you.

132
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,510
Although I can't reveal my identity now,

133
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,000
and I can't openly sit in the position
of mother-in-law

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,660
to drink the tea
that my daughter-in-law serves me.

135
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,480
But if I can personally arrange for you

136
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,760
and see you get married,

137
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,760
I will have no more regrets.

138
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,440
Beiyue,

139
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,320
let me do something for you, alright?

140
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,350
Thank you, Mother.

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,830
I think it's better for me

142
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,320
to discuss it with Ziqing.

143
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,070
Alright, I'm so glad

144
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,670
that you can agree with me.

145
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,190
It's done.

146
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,760
Where did you get it?

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,880
This is my mother's cherished item.

148
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
She asked me to come over

149
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,670
to personally put it on you.

150
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,270
Since it's your mother's cherished item,

151
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,720
I cannot accept it.

152
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,760
I'll return it later.

153
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,320
Since it is her kind gesture,

154
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,350
you should accept it.

155
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
Alright then.

156
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,440
I'll thank her in person later.

157
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,630
There's one more thing.

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,000
My mother wants
to personally organize our wedding.

159
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,520
Isn't this too much trouble?

160
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,290
Aren't we doing just fine now?

161
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,680
Are we?

162
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,200
We now live together every day.

163
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,040
It's quite enjoyable.

164
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,400
Is a wedding that important?

165
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
Isn't it important?

166
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
No.

167
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,400
Don't you think there's a bit strange
between us?

168
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,320
I don't think so.

169
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,160
What's so strange about it?

170
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,110
Can't you understand
what I'm asking you?

171
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,670
I am asking you very seriously.

172
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,400
Since you entered the Mansion,

173
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,910
in front of everyone,

174
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,520
you are Fourth Princess indeed.

175
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,400
But whenever it's just the two of us,

176
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,470
you keep avoiding me

177
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,440
and the feelings between us.

178
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,520
You don't even want me to touch you.

179
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,840
Han Ziqing, look at me.

180
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,280
Do you know what you did before

181
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,710
and the attitude you just showed

182
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,670
made me feel like
you don't care about me at all?

183
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,840
If you don't want the wedding,

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
it's okay.

185
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,350
Just take it
like nothing happened just now.

186
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,030
(Since you entered the Mansion,)

187
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,080
(in front of everyone,)

188
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,000
you are Fourth Princess indeed.

189
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,910
But whenever it's just the two of us,

190
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,150
(you keep avoiding me)

191
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,110
(and the feelings between us.)

192
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,400
Do you know what you did before

193
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,710
made me feel like
you don't care about me at all?

194
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,200
Your Highness,

195
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,880
Fourth Prince
doesn't want to see anyone.

196
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,550
Stay out of our marital affairs.

197
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,240
(Jun Beiyue,)

198
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,310
(all along,)

199
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,280
(I have lived as if I were lucid
in the world.)

200
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,910
(I have been cautious
and self-disciplined.)

201
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:23,070
(But now,)

202
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,470
(at this moment,)

203
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,200
(I want to be willful for you
just this once.)

204
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,470
(No matter what the future holds,)

205
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,720
(at least)

206
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,390
(I have no more regrets.)

207
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Why are you coming over here?

208
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,390
I do.

I don't need you to serve me here.

238
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,960
If you have nothing to do,

239
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,110
just talk to me.

240
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,230
Fourth Princess

241
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,470
is truly fortunate
to have a good girl like you

242
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,640
by her side.

243
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,230
It's also my fortune to be able

244
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,440
to be by their side,

245
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,400
and by your side.

246
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,280
You treat me so well.

247
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,920
I'm even more fortunate.

248
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,280
Such a sweet talker.

249
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,880
I like you more.

250
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,880
Only if you can

251
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,470
take good care of Beiyue and Ziqing,

252
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,350
I will be relieved.

253
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,470
I will do my best.

254
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,880
How does Fourth Princess
usually treat you?

255
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,160
She treats me very well.

256
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,470
I guess so.

257
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,310
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be so loyal to her.

258
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,880
By the way, you came at the right time.

259
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,640
Help me check this out.

260
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,590
I asked the butler

261
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,430
to give me a record book.

262
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,350
The people above

263
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,990
are all high-ranking officials and nobles
who have been doing good with us.

264
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,350
Can you take a look for me?

265
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,230
It would be best
if there are no mistakes or omissions.

266
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,070
Yes.

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Court of Justice, Zhang Family.
Dongjiang, Murong Family.

268
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,710
Jian'an City.

269
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,950
Situ Family.

270
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,110
(Jian'an City)

271
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,950
Madam Wan,

272
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,070
look at this.

273
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,980
(Jian'an City)

274
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,760
Jian'an City.

275
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,430
It's my fault for being careless.

276
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,070
I almost made a mistake.

277
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,430
Luckily, you noticed it.

278
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,560
Quickly have the butler remove it.

279
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,400
Yes.

280
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,920
Madam Wan, you have been busy

281
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,070
with His Highness' wedding.

282
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,680
You must have been too tired,

283
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,230
which got you careless.

284
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,680
The invitations
haven't been sent out yet.

285
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,520
It's not a big deal.

286
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,360
Ten.

287
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,190
Madam Wan, this is not acceptable!

288
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,680
Come here.

289
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,950
It's all thanks to you.

290
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,230
Consider this
as a token of my appreciation.

291
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,070
If you don't accept it,

292
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,590
I will be sad.

293
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,760
Thank you, Madam Wan.

294
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,590
Alright, you may leave.

295
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,120
Yes.

296
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,470
Your Highness,
does this waistline fit well?

297
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,190
Do you want me to make some alterations?

298
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,070
No need.

299
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,910
I think it's quite good.

300
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,160
Your beauty is unique.

301
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,760
You are the most beautiful bride
I have ever seen.

302
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,640
Why are you so sweet today?

303
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,430
Later, let His Highness reward you well.

304
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,760
Your Highness, I'm serious.

305
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,920
Or you can ask His Highness later.

306
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,600
Your Highness.

307
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,640
Your Highness, look.

308
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,310
Isn't she the most beautiful bride?

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
What are you staring at?

310
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,400
Do I look bad?

311
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,230
If you look bad,

312
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,790
in this world,

313
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,070
is there anyone who looks good?

314
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,350
I want to change the color
of this wedding dress.

315
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,190
Can I?

316
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,430
What color do you want to change it to?

317
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,150
White.

318
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
And make the hemline a bit larger,

319
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,520
add a layer of gauze on top,

320
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,590
open the neckline to here,

321
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,880
then put a veil on the head.

322
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,950
That won't do.

323
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,400
Whatever color she likes,

324
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,880
we will change it to that color.

325
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
However large she wants
the neckline to be,

326
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,640
we will make it as she wishes.

327
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,640
Because,

328
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
no matter how you dress,

329
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,360
you always look beautiful.

330
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,040
I'm just kidding.

331
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,040
Even if I dare to wear it,
no one dares to make it.

332
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,000
If you dare to wear it,

333
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,430
I dare to look.

334
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,070
Come on.

335
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,000
This is how we dress at my place.

336
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,430
You always talk about your place.

337
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,070
The wedding is tomorrow.

338
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,360
Are you nervous?

339
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,430
I have seen all kinds of big scenes.

340
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,670
What is there to be nervous about?

341
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,760
Why?

342
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,950
Are you nervous?

343
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,430
Look at their decoration.

344
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,640
How beautiful it is!

345
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,520
Do you want to eat it?

346
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,160
Have a bite.

347
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,040
Have a bite.

348
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,310
Looks so beautiful.

349
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,160
All look beautiful.

350
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,000
There's more here.

351
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
Which one is better to eat?

352
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,230
Hurry up, eat it!

353
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Eat some.

354
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,710
- Forget it.
- Save some room in your stomach.

355
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,070
I'll enjoy it myself then.

356
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,430
Let me ask you.

357
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,310
It's Fourth Prince
and Fourth Princess' wedding.

358
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,700
Have you prepared a congratulatory gift?

359
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,800
At most, I'll prepare
a horse treatment prescription.

360
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,990
The prescription to treat a horse?

361
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,560
It's their big day.

362
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,350
Are you going
to give them a prescription?

363
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,430
You don't understand.

364
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,280
I feel embarrassed to eat this meal.

365
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,680
Do you think anyone can just get

366
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,190
my horse treatment prescription?

367
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,910
Oh my.

368
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,430
Who cares.

369
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,400
Do you know
that my prescriptions are priceless?

370
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,640
Alright. Stop restraining yourself.

371
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,520
Eat some.

372
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,360
Don't be shy.

373
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,160
Don't be shy anymore.

374
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,640
I've told you to be reserved.

375
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,280
Who's looking at you?

376
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,990
Stop restraining yourself.
Just eat something.

377
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,880
Alright. I'll just enjoy it myself.

378
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
Senior Brother, look.

379
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,070
Is it going to snow?

380
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,400
Madam Wan.

381
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,800
Madam Wan.

382
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Although His Majesty did not come,
he sent a congratulatory gift.

383
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,590
Have all the guests arrived?

384
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,920
Every guest on the list has shown up.

385
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,470
Madam Wan,
it's almost the auspicious time.

386
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,310
Let's go over there.

387
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,720
Alright.

388
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,430
Though I can't personally
preside over his wedding,

389
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,110
I would be so satisfied

390
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,310
to be able to watch him from afar
as he's finishing the wedding ceremony.

391
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,270
Let's go.

392
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,830

Lord Situ has arrived.

478
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,830
It has nothing to do with me.

479
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,670
Alright.

480
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
Let's go take a look.

481
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,240
Let's go.

482
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,120
Let's continue drinking.

483
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,590

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,760

485
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,600
Come on.

486
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,560
Today is my wedding.

487
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,800
Thanks for your coming,

488
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,350
Lord Situ and Mrs. Situ.

489
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,430
Father, Mother,

490
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,400
why have you come here?

491
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,800
We are now one family.

492
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,160
Fourth Prince,
there's no need to be so distant.

493
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,720
One family?

494
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,030
What do you mean?

495
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,160
Although my daughter is to marry
into your mansion as a concubine,

496
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,640
according to the rules,
she cannot have a wedding ceremony.

497
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,280
But she'll serve the same husband
with Fourth Princess.

498
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,430
Your Highness,

499
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,280
how can you not care at all?

500
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,160
When did I ever say

501
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,000
I would take Xin'er as a concubine?

502
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,550
Fourth Prince,

503
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,590
what do you mean by this?

504
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,560
A few days ago,

505
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,680
the Mansion of Fourth Prince

506
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,990
proposed the marriage to Jian'an City.

507
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,530
For the sake of Xin'er's reputation,

508
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,350
- I don't know.
- we endured the humiliation

509
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,470
and agreed with you

510
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,230
even if she's becoming a concubine.

511
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,070
Now are you questioning me instead?

512
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,050
Are you saying

513
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,000
my mansion has proposed the marriage
to Jian'an City?

514
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,230
Jun Beiyue,

515
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,000
how can you still deny it?

516
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,190
Do you think Jian'an City is weak?

517
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,030
Mother.

518
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,000
Mrs. Situ,

519
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,070
do you have any evidence
for the marriage proposal?

520
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,590
Is it your place to speak here?

521
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,560
So lack of manners.

522
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,990
The Mansion of Fourth Prince
doesn't follow these rules.

523
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,070
Lord Situ,

524
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,520
you are a wise person.

525
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,590
May we take a look
at the marriage proposal letter?

526
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,280
There was no written letter.

527
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,230
But the Mansion of Fourth Prince
sent someone to Jian'an City

528
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,710
to convey
Fourth Prince's verbal promise.

529
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,430
It was said that after the wedding,

530
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,680
he would immediately marry Xin'er.

531
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,550
Lord Situ,

532
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,550
Mrs. Situ,

533
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,230
there must be
some misunderstanding here.

534
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,130
At that time, Xin'er stayed overnight
in my military tent.

535
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,880
But Xin'er and I

536
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,710
were pure and innocent, like siblings.

537
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,300
Secondly,

538
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,070
my mansion has never proposed marriage
to Jian'an City.

539
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,040
I have no intention
of taking a concubine.

540
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,400
I hope you two can understand.

541
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,160
Lord Situ, Mrs. Situ,

542
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,950
we have written a letter

543
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,230
to explain the misunderstanding

544
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,350
of the military tent.

545
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,280
Now it is evident that someone
is taking advantage of it

546
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,190
to stir up trouble.

547
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,470
This move is up for no good.

548
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,160
You two are wise people.

549
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,000
I hope you can calm down.

550
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,310
We must not let the villains succeed.

551
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:44,710
Father, Mother,

552
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:46,640
I have mentioned this to you before.

553
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,590
It was a misunderstanding.

554
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,880
I will investigate thoroughly

555
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,160
who is causing trouble behind the scenes

556
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,190
to give you two

557
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,000
- an explanation.
- Alright.

558
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,070
I hope so.

559
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,040
Why did it go wrong?

560
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,890
Let's think about it.

561
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,070
Who will benefit

562
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,710
when Lord Situ causes trouble here?

563
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,240
No matter who it is,

564
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,310
even if we can find this person,

565
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,770
but the hidden danger
remains unresolved,

566
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,000
it may happen again.

567
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,640
If you don't want this matter
to be used by others,

568
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,680
there is a way

569
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,680
of solving it once and for all.

570
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,280
What solution do you have, Mother?

571
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,950
Tell me about it.

572
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,800
Since you have a history with Miss Situ,

573
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,590
and her brother is your close friend,

574
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,310
why don't you take her as a concubine?

575
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,590
This way, no one will trouble you
with the overnight stay issue.

576
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,430
Mother,

577
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,040
please don't say that anymore.

578
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,000
Besides Ziqing,

579
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,760
I will never marry anyone else.

580
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,380
Beiyue,

581
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,640
it's quite normal for men
to have some concubines.

582
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,830
Moreover, there is a reason for this.

583
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:57,760
I believe that Ziqing will also agree.

584
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,190
I don't agree.

585
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:01,730
What did you say?

586
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,830
I will

587
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,950
never share a husband with others.

588
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,800
You...

589
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,310
Mother, don't worry.

590
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,190
I will investigate this thoroughly.

591
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,880
There are still guests
waiting for us outside.

592
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,590
Let's go over there first.

593
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,240
Ten,

594
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,110
what are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

595
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,710
I was worried about Madam Wan,
so I came to check on her.

596
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,160
Her Highness just left like that,

597
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,830
which made Madam Wan embarrassed.

598
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,280
How heartbroken Madam Wan must be.

599
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,700
What does this have to do
with Her Highness?

600
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,450
On such a joyous day,
things have turned out like this.

601
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,990
Her Highness should be the one
who feels uneasy.

602
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,950
What are you laughing at?

603
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,230
Are you happy about all this commotion?

604
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:01,070
No, I'm not.

605
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,550
Listen,

606
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,310
Madam Wan is crying so sorrowfully.

607
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:08,470
Her Highness was truly inconsiderate.

608
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,310
You shut up.

609
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,320
I think
Her Highness did nothing wrong.

610
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Ten, watch your words and actions.

611
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,390
You are working for Her Highness.

612
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,760
What does it mean
to speak towards others?

613
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,640
Madam Wan,

614
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,490
since things have come to this point,

615
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,150
don't be angry now.

616
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,230
Come on. Have a cup of tea
to soothe your throat.

617
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,630
You're so considerate.

618
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,270
Unlike them.

619
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,880
Madam,

620
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,040
Fourth Prince and Fourth Princess
share a deep affection.

621
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,280
Others can't get involved in them.

622
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,560
Madam, it's better

623
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,520
not to mention it again in the future.

624
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,190
I was considering the bigger picture.

625
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,360
I thought it would be the best ending.

626
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,360
But Beiyue and Ziqing

627
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,320
misunderstood me.

628
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,470
Madam, don't blame yourself.

629
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,870
You were doing for their good.

630
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,600
They will understand
your good intentions.

631
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,840
You are such a sensible child.

632
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,670
You know how to comfort me.

633
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,910
If Beiyue had a good girl like you
by his side

634
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,800
to give him advice and take care of him,

635
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,840
it would truly be his blessing.

636
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,230
As long as you forgive me
for being clumsy,

637
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,710
I will
serve His Highness wholeheartedly.

638
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,120
Where is this place?

639
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,960
Here

640
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,100
is called Xinqing Pavilion.

641
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,670
Xinqing Pavilion?

642
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,080
I specially prepared this

643
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,230
for our wedding.

644
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,990
Do you like it?

645
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,360
Yes.

646
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,180
♪When the drifting clouds
fall in love with the fierce wind♪

647
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:47,610
♪Only then will you
understand the pain of parting♪

648
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,690
♪ Love is too deep, but it's hard
to bear the weight of longing ♪

649
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,230
I'll take you inside to have a look.

650
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,070
Let's go.

651
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,460
♪Blame the heavens
for deliberately teasing♪

652
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,940
♪Making our encounter too brief♪

653
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,620
(Xinqing Pavilion)

654
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,190
♪A promise♪

655
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,600
♪Who promised to ride across the world♪

656
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,020
♪Crossing the vast desert sands♪

♪Deceiving me

♪What kind of punishment is this♪

659
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:32,060
♪Who left behind a touch of makeup♪

660
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,910
♪Like quicksand, slipping

♪In a fleeting moment, only

662
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,710
Ziqing,

663
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,360
you chose to be with me.

664
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,360
Will you regret it?

665
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,600
Being able to be with you

666
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,870
is the best choice.

667
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,670
I have no more regrets in this life.

668
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,710
Your Highnesses,

669
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,230
Madam Wan is ill.

670
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,150
Let's go and check on her.

671
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,420
(West Yard)

672
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:03,900
Mother,

673
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,710
how do you feel?

674
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:07,270
I'm fine.

675
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,630
I'm just anxious.

676
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:11,750
Beiyue,

677
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,520
it's all my fault.

678
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,040
I shouldn't have made such a suggestion

679
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,180
to put you in a difficult situation.

680
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,840
It's all my fault.

681
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:19,430
It's okay, Mother.

682
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:20,790
Ziqing,

683
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,840
I thought you wouldn't mind.

684
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,230
I didn't consider it thoroughly.

685
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,470
I was also doing it for your good.

686
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,470
I can understand your thoughts.

687
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,560
I just can't accept it.

688
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,150
Mother, it's okay.

689
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:35,990
It's already over.

690
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,390
Don't take it to heart.

691
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,120
Ziqing is right.

692
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,190
It's all in the past now.

693
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,000
Let's not mention the past anymore.

694
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,080
Exactly, Mother.

695
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,920
That's just a minor issue.

696
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,520
You should rest well.

697
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,600
We won't disturb you anymore.

698
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,400
Let's go.

699
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,440
Madam Wan,

700
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,470
now you can rest assured.

701
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,630
I told you
that His Highness wouldn't blame you.

702
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,150
Beiyue is my son.

703
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:24,000
I have nothing to worry about.

704
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Are you worried about Fourth Princess?

705
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,430
After all, Ziqing and I have spent
only a short time together.

706
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,350
We still don't fully understand
each other's temperaments.

707
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
Even if she still holds a grudge
against me in her heart,

708
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,760
she will not tell me.

709
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,430
Madam Wan, don't worry.

710
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,840
I will help you persuade her later.

711
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
You are an elder.

712
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
She will understand.

713
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,470
In a family,

714
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,560
if a woman is too dominant,

715
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,600
it can easily lead to household unrest.

716
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,470
Good girl,

717
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,870
just tell me one truth.

718
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,120
Do you like Beiyue?

719
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,440
Madam Wan,

720
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,270
I...

721
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,280
I have been through this before.

722
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:09,800
I know clearly

723
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,910
what you are thinking.

724
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,280
Aren't you
still keeping Beiyue's handkerchief?

725
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,880
Don't worry.

726
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,190
Since I have known what's on your mind,

727
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,910
I will help you.

728
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,670
After all, I like you.

729
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,160
But

730
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,710
His Highness said

731
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,630
that apart from Fourth Princess...

732
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,470
After all, I am
Beiyue's biological mother.

733
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,840
He will listen to me anyway.

734
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,670
As long as you can serve him well,

735
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,800
I will do my best to persuade him.

736
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,840
How do you plan to resolve

737
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,910
the issue of Jian'an City?

738
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,120
I'm still investigating
who sent the letter.

739
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
As for Xin'er,

740
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,320
I'll find her a good marriage match

741
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,470
and let Father

742
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,160
grant her

743
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,670
so she can have a grand wedding.

744
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,150
The idea is quite good.

745
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,000
But what if she refuses?

746
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,840
It has already come

747
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,280
to this point.

748
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,360
If she remains stubborn,

749
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,520
she truly is a foolish girl.
