00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,470
Have those children

22
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,310
all been settled?

23
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,960
Your Highness, rest assured.

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,440
I have followed your instructions

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,550
and gathered them in a house
in the suburbs.

26
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,960
to practice riding and archery
every day.

27
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,680
They all cherish this opportunity
very much.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
They are very diligent.

29
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,480
Have you taught them the method
of making fire bombs?

30
00:02:08,965 --> 00:02:09,694
Yes.

31
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,280
Among these children,

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,870
Gu Xi is the smartest one.

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,990
I gave him your method

34
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,040
of making firebombs.

35
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,870
Unexpectedly, he mastered
all the essentials.

36
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,200
He is even more proficient than I am.

37
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,270
That's good.

38
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,990
I hope you and Gu Xi

39
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,230
can become my capable assistants.

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,710
Thank you, Your Highness.

41
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,070
I will serve you with my life.

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,600
Please rise.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,160
Your Highness.

44
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,350
Give it to me.

45
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,280
- You may leave now.
- Yes.

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,150
Your Highness, I can do it myself.

47
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,760
Didn't you tell me
that you can't play the qin?

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,480
You lied to me again.

49
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,590
I was telling the truth this time.

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,150
I didn't know how to play it.

51
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,320
Then according to you,

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,240
Lige

53
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,790
was cheating to let you win.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,630
That's not the case.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,230
But for some reason,

56
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
I didn't

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,120
understand music at all,

58
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,400
but as soon as I placed my hands
on the qin,

59
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,070
I felt like I could play it.

60
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,590
Han Ziqing,

61
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,630
are you fooling me

62
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,480
like a three-year-old child?

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,870
Believe it or not.

64
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,710
I'm telling the truth.

65
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,470
What did you say?

66
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,320
I said I was telling the truth.

67
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,560
Believe it or not, Your Highness.

68
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,230
I am also telling the truth.

69
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,560
I didn't expect

70
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,840
that you could use the bet

71
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,960
to solve the bordering land issue.

72
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,600
Now that I have won,

73
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,630
where is the dagger?

74
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Rest assured,

75
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
I will keep my promise.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,990
I will bring the dagger
to the autumn hunt tomorrow

77
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,470
and reward you.

78
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

79
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,990
Remember to apply the medicine
on time.

80
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,750
Don't worry about that.

81
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,510
General,
you're guarding the Western Pass.

82
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,190
Without the King's decree, how dare
you return to the city privately.

83
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,510
Aren't you afraid
the King will punish you?

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
How would Father know

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,070
that Uncle has returned
to the Royal City?

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,630
Unless

87
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,120
you go to

88
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,880
report it.

89
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Now, you two

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,790
are allies of our Xiling.

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,190
This autumn hunting

92
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,440
is truly a perfect opportunity

93
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,630
for us to achieve our big plan.

94
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,960
Otherwise, I wouldn't have you
rushed back overnight, General.

95
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,000
Is your plan reliable?

96
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,230
Rest assured, General.

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,120
My armored soldiers

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,790
have already disguised themselves.

99
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,840
They are ambushed
near the hunting ground.

100
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
They will not fail.

101
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,150
Uncle.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,190
I had the fortune
to have met the armored soldiers.

103
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,530
They are all death warriors with poison

104
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,000
and have extremely high
martial arts skills.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Jun Beiyue

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
is doomed.

107
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,720
Once we kill Jun Beiyue,

108
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,910
Tianque will be yours, Second Prince.

109
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,070
You must fulfill the conditions

110
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,030
you promised me one by one.

111
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,470
Prince Xiang, rest assured.

112
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,160
As long as I ascend the throne,

113
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,720
whether it's the bordering land
or the seven states in the north,

114
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,910
Xiling can pass through it freely.

115
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,190
Our two countries
will strengthen military cooperation,

116
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,030
and trade exchanges.

117
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,800
The two countries
will maintain good relations,

118
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,590
and never infringe upon each other.

119
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
Someone.

120
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,800
Prince Xiang.

121
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,190
Uncle.

122
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,510
Let's toast

123
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,510
to our success in this great endeavor.

124
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,070
Please, Prince Xiang.

125
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,790
The hunt begins.

126
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,030
Your Majesty.

127
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,030
(Great.)

128
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,790
(Finally, I can go back today.)

129
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,310
Eighth Prince.

130
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,230
Eighth Prince.

131
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,160
Eighth Prince.

132
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,750
What is that sound?

133
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,470
Did you hear it too?

134
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,120
What's wrong?

135
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,230
What happened?

136
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,230
This sound is so strange.

137
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,190
Report.

138
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,510
Report, someone is attacking.

139
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,430
- Someone is attacking.
- Protect the King.

140
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,550
Protect the King.

141
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,510
Run quickly.

142
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,400
Protect the King.

143
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,550
- Quick, quick.
- Beichen, hurry.

144
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,390
Quick, protect the King.

145
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,200
Protect the King.

146
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,480
Quick, protect the King.

147
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,510
Run quickly.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,240
(Where did these soldiers come from?)

149
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,840
Guard the King and retreat first.

150
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,310
Quick, escort the King away.

151
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,150
Go.

152
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,430
Kill.

153
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,640
Your Highness.

154
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,750
It seems they are coming for me.

155
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,960
Help me protect the Princess Consort.

156
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,800
Yes.

157
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,470
Your Highness!

158
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,600
- Chase him!
- Yes!

159
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
- Go!
- Go!

160
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,360
(Is he seeking death?)

161
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,880
(No.)

162
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,240
(I haven't had the dagger yet.)

163
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,080
(I can't let him die.)

164
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,200
Let's go!

- Chase him.
- Quickly.

How is it?

169
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
Are you confident?

198

(I finally woke up.)

199
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,720
Am I back?

200
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,310
Why am I not back yet?

201
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,630
Take me home.

202
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,120
(What does this mean?)

203
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,840
(Why can't I go back?)

204
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,800
(Could it be a mistake in operation?)

205
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,160
Take me home. Take me home.

206
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,510
(Do I need to recite some spells?)

207
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,080
Jun Beiyue.

208
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,150
Jun Beiyue.

209
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,910
Jun Beiyue.

210
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Jun Beiyue.

211
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,240
Jun Beiyue.

212
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,120
Are you alright?

213
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,680
Come on, get up.

214
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,710
Come on.

215
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,350
How are you?

216
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,590
I'm fine.

217
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,630
Those armored soldiers from yesterday,

218
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,470
who exactly were they?

219
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,000
Why were they so ruthless?

220
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,470
Those people

221
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,870
are all death warriors.

222
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,870
They have no thoughts of their own,

223
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,160
but to follow orders and kill.

224
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,110
There must be a spy in Tianque now.

225
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,680
We should hurry back
as soon as possible.

226
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,440
How do we get up there?

227
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,110
Luckily, those branches saved us.

228
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,880
I'll go find a way out.

229
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,360
Stay here and don't wander around.

230
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,430
Alright, be careful.

231
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,200
We need to fill our stomachs first
though we're rushing back.

232
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,910
Your Highness,

233
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,150
I didn't expect you to know
how to set up a tent.

234
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,550
You can roast chicken and rabbits.

235
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,720
Why can't I know how to set up a tent?

236
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,190
I'm different from you.

237
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,600
I grew up in hardships.

238
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,240
But you are the prince.

239
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
Do you think leading an army
is just about giving orders?

240
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,200
It's roasted.

241
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,110
Come and eat.

242
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,630
It smells so good.

243
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,800
Here.

244
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,990
It tastes really good.

245
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,600
It's roasted quite well.

246
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,440
Of course.

247
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,790
Be careful with that wound.

248
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,750
Thank you.

249
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,840
For what?

250
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,880
For risking your life to save me.

251
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,190
Did you ever think

252
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,430
that you might die with me?

253
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,270
I didn't think much.

254
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,320
But,

255
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,640
this time,

256
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,550
I didn't come just for you,

257
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,550
but also for myself.

258
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,870
For yourself?

259
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,560
To

260
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,160
go home.

261
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,870
Your home now is at the Mansion
of Fourth Prince.

262
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,910
Are you referring to

263
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,470
the Chancellor Han's Mansion?

264
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,470
None of those are my real home.

265
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,630
How many secrets are you still hiding?

266
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,430
If I tell you my secrets,

267
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,110
will you believe me?

268
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,960
As long as you tell me,

269
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,960
I will decide whether to believe or not.

270
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,480
Alright.

271
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,910
Listen.

272
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,390
My home

273
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,240
is not on the Longyuan Continent.

274
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,390
I don't know how I got here,

275
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:31,270
and I don't know how to go back.

276
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:33,750
Originally,

277
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,600
I had thought of a way to go back,

278
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,720
but

279
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,270
I've tried for a long time.

280
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,600
I don't know

281
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,480
how to go back.

282
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
This method seems to be wrong too.

283
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,840
Since you've been here,
just settle down.

284
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,230
Things happen

285
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,070
for a reason and come to an end.

286
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,480
You can't be rushed.

287
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,840
I can't be rushed?

288
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,910
Take me back.

289
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,780
What are you doing, Your Highness?

290
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,150
My Princess Consort
is really interesting.

291
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,720
It's getting late now.

292
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,990
We have to hurry on the journey
tomorrow morning.

293
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,150
Go to sleep quickly.

294
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,230
Your Highness, you sleep first.

295
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,430
Why is it still not right?

296
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,720
Please, please.

297
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,120
Mami Mami Hong.

298
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:24,870
What?

299
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,880
Open Sesame.

300
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,960
Take me home.

301
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,840
It works.

302
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,300
(Maybe it doesn't have to be
so troublesome.)

303
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,790
(Just sleep and it will be fine)

304
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,390
(when I wake up.)

305
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,640
I want to go home.

306
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
(Please.)

307
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,150
(This time it must be a success.)

308
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:02,240
Why am I still here?

309
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,150
Why are you so useless?

310
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,790
Didn't you promise to take me back?

311
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,430
Please, I'm begging you.

312
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,240
Let's try again.

313
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,240
It must be a success, okay?

314
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,080
It must be a success.

315
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,910
Please take me back.

316
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Try again.

317
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
We will succeed.

318
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,030
Let's do it again.

319
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,240
Why are you praying to a dagger

320
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,520
early in the morning?

321
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,360
What are you doing?

322
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,600
I am praying.

323
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,550
I hope for world peace.

324
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,360
What time is it now?

325
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,880
Aren't we supposed to hurry back?

326
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,840
Get up quickly.

327
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,680
Let's go.

328
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,840
Hurry up.

329
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,670
Let me see.

330
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,270
It's okay.

331
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,080
How to get up there?

332
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,320
Follow me.

333
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,290
(Since I've been here,
just settle down.)

334
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,110
(It seems)

335
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,000
(I can only wait for it to happen.)

336
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,430
(She cares so much about the Liuguang.)

337
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,640
(There is a totem of the Isolated Island
on the Liuguang.)

338
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,270
(And she is immune to all poisons.)

339
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,560
(It seems she is undoubtedly
from the Isolated Island.)

340
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,190
(She keeps saying she wants to go home.)

341
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,440
(Does she mean)

342
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,640
(the Isolated Island?)

343
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,270
Your Highness.

344
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,600
Why are you looking at me?

345
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,910
It seems you really like this dagger.

346
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,320
It's called Liuguang.

347
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,760
If you truly like it,

348
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,600
I can gift this dagger to you.

349
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,800
Really?

350
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,390
Yes.

351
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,640
But isn't it a memento left
by your mother?

352
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,790
You saved my life,

353
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,720
so just consider it a gift of gratitude.

354
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,890
Here.

355
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,670
Look, this dagger is very suitable
for a woman.

356
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,880
Since it was left by my mother,

357
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,780
I believe she wouldn't mind passing it
to her daughter-in-law.

358
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,800
(Great.)

359
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,670
(Now I can study it thoroughly.)

360
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,840
Alright.

361
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:03,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

362
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,310
I will take good care of it.

363
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,840
But you must promise me one thing.

364
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,680
Go ahead.

365
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,390
From now on,
you must not hide anything from me.

366
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,900
When have I ever hidden anything
from you?

367
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,910
At the Judicial Office, you managed
to escape on your own.

368
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,790
It is not something
an ordinary woman could do.

369
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,790
And in your competition with Chu Feiyan,

370
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,430
you surprised me a lot.

371
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Besides, you saved me

372
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,430
and helped me guard the bordering land.

373
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,760
So from now on,

374
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,600
you must not hide anything from me.

375
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,390
We need

376
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,440
trust.

377
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,800
Alright.

378
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,230
Rest assured, Your Highness.

379
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,550
I will pay my allegiance to you
from now on.

380
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,910
Allegiance?

381
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,070
Do you want to be my soldier?

382
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,870
Yes.

383
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,520
As long as it's something I can do,

384
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,480
I will do my best.

385
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,600
Your Highness,

386
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,240
actually, there's something
I'm curious about.

387
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,790
It's about your mother.

388
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,670
What kind of person was she?

389
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,720
Before I can remember,

390
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
she was already gone.

391
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,190
Then your days in the palace before

392
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,100
must have been quite difficult.

393
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,790
Any slight mistake

394
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,720
may cost me my life.

395
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,670
Since I was 14 years old,

396
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,990
I have been asking Father for permission

397
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,910
to lead troops into battle.

398
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,790
At that time, it was not
for fame or status,

399
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,680
but to survive.

400
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,760
I also wanted a peaceful
and stable life,

401
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,880
but our Tianque's national strength
is not strong.

402
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,720
Besides Nanzhao and Tieyan,

403
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,720
the greatest threat to Tianque

404
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,840
comes from Dongling and Xiling.

405
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,760
Xiling has always occupied
Tianque's territory,

406
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,600
and Dongling

407
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,270
has never given up on its ambition
to revive for many years.

408
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's coveting the bordering land.

409
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,550
The only thing I want to do

410
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,430
is to protect Tianque's territory,

411
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,910
so that the people of Tianque

412
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,390
do not become displaced.

413
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,600
Commander,

414
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,710
how is it? Any news?

415
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,000
The soldiers of the Thirteen Riders

416
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,120
went out in four or five groups,

417
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,200
but none have found His Highness

418
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,300
or the Fourth Princess Consort.

419
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,960
Could it be that His Highness has...

420
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,800
Watch your mouth!

421
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,640
His Highness will be fine.

422
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,320
Pass my order.

423
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,800
Continue searching for them.

424
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,560
If they can't find His Highness,

425
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,720
- do not return to camp.
- Yes.

426
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,330
How did the war suddenly break out?

427
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,760
Yesterday,
the armored soldiers attacked.

428
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,670
The Fourth Prince is likely
in grave danger.

429
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,790
What should we do?

430
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,430
The King has arrived.

431
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,840
Your Majesty.

432
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,360
Father.

433
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,190
General Dugu Xianyun of Tieyan

434
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,120
suddenly led an army of 100,00
to press the western border.

435
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,070
General Ouyang,
who guards the Western Pass,

436
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,960
only has 50,000 troops.
It's truly dangerous.

437
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,050
Father, Please issue an order

438
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,820
to mobilize Beiyue's White Tiger Army

439
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,790
to assist General Ouyang.

440
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,560
Second Prince,

441
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,240
the battle has not yet begun.

442
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,670
Why assume defeat already?

443
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,760
With 50,000 against 100,000 troops,

444
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,910
what are the chances of victory?

445
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,790
Now it's not clear
if the Fourth Prince still survives.

446
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,360
But you're trying
to take his military power first.

447
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,790
What's your respect to His Majesty?

448
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,580
It's not clear if Beiyue still survives.

449
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:31,430
Tianque is also
at the brink of survival.

450
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,790
Are we to disregard the safety
of Tianque's people?

451
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,990
Do we really have to fight
with a ratio of five to ten?

452
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,360
It's true that Tieyan
is invading our western border.

453
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,600
But it will still take some time.

454
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,670
How can you be so sure

455
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,240
that the Fourth Prince will not return?

456
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,190
Those armored men came
with ill intentions.

457
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,560
Do you think

458
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,360
my fourth brother
can still come back alive?

459
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,390
What should we do now?

460
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,310
Yes.

461
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,360
What should we do?

462
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,150
Could it be that the Fourth Prince
won't return?

463
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,680
Father,

464
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,790
you saw it yourself on the day.

465
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,240
Those armored men

466
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,190
were targeting Beiyue.

467
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,070
Have you found out yet?

468
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:20,360
Who exactly sent those armored men?

469
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,720
Just as the armored men
launched their sneak attack,

470
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,670
Tieyan invaded.

471
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,760
It must be Tieyan who sent them.

472
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,790
We Tianque have always

473
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:34,120
adhered to the principle
of not attacking unless being attacked.

474
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,480
We have never had any conflicts
with Tieyan.

475
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,310
They dare to launch
such an unprovoked attack this time.

476
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,760
It is truly outrageous.

477
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,720
Yes.

478
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,550
So we must fight back

479
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:45,720
and leave them with no survivors.

480
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Beichen,

481
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,720
are you determined
to take Beiyue's military power

482
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,030
for your uncle?

483
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,190
Father, you misunderstand me.

484
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,670
It's not that I want
Beiyue's military power.

485
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,070
Only the White Tiger Army in the north
is closest to the west border now.

486
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,600
There is no other way.

487
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,160
Your Majesty,

488
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,840
if we mobilize the troops
from the northern border,

489
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,100
the northern border will be in danger.

490
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,910
Prince Xiang and Princess Feiyan
of Xiling

491
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,120
are still in the envoy courtyard.

492
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:26,190
If they hear about this,

493
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,070
can you bear the responsibility?

494
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,270
Father,

495
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,860
I am willing to lead the troop
to guard the western border

496
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,000
and protect Tianque's territory.

497
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,120
This is a great opportunity.

498
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,360
Your Majesty,

499
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,990
if the Second Prince leads the troops,

500
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:49,840
to assist General Ouyang,

501
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,000
we can definitely defeat Tieyan.

502
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,880
Your Majesty,

503
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,430
it must not be delayed.

504
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,430
I hope you can make a decision now.

505
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,910
Please make a decision, Your Majesty.

506
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,310
Father, please issue the decree

507
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,600
to hand the Tiger Tally over to me.

508
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,190
I guarantee

509
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,520
to retreat the Tieyan troops
within a month.

510
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,190
Report.

511
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,390
Urgent report from the western border.

512
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,560
General Dugu Xianyun of Tieyan

513
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,150
is leading 3,000 elite soldiers
in the vanguard.

514
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,110
They are only 50 miles
from the western border.

515
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,510
What...

516
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,040
What should we do now?

517
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,520
Father, please issue the decree

518
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,650
to order the White Tiger Army
to support the western border

519
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,000
and reinforce General Ouyang's army.

520
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

521
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,860
- Please reinforce the army.
- Please reinforce the army.

522
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,730
Please reinforce the army.

523
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,750
Someone.

524
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,520
Draft the decree

525
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,960
to appoint the Second Prince
as General of the West

526
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,080
who can mobilize 10,000 troops
from the outskirts of Tianque

527
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,720
to aid the western border,

528
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,390
and to deploy the White Tiger Army
from the north to support the northwest.

529
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,230
Father.

530
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,040
To take command of the White Tiger Army,

531
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,150
I need Sima Xun, the leader
of the Thirteen Riders

532
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,110
to join me.

533
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,390
Approved.

534
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:14,480
You are wise, Your Majesty.

535
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,750
Make way quickly.

536
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,520
- Make way.
- Make way.

537
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,110
Did you dispatch the armored men?

538
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,390
What if I did?

539
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,870
You knew I came for a marriage alliance.

540
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,000
Yet you wanted to kill Jun Beiyue.

541
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,320
You should be grateful now

542
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,480
that you lost to Han Ziqing.

543
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,670
Otherwise

544
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,040
you would be a widow now.

545
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,150
Jun Beiyue cannot die.

546
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,600
Sis,

547
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,720
I don't care how infatuated you are.

548
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,280
If you ruin Father's grand plan
of attacking Dongling,

549
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,720
no one will be able to save you.

550
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,910
Jun Beiyue

551
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,390
is the stumbling block on our way

552
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,670
to attack Dongling.

553
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,870
Sooner or later, he must be removed.

554
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,350
A marriage alliance is the best way.

555
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,150
It won't harm Jun Beiyue,

556
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,150
and we can use Tianque.

557
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,190
The plan is good,

558
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,630
but you were not skilled enough

559
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,080
and lost to a concubine's daughter.

560
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,670
What can I do?

561
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,190
Do you think I don't know?

562
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,350
Even without Dongling,

563
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,040
you still wouldn't tolerate Jun Beiyue.

564
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,080
Because you are jealous of him,

565
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,040
and that he is better than you.

566
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,960
Now, Jun Beiyue's dead body

567
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,040
is probably already cold.

568
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
How is he better than me?

569
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,000
Clearly, you and Jun Beichen
are colluding,

570
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,110
and trying to get rid of Jun Beiyue.

571
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,240
If I tell the King of Tianque
about this...

572
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,550
Try it.

573
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,080
I guarantee you will never see the sun

574
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,560
on the grasslands again.

575
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,590
You're too despicable.

576
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,080
If Xiling falls into your hands
in the future,

577
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,280
it won't end well.

578
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,910
Chu Feiyan,

579
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,320
relying on Father's favor,

580
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,670
can you be so disrespectful now?

581
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,520
Yes, I did collude with Jun Beichen,

582
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,760
but he also secretly colluded
with Tieyan

583
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,670
and attempted
to take Jun Beiyue's military power.

584
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,000
If others can use the scheme, so can I.

585
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,320
What's despicable about that?

586
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,560
I will tell Father.

587
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,280
Father only wants one result.

588
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,920
It is

589
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,670
to control Tianque

590
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,040
and conquer Dongling.

591
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Sis,

592
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,560
pack up your things.

593
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,640
We should leave.

594
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,670
Shadow and the others

595
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,320
should be able to see the smoke
I just released.

596
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,150
I believe they will arrive soon.

597
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,430
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

598
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,360
Something has happened.

599
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,430
- Where is the injury?
- Jun Beichen took the Tiger Tally

600
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,040
- to take over the main camp.
- It's nothing, just a minor injury.

601
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,630
Well, Shadow.

602
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,470
Here.

603
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,240
Escort the Princess Consort back
to the mansion.

604
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,320
- Yes.
- Remember,

605
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,800
rest well after returning
to the mansion.

606
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,940
- Okay.
- Remember.

607
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
Do not wander around.

608
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,910
Report.

609
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,280
- Commander.
- Speak up. What's the matter?

610
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,250
The Second Prince received
an imperial edict from the King

611
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,830
to take over our main camp.

612
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,670
What?

613
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,390
Second Prince,

614
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,350
what brings you here?

615
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:39,430
Commander Sima.

616
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,520
The King has issued a decree

617
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,800
to order you to join me
to the northern border

618
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,520
and assist me in mobilizing
the White Tiger Army.

619
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,280
White Tiger Army?

620
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,400
Second Prince.

621
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,590
I must remind you

622
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,480
that you have no authority
to command the White Tiger Army.

623
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,080
Commander Sima,

624
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,390
this is the King's decree.

625
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,910
Are you going to defy the decree?

626
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,590
The Tieyan army is pressing
at the border.

627
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,720
The military situation is urgent.

628
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,630
I recommended you to the King.

629
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,110
After the Tieyan army retreats,

630
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:16,520
the entire northern border
will be handed over to you.

631
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,280
But your attitude

632
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,560
is making me troubled.

633
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,520
I am a soldier.

634
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,590
Without the King's Tiger Tally,

635
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,430
I will obey no one.

636
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,750
Second Prince,

637
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,320
you should give up on this idea.

638
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,080
Someone.

639
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,240
Hand over the Tiger Tally,

640
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,760
and I will spare your life.

641
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:50,430
Don't even think about it.

642
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,640
Jun Beichen,

643
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,280
you will never be able
to compare with the Fourth Prince.

644
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,320
The Fourth Prince has always acted
with integrity,

645
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,360
and you

646
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,040
are nothing but a schemer
who plots behind the scenes.

647
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,960
The Fourth Prince

648
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,960
will never spare you.

649
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,870
I will fulfill your wish then.

650
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,600
Your Highness.

651
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,120
Beiyue,

652
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,320
why have you returned?

653
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,350
You didn't expect me to return alive,
did you?

654
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,190
I, I...

655
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,110
That's not what I mean.

656
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:51,000
You hurt my people while I was away.

657
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,190
What is the meaning of this?

658
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,870
Beiyue, you misunderstood.

659
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,910
This is Father's decree.

660
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,590
You dare to touch my people.

661
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,720
Take him away!

662
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,470
Wait!

663
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,240
Who dares to touch me?

664
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,870
It's between us brothers.

665
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,190
We can discuss it in front of Father.

666
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,280
If you want to use lynching,

667
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,560
ask the Tiger Tally in my hand first.

668
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,030
Your Highness.

669
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,040
You want to see Father, right?

670
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,000
I will tell Father about

671
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,520
what you have done one by one clearly.

672
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,110
Attention!

673
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,160
Your Highness, be careful.

674
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:56,470
Release the arrows.

675
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:12,310
Quickly go and get reinforcements!

676
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,160
Yes.

677
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:14,640
Go.
