21
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,270
My spy has reported back.

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,160
Beiyue is perfectly fine.

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

24
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,680
It's absolutely true.

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,590
Not only did he go to Liuxian Island,

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,870
he also revealed his identity

27
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,970
and made a grand appearance
at the Qin Gathering in Qinse Valley.

28
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,720
Jun Beiyue

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,140
deceived us so badly before.

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,720
We all thought he was recuperating
at the Mansion of Fourth Prince.

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,040
But he was actually...

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,880
Mother,

33
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,500
it should be reported to Father.

34
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,750
Indeed.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,700
Han Ziqing

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,760
repeatedly used the excuse
that Jun Beiyue was recuperating

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,110
to prevent His Majesty
from entering their mansion.

38
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,480
This is a crime of deceiving the king.

39
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:10,920
Yes.

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Alright.

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,130
I will go and inform your father now.

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,570
Let's see what they'll explain.

43
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,290
This game,

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,370
you are going to lose again.

45
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,180
Not necessarily.

46
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,510
Your Majesty.

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,880
Your Majesty.

48
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,160
Your Majesty.

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,220
I have something important to...

50
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,130
Greetings, Prince An.

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,040
Queen,

52
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,550
what is it?

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,800
Well...

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,650
Jun Beiyue

55
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,950
- is...
- By the way,

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
Your Majesty,

57
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,320
there is something

58
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,770
I forgot to report to you.

59
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,260
Brother, what is it?

60
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,420
Beiyue

61
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,110
is not at the Mansion of Fourth Prince.

62
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,010
Then where is he?

63
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,990
Beiyue was seriously injured,

64
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,550
and last month

65
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,180
he was sent to Liuxian Island
to recuperate.

66
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,620
Now his health has greatly improved,

67
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,700
and he has just sent the news back.

68
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,290
Since it's a serious situation,

69
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,750
the Fourth Princess

70
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,930
only told me this.

71
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,320
Now, I am telling you.

72
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,700
It shouldn't be too late, right?

73
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,700
Beiyue is on Liuxian Island.

74
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,020
Why

75
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,720
didn't he tell me?

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,270
Brother, I sent people
to his mansion every day,

77
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,260
but they were all turned away at the door.

78
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,670
He was showing no respect to me.

79
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,720
Indeed.

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,910
How can Fourth Prince
and Fourth Princess do this?

81
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,910
Seriously speaking,

82
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,670
it's a crime of deceiving the king.

83
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,650
Queen,

84
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,570
watch your words.

85
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,300
The Fourth Prince is a crucial figure
to the nation.

86
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,390
How could his injury

87
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,300
be easily known to others?

88
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,300
If it were discovered by enemy nations,

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,450
how great a crisis would it pose
to our Tianque?

90
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,580
You are aware of this, aren't you?

91
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,820
The Fourth Princess

92
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,950
was considering the safety of Tianque,

93
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,650
so she did not publicize it.

94
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,580
How can you say it's the crime
of deceiving the king?

95
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,470
Moreover,

96
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,540
now Beiyue

97
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
is out of danger and safe,

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,980
which is a great blessing.

99
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,820
If Your Majesty were to blame,

100
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,490
it would be unreasonable.

101
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,790
Brother,

102
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,300
you are overthinking it.

103
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,320
I

104
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,000
have no intention of blaming anyone.

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,930
You did the right thing.

106
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,370
Let's get back to our chess game.

107
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,480
Here.

108
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,750
Mother,

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,420
what did Father say about Beiyue's crime?

110
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,270
It's all because of Prince An.

111
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,670
With his sophistry,

112
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,350
the Fourth Prince is not only innocent,

113
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,170
but has contributed
to protecting Tianque.

114
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,480
His Majesty is afraid of Prince An.

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,330
What else can he say?

116
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,070
Mother, calm down.

117
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,820
Fine.

118
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,970
With Beiyue's abilities,

119
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,070
it's difficult to bring him down

120
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,490
with this matter.

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,160
However,

122
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,260
the message we sent to Consort Qin

123
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,930
should be arriving soon, right?

124
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,400
Yes.

125
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,390
As long as there is movement
from Nanzhao,

126
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,860
we don't need to rush

127
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,650
but to wait and watch the show.

128
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,860
(Nanzhao Palace)

129
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,330
About the matter the Queen of Tianque
mentioned in the letter,

130
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,210
I wonder what's your idea, Your Majesty?

131
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,210
If Han Ziqing is truly immune
to all poisons,

132
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,610
we have to take it seriously.

133
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,230
The Islanders can wreak havoc
in the world.

134
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,170
If there is any suspicion,

135
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,260
it is better to kill mistakenly
than to let go.

136
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,540
But she is the Fourth Princess
of Tianque.

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,550
If we act rashly against her,

138
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,770
it might cause

139
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,330
too much trouble.

140
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,050
If she is truly an Islander,

141
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,820
regardless of her identity,

142
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,610
she must be killed without mercy.

143
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,880
However,

144
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,510
Jun Beiyue
holds significant military power,

145
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,580
and has a renowned reputation.

146
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,980
If we make a move against his people...

147
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,240
Forget it.

148
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,870
We

149
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,700
can't be rash.

150
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,260
We need to plan carefully.

151
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,520
Your Majesty,

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,300
I have an idea.

153
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,140
What is it? Tell me.

154
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,670
It happens
to be the Nanzhao Celebration.

155
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,860
We have to get prepared for that.

156
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,110
Why don't we take advantage
of this grand event

157
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,420
to invite her here?

158
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,190
Then...

159
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,650
We'll reach the Manor in an hour.

160
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,440
Let's speed up

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,830
while it's still daylight.

162
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,110
Alright, Father.

163
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,440
When no one is looking,

164
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,300
sneak away quietly.

165
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,830
Young Master Bai is waiting for you

166
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,670
at the birch forest ahead.

167
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,910
Young Master Bai?

168
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,310
What is it for?

169
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,110
I'm just here to deliver the message.

170
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,490
How would I know your private matters?

171
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,750
Hurry up and go.

172
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,330
Jiang Chen is so undisciplined.

173
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,500
Don't blame us
for giving him a hard time.

174
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,660
Just the right opportunity

175
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,540
to clean up

176
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,860
for my master.

177
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,100
Beiyue,

178
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,940
come on.

179
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,710
You're back.

180
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,060
Honey.

181
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,990
Bei…

182
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,790
Nianbei,

183
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,620
you finally woke up.

184
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,460
Mrs. Lu,

185
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,490
Beiyue's identity has been revealed.

186
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,500
No need to use an alias anymore.

187
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,020
Is that so?

188
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,240
Beiyue,

189
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,580
it's great

190
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,860
that you woke up.

191
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,260
Thank you

192
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,820
for taking care of me these days.

193
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
I'm

194
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,660
- deeply grateful.
- No, no.

195
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,740
We're families. No need for formalities.

196
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,860
Master,

197
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,020
why didn't you tell me

198
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,780
such a great event earlier?

199
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,860
Look,

200
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,140
they just returned,

201
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,580
and Beiyue was eager to see you.

202
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,540
Beiyue's recovery

203
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,900
is a blessing for Tianque,

204
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,300
and also a blessing for the Lu Family.

205
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,900
Someone,

206
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,620
set up a banquet immediately.

207
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,660
Tonight,

208
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,910
we'll celebrate heartily.

209
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,180
Father, Mother.

210
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,180
You're awake?

211
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,260
Meiting,

212
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,340
this is the Fourth Prince.

213
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,220
Come and pay your respects.

214
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,300
The Fourth Prince?

215
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,300
Beiyue

216
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,940
is the Fourth Prince of Tianque.

217
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,380
Years ago,

218
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,780
when I was traveling in Tianque,

219
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,500
we became master and disciple.

220
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,220
I even taught him

221
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,180
our Lu's internal arts.

222
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,700
So, I have been keeping these things

223
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,140
from you all,

224
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
and not telling the truth.

225
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,420
Also,

226
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,820
his identity is special,

227
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,980
so I was worried that some people

228
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,620
might harm him

229
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,720
while he was in a coma.

230
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,020
Now, it's fine.

231
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,330
He has already recovered.

232
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,340
So, I'm here to explain it clearly

233
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,920
to prevent you from making wild guesses.

234
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,820
Meiting, why are you
still standing there?

235
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,420
Quickly pay your respects
to the Fourth Prince.

236
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,100
I'm Lu Meiting.

237
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,900
Greetings, the Fourth Prince

238
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,620
and the Fourth Princess.

239
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,060
No need for formalities.

240
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,940
Where is your husband Jiang Chen?

241
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,180
Right.

242
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,700
How could I forget about this?

243
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,220
Father, Suying,

244
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,140
where is Jiang Chen?

245
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,140
Didn't Jiang Chen come back?

246
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,540
He was always with our convoy.

247
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,060
Just before we reached the Manor,

248
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,380
he said he needed to relieve himself
by the roadside.

249
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,820
I didn't pay much attention,

250
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,540
but he might not have followed us
since then.

251
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,420
Could it be

252
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,980
that he went down the mountain
to drink again?

253
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,780
How do you know he went drinking again?

254
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,340
Father.

255
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,140
You should send some people
to look for him.

256
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,620
Jiang Chen

257
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,420
didn't come back and didn't tell anyone.

258
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,660
He is really undisciplined.

259
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,940
Mother,

260
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,460
Jiang Chen would not
stay outside without a reason.

261
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,580
Don't wrong him.

262
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe when he relieved himself,

263
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,820
he was accidentally bitten
by some snakes or insects?

264
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,140
Shut up.

265
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,380
Why do you always curse him?

266
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,940
Can't you wish us well?

267
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
I was just joking.

268
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,460
Why take it seriously?

269
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,380
You were cursing your brother-in-law.

270
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,340
How can I not be anxious?

271
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,700
You two, enough.

272
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,540
Stop arguing.

273
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,180
Butler.

274
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,820
- Master.
- Go and call some people

275
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,940
to search the mountain and the forest

276
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
to look for Jiang Chen.

277
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,820
Yes.

278
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,980
Father, Mother.

279
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
Here we are.

280
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,880
- What's going on? Why are you shouting?
- What's the matter?

281
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,700
Is Jiang Chen back?

282
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,980
No. Jiang Chen didn't come back
all night.

283
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,180
It's my parents-in-law.

284
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,700
They went to the Bai Family
to ask for him.

285
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,540
Who?

286
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,580
Ask for whom?

287
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,860
Jiang Chen.

288
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,740
They are shouting at the Bai Family

289
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,100
and saying Jiang Chen is there.

290
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:24,060
What on earth is going on?

291
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,980
How could Jiang Chen
be at the Bai Family?

292
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,420
I heard

293
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,180
their young master is a woman.

294
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,220
Master, you must think of a solution
quickly.

295
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,820
When did Jiang Chen

296
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,980
get involved with the Bai Family?

297
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,860
Father, Mother,
let's not worry about that now.

298
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,460
You two should go
and check it out quickly.

299
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,100
If Jiang Chen is really in the Bai Family,

300
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,980
bring him back first.

301
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,270
- You...
- No way.

302
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,100
Even if Jiang Chen

303
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,300
is at the Bai Family,

304
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,820
what does it mean for our family
to ask for him?

305
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,990
Father and Mother can't show up now.

306
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:51,820
Lu Suying.

307
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,780
What do you mean?

308
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,980
If something happens to Jiang Chen,

309
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,460
are we ignoring it?

310
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,700
Your husband is irresponsible

311
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,260
and always causing trouble outside.

312
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,860
Why should Father and Mother
clean up his mess?

313
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,420
- What trouble is Jiang Chen causing?
- Master.

314
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,860
Why are you cursing him?

315
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,540
- Mother...
- Why are you hitting me?

316
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
Stop arguing.

317
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,460
Master, what should we do?

318
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,260
Fine.

319
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,100
Let's go and check it out first.

320
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,060
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

321
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,340
My son is the eldest son-in-law
of the Lu Family.

322
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,140
It's one thing for you to bully us.

323
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,820
But how dare you bully the Lu Family!

324
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,180
Hand over Jiang Chen quickly!

325
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,780
Hand him over! Hand him over!

326
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,140
Hurry up! Hand over Jiang Chen!

327
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,980
Chen!

328
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,180
Son!

329
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,460
Hand over my son!

330
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,020
(Bai Manor)

331
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,220
Who are you people?

332
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,940
How dare you cause trouble
in front of the Bai Family!

333
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Why are you hitting her?

334
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,820
We are here to find Jiang Chen.

335
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,260
He is the eldest son-in-law
of the Lu Family.

336
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,660
He is friends with Miss Bai.

337
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
They meet a lot.

338
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,120
Stop talking nonsense
and drive them away!

339
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,220
Stop!

340
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,500
What are you doing?

341
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,420
- Mrs. Jiang.
- Where is Bai Feiyao?

342
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,740
Call Bai Feiyao out for me.

343
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,540
What do you want to do?

344
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,140
Where is Jiang Chen?
Is he here with you?

345
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,060
Your husband Jiang Chen is missing.

346
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,560
Yet you come to the Bai Family
to look for him.

347
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,420
This is simply outrageous.

348
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,540
You shameless woman.

349
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,460
I'll fight you to death today.

350
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,420
Meiting, Meiting, stop!

351
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,220
Mrs. Jiang.

352
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,500
What are you thinking?

353
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,100
Why did you come to the Bai Family?

354
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:21,950
It…

355
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,700
How would people

356
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,940
judge us Lu Family?

357
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,060
It's so humiliating.

358
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,660
I am here to catch my son's affair
for my daughter-in-law.

359
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,820
My son can't resist temptation.

360
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,660
He is having an affair with you,
Miss Bai.

361
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,820
I have advised him many times
but he won't listen.

362
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,580
Now he has abandoned his wife

363
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,700
and is hiding in the Bai Family.

364
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,180
I must bring him back today

365
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,380
to kneel and apologize to my in-laws.

366
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,420
Otherwise, I won't leave.

367
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,460
Yes, I won't leave.

368
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,860
Bai Feiyao, you shameless woman.

369
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,700
Hand over Jiang Chen to me.

370
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,220
Stop!

371
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,540
Bai Feiyao.

372
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,660
You caused this mess.

373
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,780
You must give the Lu Family
an explanation.

374
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,580
Fine.

375
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,780
Today, I will give you an explanation.

376
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,620
Fine.

377
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,820
Where is Lu Suying?

378
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,500
Come out.

379
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,580
What?

380
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,660
Are you afraid?

381
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,180
I'll come out then.

382
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,020
What is there to be afraid of?

383
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,900
Lu Suying.

384
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,180
It was you who killed Jiang Chen

385
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,220
and even instigated them to come to me.

386
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,260
You vicious woman.

387
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,740
Suying, what's going on?

388
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,090
- Where is Jiang Chen?
- Where is Jiang Chen?

389
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:04,660
Where is my son?

390
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,940
- Lu Suying.
- Suying.

391
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,620
Tell me the truth.

392
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,820
What happened?

393
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,020
Father,

394
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,780
how could I possibly kill Jiang Chen?

395
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,780
You can't believe an outsider's words.

396
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,260
You must trust your daughter.

397
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,700
It must be her.

398
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,420
It must be her who killed Jiang Chen.

399
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,100
And now she's trying to frame me.

400
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,100
Master Lu.

401
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,940
Mrs. Lu.

402
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,060
Miss Suying

403
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,220
- often met with me.
- Father.

404
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,500
What is Jiang Chen to me?

405
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Father.

406
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,180
He was merely a go-between for me
and Miss Suying.

407
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,300
Lu Suying,

408
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,500
you killed him to silence him.

409
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,300
Don't try to pin it on me.

410
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,340
- You're talking nonsense.
- Suying.

411
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,780
What exactly happened?

412
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,060
Sis.

413
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,700
She

414
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,300
has been having an affair
with Jiang Chen behind your back.

415
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
An affair?

416
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,940
Are you now trying to drag me down
with you?

417
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,380
Mrs. Jiang.

418
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,340
Didn't you know about this all along?

419
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,380
Hasn't she been fooling around

420
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,940
with Jiang Chen all along?

421
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,260
Say something.

422
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,380
Say something.

423
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,020
My son!

424
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,940
Bai Feiyao.

425
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,340
Give me back my son!

426
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,220
Jiang Chen was with you for five years.

427
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,980
How could you be so cruel?

428
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,580
Bai Feiyao, you shameless woman.

429
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,820
- I'll fight you.
- Meiting.

430
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,300
Meiting.

431
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,060
Bai Feiyao, give me back my son.

432
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,620
- Jiang Chen was with you for five years.
- Alright, alright.

433
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,020
He was either in the Lu Family

434
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,660
or in your boudoir.

435
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,940
How could you be so cruel?

436
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,180
- Miss Bai.
- Father.

437
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,140
Mother.

438
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,900
Isn't this their son-in-law?

439
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,580
- He's not dead.
- He's not dead.

440
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,860
Retreat.

441
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,860
Take him away.

442
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,500
- Isn't he fine?
- What?

443
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,380
Did you think I was killed by you?

444
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,980
Killed by your joint efforts?

445
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,900
You wretch!

446
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,060
How dare you try to kill me!

447
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,110
Jiang Chen.

448
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,220
Stop!

449
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,300
Son.

450
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,180
Are you alright?

451
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:31,900
Bai Feiyao.

452
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,340
Are you bullying my Lu Family?

453
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,420
Lu Jun.

454
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,140
Don't push us too far.

455
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,220
If you slander my daughter again,

456
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,380
don't blame me for being rude.

457
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,340
Slander?

458
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,780
Even your daughter doesn't dare
to deny it.

459
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,900
And you still have the nerve
to talk about slander?

460
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,500
Your daughter
would kill your son-in-law.

461
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,980
Why is that?

462
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:04,940
Could it be

463
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,180
there's something unspeakable

464
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,260
between them?

465
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,660
- Nonsense.
- You're talking nonsense.

466
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,700
But you insist on throwing dirt
on my Bai Family.

467
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,700
- You...
- Mother.

468
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,540
Mr. Jiang, Mrs. Jiang,

469
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,780
you speak.

470
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,900
Mother.

471
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,780
Speak.

472
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,180
Speak, Mother.

473
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,020
Jiang Chen,

474
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,060
you'll talk.

475
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,500
Fine, I'll talk.

476
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,300
These past five years,

477
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,980
thanks to Miss Bai's kindness,

478
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,660
I have been fortunate

479
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,580
to often accompany her by her bedside.

480
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,500
In these five years,

481
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,900
I have been working hard all along.

482
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,780
But Miss Bai

483
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,980
was heartless enough to try to kill me.

484
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,260
She colluded with my sister-in-law

485
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,060
and sent people to ambush me
in the woods.

486
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,380
If it weren't

487
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,340
- for Guard Shadow...
- Jiang Chen, shut up!

488
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,180
Father.

489
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,780
If you keep spouting nonsense,

490
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
I'll tear you apart, you hideous man.

491
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:03,980
Master Bai,

492
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,900
in front of so many people,

493
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,660
are you trying to silence me?

494
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,580
Jiang Chen.

495
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,780
I...

496
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,380
I'll kill you.

497
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,220
Bai Feiyao!

498
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,980
You fear that once Jun Beiyue woke up,

499
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,300
he will take over the Lu Family,

500
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,980
thus affecting your Bai Family

501
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,820
to compete for the top family
on Liuxian Island.

502
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,180
So you sent me to poison him.

503
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,500
And I...

504
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,180
To make a living

505
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,140
in the Bai Family,

506
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,580
and to please you,

507
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,020
I reluctantly agreed to do that.

508
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,700
And you,

509
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,460
Lu Suying.

510
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,500
She just wants to

511
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,940
take full control of the Lu Family
in the future.

512
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,780
Pah!

513
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,900
The three of us

514
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,240
were originally in it for our own needs.

515
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,460
But

516
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,860
they two

517
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,260
tried to kill me

518
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,420
to silence me.

519
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,420
They were trying to kill him.

520
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,700
You are heartless,

521
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,580
so I will be unrighteous.

522
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,660
Everyone.

523
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,380
Everyone.

524
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,380
If you don't believe

525
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,060
what I said,

526
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,820
and if you don't believe
my relationship with Miss Bai,

527
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,260
then listen carefully

528
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,940
to what I am about to say next.

529
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,540
Miss Bai

530
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,620
has a black birthmark on her back.

531
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,140
Master Bai,

532
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,300
check it in public.

533
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,940
Miss Bai,

534
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,780
take your clothes off

535
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,140
and check it.

536
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,980
Close the door!

537
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,300
- Let's go.
- I'll fight you to the death.

538
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
- Meiting.
- Jiang Chen.

539
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,780
I'll fight you to the death.

540
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,620
Meiting.

541
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,980
Alright.

542
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,780
Alright, alright!

543
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,220
What a disgrace!

544
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,460
Stop it.

545
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,580
I feel ashamed.

546
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:47,660
Son.

547
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,780
- Let's go.
- Are you alright?

548
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,620
Lu Suying, just you wait.

549
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,460
Let's go.

550
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,540
Let's go.

551
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,380
Master.

552
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,540
- Master.
- Slap it hard!

553
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,380
Master.

554
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,740
Master.

555
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,860
Suying has been slapping herself
for a long time.

556
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,620
Please forgive her this time, Master.

557
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,180
- She has made a serious trouble.
- She...

558
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,260
If it is

559
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,780
just brushed it off like this,

560
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,140
how can we face Beiyue?

561
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,860
How can I

562
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,940
stand in the world?

563
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,580
Father.

564
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,660
I truly know my mistake this time.

565
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,700
Father, please forgive me.

566
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,540
There's no room for you anymore.

567
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,820
- Get out immediately.
- Father.

568
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,380
Father, I can't leave.

569
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,980
I am a member of the Lu Family, Father.

570
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,940
- Father.
- Master.

571
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,180
Mother, please plead with Father for me.

572
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,020
Mother.

573
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,980
Father, Mother.

574
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,620
Mother, you love me the most.

575
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,180
Master, the child is young
and does it wrong.

576
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,020
This time,

577
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,980
please give her another chance.

578
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,540
She has disregarded human lives repeatedly

579
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,340
and has already made a grave mistake.

580
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,620
If this continues,

581
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,060
she will bring disaster to the Lu Family.

582
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,780
- Master.
- I know my mistake, Father.

583
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,580
- I truly know my mistake, Father.
- Stop slapping.

584
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,100
I know my mistake.

585
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,180
Don't blame me for being harsh.

586
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,460
Please forgive me, Father.

587
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,580
- If we
- I will never do it again, Father.

588
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,900
don't handle it this way,

589
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,860
it would be unfair to Beiyue.

590
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,900
I will never do that again, Father.

591
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,740
You should leave.

592
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,980
- Master.
- Leave.

593
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,180
- I won't leave.
- Don't show up at the Manor again.

594
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,420
- I won't leave, Father.
- Master.

595
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,580
- Someone, come here.
- I won't leave.

596
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,100
Please forgive me, Father.

597
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,780
Pack up Miss Suying's belongings.

598
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,940
- Father.
- Take her down the mountain.

599
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,300
- Father.
- Suying.

600
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,260
Father, I won't leave.

601
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,380
Father.

602
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,610
- Mother.
- Suying.

603
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,100
- I won't leave.
- Master.

604
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,580
Father. Father!

605
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,440
Master.

606
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,500
Father.

607
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,180
- Father.
- Don't call me Father.

608
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,220
I am not your father.

609
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,140
Meiting,

610
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,580
say something.

611
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,420
Mother.

612
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,820
Father.

613
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,820
I was wrong.

614
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,460
Father,

615
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,860
what will you deal with Jiang Chen?

616
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,860
I won't deal with him.

617
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,180
After this incident,

618
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,460
you should have seen his true colors.

619
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,260
Quickly break with him,

620
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,740
otherwise

621
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,940
you will go back to the Jiang Family
with him.

622
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,700
Meiting.

623
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,980
Meiting.

624
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,100
Father,

625
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,420
what do you mean by this?

626
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,100
Master,

627
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,300
you just drove Suying away,

628
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,140
and now you want to drive them away too?

629
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,060
Master,

630
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,540
do you still want me to live?

631
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,100
Father. Meiting, say something.

632
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,060
She can stay,

633
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,100
but you must divorce.

634
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,900
- Remember.
- Meiting.

635
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,300
From now on, the Lu Family
and the Jiang Family

636
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,020
should not have any connection.

637
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,500
Otherwise,

638
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,460
you can go back to the Jiang Family
with him.

639
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,140
Meiting, please say something for me

640
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
to plead with Father.

641
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,180
Jiang Chen,

642
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,220
I will not go back to the Jiang Family
with you.

643
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,540
We will divorce.

644
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,700
You can live with whoever you want.

645
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,140
Divorce?

646
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,580
You wish.

647
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,700
I am

648
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,580
not someone the Lu Family

649
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,340
can summon and dismiss at will.

650
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,980
If the Lu Family wants to drive me away,

651
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,540
I will take you with me

652
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,780
and then torment you.

653
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,620
Just you wait.

654
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,780
Jun...

655
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,580
Quickly.

656
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,420
Father...

657
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,500
I am not your father.

658
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,260
(Divorce Certificate)

659
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,660
Father...

660
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,180
Master Lu,

661
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,580
I have signed it.

662
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,460
However,

663
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,180
I have worked hard for the Lu Family
for over ten years.

664
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,820
When I leave,

665
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,740
could you

666
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,300
give me some land and silk?

667
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,020
You...

668
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,740
Get out.

669
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,620
You...

670
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,620
I truly feel sorry for Master Lu.

671
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,100
I know,

672
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,300
you didn't want it to end this way.

673
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,340
If they have
a nice father-daughter relationship,

674
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,580
and the family was thriving,

675
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,700
you wouldn't have to
deal with this mess, right?

676
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,660
But it concerns my master,

677
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,100
and since I encountered it,

678
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,860
I cannot ignore it.

679
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,540
Yes.

680
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,540
Master Lu has been very kind to you.

681
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,020
I think

682
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,580
what you did is right.

683
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,020
(Lu Manor)

684
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,860
Beiyue,

685
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,620
are you really completely fine now?

686
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,380
I'm fine, Master.

687
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,260
Beiyue,

688
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,020
once you leave,

689
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,980
we don't know when we will meet again.

690
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,700
Master Lu, don't worry.

691
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,300
As long as the Lu Family needs us,

692
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,980
we will come back immediately,

693
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,940
and do our best to help.

694
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,380
Thank you, Fourth Princess.

695
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,980
Beiyue,

696
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,020
Ziqing,

697
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,620
the situation in Longyuan Continent
is ever-changing.

698
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,220
You must be very careful.

699
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
If you are not happy staying there,

700
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,940
you can return to Liuxian Island
anytime.

701
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,320
Here

702
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,940
is a place of tranquility after all.

703
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,060
Thank you

704
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,580
for taking care of me during these days.

705
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,780
I will come back to visit you.

706
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,620
Alright.

707
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,420
Farewell.

708
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,860
(Lu Manor)

709
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,700
Get in the carriage.

710
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,820
Let's depart.

711
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,860
(Lu Manor)

712
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:53,500
(Tianqi)

713
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,740
Your Majesty.

714
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,020
Greetings,

715
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,420
- Father.
- Your Majesty.

716
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,300
Rise.

717
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,900
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

718
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,980
You just returned from Liuxian Island,
right?

719
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,080
Indeed.

720
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,660
Beiyue, you act so freely.

721
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,460
You went to Liuxian Island secretly

722
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,500
without informing your father.

723
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,420
Your father was so worrying

724
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,220
about your injury all day long,

725
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,340
and was unable to sleep well.

726
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,790
Sorry to keep you worried, Father.

727
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,900
It is my fault.

728
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,420
I also heard

729
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,260
that at the Qin Gathering
in Qinse Valley,

730
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,940
you revealed your identity.

731
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,460
Is this true?

732
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,920
It is true.

733
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,140
Beiyue,

734
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,860
as a member of the royal family,

735
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,220
you openly supported
a martial arts sect.

736
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,180
If this gets out,

737
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,220
it might be inappropriate.

738
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,370
Father,

739
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,520
although the martial arts sects don't
involve themselves in court affairs,

740
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,620
their influence on the people

741
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,630
is extremely strong.

742
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,020
In the name of the Tianque royal family,

743
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,780
I secured a ranking for the Lu Family
on Liuxian Island,

744
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,980
thereby the Tianque royal family

745
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,140
can intimidate the martial arts sects.

746
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,060
This is beneficial and not harmful.

747
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
So

748
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,940
why shouldn't I do it?

749
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,340
You have considered thoroughly

750
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,940
for our Tianque.

751
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,420
I feel very gratified.

752
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,420
By the way,

753
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,580
for the upcoming Nanzhao Celebration,

754
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,700
will you go there?

755
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,100
I came today

756
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,860
to report this to you.

757
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,740
Ziqing and I

758
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,580
will go together

759
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,140
on time.

760
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,920
Look at you.

761
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,260
You just returned

762
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,410
and now have to set off again.

763
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,180
You all have worked hard.

764
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,140
Your Majesty,

765
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,940
there's no need to be so polite
with the Fourth Prince.

766
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,060
After all, the invitation from Nanzhao

767
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,860
was sent directly to his mansion

768
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,420
instead of our palace.

769
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,220
It shows that the entire Longyuan Continent

770
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,380
recognizes the golden reputation

771
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,540
of our Fourth Prince.

772
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,700
(Quite good at stirring things up, huh?)

773
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,740
The Fourth Prince is a prince of Tianque

774
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,420
and should serve the country.

775
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,500
It's not just the invitation.

776
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,420
Even a war declaration

777
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,380
would be sent directly
to the Mansion of Fourth Prince.

778
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,260
Do you expect it

779
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,340
to be sent to the palace

780
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,900
and have Your Majesty
personally go to battle?

781
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,620
Ziqing.

782
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,140
(Wretch.)

783
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,700
(Let's see how long you can stay smug)

784
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,020
(once you get to Nanzhao.)

785
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,300
Your Highness.

786
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,780
The Nanzhao Celebration is coming.

787
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,380
You just returned to the Mansion

788
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,500
and now have to set off again.

789
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,660
Your Highness, take me with you
this time.

790
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,860
You're still a child

791
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,700
and love the fun so much.

792
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,260
Your Highness, please take her with you.

793
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,320
Without you watching over her,

794
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,300
she can be quite mischievous.

795
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,300
Alright.

796
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,140
For the sake of your service
to the Mansion,

797
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,420
- I'll take you with me.
- Yes.

798
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,980
Pack your luggage.

799
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,420
(West Yard)

800
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,220
Ziqing has been back for long.

801
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,380
Why are you just returning now?

802
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,700
As soon as you return, you're so busy.

803
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,020
You don't even have time
to chat with me.

804
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,900
Isn't this too neglectful of the guest?

805
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,820
When I was not around,

806
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,780
you were taking care of the Mansion.

807
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,860
You're not considered a guest.

808
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,300
Good to know.

809
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,740
Remember

810
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,580
my great kindness.

811
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,340
Don't worry. I'll treat you

812
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
to meat and wine another day.

813
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,140
We can have meat and wine anytime.

814
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,780
But there's one thing

815
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,100
you need to get ready in advance.

816
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,500
I've already sent Xin'er
back to Situ City.

817
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,020
But my parents have already known

818
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,620
that she spent the night in your camp.

819
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,660
But do you know

820
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,820
that all of this is a misunderstanding?

821
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,740
Of course I know
it's a misunderstanding.

822
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,820
But my parents wouldn't believe it.

823
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,380
My father might send a letter
in a few days

824
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,260
to urge you to marry Xin'er.

825
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,340
I've conveyed the message to you.

826
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,580
As for the rest,

827
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,660
you decide for yourself.

828
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,620
I'm going out to meet a friend.

829
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,100
Beiyue,

830
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,540
if you really become my brother-in-law,

831
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,060
then not only will we be even closer,

832
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,300
but Situ City will also have Tianque
as a strong ally.

833
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,820
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

834
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,660
Stop dreaming.

835
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,980
Why is His Highness still awake?

836
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,500
I'll go check.

837
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,300
It's so late. Why are you still awake?

838
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,300
Come here.

839
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,540
(Nanzhao)
Liuli Pavilion has replied.

840
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,380
Look.

841
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,260
What did they find out?

842
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,140
Nanzhao is different from other countries.

843
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,260
It marked every place

844
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,300
with a totem.

845
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,620
This one

846
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,380
(Ice Pool)
corresponds to this place.

847
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,220
Ice Pool?

848
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,140
You mean

849
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,980
this totem

850
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,980
represents the Ice Pool?

851
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,980
What is the connection

852
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,260
between it and the Isolated Island?

853
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,220
I haven't figured out

854
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,540
the connection between them yet.

855
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,340
But do you remember?

856
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,780
When we were in Qinse Valley,

857
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,980
we found Lishang

858
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
and this totem.

859
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,660
There must be some connection
between them.

860
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,900
So,

861
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,180
we need to investigate further.

862
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,590
But there's a problem.

863
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,900
Nanzhao

864
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,050
is a place of perpetual heat.

865
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,200
Why would there be a place
like the Ice Pool?

866
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,980
Nanzhao has always been

867
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,500
the most magical place
in the entire Longyuan Continent.

868
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,340
The climate

869
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,740
and geographical features of Nanzhao

870
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,060
are very unique.

871
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,540
The Ice Pool

872
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,740
is just one of its many wonders.

873
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,330
It sounds

874
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,340
like an adventure journey.

875
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,820
With me here, I will protect you.

876
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,330
Your Highness,

877
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,000
I am not a coward.

878
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,860
I don't need your special care.

879
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,510
I want to fight alongside you.

880
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,020
You?

881
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,780
Fight alongside me?

882
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,500
Yes.

883
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,740
(Nanzhao)
Do you know that over the years,

884
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:32,940
Nanzhao

885
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,140
has always been my concern?

886
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,980
Nanzhao seems to be at peace
with the world,

887
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,940
but the King of Nanzhao

888
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,380
is a very ambitious person.

889
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,780
Nanzhao has the Medicine Tribe,
Beast Tribe, and Merfolk Tribe.

890
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,980
Each tribe has special abilities.

891
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,980
As long as it's wartime,

892
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,540
their combat power
will be extremely fierce.

893
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,460
Look at the location of Nanzhao.

894
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,660
(Medicine Valley)
They have natural barriers.

895
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,860
This place

896
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,550
is easy to defend and hard to attack.

897
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,180
If a war breaks out,

898
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,540
given Nanzhao's current
national strength,

899
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,500
no one can match them.

900
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,170
Your Highness,

901
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,260
you are indeed far-sighted.

902
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,140
How am I far-sighted?

903
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,380
I find that your ability to flatter

904
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,460
is getting better.

905
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,920
I'm telling the truth.

906
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,740
Really?

907
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,980
Yes.

908
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,060
I think your room

909
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,340
is really hot.

910
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,220
So hot, why is it so hot?

911
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,700
There are too many candles,
Your Highness.

912
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,340
I'll go back to cool off.

913
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,580
(Nanzhao Map)

914
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,260
Why are you staring at me?

915
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,620
I really can't see any information

916
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,660
about the Isolated Island from you.

917
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,780
Don't worry.

918
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,980
Haonan is one of us.

919
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,740
I've told him everything about you.

920
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,900
What do you think

921
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,060
an Islander should look like?

922
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,140
If I knew,

923
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,340
why would you still go to Nanzhao?

924
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,420
What's the attitude?

925
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,140
You've been studying the map
for a long time.

926
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,660
Have you found anything?

927
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,260
I checked all the historical records
of Nanzhao.

928
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,100
There are no detailed records
about the Isolated Island.

929
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,540
That's not surprising.

930
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,300
Nanzhao is a peculiar kingdom.

931
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,460
Apart from the celebration
held every ten years,

932
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,200
it has no interactions
with neighboring countries.

933
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,200
The weather is hot,

934
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,420
and there are many poisonous insects.

935
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,940
Who would go there for no reason?

936
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,820
You.

937
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,260
Me?

938
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,100
Yes.

939
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,300
You are going to Nanzhao with us
so openly.

940
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,860
Will someone come to assassinate you?

941
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,860
Who dares to assassinate me?

942
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,140
The one who pesters you every day.

943
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,980
Go away.

944
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,660
- Annoying.
- Let's go. It's time to eat.

945
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,140
Who?

946
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,860
Don't listen to his nonsense.

947
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,700
There's no one.

948
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,060
I don't even care to know.

949
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,460
Donkey.

950
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,340
Senior Brother.

951
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,060
Senior Brother, come back quickly.

952
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,570
Senior Brother.

953
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,130
Hurry up.

954
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,500
The donkey.

955
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,740
- The donkey...
- What?

956
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,860
The donkey ran away.

957
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,820
The donkey ran away.

958
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,660
Where's the donkey?

959
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,060
The donkey ran away.

960
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
Ran away.

961
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,260
Donkey.

962
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,060
Chase it, go on.

963
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,980
You, you...

964
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,540
I just went to the toilet,
and you lost the donkey.

965
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,980
What else can you do?

966
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,540
Why didn't you lose yourself?

967
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,820
It's all your fault.

968
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,980
I told you to hire someone.

969
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,820
You didn't listen.

970
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,180
You insisted on doing it yourself.

971
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,780
Now it ran away.

972
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,620
What to do?

973
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,700
We still owe them

974
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,780
1,000,000 taels on Liuxian Island.

975
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,620
Where's the money?
We can't even afford food.

976
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,820
Why don't you be the donkey?

977
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,660
I...

978
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
Yes.

979
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,340
The money has been running out,

980
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,900
and the task has not been finished.

981
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,820
Now we have to go back to Nanzhao.

982
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,980
If the King of Nanzhao blames us,

983
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,980
I'll suffer with you.

984
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,260
Then don't follow me. Get lost.

985
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,100
I...

986
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,820
Didn't you say
you wouldn't capture Han Ziqing anymore?

987
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,990
Why are you going back to Nanzhao?

988
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,140
Not go back to Nanzhao.

989
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:06,620
Let's go back to Tianque.

990
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,700
Go back to Tianque.

991
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,860
Go back to Tianque.

992
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,180
Not return to Nanzhao.

993
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,700
I haven't repaid her kindness yet.

994
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,940
I need to follow her.

995
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,860
I haven't seen those old men

996
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,260
for a long time. I miss them too.

997
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,100
I'll go back and see them.

998
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,460
Let's go.

999
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,900
No way.

1000
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,100
There's more?

1001
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,740
I can see it.

1002
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,380
You just can't let go of Han Ziqing.

1003
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,660
You just

1004
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,740
forget benefits when you see beauty

1005
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,990
and value beauty over friendship.

1006
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,500
Senior Brother, slow down
and wait for me.

1007
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,620
You're not even as strong as a donkey.

1008
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,860
Can we even call ourselves friends?

1009
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:42,780
(Nanzhao Territory)

1010
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,500
Did you get the information right?

1011
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,540
Will Han Ziqing come to Nanzhao
this time?

1012
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,820
According to the intel,

1013
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,980
Han Ziqing and Jun Beiyue

1014
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,580
should be arriving today.

1015
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,820
How dare you call Jun Beiyue by name?

1016
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,660
I spoke too quickly.

1017
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,580
It's the Fourth Prince of Tianque.

1018
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,700
What goes around comes around.

1019
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,260
This time

1020
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,820
I will not let Han Ziqing
live an easy life.

1021
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,660
