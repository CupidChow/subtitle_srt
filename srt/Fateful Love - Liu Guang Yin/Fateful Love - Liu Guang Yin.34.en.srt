21
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,790
Beiyue,

22
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,580
when you saved Ziqing
in Mitian Deep Sea,

23
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,520
didn't Baili Weisheng stop you?

24
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,950
He didn't fight me.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,510
So, are you saying

26
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,760
he let you go on purpose?

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,200
Maybe

28
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,550
he is also conflicted inside.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,230
Under the instigation
of Lady Silver Merfolk,

30
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,190
Baili Weisheng indeed wanted to kill me,

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,630
but he never took action.

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,600
It's clear that this child
has a kind nature.

33
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,110
Beiyue,

34
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,390
Ziqing,

35
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,550
are you sure that Baili Weisheng
is Golden Merfolk?

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,830
With just a roar, Baili Weisheng

37
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,240
damaged our internal strength.

38
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
And those Silver Merfolk Soldiers

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,960
all knelt and submitted to him.

40
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,110
I think he must be Golden Merfolk.

41
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,240
It can't be wrong.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,270
Besides him,

43
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,110
are there any other Golden Merfolk
in the palace?

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,000
What do you mean by that, Grandfather?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,630
The underwater palace you mentioned

46
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,000
should be Golden Merfolk Palace.

47
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,720
Golden Merfolk Palace
was originally a large Barrier.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,160
It was established
by the ancestor of Meng Tribe.

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,670
And this Golden Merfolk Palace

50
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,880
is only sustained by the energy

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
of Golden Merfolk.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,630
If there is no other Golden Merfolk
in the palace, it will collapse.

53
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,750
Since Baili Weisheng

54
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,470
had never been there before,

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,240
if there were no other Golden Merfolk,

56
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,830
how did it manage to stand firm?

57
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,630
So, Grandfather, are you saying

58
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,160
that in this Mitian Deep Sea,

59
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,670
besides Baili Weisheng,

60
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,720
there are other Golden Merfolk?

61
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,550
I heard from Baili Weisheng.

62
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,080
Inside Golden Merfolk Palace,

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
he said he smelled a familiar scent.

64
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,320
Grandfather,
what do you think it could be?

65
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,000
What he smelled

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,160
was probably the scent
of his tribe members.

67
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,230
Grandfather,

68
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,560
Beiyue,

69
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,600
I want to
visit Golden Merfolk Palace again.

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,600
Again?

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,550
Last time, you barely managed to escape.

72
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,760
You may die there if you go back again.

73
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,630
Besides,

74
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,800
your body is still so badly injured.

75
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640
That's right.

76
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,950
Ziqing,

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,600
you should recover yourself first.

78
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,400
We will discuss it later.

79
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
There is something suspicious
about Golden Merfolk Palace.

80
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,200
I must find out the truth.

81
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,470
Beiyue, look.

82
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,800
My injury has almost healed.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,840
It's nothing serious.

84
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,440
Ziqing,

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,510
this is too dangerous.

86
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,390
You can't go.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,320
I want to go too.

88
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,670
You can't go.

89
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,700
Your injury hasn't healed yet.

90
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,910
Fourth Princess,

91
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,920
I believe Senior Brother is against you

92
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,040
because he has been deceived.

93
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,440
You must clear up the misunderstanding.

94
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,720
Alright.

95
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,830
I will do my best.

96
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,320
However,

97
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,110
you must wait here for us to return.

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,880
If you must go,

99
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,600
I'll

100
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,110
go with you.

101
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:50,950
Well...

102
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,630
Thank you, Grandfather.

103
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,910
Beiyue,

104
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,160
like me, you also

105
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,320
want to resolve the misunderstanding
with Weisheng as soon as possible,

106
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
right?

107
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,920
Oh you.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Grandfather,

109
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,830
what did you see?

110
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,230
This is indeed Golden Merfolk Palace.

111
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:48,350
There are many Barriers around.

112
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,950
Can you see me?

113
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,110
Can you see me?

114
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,640
Grandfather, what did you see?

115
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,950
Who is she?

116
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,110
If I'm not mistaken,

117
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:32,510
she is Golden Merfolk.

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,950
Thank you for saving me.

119
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,880
I am Lady Golden Merfolk,

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,000
the owner of Golden Merfolk Palace.

121
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,200
I am going to find my son.

122
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,320
Son,

123
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,510
I am your mother.

124
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,350
I can't even believe it in my dreams

125
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,880
that one day

126
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,070
I will be able to see you again.

127
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,510
You are my mother?

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
But

129
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,510
my mother has died.

130
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,630
Son,

131
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,830
it's Helian,
the venomous Silver Merfolk,

132
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
who was talking nonsense.

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
Now we are the only two left

134
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,200
in Golden Merfolk Tribe.

135
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,230
That vicious woman

136
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,790
killed all the Golden Merfolk

137
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,070
and occupied Golden Merfolk Palace.

138
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,350
She has imprisoned me in a stone chamber

139
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,920
for 20 years.

140
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,720
I've been missing you every moment.

141
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,150
Today, I finally see you, my son.

142
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,230
I'm your mother.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,960
If you don't believe it,

144
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,230
you can ask Chief Meng.

145
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,440
He just released me from the Barrier.

146
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,880
You can ask him.

147
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,710
Son, I have finally found you.

148
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,520
I'm your mother.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,790
I have finally found you.

150
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,000
It's been 20 years.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,440
I have been longing for you
day and night.

152
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,590
Finally, I've gotten to see you.

153
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,520
Madam.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,760
The Silver Merfolk said that the Islanders
exterminated Golden Merfolk Tribe.

155
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
What is the truth?

156
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,230
This woman was talking nonsense

157
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,070
and distorting the facts.

158
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,710
My husband and I were invited

159
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,400
to attend the palace banquet that year.

160
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,550
Helian and her husband

161
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,710
were leading the Silver Merfolk Legion
to guard outside the hall.

162
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,640
The chief guard had always misbehaved.

163
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,000
When no one was paying attention,

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,400
he wanted to sneak into
the back hall to steal something.

165
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,500
At that time, we still didn't know

166
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,320
that the place where he broke into
is the forbidden area

167
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,880
where the King of Nanzhao
secretly trained his human puppets.

168
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,000
He released the Puppet Islanders
that were being trained.

169
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,910
These puppets rushed to the main hall

170
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:10,880
to conduct a massacre.

171
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,390
Madam, be careful.

172
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,470
Protect His Majesty!

173
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,080
- Take the lady away!
- Yes.

174
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,230
Honey, I won't leave.

175
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,400
- Go!
- I won't go.

176
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,030
For the sake of the baby, go!

177
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,150
Honey.

178
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,840
Madam.

179
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,110
You stay here and hide for a while.

180
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,590
I will find more people to protect you.

181
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,590
Red-gold scales.

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,710
Red-gold scales can kill them.

183
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,320
Red-gold scales

184
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,400
can kill those human puppets.

185
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,400
But when the Golden Merfolk
lost their red-gold scales,

186
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,960
they lost the supply of energy.

187
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,110
My husband also fell.

188
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,200
Can the red-gold scales
kill the human puppets?

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,960
Your Majesty,

190
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,790
my disciple saw it with his own eyes.

191
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,280
It is true.

192
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Your Majesty,

193
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,710
these red-gold scales

194
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,000
can greatly aid your grand plan.

195
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,080
Let go of me.

196
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,000
Your Majesty,

197
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,400
this woman trespassed into the backyard

198
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,350
with suspicious behavior.

199
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,230
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

200
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,590
I was looking for my husband
in the backyard.

201
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,670
I have no other intentions.

202
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,080
Silver Merfolk's duty
is to protect Golden Merfolk.

203
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,640
You left your post
and trespassed into the backyard.

204
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,550
Do you know what the crime is?

205
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,550
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

206
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,600
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

207
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,640
His Majesty considers
that you are repentant,

208
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,520
and he is willing to give you a chance.

209
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,670
Are you willing to seize it?

210
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,670
Only in this way,

211
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:00,200
can I forgive your sins.

212
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,400
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

213
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,200
I will not fail in my mission.

214
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,320
I will go capture
Lady Golden Merfolk right away.

215
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,080
And I will annihilate
the entire Golden Merfolk Tribe.

216
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,760
As long as you accomplish it,

217
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,150
you will become the owner
of Golden Merfolk Palace.

218
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,200
Don't be afraid.

219
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,280
I am different from them.

220
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,350
I won't hurt you.

221
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,430
Listen to me.

222
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,320
They were originally just like me.

223
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,710
However, the King of Nanzhao
transformed them with some sorcery

224
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,110
to make them to be like this.

225
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,240
Where are you going?

226
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,000
The King of Nanzhao
wants to exterminate my entire tribe.

227
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
I must hurry back to inform them.

228
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,600
Listen to me.

229
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,200
Follow this road ahead,

230
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,150
and keep heading north.

231
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,670
That end is the source of Wuxie Gorge.

232
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,000
You can go back from there.

233
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,320
Why did you save me?

234
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,670
I just want the world to know

235
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,760
that we Islanders

236
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,190
are not monsters.

237
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,110
Look over there.

238
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,590
Are they in front?

239
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,150
To avoid implicating my baby,

240
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,320
I could only leave him behind.

241
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,070
However,

242
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,670
when I ran back
to Golden Merfolk Palace,

243
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:48,080
I was discovered by the guard
who was one step ahead of me.

244
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,710
Lady Silver Merfolk imprisoned me,

245
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,960
gathered all Golden Merfolk in my name,

246
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,000
and locked them all in the sea prison.

247
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,640
Right in front of me,

248
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,280
she poisoned them all to death

249
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,640
and took away their red-gold scales.

250
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,480
This is

251
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,520
the whole story.

252
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
And from that day on,

253
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,590
I never saw my son again.

254
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,960
Don't blame me for leaving you.

255
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,800
I'm sorry.

256
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,520
Thanks for the blessings.

257
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,350
I can reunite with my son.

258
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,430
Madam,

259
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,950
all these years,

260
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,470
have you been trapped
in the Barrier?

261
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,640
Because Golden Merfolk Palace

262
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,350
must be guarded
by the Golden Merfolk Royal Family,

263
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,520
otherwise, it will collapse.

264
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,080
So she didn't kill me.

265
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,550
She just imprisoned me.

266
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,280
Are you

267
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,710
Ziqing?

268
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,550
Yes.

269
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,910
How is your injury?

270
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
I can see

271
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,070
that you and my son are close friends.

272
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,000
Earlier, he believed in
the slanderous words

273
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,280
and imprisoned you.

274
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,430
I'm sorry for that, child.

275
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,680
Today let me apologize to you

276
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,350
on his behalf.

277
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,000
Madam, you are too kind.

278
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,760
I often argue with Baili Weisheng.

279
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,610
It's alright.

280
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,800
But this time, we should thank you.

281
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,400
Your name is Weisheng.

282
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,880
Who gave you your name?

283
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,280
When you threw me onto the bridge,

284
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,400
the Pharmacist found me.

285
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,350
My master's surname is Baili.

286
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,500
After finding me,
he named me Baili Yesheng.

287
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,650
I think it sounds a bit unpleasant.

288
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,110
After wandering the world
for so many years,

289
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,680
I gave myself a name,

290
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,710
a nicer one, called Weisheng.

291
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,520
Sounds good.

292
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,800
Did you see how impressive I was before?

293
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,560
I was so powerful.

294
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,040
I just beat them harshly.

295
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,680
Son, don't get too complacent.

296
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,160
Those powerful moves of yours

297
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,400
were activated by the energy
of Golden Merfolk Palace

298
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,190
and for protecting the Palace.

299
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,590
It is our mission as Golden Merfolk.

300
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,110
If I leave, will it be gone?

301
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,950
Silly boy.

302
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,400
It can still protect you
and keep you safe.

303
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,280
What's the use of that?

304
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,120
Weisheng,

305
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,880
the sound wave you roared out that day,

306
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
could you do it again?

307
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,440
That's right.

308
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,710
It is Lishang indeed.

309
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,910
By the way, Ziqing,

310
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,680
I have something to show you all.

311
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,880
Weisheng.

312
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,430
What is this?

313
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,710
This looks like a totem.

314
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,880
I discovered it by chance.

315
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,590
But I don't know what it is for.

316
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,480
Ziqing,

317
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,560
after all the totems are found,

318
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,310
can you then decipher Lishang?

319
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,160
We are still missing two volumes.

320
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,350
Find all the totems,

321
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,760
and we can find the complete Lishang.

322
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,640
The music score?

323
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,790
Ziqing,

324
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,240
Liuguang.

325
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,000
We are life-and-death friends now.

326
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,910
Ziqing,

327
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,350
this dagger is extraordinary.

328
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,590
You must keep it safe.

329
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,680
So it doesn't fall into the wrong hands,

330
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,590
or the consequences would be horrible.

331
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,480
Okay.

332
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,790
Madam,

333
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,590
would you be willing
to return to Liuxian Island with us

334
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,750
and to live together with Weisheng?

335
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,600
It's been 20 years.

336
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,040
I have been longing
to see my son every day.

337
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,640
Now, I have finally found him.

338
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,880
No matter what, I cannot be separated
from him again.

339
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,430
Son,

340
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
you won't despise your mother, will you?

341
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,190
What are you saying?

342
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,520
If you are willing to come back with me,

343
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,160
I will build a house for you
on Liuxian Island.

344
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,830
Liuxian Island?

345
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,110
Ziqing, is Liuxian Island beautiful?

346
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, it is.

347
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,830
Come on, this way, please.

348
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,040
Madam, where is my junior brother?

349
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,070
He's in the inner room.

350
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,800
- Slow down.
- Okay.

351
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,470
You brat.

352
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,790
Senior Brother,

353
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,710
why are you running?

354
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,190
Are you feeling better?

355
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,350
Is your body okay?

356
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,190
I'm fine now.

357
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,830
It's good

358
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,520
that you come back.

359
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,310
I'm relieved that you're back.

360
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,280
Who is this lady?

361
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,040
This is my mother.

362
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,710
It's also your aunt.

363
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,950
Mother?

364
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,590
Weisheng, is this...

365
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,070
This is my junior brother Xiaosheng.

366
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,430
So you were the boy who saved the person

367
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,680
in Mitian Deep Sea.

368
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,350
But you are a girl.

369
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,310
She looks so cute.

370
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,430
How are you feeling?

371
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,830
Her condition...

372
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,670
Doctor Hua,

373
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,360
please.

374
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,230
Xiaosheng,

375
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,430
how is your injury?

376
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,590
My junior brother,

377
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,070
how is she now?

378
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,680
The Merfolk Poison in her body
has been cleared.

379
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,470
However, the internal injury
will need time to heal.

380
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,400
Maybe there is a better way.

381
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,430
But at the moment, I've done my best.

382
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,470
Don't worry.

383
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,430
I'll have the Master

384
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,160
to personally visit Qinse Valley

385
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,760
to ask them

386
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,160
if there's a way to cure this illness.

387
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,830
I think

388
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,950
when you were saving people
in Golden Merfolk Palace,

389
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,710
you were truly clever and brave.

390
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,880
I just didn't expect that you were a girl.

391
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,310
Have you seen it?

392
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,920
I saw it clearly
when I was in the Barrier

393
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
in Golden Merfolk Palace at that time.

394
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,760
Barrier?

395
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,280
In this whole journey,

396
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,520
Weisheng has been expressing
his concern for you.

397
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,040
Is there anything you would like to eat?

398
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,280
I will make it for you later.

399
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,760
Oh, how can I accept this?

400
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,350
Don't be shy.

401
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,310
I want to eat sweet and sour ribs

402
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,150
and braised fish.

403
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,040
My senior brother is so stingy.

404
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,880
He never bought it for me.

405
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,350
I've been starved thin.

406
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,190
Really?

407
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,710
Has her illness fried her brain?

408
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,190
Beiyue,

409
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,230
I will go back tomorrow.

410
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,110
I'll take your mother
back to Meng Tribe.

411
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,760
Grandfather, how will you deal with her?

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,190
According to Meng Tribe's rules,

413
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,800
she has committed a serious crime.

414
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,230
She should be imprisoned for life.

415
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,520
As long as I'm there, she won't get out.

416
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,640
But don't worry,

417
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,230
I won't let her suffer.

418
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,310
Beiyue, do you blame me?

419
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,640
I understand.

420
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,310
Grandfather, you did this

421
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,850
for the sake of the tribe members
and future generations.

422
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,310
And,

423
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,400
I plan to destroy Momentary Tower.

424
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,640
But Momentary Tower was built
by the ancestor.

425
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,310
The Tower contains
many forbidden techniques.

426
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,000
If it is not destroyed,

427
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,040
future generations
might imitate your mother

428
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,470
to commit such evil deeds
and bring endless troubles.

429
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,310
Beiyue, Ziqing,

430
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,280
I'll head back to my room first.

431
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,760
Fourth Prince,

432
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,670
Fourth Princess,

433
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,760
Ten

434
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,430
wants to hang herself.

435
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,560
Let's go and see her.

436
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,520
Why do you want to die?

437
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,000
Have you known
that Madam Wan was captured

438
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,920
and we have known the truth,

439
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,070
so you tried to hang yourself?

440
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,590
Now I have no hope at all.

441
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:58,040
Just deal with me as you wish.

442
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,880
How can you speak to your master
like that?

443
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,720
Yes,

444
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,070
she is my master.

445
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,230
Therefore, I can't covet

446
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,590
her belongings even a bit.

447
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,120
I am inferior.

448
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,910
I admit it.

449
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,480
Is that okay?

450
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,310
You are right.

451
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,230
You are inferior.

452
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,350
Don't you want to die?

453
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,190
I will fulfill your wish.

454
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,950
Your Highness, if you want me to die,

455
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,430
I have no complaints.

456
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,000
It's just that I don't want to die here.

457
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,950
I want to find a clean place.

458
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,710
I hope you will grant my wish,
Your Highness.

459
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,270
Alright.

460
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,760
Shadow.

461
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,270
Yes.

462
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,400
- Drown her in the pond.
- Yes.

463
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,670
Beiyue.

464
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,190
Impossible.

465
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,470
I am not pleading for her.

466
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,430
We

467
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,830
have at least been master and servant.

468
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,800
I will personally see her off.

469
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:53,030
Your Highness.

470
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,910
You have arrived.

471
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,310
Your Highness,
I would like to have a word with her.

472
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,880
Are you now

473
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,070
despising me so much?

474
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,240
Gu Xi,

475
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,560
I have let you down.

476
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm sorry.

477
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,110
It's not me
you should be apologizing to,

478
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,070
but Her Highness.

479
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,830
But I want to tell you,

480
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,070
if there is a next life,

481
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,710
I am willing to be with you.

482
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,430
You don't even cherish this life.

483
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,920
How can we talk about the next one?

484
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,110
So you hate me now, don't you?

485
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,400
I hate myself

486
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,270
for not stopping you

487
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,920
in time.

488
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,230
You have served me for so long.

489
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,350
I have treated you well.

490
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Why did you betray me?

491
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,400
That's right.

492
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,070
You were very nice to me.

493
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,040
I once swore

494
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,710
to honor you above all

495
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,470
and serve you for a lifetime.

496
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,950
But...

497
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,110
But you fell in love with His Highness

498
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,040
and came to harm me.

499
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,880
I didn't.

500
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,710
I just want

501
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,830
to be by His Highness' side.

502
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,350
But with you here,

503
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,830
he won't even spare me a glance.

504
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,610
Now that this is the end,

505
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,280
you can just kill me.

506
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,520
I have nothing to say.

507
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,920
Ten, now haven't you

508
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,160
felt repentant?

509
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,560
Is repentance useful?

510
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,160
Even if I said I'm sorry for what I did,

511
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,430
will she spare me?

512
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,070
Alright.

513
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,310
This is your choice.

514
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,680
I will fulfill your wish.

515
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,190
Throw her down.

516
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Ten,

517
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,830
beg Her Highness.

518
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,350
She will forgive you.

519
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,590
Tie me up tighter.

520
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,640
Don't let me break free.

521
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,070
Ten,

522
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,300
Ten, please.

523
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,280
You should beg Her Highness.

524
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,560
Just let me die.

525
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,760
I tie you a slipknot.

526
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,000
Hope you can be a good person
in the future.

527
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,520
Never come back again.

528
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,680
Your Highness.

529
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,000
Are you sure she can break free?

530
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,800
She should be able to break free.

531
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,190
Chief Meng,

532
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,680
my son and I can never

533
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,120
repay your great kindness and virtue.

534
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,800
We'd like to give you our best wishes.

535
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,230
May everything go smoothly for you.

536
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,470
You are too kind, Madam.

537
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,380
I'm glad I can help. Don't mention it.

538
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,860
(Lu Manor)
Chief Meng,

539
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,080
I don't have many skills,

540
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,670
but from now on, in Meng Tribe,

541
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,600
all the livestock, big or small,

542
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,000
if any of them fall ill,

543
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,840
I can treat them

544
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,680
for free.

545
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,190
Alright, alright.

546
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,030
Master Lu,

547
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:30,630
sorry for the disturbance
over the past few days.

548
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,190
Thank you so much.

549
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,840
My pleasure.

550
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,680
Grandfather,

551
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,750
write to us

552
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:38,230
when you arrive safely.

553
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,310
Grandfather,

554
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,240
have a safe journey.

555
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,400
I used a Barrier to lock her feet

556
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,080
to make sure she wouldn't escape
on the way.

557
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,560
We are about to leave.

558
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,920
Say goodbye

559
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:53,710
to your mother.

560
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,200
Mother,

561
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,560
I hope that after you go back
with Grandfather this time,

562
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,120
you can truly turn over a new leaf.

563
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,080
I believe we will meet again.

564
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,780
(Lu Manor)

565
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,640
Everyone, please stay.

566
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,080
Take care.

567
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,920
Alright.

568
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,680
You brat.

569
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,640
You look so comfortable.

570
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,190
Are you faking your illness?

571
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,120
I'm not.

572
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,470
Do you think

573
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,910
I want to lie here all day?

574
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,200
Your mother

575
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
often served me soup

576
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,160
and medicines.

577
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,080
She's so attentive.

578
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,670
It really overwhelmed me.

579
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,910
But if I don't let her take care of me,

580
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,800
I'm afraid of
rejecting her good intentions.

581
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm in such a difficult position.

582
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,320
Why are you so ungrateful?

583
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,080
My mother has been
taking care of you diligently,

584
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,200
yet you still don't appreciate it.

585
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,190
Suddenly, you went from
being a bratty boy to a bratty girl.

586
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,230
It's really hard to get used to it.

587
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,080
You should switch back
to men's clothing tomorrow.

588
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,600
Otherwise, it would be inconvenient
to go out.

589
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,950
Fourth Princess

590
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,560
insisted that I change back
into a girl's attire.

591
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,880
She said

592
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,040
being a girl is also funny.

593
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,310
Looking at me,

594
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,190
it's not bad.

595
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,390
When I look at myself,

596
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,040
I find myself quite pretty.

597
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,920
Really?

598
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,800
Why do I find it so ugly?

599
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,030
Seriously?

600
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,200
What do you mean, seriously?

601
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,120
Look into my eyes.

602
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,600
Say it again.

603
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,230
Am I ugly?

604
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,510
You are

605
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,230
the most beautiful in the world.

606
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,600
The most beautiful one in the world.

607
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,150
I can't even afford to look at you.

608
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,120
Senior Brother,

609
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,880
you don't like me anymore,

610
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,520
do you?

611
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,710
What makes you say that?

612
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,470
You are Golden Merfolk.

613
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,910
Now you have found your mother.

614
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,910
You have a home

615
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,750
and an identity.

616
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,680
But I am

617
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,040
just an orphan.

618
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,630
I don't even know where I'm from.

619
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,310
Am I

620
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,840
not worthy of being your junior sister?

621
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,280
What are you talking about?

622
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,190
You will always be my junior brother.

623
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,800
But you know I am a girl.

624
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,800
Then you are still my junior sister.

625
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,960
No need to say anything else.

626
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,000
No matter what happens,

627
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,600
you will always be my junior sister.

628
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,920
Alright.

629
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,150
Junior Sister it is.

630
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,750
You should

631
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,840
switch back to men's clothing tomorrow.

632
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,680
Otherwise,

633
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,800
it's inconvenient for me to hit you.

634
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,670
If you dare to hit me again,

635
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,520
I will go and tell Mother.

636
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,670
That is my mother.

637
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,910
How does she become your mother?

638
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,800
Your mother has been working hard
on taking care of me these days.

639
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,000
I will go pay my respects to her now.

640
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,710
It's not your mother anyway, right?

641
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,280
She is my mother.

642
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,670
You ungrateful brat.

643
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,910
Are you looking for a beating again?

644
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,120
Do you think I won't dare to beat you?

645
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:05,750
Don't run away.

646
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,440
Mother.

647
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
Mother, help!

648
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,280
- What's wrong?
- You little brat!

649
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,600
- Help! Help!
- Slow down.

650
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,710
Senior Brother bullied me.

651
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,600
Weisheng, did you bully Xiaosheng again?

652
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,910
Xiaosheng is such a good girl.

653
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,320
It must all be your fault.

654
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,430
My fault?

655
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,280
Am I your son,

656
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
or is she?

657
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,630
You are my son.

658
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,320
But Xiaosheng is also my daughter.

659
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,840
Mother, thanks for taking care of me
these past few days.

660
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,950
Thank you so much.

661
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,560
I want to cook a meal for you.

662
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,390
- Okay.
- No, please don't.

663
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,120
I have been with her for over ten years.

664
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,960
Mother,

665
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,230
she has never made a successful dish.

666
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,670
Do you want her to cook for you?

667
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,870
Mother, don't believe him.

668
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,310
What do you want?

669
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,870
Just show your specialty.

670
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,280
- Sweet and sour ribs.
- Okay.

671
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,950
Alright, sweet and sour ribs it is.

672
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,670
I'll make it for Mother right away.

673
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,390
I'll watch how you make it.

674
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,230
Weisheng,

675
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:05,470
come here.

676
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,280
I have something to tell you.

677
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,120
Mother, what?

678
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,320
Weisheng,

679
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,160
tell me the truth.

680
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,000
Do you have

681
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,430
some feelings for Ziqing?

682
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,950
Don't blame me for meddling.

683
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,080
When you
had such a big misunderstanding,

684
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,600
you still couldn't bring yourself
to kill her.

685
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I knew the suffering in your heart
at that time.

686
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,190
I have been through it.

687
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,190
What does it matter
if I have feelings for her?

688
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,870
You can't.

689
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:43,800
Not to mention Ziqing and Jun Beiyue

690
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,560
are perfectly matched,

691
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,320
I can see it clearly

692
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
that in Ziqing's heart,

693
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,600
she considers you a close friend.

694
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,040
I know she has no feelings for me.

695
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,870
Mother, don't worry.

696
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:02,230
I will always treat her as a sister

697
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,670
and a friend.

698
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,040
I will always keep my feelings for her
in my heart,

699
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,040
and will never do anything
that crosses the line.

700
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,230
Mother, don't worry.

701
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,870
I'll go check how she's doing.

702
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,710
I'm leaving.

703
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,160
Okay.

704
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,950
I did not expect

705
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:31,000
that the King of Nanzhao
would risk universal condemnation

706
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,120
to have committed such a crime.

707
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,670
We now only have
Lady Golden Merfolk's testimony,

708
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,710
but no solid evidence.

709
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,320
If the King of Nanzhao refused
to admit to the crime he committed,

710
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,630
we still need to find other evidence.

711
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,150
After so many years have passed,

712
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,190
it's not that easy

713
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,000
to find some evidence.

714
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,560
Do you remember the Ice Pool in Nanzhao?

715
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,320
Your Highnesses,

716
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,200
a secret letter from Liuli Pavilion.

717
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,950
Has the totem in Golden Merfolk Palace
been deciphered?

718
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,630
The totem in Golden Merfolk Palace

719
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,670
precisely directs to
Yuqiong Heavenly Pool.

720
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,950
Yuqiong Heavenly Pool?

721
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,800
Do you two still remember?

722
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,000
We've visited four places

723
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,900
and gained two volumes
of the music score at each of them.

724
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,320
If I guess it right,

725
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,600
the last two volumes of the music score

726
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,710
are right there.
