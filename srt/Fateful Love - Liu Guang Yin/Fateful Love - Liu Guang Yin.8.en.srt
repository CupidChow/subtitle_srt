(Tianque)

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,480
How is this possible?

23
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
She's faster.

24
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,710
She's faster.

25
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,470
Miss Ziqing won.

26
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,230
If not for her excellent riding skills,

27
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,560
an ordinary person
could never achieve this.

28
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,150
How did Han Ziqing manage this?

29
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,120
Father,

30
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,430
the first round of the competition
has ended.

31
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,480
You can announce the result now.

32
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,830
Alright.

33
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,400
I announce,

34
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,560
Fourth Princess Consort Han Ziqing
wins the first round.

35
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,440
Congratulations
to the Fourth Princess Consort!

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,190
Everyone

37
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,030
is tired.

38
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,560
Let's take a short break.

39
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,560
The second round

40
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,510
will be held tonight.

41
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,120
His Majesty departs.

42
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,000
Farewell to His Majesty.

43
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:54,790
Prince Xiang,

44
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,350
the horse is soaring like a swallow.

45
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,070
That's truly magnificent.

46
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,190
Prince Xiang, take care.

47
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,000
You all may leave now.

48
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,120
What happened to your leg?

49
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,800
Nothing.

50
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,000
How did your leg get injured like this?

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,510
It was hit by a horse.

52
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,960
Whom did you fight with?

53
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,520
No.

54
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,160
Who exactly are you?

55
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,120
Your Highness,

56
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I am Han Ziqing,

57
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,100
the Fourth Princess Consort of Tianque,

58
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,100
and Chancellor Han's second daughter.

59
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,630
I have investigated

60
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,500
that Chancellor Han's second daughter
can't ride a horse.

61
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,470
You also told me before
that you can't ride a horse.

62
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,910
But your riding skills are extraordinary.

63
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,510
And whom did you fight with

64
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,880
to get this leg injury?

65
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
Speak up.

66
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,750
Your Highness,

67
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,680
actually…

68
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,910
Call Physician Gu.

69
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,680
Your Highness, I am here.

70
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,070
Your Highness, she is...

71
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Your Highness,

72
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,510
I need to remove her clothing.

73
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,060
Do it.

74
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,030
She has bandaged herself.

75
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,120
I have already sent someone
to ask around.

76
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,030
The servants
at the Chancellor's Mansion said,

77
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,440
this second daughter Han Ziqing

78
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,910
was timid and frail,

79
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,960
a weak and sick.

80
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,470
Since the Grandeur Palace,
her personality has changed drastically.

81
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,470
She even dared to slap her stepmother
in public.

82
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,440
She could also defend herself clearly
at the Judicial Office

83
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,570
and walked away unscathed.

84
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,110
Now her riding skills
are also so impressive.

85
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,430
It's quite strange.

86
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,840
Didn't you investigate further

87
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,160
about her background?

88
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,070
She has no significant background.

89
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,550
Her mother was the best qin master
at Tianque's music parlor.

90
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,620
After marrying the Chancellor,
she behaved herself well.

91
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,070
There's nothing more to find out.

92
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,950
Your Highness,

93
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,190
although the leg injury is severe,

94
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,750
it hasn't affected her bones.

95
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,400
With proper care, she will recover
in a few days.

96
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
How many days?

97
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,110
Your Highness, I'm fine.

98
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880
Your Highness.

99
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,800
Eunuch Yin is here.

100
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,240
Let him in.

101
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Eunuch Yin,

102
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
come in.

103
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,040
Eunuch Yin.

104
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,880
Your Highness.

105
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,990
Greetings to Your Highness.

106
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,190
His Majesty has issued a decree

107
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,240
to state that tonight's competition
will be shooting incense on a horse.

108
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,840
Please get ready for that,
Your Highness.

109
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,070
I shall take my leave now.

110
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,630
Alright. Eunuch Yin, please.

111
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,480
Shooting incense on a horse.

112
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,320
Do you know how to do it?

113
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,000
No, I don't.

114
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,640
Since you don't,

115
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,120
let's give it up.

116
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,560
We surrender.

117
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,640
No way.

118
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,960
You have principles,

119
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,550
and so do I.

120
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,960
Since I accepted the challenge,

121
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
I cannot give up halfway.

122
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,110
I'm looking forward
to your performance now.

123
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,270
How's your leg?

124
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,950
It's fine now.

125
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,950
Really?

126
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,190
I want to see for myself,

127
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,630
what else

128
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,160
you're hiding from me.

129
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,800
Chu Tiange.

130
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Chu Tiange.

131
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,550
Do you still have the mood to drink?

132
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,360
Let me tell you.

133
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,800
No matter what method you use,

134
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
I must win the second round.

135
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,070
Otherwise, if you lose
the bordering land,

136
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,240
don't blame it on me.

137
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,250
You are Princess Feiyan of Xiling.

138
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,220
You have been skilled in archery
since childhood.

139
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,280
I'm not afraid now.

140
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,240
Why would you be?

141
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,510
It seems,

142
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,280
you've come up with a plan.

143
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,670
Don't worry.

144
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,720
We're not the only people there

145
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,990
who are hoping Jun Beiyue to lose.

146
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,440
Come on.

147
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,800
Let's toast

148
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,680
to our impending victory.

149
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,630
Father,

150
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,280
how is my performance?

151
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,090
Excellent.

152
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,960
Mr. Lige,

153
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,960
since you taught my son,

154
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,980
his qin skills have greatly improved.

155
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,960
If you could stay in Tianque,

156
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,160
I can build a qin palace for you,

157
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,840
and gather famous qins
from all over the world for your use.

158
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,310
You could also take charge
of the music and rituals of Tianque.

159
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,430
What do you think?

160
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,800
Thank you for your appreciation.

161
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,040
But I am reclusive,

162
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,310
and I dare not accept
such a heavy responsibility.

163
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,150
Mr. Lige,

164
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,670
since Father invites you sincerely,

165
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,720
why not...

166
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,560
Your Majesty.

167
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,590
Your Majesty.

168
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,510
Here comes my queen.

169
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,920
Father, I will take my leave first.

170
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,070
I will also take my leave.

171
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,040
Mr. Lige, please.

172
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,990
As for my offer,

173
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,040
please think about it.

174
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
Your Majesty,

175
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,400
look at the arrow I found.

176
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,630
Is it suitable for the competition?

177
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,480
Is this

178
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
an iron arrow used by Xiling?

179
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,640
Yes.

180
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,840
This arrow is several times heavier
than a regular arrow.

181
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,110
If someone hasn't used it before,

182
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,190
they might fail to aim at their target.

183
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,310
If we use this arrow,

184
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,160
it would give an advantage
to the opponent.

185
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,990
Would Beiyue

186
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,960
think

187
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,750
it's unfair?

188
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,800
This competition of shooting incense

189
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,110
isn't anything new.

190
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,110
How could it be?

191
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,870
If Xiling wins,

192
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:10,240
Princess Feiyan will marry Beiyue.

193
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,960
With Xiling's national strength,

194
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,070
it would be beneficial to Tianque,

195
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,510
and not harmful.

196
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,040
Moreover,

197
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,840
it would also
suppress Beiyue's momentum.

198
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,770
That's right.

199
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,860
A bet is a bet.

200
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,870
It's almost time.

201
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,710
Someone.

202
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,190
Wait, Your Majesty.

203
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,310
I have a plan.

204
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,400
(Han Ziqing, I want to see)

205
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,800
(how you will make Jun Beiyue proud
this time.)

206
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,550
What's going on?

207
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:01,310
The Fourth Princess Consort
doesn't dare to compete?

208
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,950
It's possible.

209
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,360
After all, shooting incense
is Xiling's specialty,

210
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,960
and we in Tianque are not good at it.

211
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,990
It's understandable to be afraid.

212
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,440
You two

213
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,480
are boosting others' morale
while undermining our own.

214
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,320
What do you mean by that?

215
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,160
The Fourth Princess Consort

216
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,550
is not someone who easily admits defeat.

217
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,430
It was obvious

218
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,350
when she was in the riding competition
in the daytime.

219
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,870
Your Majesty,

220
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,040
is Han Ziqing coming or not?

221
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,480
Princess Feiyan,

222
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
don't be anxious.

223
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,720
They should be arriving soon.

224
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,270
Are they too scared to compete?

225
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,000
Stop it.

226
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,390
Han Ziqing would never run away.

227
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,000
It's not like she can't beat you.

228
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,240
Your Majesty,

229
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,840
the scheduled time cannot be changed.

230
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,270
If they haven't showed up,

231
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,120
you will have to declare
Xiling is the winner.

232
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,000
Here they are.

233
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,840
They have arrived.

234
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,430
If you regret it now,

235
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,990
there's still time.

236
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,670
In my dictionary,

237
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,390
there is no word for surrender.

238
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,640
Are you confident?

239
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,790
Your bordering land

240
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,310
and my hands and feet

241
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,480
do not allow me to not be confident.

242
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,150
Good.

243
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,910
- Greetings, Father.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

244
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,030
Beiyue, sit.

245
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,360
Your Majesty.

246
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,080
Ziqing,

247
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,190
you rode well during the day.

248
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,270
Now,

249
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,030
let me announce the competition rules.

250
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,070
We won't be riding horses

251
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,030
to shoot incense sticks.

252
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,800
Look here,

253
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,360
there is a bag

254
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,910
of copper coins.

255
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,720
Among them,

256
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,150
there is one smallest coin.

257
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,200
You two,

258
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,240
whoever hits this smallest coin

259
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,640
will be the winner of this round.

260
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,790
Princess Feiyan,

261
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,430
are you scared?

262
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,640
What a joke.

263
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,440
Come on.

264
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,030
Father,

265
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,600
we can start now.

266
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,840
Begin.

267
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,150
Choose your bow.

268
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,310
Choose your arrow.

269
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:29,440
The archery competition begins.

270
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,270
Check the target.

271
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,070
Ziqing won.

272
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,910
Ziqing won.

273
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,240
Father, Ziqing hit it first.

274
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,840
Did you see clearly

275
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,150
whose arrow is on the coin?

276
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,360
It was clear that Ziqing hit it first.

277
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,880
Her arrow was first.

278
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,720
Is that so?

279
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,550
Where is her arrow then?

280
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,390
You...

281
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,390
You're being unreasonable.

282
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,120
Everyone saw it.

283
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:05,960
Alright, alright.

284
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,480
The winner of this round

285
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,840
is Princess Xiling, Chu Feiyan.

286
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,310
Each of you has won one round now.

287
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,520
It's a tie.

288
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,800
Your Highness,

289
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,440
what do you think the topic
of tomorrow's literary exam will be?

290
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,750
Why?

291
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,750
Are you afraid of losing?

292
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,880
I don't even know
what the competition will be about,

293
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,990
so naturally, I'm not confident.

294
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,840
Can you write poetry?

295
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,680
I can't.

296
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,120
I'm not lying to you.

297
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,150
I'll teach you.

298
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,240
Will cramming at the last minute work?

299
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,600
It's better than surrendering.

300
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,960
Here.

301
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,230
What should I write?

302
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,740
Ode to the Plum Blossom.

303
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,690
Ode to the Plum Blossom?

304
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,870
Quickly.

305
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,540
(Ode to the Plum Blossom)

306
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,780
Alright, it's done.

307
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,540
What did you write?

308
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,390
Ode to the Plum Blossom.

309
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,360
Are you kidding?

310
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,270
Your Highness,

311
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,760
I told you I can't do it.

312
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,390
I don't care about tomorrow now.

313
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,230
I'm heading back first.

314
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,240
What's this?

315
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,910
Why are you just arriving?

316
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,880
My armored soldiers
are already waiting outside the city.

317
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,190
How will they enter the city?

318
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,070
Prince Xiang, don't worry.

319
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,360
I will make the arrangements.

320
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,720
They will enter
through the secret passage.

321
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,320
Good.

322
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,670
I trust you.

323
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,960
Make sure they stay close.

324
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,910
They must enter the city before dawn.

325
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,310
- No delays.
- Yes.

326
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,960
(Of course you're not worried.)

327
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,910
(If I lose, I won't get the dagger.)

328
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:03,190
(And I won't be able
to leave this place.)

329
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,390
The King has arrived.

330
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,030
Everyone, rise.

331
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,840
Please be seated.

332
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,840
The literary exam begins.

333
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,200
Father,

334
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,640
I have a suggestion.

335
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,720
Since Beishen has brought Mr. Lige,

336
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,240
why not let the world's best qin master

337
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
set the topic for the literary exam?

338
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,120
Beichen's suggestion is excellent.

339
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:53,030
What do you think, Mr. Lige?

340
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,070
I agree then.

341
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,600
Mr. Lige,

342
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,550
I wonder what kind of challenge
you have in mind.

343
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,560
Qin skills.

344
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,080
Alright.

345
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,880
Qin skills?

346
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,720
What's wrong?

347
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,720
Are you proficient in it again?

348
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,200
I don't know how to do this.

349
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,640
Your mother is the best qin master
in Tianque.

350
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,030
And you say you can't play the qin?

351
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,390
I'm not lying to you.

352
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,070
My mother is a qin master.

353
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,570
Does that mean I must know
how to play the qin?

354
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,840
Sis,

355
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,600
you have been familiar with music
since childhood.

356
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,960
This time, don't let Han Ziqing

357
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,600
lose too badly.

358
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,510
It's doomed.

359
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,640
The bordering land of Tianque

360
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,000
and my hands and feet are all at risk.

361
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,270
As I said before,

362
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,270
how could I stand by and watch you

363
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,430
have your hands and feet chopped off?

364
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,360
Your Highness,

365
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:08,750
what about the dagger?

366
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,250
Will you show me the dagger?

367
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,360
That depends on your performance.

368
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,270
(I know nothing about qin skills.)

369
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,230
(This is troublesome.)

370
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:37,150
The Fourth Princess Consort
and Princess Feiyan, please.

371
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,630
Wish me luck.

372
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,760
Tianque people prefer qin,

373
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,800
and favor solo performances.

374
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,070
Xiling people prefer kouxian,

375
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,470
and favor ensemble performances.

376
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,320
To ensure fairness,

377
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,520
I will play a new piece on the qin.

378
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,430
Please join me in playing it.

379
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,080
Beishen.

380
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,430
Did you invite him here?

381
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:44,830
I-I invited him myself.

382
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,680
(How strange.)

383
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,190
(I seem to know how to play it.)

384
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:46,390
(Could it be that Han Ziqing's memories
about qin skills)

385
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,310
(have also been transferred to my mind?)

386
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,360
This piece
is called Spring and Autumn Dream.

387
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,750
It has three sections.

388
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,280
In the first section,

389
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,550
both of you lose.

390
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,560
It's a tie.

391
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,700
What kind of competition is this?

392
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,120
I've never seen
such a competition before.

393
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,360
The world's best qin master indeed.

394
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,840
The sound of the qin
is truly enchanting.

395
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,870
Yes.

396
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,640
Just now, everyone in the hall

397
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,840
seemed to be under a freezing spell.

398
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,310
It seems that the Princess Consort
and Princess Feiyan of Xiling

399
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:40,150
have both been captivated,

400
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,480
and are unable to keep up
with the melody.

401
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,600
What a pity.

402
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,990
This is not something
an ordinary person can keep up with.

403
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,180
Yes, indeed.

404
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,640
Mr. Lige.

405
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,030
Let's continue.

406
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,600
She wants to play blindfolded.

407
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,840
Beiyue.

408
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
There are two ways

409
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,790
to solve the ensemble performance
Mr. Lige is testing.

410
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,150
The first one is

411
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,240
to replay his tune.

412
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,310
But he is playing a new tune.

413
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,550
If you don't know the melody,

414
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,120
you can't keep up.

415
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,030
The second way is...

416
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,870
You,

417
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,910
say less.

418
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,910
Are you listening to yourself,

419
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,120
or to their playing?

420
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,560
Chu Feiyan is truly remarkable.

421
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,590
You should know,

422
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:07,760
there are few people in the world

423
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,800
who can keep up with Mr. Lige.

424
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
Moreover, this is a new tune.

425
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,950
Good.

426
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,590
Ziqing,

427
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,110
if you can't keep up,

428
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,760
it's not your fault.

429
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,150
Mr. Lige's tunes are unparalleled
in the world.

430
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,560
Not to mention keeping it up,

431
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,350
it's already impressive

432
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,910
not to be entranced.

433
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,830
That's right.

434
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,960
Not everyone can keep it up.

435
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,190
The Fourth Princess Consort
has done her best.

436
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,630
No need to be too harsh.

437
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,000
Beiyue,

438
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Ziqing is actually proficient
in music and playing techniques?

439
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,960
That's incredible.

440
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,280
(I didn't expect her to be so skilled
in playing the qin.)

441
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,190
(She is indeed the daughter
of Tianque's best qin master.)

442
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Master...

443
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,830
It was just a lucky match.

444
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,760
What's there to be proud of?

445
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,590
Mr. Lige,

446
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,320
please announce the result.

447
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Mr. Lige,

448
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,840
thank you for your effort.

449
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,870
Isn't the result obvious?

450
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,720
Princess Feiyan and the Fourth
Princess Consort each won a round.

451
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,760
Their qin skills

452
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,080
are evenly matched.

453
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,800
Your Majesty, you are mistaken.

454
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,870
In this qin duel,

455
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,960
in the first round,

456
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,150
they were tied.

457
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,360
In the second round,

458
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,510
the Fourth Princess Consort won.

459
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,930
The third round was also won
by the Fourth Princess Consort.

460
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,430
What did you say?

461
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,190
Wasn't the second round won
by Princess Feiyan?

462
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,150
The Fourth Princess Consort
didn't move a bit.

463
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,910
The musical style of the second section
is not suitable for ensemble playing.

464
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,350
Anyone with basic music theory knowledge
is aware of it.

465
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,150
If it were an ensemble playing,

466
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,670
it would sound cumbersome and dragging.

467
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,960
So the Fourth Princess Consort
was smart enough

468
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,110
to sit still and not move.

469
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,960
The Fourth Princess Consort
won the third section.

470
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,920
Therefore,

471
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,590
in this qin competition,

472
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,480
the Fourth Princess Consort won.

473
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
The Fourth Princess Consort
is indeed impressive.

474
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,630
That's great.

475
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,470
Come on.

476
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,430
Congratulations to the Princess Consort.

477
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,900
Congratulations
to the Fourth Princess Consort.

478
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,450
Congratulations
to the Fourth Princess Consort.

479
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,560
What are you doing?

480
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,280
I want to cut this woman's tendons.

481
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:37,710
Don't be impulsive.

482
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,040
Be careful not to ruin the big plan.

483
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,430
(This woman is not simple.)

484
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,390
(If she cannot be used by me,)

485
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,960
(I can't let her fall into
Jun Beiyue's hands.)

486
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,280
The Fourth Princess Consort is talented
in finger techniques.

487
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,350
I cannot compare to you.

488
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,720
This qin is called Wuzheng.

489
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,240
It is said to be able
to play without strings.

490
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,960
I have been searching for someone
who can master it.

491
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,480
I will gift this qin
to the Fourth Princess Consort.

492
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,320
Is this the legendary qin Wuzheng?

493
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,190
The Fourth Princess Consort,
a concubine's daughter,

494
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,760
has really made a name for herself.

495
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,600
Indeed.

496
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,120
What?

497
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,470
Lige,

498
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,350
do you want to give Wuzheng to Ziqing?

499
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,520
But that's Wuzheng!

500
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,350
One of the demonic qins in the world!

501
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,920
Mr. Lige,

502
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,590
I am dull-witted,

503
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,630
and cannot master this qin.

504
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,520
With such a precious qin,

505
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,630
you should take it back.

506
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,280
If a qin master has no soulmate,

507
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,720
they should abandon their hands.

508
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:03,240
If a qin has no soulmate,
its strings should be cut.

509
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,400
Since the Fourth Princess Consort
is unwilling to accept this qin,

510
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,430
it will have no owner.

511
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,990
It might as well be destroyed.

512
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,510
Wait a moment.

513
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,520
Since Mr. Lige is kind enough
to gift the qin,

514
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,670
then, I will accept it on her behalf for now.

515
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,430
If she truly dislikes it in the future,

516
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,800
I will return it to you.

517
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,520
That will do.

518
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

519
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,110
You really love making decisions
for others.

520
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,760
Father,

521
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,980
the literary and martial competition
has concluded.

522
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,430
Please announce the result, Father.

523
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,830
The literary and martial competition

524
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,320
has a total of three rounds.

525
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,670
The Fourth Princess Consort
won two and lost one.

526
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,560
The Fourth Princess Consort

527
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,840
is the winner.

528
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,800
Congratulations
to the Fourth Princess Consort.

529
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:32,480
Prince Xiang.

530
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,040
Prince Xiang.

531
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:39,840
Prince Xiang,

532
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,390
what about your stake?

533
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,400
What?

534
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,480
Are you afraid
that I won't honor my bet?

535
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,960
A bet is a bet.

536
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,870
The stake must be fulfilled in court.

537
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,960
Prince Xiang,

538
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,590
you owe Tianque 10, 000 fine horses.

539
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,870
And Xiling is not allowed
to step into the bordering land.

540
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,390
Please issue the order now, Prince Xiang.

541
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,520
Alright.

542
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,080
Xiling accepts the bet.

543
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,630
Both stakes will be fulfilled immediately.

544
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,600
Someone.

545
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,720
Bring him paper and ink.

546
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,910
The Fourth Princess Consort's actions
today

547
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,350
have humbled Xiling.

548
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,320
Indeed, it's wonderful.

549
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,320
Yes, indeed.

550
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,270
He signed it.

551
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,500
(Chu Tiange)

552
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,190
Prince Xiang,

553
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,840
please seal it.

554
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,190
Alright, the three rounds of competition

555
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,480
are all over.

556
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,910
Tomorrow, I'll meet you
in the autumn hunt.

557
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,830
Enjoy yourselves.

558
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

559
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,150
Mr. Lige, please wait.

560
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,880
