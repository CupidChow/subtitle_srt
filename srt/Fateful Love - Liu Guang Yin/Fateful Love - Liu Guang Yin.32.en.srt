21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
Your Highness,

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,950
I finally found you.

23
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,270
Don't do anything rash.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,830
Ms. Qin, have you forgotten?

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,120
I am no longer the Crown Prince.

26
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,190
I am now

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,800
just a useless pawn

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,510
discarded by Mother.

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,910
Are you very disappointed in me?

30
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,960
I will never be disappointed in you.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,080
I understand, Your Highness,

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,030
there must be a reason

33
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,270
for your actions.

34
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,100
Rest assured.

35
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,470
I have decided to go to war
with Jun Beiyue.

36
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,870
I will fight to get back

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
whatever belongs to me.

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,910
So, what should we do next?

39
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,870
Deliver this letter

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,520
to the Leader of Snow Region.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,110
Your Highness, are you going
to cooperate with Snow Region?

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,190
Since you have chosen
to stay by my side,

43
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,030
you must trust my decisions.

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,560
Yes.

45
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,510
Your Highness,

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,160
it seems

47
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Ten has rarely entered your room lately.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,750
She and Gu Xi are busy
with managing the corps.

49
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,110
They don't have time.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,940
But I have seen her

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,600
going to Madam Wan's room a lot.

52
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,600
I don't have time.

53
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,320
It's good
that she can chat with Madam Wan.

54
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Your Highness,

55
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,000
I feel that Ten has been unsettled

56
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,030
and suspicious.

57
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,270
She was young,

58
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,660
and hadn't received much education.

59
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,520
It's understandable

60
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,880
that she may be rebellious sometimes.

61
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,440
I will talk to her more.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,350
As long as you know it.

63
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,830
- Madam Wan.
- You're here.

64
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,990
You can keep playing the guqin.

65
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,950
I was taking a walk nearby.

66
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,470
While I was listening
to the sound of the guqin,

67
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,670
I just walked in unknowingly.

68
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,600
I hope I didn't disturb you.

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Not at all.

70
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,230
I was just playing casually.

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,160
Please have a seat.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
Serve the tea.

73
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,510
This dagger...

74
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,440
It was from Beiyue.

75
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,830
I know

76
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,880
you left it for him.

77
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,320
Beiyue gave it to me.

78
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,390
Will you be upset?

79
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,670
What are you talking about?

80
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,950
We are family now.

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,790
It's the same
whether it's with you or with him.

82
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,720
There is no difference.

83
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,230
You should keep it well.

84
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,880
Actually, I feel

85
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,830
I have a connection with this dagger.

86
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,760
What do you mean?

87
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,670
When I was little,

88
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,160
I saw this dagger with my mother.

89
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,760
Your mother?

90
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,510
Who...

91
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,040
She was Chancellor Han's second wife.

92
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
However,

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,950
she has passed away.

94
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,790
How

95
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,440
did she die?

96
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
I was still young at the time.

97
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,270
I'm not very sure.

98
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,070
I only remember the servants
at the residence

99
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,760
saying that she encountered a bandit

100
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,230
and fell off a cliff

101
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,320
when she went to offer incense.

102
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,000
(Unexpectedly,
she was that person's daughter.)

103
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,440
What's wrong?

104
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,390
Is your mother named Mu Ci?

105
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,270
Do you know her?

106
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,110
Yes.

107
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,510
The dagger

108
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,440
was given to me by your mother.

109
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,000
Now it can be considered
to have returned to its rightful owner.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,920
How did you meet?

111
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,070
When I left Meng Tribe back then,

112
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,390
I traveled around Longyuan.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,640
During the journey, I met Master Lu

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,790
and went to Liuxian Island with him.

115
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,760
There, I met your mother being bullied

116
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,350
and I helped her
drive away the ruffians.

117
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,230
From then on, we became friends.

118
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,200
She played the guqin very well.

119
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,550
She often invited me to listen to
the music and enjoy the scenery.

120
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,350
However,

121
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,070
when we were on Liuxian Island,

122
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,600
Master Lu never mentioned this.

123
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,440
He was busy with his family affairs.

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,270
How could he have time
to care about what I was doing.

125
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,880
So he may not know it at all.

126
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,270
Why did my mother

127
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,200
give you this dagger?

128
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,950
Later, I left Liuxian Island

129
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,040
and was separated from your mother.

130
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,790
Unexpectedly, a few years later,

131
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,270
we met again in Tianque City.

132
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,230
That day, we, a group of concubines,

133
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,340
went to Xiangguo Temple
to offer incense and pray for blessings.

134
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
When I was leaving in the carriage,

135
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,550
I saw your mother.

136
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,160
Unfortunately, due to my status,
I couldn't get off to greet her.

137
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,830
So I sent a maid to convey my message.

138
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,920
But she returned with this dagger.

139
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,920
Your mother asked me
to take good care of it.

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,040
Although I didn't understand why,

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,720
I decided to fulfill her request

142
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,670
and kept it like a treasure
for many years.

143
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,880
Even I left the palace later on,

144
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,110
it was still placed with Beiyue.

145
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,160
Have you seen my mother since then?

146
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
No, I haven't seen her again.

147
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,230
I didn't expect

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,270
that day to be our last meeting.

149
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,600
The piece you just played
was very beautiful.

150
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,950
It was also played by my mother
when she was alive.

151
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
I also like it very much.

152
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,040
This melody sounds so familiar.

153
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,200
I think I have heard
your mother played it before.

154
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,600
Really?

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,640
While playing,
she seemed to have said

156
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,660
that she was looking for a place.

157
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,550
So I have some impression.

158
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,120
What place?

159
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,030
It's been so long
that I can't remember clearly.

160
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,400
However, there is one name
that is unique.

161
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,640
So I remember it.

162
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,200
It seems to be called

163
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,960
Wuxie Gorge.

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,150
Wuxie Gorge?

165
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,550
Are you going to Wuxie Gorge?

166
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,750
Yes.

167
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,030
Ziqing's mother mentioned this place.

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,960
So we need to make a trip there.

169
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
In that case,

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840
I will go with you.

171
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:25,990
Mother,

172
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,670
we are still unclear
about the situation over there.

173
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,350
We don't know if there is any danger.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,680
It would be better for you
to stay in the Mansion.

175
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Don't worry.

176
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,230
I may not be young anymore,

177
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,200
but I have been traveling around
for many years.

178
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,910
I can still help you.

179
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,470
Moreover,

180
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,760
Mu Ci and I were good friends.

181
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,550
I should do my best for her.

182
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
Since that's the case,

183
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
let's go together.

184
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Thanks, Mother.

185
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,840
Don't mention it. We are a family.

186
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,440
If you are still worried,

187
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,760
why not bring Ten along?

188
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,710
She can take care of me,

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,880
so you all can rest assured.

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,960
Alright, as you wish.

191
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,160
Baili Weisheng,

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,760
do you want to get involved

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,350
into my family affair too?

194
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,280
It's about Ziqing.

195
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,000
How is it only your family affair?

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I want to go with you.

197
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,520
Say that again.

198
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,720
He can't go.

199
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,950
Why?

200
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,640
No time to lose,
so we'll depart tomorrow.

201
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
Why can't I go?

202
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,280
Did you hear that?

203
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,600
He said you can't go.

204
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Why can't I go?

205
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,750
Why?

206
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,470
Really, Madam Wan?

207
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,350
Are you taking me with you this time?

208
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,790
Of course, it's true.

209
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,880
It's thanks to your consideration.

210
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,280
You mentioned that Fourth Princess

211
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,520
is searching for some music scores.

212
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,770
Otherwise, how would I have the chance

213
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,030
to help my old friend's daughter?

214
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,280
I never expected that Ziqing and I

215
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,440
would have such a deep connection.

216
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,080
Madam, rest assured.

217
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,880
I will take good care of you.

218
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,550
Actually, this time I bring you along

219
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,080
just to let you and Beiyue

220
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,680
have the chance
to spend some time together.

221
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,840
You can also broaden your horizons

222
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,790
so that you can assist him well

223
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,880
in the future.

224
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,230
I'm willing to do everything

225
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,200
for you, Madam.

226
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,590
Rest assured.

227
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,760
Everything I do is for your good.

228
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,710
Madam Wan,

229
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,030
what can I help you?

230
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,600
Just act according to the situation
to cooperate with me

231
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,880
when the time comes.

232
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,140
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

233
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,990
Your Highness.

234
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,800
Eunuch Yin.

235
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,280
Your Highness,

236
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,350
His Majesty urgently summons you
to the palace.

237
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,030
You have seen it too.

238
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,640
I have urgent work to do

239
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,790
and need to leave Tianque.

240
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,630
You should return now

241
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,280
and help me report to Father

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,320
that after I return to Tianque,

243
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,080
I will go to meet him.

244
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,320
Your Highness, you can't.

245
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,910
His Majesty has summoned you
to the palace.

246
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,320
There must be an important matter.

247
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,670
Your Highness, you cannot
defy the imperial order.

248
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,720
Beiyue,

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,640
it's a private travel.

250
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,910
It's better not to arouse attention.

251
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,350
If you anger your father,

252
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,860
it will inevitably hinder our actions.

253
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,040
Interesting.

254
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,280
Yes.

255
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,120
You go first.

256
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,760
We will wait for you to set off.

257
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,720
It doesn't matter.

258
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,320
We can set off first.

259
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,000
You can catch up with us.

260
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,550
- Shadow.
- Yes.

261
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,880
You will depart together
with Fourth Princess.

262
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,360
Yes.

263
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Be careful.

264
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,280
Hurry up and go.

265
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,160
Let's go.

266
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,750
Yes.

267
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,590
Let's go.

268
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,930
Mother, are you tired?

269
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
No, I'm not.

270
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,910
- It's late.
- What are you standing here for?

271
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,500
- We can wait here for Beiyue.
- Go to borrow some fire.

272
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,400
We're almost starving.

273
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
I've already sent Ten to fetch water.

274
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,320
Let's have some water first.

275
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,160
Take a break.

276
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,030
- Your Highness, please try this.
- Xiaosheng,

277
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,760
what do you think of
Ziqing's mother-in-law?

278
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,240
What do you mean?

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,280
She's just a kind-hearted person.

280
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,240
Not really.

281
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,670
You can't judge a person
by their appearance alone.

282
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,350
Judged from her facial features,

283
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,200
she is not ordinary.

284
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,320
- This old lady is not simple.
- Please eat some food first.

285
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,350
I wonder if it suits your taste.

286
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,750
No wonder.

287
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,640
- Delicious.
- You're worried about Han Ziqing,

288
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,790
- so you come along, right?
- You eat too.

289
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It has nothing to do with this.

290
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,190
We're talking about her mother-in-law.

291
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,350
I advise you

292
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,880
to save your worries.

293
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,640
Fourth Prince

294
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,670
is quite capable.

295
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,640
You don't need to worry about it.

296
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,520
Stop messing with that firewood.

297
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,200
Aren't they eating over there?
Ask them for some.

298
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,590
I collected the firewood.

299
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,670
And now you want me to ask for food?

300
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,790
How about you?

301
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,360
I am your junior brother,

302
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,110
not your...

303
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,580
That person doesn't look like
a good person.

304
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,450
I don't want to provoke her.

305
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,350
- Go ahead.
- Alright. I'll go borrow it.

306
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,190
But you can't eat.

307
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,350
Just keep acting cool here.

308
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,440
After we finish eating,

309
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,350
let's rest a bit more.

310
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,790
- Okay.
- Ziqing,

311
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,790
what delicious food are you eating?

312
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,190
Are you hungry?

313
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,070
Pastries.

314
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,000
Why do you take them all?

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,030
We are two people here.

316
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,110
Give it to him.

317
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,710
- We still have more here.
- He can eat a lot.

318
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,550
Well, then I won't start a fire.

319
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,360
Go ahead.

320
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,150
I brought it here. You can't eat it.

321
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,990
Can you eat so much?

322
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,240
It smells so good.

323
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,000
It's a bit deep.

324
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,150
This should be the place.

325
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,550
It's still early.

326
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,230
Why don't we go down quickly?

327
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,640
It's too reckless and dangerous.

328
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,710
Let's take a break
and then set off again.

329
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,240
Alright.

330
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,030
Let's take a break.

331
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,400
We'll leave together
when Beiyue arrives.

332
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,870
Ziqing,

333
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,880
how about I go down first

334
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,790
to take a look?

335
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,760
Madam Wan, you are so great.

336
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,030
Do you dare to go down this deep?

337
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,550
That's quite impressive.

338
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,550
I have been wandering around
for many years.

339
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,710
Of course, I have some skills.

340
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,240
Ziqing,

341
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,230
Beiyue still hasn't arrived yet.

342
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,280
He must have been hindered

343
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,030
by His Majesty in the palace

344
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,870
and couldn't come over.

345
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,470
We can't just stay here.

346
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,030
Now that it's still early,

347
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,880
let's hurry down.

348
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,490
Alright then.

349
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,550
Let's set off as soon as possible.

350
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,430
Shadow,

351
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,450
you send someone to stay behind
to assist His Highness.

352
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,290
Yes.

353
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,910
Then I'll go down first.

354
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,290
Mother,

355
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,590
it's too dangerous. Let me go first.

356
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,550
Then I'll go second.

357
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,720
Be careful.

358
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,470
Clear. Come down now.

359
00:17:58,230 --> 00:17:59,800
Sir, His Highness hasn't arrived yet.

360
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,520
You just stay here

361
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,560
to wait for His Highness

362
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,400
and assist him.

363
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,410
- Yes.
- Yes.

364
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,600
Senior Brother,

365
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,430
where is this place? It's so cold.

366
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
Is it cold?

367
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,640
Aren't you cold?

368
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,680
(It's just as recorded in the books
in the Momentary Tower.)

369
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,880
(There is a Golden Merfolk Palace
beneath the Wuxie Gorge.)

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,280
(This should be the front hall
of the Golden Merfolk Palace.)

371
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,000
It seems like someone lives here.

372
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
Senior Brother, what's wrong with you?

373
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,070
This smell is very familiar.

374
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,190
But I can't remember.

375
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,150
The smell?

376
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,880
(As expected, the ancestor
set up many Barriers here.)

377
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,520
(The front hall is filled with
small defensive Barriers.)

378
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,350
(The larger Barriers)

379
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,110
(should all be in the rear hall.)

380
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,590
Who are you?

381
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,150
How dare you to trespass
into Mitian Deep Sea.

382
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,110
Mitian Deep Sea?

383
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,950
Deep sea?

384
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
There's no water here.

385
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,920
Sorry.

386
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,150
We just accidentally wandered in.

387
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,880
Could you please

388
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,160
report to your master?

389
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,190
(How could there be someone
in Golden Merfolk Palace?)

390
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,200
(According to the record,)

391
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,950
(Golden Merfolk have been extinct
for 20 years.)

392
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,840
What's going on?

393
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,040
Who is it?

394
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,760
How dare you trespass into my territory?

395
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,910
Sorry about that.

396
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,680
We didn't mean to.

397
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,270
Who are you?

398
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,280
You are intruders.

399
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,430
How dare you question me?

400
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,710
Do you want to die?

401
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,400
Release the arrows.

402
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:57,950
With just you lot,

403
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,760
how dare you come here?

404
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,070
You should know your own strength.

405
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,130
Nobody moves.

406
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
We don't want to fight.

407
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,950
Please tell us

408
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,800
who

409
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,640
is in charge here.

410
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,310
Hurry up and say it.

411
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,590
It's my mother.

412
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,430
Where is your mother?

413
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,640
Mother.

414
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Mother!

415
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,350
Save me, Mother!

416
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,190
Move aside.

417
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:35,910
Mother.

418
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,800
Who are you?

419
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,710
Why do you arrest my son?

420
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,640
(She should be the owner here.)

421
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,840
Release my son immediately!

422
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,110
Shadow.

423
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,550
Mother.

424
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Don't misunderstand.

425
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,310
We are not here to cause trouble.
We just want to...

426
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,190
Mother, stop wasting words with them.

427
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,030
They hit me.

428
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,280
You injured my son

429
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,350
in my territory.

430
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,880
Today,

431
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,280
none of you can leave alive!

432
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,040
So, you are actually...

433
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,640
Alright then.

434
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,190
Finally, you have come to us.

435
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,280
Then let's fight to the death.

436
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,030
Your Highness, be careful.

437
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,190
They are Silver Merfolk.

438
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,830
We are Silver Merfolk,

439
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,760
the owner of Mitian Deep Sea.

440
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,950
But you

441
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:07,830
came to the wrong place.

442
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,000
Kill them!

443
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,670
Retreat!

444
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,640
Attack their navels.

445
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,590
The Silver Merfolk's weak point
is at their navels.

446
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,520
Attack their navels.

447
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,230
Ziqing, attack their navels!

448
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,950
Mother.

449
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:22,880
Mother.

450
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
Mother.

451
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,480
Mother!

452
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,830
How do you know the weakness
of our Silver Merfolk?

453
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:52,190
I-I don't know how I know it either.

454
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,280
Who is this child?

455
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,510
He...

456
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,430
(As long as I hit her fainting point,)

457
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,350
(I can make the slightest effort)

458
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,040
(to lock her inside the Barrier.)

459
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,230
- Xiaosheng.
- Xiaosheng.

460
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
Xiaosheng.

461
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,800
Fortunately, he held his breath.

462
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,640
It's not serious for now.

463
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,710
You're causing trouble in my territory.

464
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,310
I will show you my power.

465
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,830
You have gone too far!

466
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,230
You are my son.

467
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,460
Son,

468
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,310
I'm your mother. I'm here!

469
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,240
Mother,

470
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,920
he is
from the Golden Merfolk Royal Family.

471
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,520
Sir,

472
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,360
you can't kill me.

473
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,150
We Silver Merfolk

474
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,800
are not just your kin

475
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,160
but also your servants.

476
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Since we are of the same tribe,

477
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
why do you want to kill us?

478
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,120
Because...

479
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,190
Because

480
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,680
she is the enemy
of the entire Golden Merfolk Tribe.

481
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,760
What are you talking about?

482
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,880
When did I ever become your enemy?

483
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,240
What do you mean?

484
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,190
The dagger in her hand

485
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:02,470
is made of red-gold scales.

486
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,070
The person who possesses such a dagger

487
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,760
is the enemy
of the entire Golden Merfolk Tribe.

488
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,000
Son,

489
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,800
do not believe her.

490
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,760
Don't believe her.

491
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,350
She is a liar!

492
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,760
What did you say?

493
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,600
Do you have any evidence?

494
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,550
Yes, indeed.

495
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,920
What evidence do you have?

496
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,310
This dagger

497
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,800
is a relic from her mother.

498
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,440
What does it have to do
with Golden Merfolk?

499
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,520
Red-gold scales

500
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,680
are the scales on the chest
of Golden Merfolk.

501
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,690
They're indestructible.

502
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,390
No Golden Merfolk would willingly
hand over such scales.

503
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,880
Unless

504
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,490
he is killed.

505
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,110
What about Golden Merfolk Tribe?

506
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,950
Where are they now?

507
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,190
And my parents?

508
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,110
Golden Merfolk Tribe

509
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,920
and your parents

510
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,470
all died at the hands of the Islanders

511
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,710
at that palace banquet in Nanzhao
years ago.

512
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,190
Son,

513
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,520
do not believe her.

514
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,590
It's not like that.

515
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,830
I'm here.

516
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,470
Explain it clearly. I don't understand.

517
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,870
Back then,

518
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,880
the Puppet Islanders
breached the Nanzhao palace.

519
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,950
To protect everyone,

520
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,380
the Golden Merfolk fought desperately.

521
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,310
Many of them died in the battle.

522
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,040
Your father, the King of Golden Merfolk,

523
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,470
discovered that the red-gold scales
could kill the Puppet Islanders.

524
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,430
So, they pulled out the red-gold scales
from their bodies resolutely

525
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,680
and gave them to the warriors
to use as weapons

526
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,760
to resist the Islanders.

527
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,190
All the Golden Merfolk followed suit

528
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:44,400
and offered their red-gold scales.

529
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,240
However,

530
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,400
without the scales,

531
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,070
the Golden Merfolk
cannot survive either.

532
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,560
In the end,

533
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,560
they all perished in battle.

534
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,950
And

535
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,680
she has a dagger made
of red-gold scales in her hand.

536
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,640
So she must have some connections
with that massacre years ago.

537
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,670
Mother.

538
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,070
Weisheng.

539
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,880
They used the red-gold scales
from their chests

540
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,280
to forge a dagger with immense energy.

541
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,440
Does this dagger truly
belong to your mother?

542
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,310
So she also participated

543
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,430
in the battle, right?

544
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,070
She is also one of those Islanders

545
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,350
who raised her weapon

546
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,230
against Golden Merfolk Tribe, right?

547
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,230
She used the golden scales

548
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,520
from the chest
of the Golden Merfolk Warriors

549
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,430
to forge this dagger, right?

550
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,240
Weisheng,

551
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,710
let's get it clear first.

552
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,840
Weisheng,

553
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,070
don't be agitated.

554
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,880
Though Ziqing's mother has this dagger,

555
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,680
it doesn't prove
that she is an Islander.

556
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,880
Perhaps her mother used the scales
to forge the dagger

557
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,190
to fight against the Islanders.

558
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,920
Han Ziqing is an Islander!

559
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,160
Her mother is one of them for sure!

560
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,840
What?

561
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,330
Ziqing,

562
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,160
are you an Islander?

563
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,560
So you knew the truth all along.

564
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,160
You pretended to be my friend,
didn't you?

565
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,190
No, it's not.

566
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,710
Don't believe her.

567
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,310
Don't believe her, son!

568
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,710
She was lying!

569
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,400
There have been terrifying legends

570
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,590
about the Islanders.

571
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,040
I thought it was just a legend.

572
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,950
I didn't expect the Islanders

573
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,920
to be so cruel

574
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,190
that they have committed
such a heinous crime.

575
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,030
Madam,

576
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,520
it has not been confirmed.

577
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,360
Do not speak recklessly.

578
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,880
That's not what I meant.

579
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,950
I'm just very shocked.

580
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,550
How can the Islanders

581
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,000
be so ferocious?

582
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,280
Both the witness and the evidence
are here.

583
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,430
What else is there to explain?

584
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,310
Mr. Baili,

585
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,830
you shouldn't listen to
just one side of the story.

586
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,670
Fourth Princess is...

587
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,920
My parents were killed by the Islanders.

588
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,590
I became an orphan
right after I was born.

589
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,520
Do you know how it feels?

590
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,160
Calm down.

591
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,360
I want to avenge my parents.

592
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,400
Han Ziqing,

593
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,240
your mother's debt should be repaid
by you.

594
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,820
Baili Weisheng!

595
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,560
If you are trying to hurt Her Highness,

596
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,760
don't blame me for being rude.

597
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,710
From now on, we are enemies.

598
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,320
Silver Merfolk Soldiers,
listen to my command.

599
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,160
Yes.

600
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,000
As the Lord of Golden Merfolk,
I command you

601
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,760
to capture them.

602
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,600
Yes, sir!

603
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,560
(If Baili Weisheng kills her,)

604
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,600
(all my previous efforts
will be in vain.)

605
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,150
(It's better
to use the Concealment Knot)

606
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,760
(to temporarily hide her
in this deep sea)

607
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,190
(and come back for her later.)

608
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,150
Their target is me.

609
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,150
You take everyone to leave.

610
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,360
Your Highness,
I'll stay. You all go first.

611
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,230
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

612
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,950
If you don't leave, you'll all die. Go!

613
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,000
Son, I'm here.

614
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,800
Son.

615
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,310
Ziqing!

616
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,920
Your Highness.

617
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,160
It's a Barrier!

618
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,030
Mother.

619
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,000
Mother, please open the Barrier.

620
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,840
No, I can't.

621
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,760
This Barrier can only be opened
after four hours.

622
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,150
My strength is already exhausted.

623
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,120
Where is this place?

624
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,520
Why does this place look so familiar?

625
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,600
Have we been here before?

626
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,120
Who dares to trespass on Liuxian Island?

627
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,910
Greetings, Fourth Prince.

628
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,950
Alright, you may rise.

629
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,190
Inform my master that I have arrived.

630
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,520
Yes.

631
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,550
Quickly report to the Master.

632
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,090
Beiyue,

633
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,840
we can't stay here for long.

634
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,150
Let's return to Tianque first.

635
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:27,990
Mother,

636
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,630
you are injured.

637
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll settle you here first

638
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,310
to take good care of your injuries.

639
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,390
I still need to find a way
to rescue Ziqing.

640
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,360
Let's go.

641
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,340
Keep up.

642
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,710
Beiyue,

643
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,520
I don't know you are coming over.

644
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,000
Why don't you tell me in advance?

645
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,150
Master,

646
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,290
the incident happened suddenly.

647
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,840
I have a favor to ask.

648
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:08,810
Mother,

649
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,710
you and my master are old acquaintances.

650
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,710
So there's no need for me
to introduce you.

651
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,920
Master Lu,

652
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,800
we meet again.

653
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,200
Wanyue.

654
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,280
Are you Wanyue?

655
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,320
That's great.

656
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,560
You're still alive.

657
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,230
You're alive!

658
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,840
Wanyue,

659
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,600
all these years,

660
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:47,470
I have always remembered
my promise to you.

661
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,360
I have completely passed on

662
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,080
the Lu's internal arts to Beiyue,

663
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,430
and also cured his illness.

664
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,870
I finally have fulfilled

665
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,670
my promise to you.

666
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,430
Wanyue,

667
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,000
I didn't expect

668
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,840
that in this lifetime,

669
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,910
I can see you again.

670
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,790
Master Lu,

671
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,950
I'm extremely grateful

672
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,600
for your kindness to Beiyue.

673
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,600
Now that we meet again,

674
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,080
allow me to give you a grand salute

675
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,150
- as a token of my gratitude.
- No, no.

676
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,150
Don't do this.

677
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,630
Beiyue, quickly, stop your mother.

678
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,510
Master.

679
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,120
Master, they're esteemed guests.

680
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,190
Moreover, they are injured.

681
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,840
Why don't we go inside to talk?

682
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,680
Alright.

683
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,120
Is this Mrs. Lu?

684
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,390
I'm Wanyue. Greetings, Mrs. Lu.

685
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,520
Over the years,

686
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,630
my husband
has always been thinking about you.

687
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,230
Compared to you,

688
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,760
I am insignificant.

689
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,280
I dare not accept your courtesy.

690
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,470
Please come inside.

691
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,040
Alright, please come inside.

692
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,080
Beiyue, quickly help your mother.

693
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,460
(Lu Manor)

694
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,840
Beiyue,
help your mother sit down.

695
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,220
Beiyue,

696
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,040
what is going on?

697
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,760
We are all injured.

698
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,430
Especially this child.
He is the most seriously hurt

699
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:17,580
and has been unconscious all along.

700
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,640
Master,

701
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,870
please find someone to check on him.

702
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,760
Alright, alright.

703
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,750
Honey,

704
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,800
go invite Doctor Hua

705
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,230
and arrange this child
to the inner room.

706
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,320
Alright.

707
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,870
Guard Shadow, please follow me.

708
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,440
Ten,

709
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,710
you should follow them too.

710
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,230
Help them.

711
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:45,760
Yes, Madam Wan.

712
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,950
Come on, this way.

713
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,330
Hurry up.

714
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,600
Here.

715
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,910
Slow down.

716
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,630
Lamei,

717
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,470
you will take care of this child

718
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,870
- for the next few days.
- Yes, Madam.

719
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,230
Mrs. Lu, I can handle it.

720
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,230
Since you are a guest, let her do it.

721
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,120
It's alright, Mrs. Lu.

722
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,150
Let me do it.

723
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,990
Alright.

724
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,230
Lamei,

725
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,670
go fetch a basin of hot water.

726
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,120
Let me check if Doctor Hua has arrived.

727
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,960
Yes.

728
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,520
It's a Merfolk Poison.

729
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,430
I have already removed it
with medication.

730
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,320
But remember,

731
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,710
do not get it wet before it heals.

732
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,550
Doctor,

733
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,040
when will my leg recover?

734
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,320
It will take

735
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,520
at least ten days to heal.

736
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,910
Master, I'll go check on that child.

737
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,870
Alright, go ahead.

738
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,470
Since that's the case,

739
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,470
Beiyue,

740
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,950
when your leg injury hasn't healed,

741
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,150
don't take any more risks.

742
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,910
As for rescuing Ziqing,

743
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,320
I think we should make other plans.

744
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,560
Beiyue, it's all my fault.

745
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,760
If it weren't for protecting me,

746
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,000
your leg won't get hurt

747
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,910
and Ziqing won't be captured.

748
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,810
Ziqing might have...

749
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,660
Mother,

750
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,150
you should focus on recovering first.

751
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,600
I will find a way to save Ziqing.

752
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,880
Master,

753
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,630
is there any way
to make my leg heal quickly?

754
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,430
Don't worry.
I will immediately send someone

755
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,190
to go to Qinse Valley to ask

756
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,800
if there are any good medicines.

757
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,950
As long as they are effective,

758
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,080
I will get it back for you.

759
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,640
(No way.)

760
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:36,520
(I can't let them rescue Han Ziqing.)

761
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,800
(She must stay in Wuxie Gorge.)

762
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,150
Someone!

763
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,670
- Mother.
- Quickly help Madam

764
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,280
- I'm fine. I'm just too tired.
- go rest in the guest room.

765
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,670
- Yes.
- I'll be fine after some sleep.

766
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:12,790
Doctor Hua,

767
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,760
how is the child doing?

768
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,560
Master,

769
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,390
the child is also affected
by Merfolk Poison.

770
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:19,630
He's severely weakened

771
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,520
and needs some medicines
to stabilize the vital energy.

772
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,190
When will he wake up?

773
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,280
This is

774
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,360
hard to say.

775
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,160
Honey,

776
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,040
according to the prescription
given by Doctor Hua,

777
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,320
go get the medicines immediately.

778
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,630
Alright.

779
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:35,600
Doctor Hua, please follow me.

780
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,440
Yes.

781
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,440
Wanyue,

782
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,840
didn't I tell you to go back
to your room and rest?

783
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,710
Why do you come over?

784
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:49,800
I am worried about this child.

785
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,640
I'm here to check on him.

786
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,360
Madam Wan,

787
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,150
I didn't expect that his senior brother

788
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,710
even tried to kill us,

789
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,650
but we still have to save him.

790
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,990
What nonsense are you talking about?

791
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,670
Xiaosheng is just a child.

792
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,910
What does it have to do with him?

793
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:08,870
Stop saying such words.

794
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,430
Yes, Madam Wan.

795
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,390
My mistakes.

796
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,070
Wanyue,

797
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,710
I have already arranged for dinner.

798
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,600
Let's have dinner together.

799
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,760
Ten,

800
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,320
take good care of this child.

801
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,160
Yes.

802
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,600
Madam Wan.

803
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,680
Madam Wan.

804
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,560
Xiaosheng is a girl.

805
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,160
Really?

806
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,150
Doctor Hua found it when he was
applying the medicine for her.

807
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:44,520
Xiaosheng is a girl.

808
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,360
No wonder I felt
something was off about her.

809
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,680
Ten,

810
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,670
if this child wakes up,

811
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,670
I'm afraid it might be troublesome.

812
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,910
She seemed to have seen something

813
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,760
in Mitian Deep Sea.

814
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,890
What do you mean, Madam?

815
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,080
You know what I mean.

816
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:17,510
