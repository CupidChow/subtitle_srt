When Ziqing hadn't fallen,

40
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,650
you kept digging into the sand.

41
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,550
As soon as Ziqing fell,

42
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,620
you stopped digging.

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,190
Tell me.

Let go.

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,290
- Why are you here?
- Let go.

51
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,440
No, what's going on?
What are you trying to do?

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,670
If he cared about Ziqing,

53
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,990
Ziqing wouldn't have had the accident.

54
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,390

55
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,800
Calm down.

56
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Ziqing has already fallen.

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,190
He knew Ziqing's background well,

58
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,930
so why didn't he protect her properly?

59
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,770
Now he's just pretending here.

60
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,250
Let go of me.

61
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,160
Don't go.

62
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,110
The most urgent thing now
is to find Ziqing, isn't it?

63
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,960
What's done is done.

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,240
If you kill him or he kills you,

65
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,100
will Ziqing come out?

66
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,290
Are you out of your mind?

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,270
Ziqing couldn't have just fallen

68
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,460
for no reason.

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,600
There must be something fishy about it.

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,440

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,110

I need to stay here to find Ziqing.

78
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,550
Then you dig here.

79
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,610
I'm leaving. I'll go by myself.

00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,190
Go.

Han Ziqing,

107
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,860
stop struggling.

108
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,160
The Isolated Island's bloodline

109
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,740

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,100
You were never meant to exist
on Longyuan Continent

111
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,620
Exile yourself,

112
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,240
and you can gain freedom.

113
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,380
Gain freedom?

114
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,190
Can you take me away from here?

115
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,940
Of course, I can.

116
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,860
You can go anywhere you want.

117
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,130
Trust me.

I'm helping you.

Who are you?

120
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,920
Why are you helping me?

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,010
It is not important.

122
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,740
What matters is who you are.

123
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,380
You are an Islander.

124
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,590
This Poisonous Grass World

125
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,250
exists because of you.

126
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,650
You should accept it

127
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,570
and become stronger here.

128
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,210
Being a Human Puppet
is your ultimate destiny.

129
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,740
I am not a Human Puppet.

130
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,650
I am not an Islander.

131
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,770
I am not Han Ziqing.

132
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,440
I am myself.

133
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,880
I am myself.

134
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,300
Myself!

135
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,860
(This girl is so hard to tame.)

136
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,130
(The entrance to the Barrier
is now closed.)

137
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,980
(It seems I have to make other plans.)

138
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Ten, Your Highness is suffering
from a rush of anger.

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,910
He is having a fever.

140
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,880
Take good care of him.

141
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,520
- I'll go prepare some medicine.
- Yes.

142
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,380
Shadow, come with me.

143
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,390
Your Highness.

144
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,100
Ziqing.

145
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
Ziqing,

146
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,890
you're back.

147
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,420

Who is it?

149
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,330
Come out right now.

150
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,330
I'll count to three.

151
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,640
If you don't come out,

152
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,100
don't blame me for being rude.

153
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,300
My books!

154
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,300
My books!

155
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,540
This is going to kill me.

156
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,940
Who is it?
If you have the guts, come out.

157
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,200
Master Jin, don't be anxious.
I'll come out.

158
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
Baili Weisheng.

159
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,980
Why are you here?

160
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,880
You trespassed into Archive Pavilion,
the forbidden area.

161
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,060
Do you wish to die?

162
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,350
Don't be hasty.

163
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,520
I just missed you.

164
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,840
I wanted to come see you.

165
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,420
Do we have any relationship?

166
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,250
How you would come to see me?

167
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,710
This is the royal forbidden area.

168
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:59,000
You must be up to no good
to trespass here.

169
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,570
Keep your voice down.

170
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,650
If my hand shakes,

171
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,440
these hundred-year-old books

172
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,280
may be burned down by fire.

173
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,320
Baili Weisheng,

174
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,890
what exactly do you want?

175
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,230
Master Jin,

176
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:14,150
I just want to find a book
in Archive Pavilion.

177
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,740
Why don't you help me look for it?

178
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,210
You brat

179
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,940
snoop around Archive Pavilion.

180
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,590
I think you're tired of living.

181
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,210
I'll report this to His Majesty
immediately.

182
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,210
Wait, wait.

183
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,980
Put the fire away.

184
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,550
Put it away.

185
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,520
Don't come any closer.

186
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,860
Or I'll really set it on fire.

187
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,890
Let's talk this over.

188
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,270
You brat,

189
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,110
setting fire to Archive Pavilion

190
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,550
is a crime punishable
by flaying and dismemberment.

191
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,180
You better think it over.

192
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,620
Master Jin,

193
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,110
for the sake of our old acquaintance,

194
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,520
just tell me

195
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,350
where the book

196
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,360
about Mingsha Mountain is.

197
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,540
I won't burn your books anymore.

198
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,450
Mingsha Mountain?

199
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,080
What are you going there for?

200
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,110
Is there something strange
about Mingsha Mountain?

201
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,180
How would I know?

202
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,860
Is there something in Mingsha Mountain?

203
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,890
For example,

204
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:13,980
is it a secret chamber full of poisons?

205
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,200
I only handle herb gathering
and medicine refining.

206
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,850
How would I know anything
about secret chambers?

207
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,470
I'm not from Meng Tribe.

208
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,060
How could I possibly create a Barrier
for a secret chamber out of thin air?

209
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,510
Barrier?

210
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,250
Are you saying

211
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,320
there's a Barrier
under Mingsha Mountain?

212
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,640
You said

213
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,670
there's a secret chamber
under Mingsha Mountain.

214
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,130
I just remembered it.

215
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,620
There must be a book

216
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,620
about the Barrier at Mingsha Mountain.

217
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,000
in Archive Pavilion.

218
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,980
No, no.

219
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,500
There's nothing. You should leave.

220
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,760
Otherwise, I'll call the guards.

221
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,320
I knew you wouldn't help me.

222
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,210
Luckily, I'm smart.

223
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,100
I've already found it myself.

224
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,660
You brat.

225
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,450
Could he take it?

226
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,680
You brat,

227
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,230
how dare you deceive me.

228
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,070
Thanks.

229
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,200
Stop right there.

230
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,810
You brat, stop right there.

231
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,160
You brat, you've been hit
by my Seven Insect Powder.

232
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,470
Do you still want to get away unscathed?

233
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,570
Go to hell!

234
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,140
Luckily, you protected me.

235
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,360
Without you,

236
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,860
this arm would be useless.

237
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,050
What a Golden Merfolk am I
without golden scales?

238
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,980
I knew something was fishy about this.

239
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,860
There is a Barrier indeed.

240
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:53,270
Found it.

241
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,140
Why am I back here again?

242
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,690
Why is it here again?

243
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,020
Everything here is poisonous.

244
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,980
This fruit

245
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,740
must be poisonous too.

246
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,690
Anyway, I'm immune to all poisons,
so what am I afraid of?

247
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,450
It's better than starving to death.

248
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,380
Beiyue.

249
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,980
Beiyue.

250
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,500
Save me.

251
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,810
Beiyue,

252
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,740
save me.

253
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,030
His Highness is awake.

254
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,390
Beiyue.

255
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:30,110
Your Highness.

256
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:30,950
Your Highness.

257
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,870
Your Highness.

258
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,410
Have you found Ziqing?

259
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,000
Your Highness, please don't move.

260
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,230
- Your Highness.
- Fourth Prince.

261
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,070
Jun Beiyue.

262
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,110
Jun Beiyue,

263
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:58,280
no matter how much force you use
to dig that sand.

264
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,160
It's all in vain.

265
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,000
Do you know?

266
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,470
I don't believe
she would just disappear into thin air.

267
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,310
I'm back.

268
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,780
I'm back.

269
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,330
She just disappeared into thin air.

270
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,930
There is a Barrier
under Mingsha Mountain.

271
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,440
I read it.

272
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
In the book from the Archive Pavilion
of Nanzhao,

273
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,980
it is recorded

274
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,040
that every Jiazi day on the Jiazi month,

275
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,280
several Barriers will open.

276
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,660
Ziqing fell in at that time.

277
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,450
Now you all understand, right?

278
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,680
Chu Feiyan deliberately led Ziqing

279
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,820
to the entrance to the Barrier.

280
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,950
When it's time, the Barrier opened

281
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,260
and Ziqing fell in.

282
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,720
Moreover...

283
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,980
What?

284
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,210
Moreover, Ziqing is an Islander.

285
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,640
The Islanders
have a special body constitution.

286
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,680
There might be something inside
that suppresses Ziqing.

287
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,210
Did the book mention

288
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,350
how to break the Barrier?

289
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,040
This book didn't say,

290
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:48,880
but

291
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,410
the book recorded

292
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,380
that the Barrier was set by Meng Tribe.

293
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,920
Yes, I also heard it from my father.

294
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,160
The Meng Tribe of Nanzhao

295
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,600
is the most skilled
in Barrier Technique.

296
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,280
Your Highness,

297
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,260
Meng Tribe has been secluded
in Nanzhao for years

298
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,430
without contact with the outside world.

299
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,710
Even if the King of Nanzhao
summons them, they might not come.

300
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,470
No matter how difficult it is,
we must invite them here.

301
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,310
Yes.

302
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,630
Shadow.

303
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,990
Here.

304
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,830
You must help me

305
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,670
bring Meng Tribe here.

306
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,990
Yes.

307
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,440
Beiyue.

308
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,980
Han Ziqing fell into the Barrier,

309
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,620
and the entrance disappeared
out of thin air?

310
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,230
What is going on?

311
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,500
I can't figure it out either.

312
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,040
After all,

313
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,740
I don't know much about Barriers.

314
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,530
It's good that it disappeared.

315
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,330
Let her fend for herself there.

316
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,110
This way,

317
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
we can also avoid trouble

318
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,410
with Jun Beiyue.

319
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,410
I think it's unwise.

320
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,260
If we ignore it,

321
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,290
and someone else gets ahead of us,

322
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,380
it will be endless trouble.

323
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,880
I believe

324
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,680
we must find Han Ziqing.

325
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,740
To see the person or her corpse.

326
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,210
Only then can we be at ease.

327
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,170
You are right.

328
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,170
Then we need to find someone to help.

329
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,930
Now there is someone who can be used.

330
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,260
Whom are you referring to?

331
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,880
I have kept her confined in Ice Pool

332
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,050
for over 20 years.

333
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,750
Back then,

334
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,290
she was extraordinarily gifted.

335
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,280
She deciphered the second level
of Meng Tribe's Momentary Tower

336
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,210
stole the true teachings,

337
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,570
and was thus expelled from Meng Tribe.

338
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,590
If she cannot break this Barrier,

339
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,430
I'm afraid...

340
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,570
This woman is ambitious.

341
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,290
Releasing her

342
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,930
might ruin our grand plans.

343
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,510
Yes,

344
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,860
you are right.

345
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,830
Then it's better

346
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,780
not to get her involved for now.

347
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,830
Now we have no choice
but to seek help from Meng Tribe.

348
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,680
But Chief Meng has always been stubborn.

349
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,350
He is unwilling to associate
with the royal family.

350
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,640
Even if he can find the Barrier

351
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,690
and open the entrance,

352
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,210
he probably won't follow our orders.

353
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,810
No matter how powerful they are,

354
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,160
they are still citizens of Nanzhao.

355
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,000
Yes.

356
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,330
Besides Chief Meng,

357
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,830
there might be other disciples

358
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,160
in Meng Tribe who can handle it.

359
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,350
It is said that Chief Meng
is quite dissatisfied

360
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,980
with his two sons.

361
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,380
He believes they are mediocre
and behave improperly.

362
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,210
Therefore, he hasn't considered them

363
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,190
to be the next chief.

364
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,500
This has caused their discontent.

365
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,640
We might as well

366
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,020
make some moves in this matter

367
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,980
and lend them a helping hand.

368
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,330
Greetings, Your Majesty.

369
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,810
You may rise.

370
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

371
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,310
Thank you, Your Majesty.

372
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,910
Your Majesty,

373
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,740
it has been a long time
since we last visited the Royal City.

374
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,570
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

375
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,800
Masters,

376
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,020
you must have received my secret letter.

377
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,500
Your Majesty, if you are in trouble,

378
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,230
we will do our utmost

379
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,410
to alleviate your worries.

380
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,260
However, my father is quite averse

381
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:48,290
to the matters outside the tribe,

382
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,810
and is unwilling to get involved.

383
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,800
If we act behind his back,

384
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,620
it would be against the tribe's rules.

385
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,620
Masters, your words are mistaken.

386
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,280
Compared to the rules
of Meng Tribe,

387
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,530
the safety of Nanzhao is more important.

388
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,050
Moreover,

389
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,380
when this Poisonous Grass World
was established,

390
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,290
your ancestor chief
was also involved.

391
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,800
Now,

392
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,230
it is only natural

393
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,160
for his descendants

394
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,690
to find and open this Barrier.

395
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,740
Therefore, I persuaded my brother

396
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,190
to come here
without informing our father.

397
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,100
Even if we are punished
for violating the rules,

398
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,760
my brother and I
will have a clear conscience.

399
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,600
Brother.

400
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,660
Third Master, I'm pleased

401
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,620
that you can understand
for the greater good.

402
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,830
I promise,

403
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,050
as long as you can find the entrance
to the Poisonous Grass World,

404
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,530
and find the person,

405
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,000
I will fully support Second Master

406
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,410
to take over Meng Tribe.

407
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:54,990
Brother.

408
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,070
Your Majesty, I will do my utmost
to relieve your worries.

409
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

410
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,510
You may rise.

411
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

412
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,560
Remember,

413
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,620
once you capture Han Ziqing,

414
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:16,450
kill her immediately.

415
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,410
Mr. Situ,

416
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,690
have you heard from Shadow
in Dream Island?

417
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,080
Shadow has sent a letter.

418
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,720
What does it say?

419
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,880
He says Chief Meng is old and reclusive,

420
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,430
and has long stopped
seeing outside guests.

421
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,880
He is still waiting outside

422
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,990
and he asks us to wait for news.

423
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,620
That's all we can do for now.

424
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,040
How about I write a letter to my father

425
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,530
and see if he has any ideas?

426
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,500
That would be great.

427
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,720
Thank you.

428
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,470
I have followed the steps

429
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,450
to meticulously create
this little soul bug.

430
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:08,830
I rely on you to find the Barrier now.

431
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,110
You must not let me down.

432
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,380
Don't give up halfway.

433
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,410
Right. I should follow you.

434
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,930
(I can't be trapped here.)

435
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,290
(I still need to find the music scores.)

436
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,980
(I still need to go home.)

437
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
Brother,

438
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,020
there are no signs of Barrier.

439
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,450
It seems the entrance has moved.

440
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,780
That's quite strange.

441
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,980
What's so strange about it?

442
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,980
Although the entrance has moved,

443
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,140
I can still sense it.

444
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,100
It should be nearby.

445
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,230
Take this.

446
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,120
This way.

447
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,260
(Dream Island)

448
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,430
Don't move.

449
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,380
Who are you?

450
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,970
How dare you trespass on Dream Island?

451
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,770
I am the Crown Prince of Dongling.

452
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,290
I have something urgent to discuss
with Chief Meng.

453
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,570
The Crown Prince of Dongling

454
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,660
has something urgent

455
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,640
to discuss

456
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,330
with Chief Meng.

457
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,360
Master,

458
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,700
that person has been unconscious
since arriving on the island.

459
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,190
He claimed to be the Crown Prince
of Dongling

460
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,460
and had something to discuss with you.

461
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,280
But you have been in seclusion,

462
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,530
so I didn't dare disturb you.

463
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,860
Give him some water.

464
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,510
Who are you?

465
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,490
Young man,

466
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,530
your health doesn't seem very good.

467
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,010
I am well aware of my illness.

468
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,860
It is beyond cure.

469
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,620
Just let it be.

470
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,730
May I ask if you are Chief Meng?

471
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,660
Yes, I am.

472
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,150
Your body is weak.

473
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,100
Don't move.

474
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,190
I am Xuanyuan Lige,

475
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,710
and I have an urgent matter
to ask for your help.

476
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,900
That is why I came here abruptly.

477
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,050
Chief Meng, please save a life.

478
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,120
Are you still caring about
others' affairs?

479
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,700
But you now are on the brink of death.

480
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,760
Compared to my life,

481
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,480
there is something more important
right now.

482
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,320
When you can survive,

483
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,000
we can talk about it later.

484
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,840
How about that?

485
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,040
But Chief Meng,

486
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,880
I...

487
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,900
You are already at the end of your life.

488
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,460
I can only use the Barrier Technique
to save you.

489
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,490
I'm not supposed to meddle in
others' affairs,

490
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,870
but by a stroke of fate,

491
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,570
you came to Meng Tribe.

492
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,380
I cannot stand by and watch you die.

493
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,510
Master.

494
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,460
Take care of him.

495
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:20,950
This way.

496
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,500
(Sha)

497
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,250
Brother, do you sense anything?

498
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,330
The aura is getting stronger.

499
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,250
It should be right here.

500
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,670
Here?

501
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,420
In this room?

502
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:11,330
Who are you?
Why are you sneaking around here?

503
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,320
I...

504
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
We are...

505
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,160
What happened?

506
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:16,520
Mr. Situ,

507
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,770
we found two suspicious individuals.

508
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,360
Who are you?

509
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,200
What are you doing here?

510
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,840
We are from Meng Tribe.

511
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,730
We came here...

512
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,220
You are from Meng Tribe?

513
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,190
You arrived so quickly.

514
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,040
Earlier, we sent someone to Meng Tribe
but he was turned away at the door.

515
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,810
We thought you were unwilling to help.

516
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,730
Masters, please come in.

517
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:38,950
Alright.

518
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,030
Please.

519
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,740
(Sha)

520
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,730
Isn't this Sha Qiuzi's clinic?

521
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,010
It stopped moving.

522
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,250
You little bug.

523
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,140
Why did you stop moving?

524
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,490
What are you doing here?

525
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,970
What's going on?

526
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,530
Now here's the current situation.

527
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,010
I wonder if you two can help.

528
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,460
It's not easy to find the Barrier.

529
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,660
We need to sense the aura
of the Barrier first.

530
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,010
Only then can we make a decision.

531
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,660
Mr. Situ,

532
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,050
has Chief Meng arrived?

533
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,320
May I know who are they?

534
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,900
These are the two masters
from Meng Tribe.

535
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,000
We are the seventh-generation disciples
of Meng Tribe.

536
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,710
By the order of my father,

537
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,660
we have come to help Fourth Prince.

538
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,320
That's wonderful.

539
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,430
Earlier, Shadow sent a message

540
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,810
saying Chief Meng was unwilling
to intervene in this matter.

541
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,530
My father is upright by nature,

542
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,900
and he is also a reasonable person.

543
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,950
He can't come here in person,

544
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,900
so he sent us two brothers.

545
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,910
Chief Meng is so righteous.

546
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,670
I want to thank you
on behalf of Fourth Prince.

547
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,800
Since it is Fourth Prince's request,

548
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,010
why not invite him to join us

549
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,770
to discuss and make a decision?

550
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,490
Fourth Prince has been
searching for the person for days.

551
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,120
He fainted from exhaustion.

552
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,110
He is currently recuperating.

553
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:08,970
Fourth Prince is ill?

554
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,860
Is it serious?

555
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,160
Don't worry.

556
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,390
His Highness is fine.

557
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,940
He will recover soon.

558
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,320
Do you need to prepare anything

559
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,040
to find the Barrier?

560
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,880
No need.

561
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:26,220
We will first visit Fourth Prince,

562
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,100
and then please accompany us

563
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,470
to inspect around.

564
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:32,000
Of course, please.

565
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,840
Please.

566
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,710
Take it.

567
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,670
Please.

568
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,940
(Sha)

569
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,100
Masters, this way, please.

570
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,250
Fourth Prince is in this room.

571
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:12,950
Master,

572
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,320
is there anything wrong?

573
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:17,730
His Highness is indeed here?

574
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,990
Yes.

575
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,940
But I sense

576
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,010
the entrance to the Barrier

577
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,490
is right here.

578
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,080
Well...

579
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,000
We need to go in and check immediately.

580
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,840
Master, please.

581
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,430
Please.

582
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:36,880
Let's go.

583
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:42,670
Please.

584
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,010
Brother, is there something unusual?

585
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:09,900
Can you see anything?

586
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,010
I can confirm

587
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,940
the entrance is right in this room.

588
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:21,270
