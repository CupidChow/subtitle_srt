21
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,470
Mother,

22
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,230
are you feeling better?

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm fine.

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,510
You should think about
how to save Ziqing first.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,400
Should I ask Doctor Hua to check on you?

26
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,790
No need.

27
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,360
Although Master Lu is kind,

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,440
he is still an outsider.

29
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,870
We shouldn't trouble him too much.

30
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,550
Beiyue,

31
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,390
how about

32
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,800
returning to Tianque first?

33
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,320
Are you saying

34
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,160
that I should disregard Ziqing's safety

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,110
and return to Tianque with you?

36
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,670
That's not what I mean.

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,960
I am also worried about Ziqing.

38
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,720
I wish I could rescue her
as soon as possible.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,880
But I don't

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,080
feel well now.

41
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,270
Otherwise, I will go with you
to Mitian Deep Sea.

42
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,660
Mother,

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,880
don't think too much about it for now.

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,390
The most important thing now
is to take good care of your health.

45
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,670
I will find a way to save Ziqing.

46
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
Alright.

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Then you should go rest quickly.

48
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,880
Mother, good night.

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,800
Get up!

50
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,720
Weren't you bullying me?

51
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,600
Weren't you very capable?

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,160
Weren't you very good at fighting?

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,000
Get up!

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,630
- Get up!
- Beat her to death!

55
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,360
- Get up!
- Let's see how capable she is.

56
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,520
Weren't you bullying me?

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,360
Get up!

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,900
- Weren't you...
- Stop!

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,110
Son.

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,520
Son, I'm here!

61
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,240
Sir, the prisoner wants to escape.

62
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,460
Fortunately, we arrived just in time.

63
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,800
How can you beat her without orders?

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,240
She is not a prisoner.

65
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,550
She is just my enemy.

66
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,470
Therefore, without my command,

67
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,470
no one is allowed to touch her.

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,280
Do you hear that?

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
I understand.

70
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,960
I will follow your command.

71
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,720
The Silver Merfolk Soldiers are outside.

72
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,190
Just feel free

73
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,640
to give your orders.

74
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,910
You two will receive 50 lashes.

75
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,630
If you do it again,
there will be no leniency.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go ahead.

77
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,070
Do you think I don't dare?

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
You dare.

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,600
But you don't want to.

80
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,920
What makes you so confident?

81
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,350
Is it because of our fake friendship?

82
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,760
Fake?

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,480
If you think this way,

84
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,070
just consider that I never knew you.

85
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,510
From the moment I learned the truth,

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
everything

87
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
becomes fake.

88
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
If your wounds don't stop bleeding,

89
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,200
you are about to bleed to death.

90
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,390
Don't get me wrong.

91
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,510
I just don't want you to die so quickly.

92
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,550
Do you believe

93
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,440
it was the Islanders

94
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,390
who exterminated your entire tribe?

95
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,230
Isn't it so?

96
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,510
You will definitely speak up
for your kin.

97
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,920
But Han Ziqing, let me tell you.

98
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,390
Blood for blood.

99
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,040
I will not be deceived

100
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,950
by your sweet talk again.

101
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,720
If the truth is uncovered

102
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,200
and it's the Islanders
who exterminated your tribe,

103
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,320
you can deal with me as you want.

104
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
Sir,

105
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,110
she is arguing cunningly

106
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,550
while attempting to escape.

107
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,830
The Islanders are evil and atrocious.

108
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,320
They killed your parents.

109
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
You must not let her go.

110
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,670
Keep an eye on her.

111
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,510
If anything goes wrong,
you'll be held responsible.

112
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,110
Understood.

113
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,640
Son,

114
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,760
I'm here!

115
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,320
Son,

116
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,950
I'm right here!

117
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,440
Turn around and look.

118
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,720
I'm right here.

119
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,270
Turn around.

120
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,390
I'm right here, Son.

121
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,790
Son.

122
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,830
Son.

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,670
Son.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
Wanyue,

125
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,270
why did you come out?

126
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,480
I've been cooped up in the house all day.

127
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,950
I just came out to get some fresh air.

128
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,110
It's so late.

129
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,720
I thought you went to sleep.

130
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,670
It's been busy and chaotic these days.

131
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,270
I don't get a chance

132
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,790
to have a word with you alone.

133
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,350
Wanyue,

134
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,390
do you still want to
be so distant with me?

135
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,510
It's better not to mention the past.

136
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,350
But in my heart, I have always...

137
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,190
No need to say more.

138
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,510
I just came here by accident.

139
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,440
I did not mean to disturb you.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,920
Please do not mistake me, Master Lu.

141
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,350
Wanyue,

142
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,270
back then, you left suddenly.

143
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,110
I...

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,160
I married someone else
only because I felt so desperate.

145
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,910
But in my heart,

146
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,400
I've been keeping a place for you.

147
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,320
Now,

148
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,670
when I see you standing
right in front of me,

149
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,630
I feel

150
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,080
so complicated indeed.

151
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,630
If I did

152
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,670
something offensive,

153
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,200
please forgive me.

154
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,590
You passed the Lu's internal arts
to Beiyue

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,190
and didn't keep anything private.

156
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,030
I am grateful to you.

157
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,400
But now, we are no longer
what we used to be.

158
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,660
Let's just be well in our own lives.

159
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,900
Of course.

160
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,760
Of course, we should each be well.

161
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,040
However,

162
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,350
there is one thing
that has always worried me.

163
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,120
Therefore,

164
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,470
I came over to ask you.

165
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,920
What?

166
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,190
Wanyue,

167
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,200
don't take me offensive.

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,030
I just want to ask,

169
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
well,

170
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,960
are you still practicing that?

171
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,390
Master Lu,

172
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,320
we are just old acquaintances.

173
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
You have shown kindness to Beiyue,
and I am grateful.

174
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,200
But other matters
have nothing to do with you.

175
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,150
So please do not ask further.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
Wanyue,

177
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,870
Wanyue...

178
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,240
You were offering warmth to someone
who responded with coldness.

179
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,280
I think you were asking for trouble.

180
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,120
Honey,

181
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,710
when did you arrive here?

182
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,510
What did you hear?

183
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,990
Honey,

184
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,790
what did you hear?

185
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,760
When you go out,

186
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,000
make sure not to speak recklessly.

187
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,350
I didn't hear anything.

188
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,960
I only know that my husband

189
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,110
has always had another woman
in his heart

190
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,000
and remains infatuated with her.

191
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,280
Honey.

192
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,680
Honey.

193
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,480
Your Highness,

194
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,080
you asked me
to take so many silver taels.

195
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,920
What was it for?

196
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,510
Do you know

197
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,470
how wide

198
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,000
and how deep

199
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,510
Wuxie Gorge is?

200
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,320
I don't know.

201
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,640
The narrowest part of this gorge

202
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,880
is only
about five or six centimeters wide.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,880
The deep gorge is wide at the top
and narrow at the bottom.

204
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,150
It is perfect to tunnel through it
from the bottom.

205
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,700
Tunnel through it?

206
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Your Highness,

207
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,230
are you planning to dig a tunnel

208
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,230
under the gorge?

209
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,000
It's not that I want to dig a tunnel,

210
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,230
but a tunnel below this gorge

211
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,880
is about to be completed.

212
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
What?

213
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,080
As early as three years ago,

214
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,840
I have already started this plan.

215
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,150
It's just that midway,
due to my physical weakness,

216
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,790
I was worried
I wouldn't make it to that day,

217
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,640
so it has been stopped for a few times.

218
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,230
However, since I have decided
to go to war now,

219
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,670
this tunnel work must be finished.

220
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,640
The entrance to this tunnel

221
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,400
is on the territory of Dongling,

222
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,710
while the exit of the tunnel

223
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,320
happens to be
on the territory of Xiling.

224
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,590
Dongling is not bordering with Tianque.

225
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,280
Your Highness, are you intending
to use this tunnel

226
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,590
to get across from Dongling
to Wuxie Gorge

227
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:11,840
and head west to Xiling

228
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,440
to occupy Xiling

229
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,790
to battle with Tianque?

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,840
That's right.

231
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,160
But

232
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,910
the terrain here is treacherous.

233
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,110
The project is so enormous.

234
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,400
Where can you find the workers?

235
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,590
You don't need to worry about that.

236
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,110
I have been secretly training
a group of craftsmen for a long time.

237
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,550
Now,

238
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,640
they are working on it.

239
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,080
I see.

240
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,270
How is he doing?

241
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,040
Your Highness,

242
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,790
although he remained unconscious,

243
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,910
he slept soundly.

244
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,440
It seems to be a good thing.

245
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,530
Your Highness,

246
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,530
there is something

247
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,520
I wonder if Madam Wan
has mentioned to you.

248
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,510
What?

249
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,000
Xiaosheng

250
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,150
is a girl.

251
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,800
This is good.

252
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,530
It will be more convenient for you
to take care of her.

253
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,760
Yes.

254
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,910
Your Highness, rest assured.

255
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,670
I will take good care of Mr. Xiaosheng.

256
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,080
No, Miss Xiaosheng.

257
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,030
You should rest early.

258
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,870
Yes.

259
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,840
- Shadow.
- Yes.

260
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,430
Listen,

261
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,030
send someone to...

262
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,240
Madam Wan.

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,840
How is the child doing?

264
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,030
Yesterday, I heard Doctor Hua said

265
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,760
he found two excellent medicines.

266
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,080
Perhaps if these medicines are taken,

267
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,550
the child might wake up immediately.

268
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,950
Madam Wan,

269
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,630
I...

270
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,710
I really can't bring myself to do it.

271
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,030
Good girl.

272
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,230
I know you have a kind heart.

273
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,400
But don't forget.

274
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,840
If she wakes up

275
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,080
and tells what she saw,

276
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,200
it would be very bad
for both you and me.

277
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,110
Have you ever thought about it?

278
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,880
What if Beiyue finds out

279
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,790
that you were my accomplice
in harming Ziqing?

280
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,650
How will they deal with you?

281
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,840
I did all this

282
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,450
for you, Madam Wan.

283
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,840
But after all,
I am Beiyue's biological mother.

284
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,150
Do you think
he will still keep you by his side?

285
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,230
If you want to take an action,

286
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,760
this afternoon is the best opportunity.

287
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Make the most of it.

288
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,160
Madam Wan,

289
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,430
after it is accomplished,

290
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,000
you must not go back

291
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,950
on your word.

292
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,350
Silly girl.

293
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,950
Ziqing is now trapped in Wuxie Gorge.

294
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,190
No one can save her.

295
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,040
As long as you have some means,

296
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,640
you can win over Beiyue.

297
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,600
Son,

298
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,000
I have never thought

299
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,880
that there would be such a day

300
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,110
when you are so close to me.

301
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,950
It's been 20 years.

302
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,230
I've been missing you

303
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,680
every moment.

304
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,880
Now

305
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,760
I can see you.

306
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,190
But son,

307
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,430
you can't see me.

308
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,000
I will sit with you for a while.

309
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,070
You look so worried.

310
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,230
Is it that you don't want
to catch that girl?

311
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,790
Son,

312
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,590
what can I do to help you?

313
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,190
Son,

314
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,950
turn around and look at me.

315
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,710
I'm here.

316
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:52,230
I want you to call me mother so much.

317
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm sorry.

318
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,000
We are not enemies.

319
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,470
Unfortunately, you saw something
you shouldn't have.

320
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,880
I have no other choice.

321
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,760
I can only

322
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,710
let you sleep forever.

323
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,070
Your Highness,

324
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,240
I...

325
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,070
What were you doing?

326
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,910
I...

327
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,150
I...

328
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,550
Speak.

329
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Why did you do this?

330
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,030
Beiyue,

331
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,070
what is this for?

332
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,950
You...

333
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,070
Ten,

334
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,710
ar-are you trying to poison her?

335
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,190
How...

336
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,190
How could you do such a thing?

337
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,710
Did she offend you?

338
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,310
Your Highness,

339
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,920
I didn't have ill intentions,

340
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,830
but Xiaosheng

341
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,520
secretly acted against Fourth Princess

342
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,070
while in Mitian Deep Sea.

343
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,400
I saw it with my own eyes.

344
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,190
I know

345
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,400
no one will believe me.

346
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,110
So I just killed her

347
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,350
to avenge Fourth Princess.

348
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,190
Your Highness,

349
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,760
it's all my fault.

350
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,830
But I did it

351
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,280
all for you

352
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,470
and Fourth Princess.

353
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:42,680
Do you think by saying this,

354
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
I will believe you?

355
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,000
Why don't you trust me?

356
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,230
Have you forgotten?

357
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,520
She is with Baili Weisheng.

358
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,680
Baili Weisheng
has detained Fourth Princess.

359
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,920
We don't even know
if she's alive or not.

360
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,710
Beiyue, even if Ten's words
are not credible,

361
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,190
there is no way to verify it

362
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,640
before Xiaosheng wakes up.

363
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,040
It's better to wait for Xiaosheng

364
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,190
to wake up and confront her.

365
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,790
Beiyue,

366
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,350
what is going on here?

367
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,360
Shadow.

368
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,400
Yes.

369
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,400
Lock her up.

370
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,760
Without my permission,

371
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,950
she is not allowed to see anyone.

372
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,110
- Yes.
- Your Highness.

373
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,520
- Madam Wan, save me.
- Move.

374
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,400
Madam Wan, save me.

375
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,240
Move.

376
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,190
Beiyue,

377
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,840
- it...
- Master,

378
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,830
we just had a mishap.

379
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,520
But this young lady

380
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,680
cannot afford any more accidents.

381
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
Master, please

382
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,590
assign more guards

383
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,430
to ensure her safety.

384
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,470
Alright, I understand.

385
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,310
Let me take care of Xiaosheng.

386
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,640
There's no need to trouble Master Lu.

387
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,880
Mother,

388
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,640
weren't you injured?

389
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,040
I'm much better now.

390
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,310
I can do it. It doesn't matter.

391
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,950
No need to trouble you, Mother.

392
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,720
I'll escort you back to your room.

393
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
Alright.

394
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,070
Your Highness,

395
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,800
that girl insisted it was her own doing

396
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,990
and that she was instructed by no one.

397
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,560
Keep a close watch on her.

398
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,760
Don't let anyone approach her.

399
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,360
Yes.

400
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,880
Master,

401
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,190
there is something

402
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,760
I am not sure if I should ask you.

403
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,280
There's no need to be hesitating
between us,

404
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,640
but feel free to ask.

405
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
I want to know

406
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,760
why did my mother suddenly leave?

407
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:41,310
Beiyue,

408
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,830
this is all in the past.

409
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,240
Better left unsaid.

410
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,800
When do you plan to rescue Ziqing?

411
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,950
We have found a secret passage.

412
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,240
We'll go there tonight.

413
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,310
How is your injury going?

414
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:56,190
Don't worry. It's no longer a problem.

415
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,520
Wait for me to come back.

416
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,670
Alright.

417
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Beiyue,

418
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,400
be careful.

419
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,670
Stop.

420
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,070
I am Fourth Prince's mother.

421
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,800
I want to go in to see that girl.

422
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
Can I?

423
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,470
Sorry, Madam.

424
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,680
His Highness has instructed

425
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,760
that no one is allowed to enter.

426
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,590
That girl served me,

427
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,070
but made some minor mistakes.

428
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,520
I want to go in to comfort her

429
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,360
and I'll leave quickly.

430
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,560
Madam, sorry.

431
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,640
(Baili Weisheng)

432
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,920
(is bewitched by the Silver Merfolk.)

433
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,830
(I don't know)

434
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,400
(if he can accept what I said.)

435
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,840
(Beiyue,)

436
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,040
(how are you now?)

437
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,760
Mother, last time we got beaten
because of this woman.

438
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,790
This time...

439
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,230
If we don't act now,
we'll miss our chance.

440
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,070
Hurry up.

441
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,280
Indeed, you were lying.

442
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
Now

443
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,950
you want to kill me to silence me.

444
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,350
If it weren't for that dagger causing me
to lose all my internal strength,

445
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,470
I would kill her with my own hands.

446
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,760
Stop wasting time with her. Kill her.

447
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,190
Otherwise, Baili Weisheng will wake up.

448
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,950
Ziqing.

449
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,310
Ziqing.

450
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,710
You have arrived.

451
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,070
Let them go.

452
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,640
Master.

453
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,720
- Open the door.
- Yes.

454
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,150
Quickly.

455
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,360
Child, you are awake.

456
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,550
How are you?

457
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,400
Do you feel better?

458
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,360
Hurry up.

459
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,560
Tell Fourth Prince

460
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,680
that Fourth Princess is in danger.

461
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,640
Fourth Princess is in danger.

462
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,720
Hurry.

463
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,310
Madam, please stop.

464
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,430
I'll wipe the child's body.

465
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,160
Why are you stopping me?

466
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,280
The Master has given an order.

467
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,990
Except for the doctor,
no one else is allowed to enter.

468
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,920
I am not someone else.

469
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,760
I am Madam Wan.

470
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
The Master has given an order.

471
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,000
Except for the doctor,

472
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,270
no one else is allowed to enter.

473
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,120
You...

474
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,510
Your Highness.

475
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,470
Call Doctor Hua here.

476
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,310
- Quick.
- Yes.

477
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,480
Mother,

478
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,470
where are you going?

479
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,950
You're awake.

480
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,790
Xiaosheng,

481
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,070
don't be afraid.

482
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,230
Tell us everything you know.

483
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,000
In Mitian Deep Sea,

484
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,000
I saw it with my own eyes

485
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
that she wanted to stick a needle
on Fourth Princess.

486
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,800
So, are you saying you pushed them away

487
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,190
to save Fourth Princess

488
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,710
and got injured by the Silver Merfolk?

489
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,840
Yes.

490
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,950
Mother,

491
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,190
is what she just said

492
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,600
true?

493
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,280
If you believe what she said,

494
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,760
what else can I do?

495
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,280
I just stopped Ten

496
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,190
from harming this child.

497
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
How do you explain this?

498
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,520
That was Ten's doing.

499
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,640
What does it have to do with me?

500
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,880
Do you really have to be like this?

501
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,720
Beiyue,

502
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,230
why do you only listen to
their side of the story?

503
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,310
Why don't you believe
your mother's words?

504
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,280
You abandoned me back then.

505
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,880
Now you suddenly return.

506
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
I should have doubted you
from the beginning,

507
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,920
but considering
our mother-son relationship,

508
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,000
I treat you sincerely.

509
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,280
But you come back to find me

510
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,110
only to try to kill Ziqing.

511
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,190
I abandoned you

512
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,160
for a reason.

513
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,640
Moreover, I placed a Barrier
on your chest

514
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,470
to protect you to grow up safely.

515
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,310
My genuine efforts...

516
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,070
Are they genuine efforts
or ulterior motives?

517
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,030
Beiyue,

518
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,830
you mistake me.

519
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,910
Mistake?

520
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,640
Then let's have a good talk

521
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,520
to clarify these mistakes.

522
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,400
I remember you once told Ziqing

523
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,950
that you met her mother
on Liuxian Island

524
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,000
and you were as close as sisters.

525
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,010
Master,

526
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,120
is this true?

527
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,400
I've never heard

528
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,310
if Wanyue was befriending anyone
on Liuxian Island.

529
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,760
That's my private issue.

530
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,640
How would you know?

531
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,280
Although I was not
by your side every day,

532
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,110
I was still the master of a big family
on Liuxian Island,

533
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,680
so I was well-informed
about the situation here,

534
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,640
especially your situation.

535
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,560
Master, have you heard

536
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,110
that on this Liuxian Island,

537
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,560
there was a woman named Mu Ci

538
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,000
who was skilled in playing the guqin?

539
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,950
Mu Ci?

540
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,400
Are you referring to

541
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,110
the woman living at Qinse Valley?

542
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,470
Why would you know this woman?

543
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,640
Wanyue once inquired about her from me.

544
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,760
Later, I sent someone to look for her.

545
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,400
But this woman had left.

546
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,110
So, you knew

547
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,680
Mu Ci had left Liuxian Island

548
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,190
and then you chased all the way
to Tianque,

549
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
right?

550
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,720
No wonder.

551
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,660
No wonder you left suddenly.

552
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,560
It turns out you met with me

553
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,020
and came back to Liuxian Island

554
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,470
for your own purpose.

555
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,040
You were using me to find the woman,

556
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:26,880
right?

557
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:28,830
You...

558
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,430
You have told so many lies.

559
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,710
What are you trying to hide?

560
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,480
Beiyue,

561
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,070
no matter what,

562
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,590
I did all this for your good.

563
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,040
Han Ziqing and Mu Ci

564
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,880
are from the Isolated Island.

565
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,760
If you are with her,

566
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,950
you will be implicated sooner or later.

567
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,000
So, you know all along
that Ziqing is one of the Islanders.

568
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,700
Your Highness,

569
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,840
Chief Meng is here.

570
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,500
Father.

571
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,470
Since my mother has returned,

572
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,000
how could Grandfather not come?

573
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,760
I specifically invited Grandfather

574
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,950
to make him to be the witness here.

575
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,600
I have some things
to clarify with my mother.

576
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,040
Beiyue,

577
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,320
your mother
has always been up to no good.

578
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,040
It's my fault for not teaching her well.

579
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,360
It's also my fault

580
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,910
for putting you and Ziqing in danger.

581
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,750
Grandfather,

582
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,470
please don't say that.

583
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,520
Back then, she was the most talented
in our tribe.

584
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,120
But she didn't go on the right path

585
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,320
and violated the rules.

586
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,000
She entered Momentary Tower
without permission

587
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,670
to practice the forbidden technique.

588
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,430
Meng Tribe considered her a disgrace

589
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,800
and expelled her from the tribe.

590
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,760
However,

591
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,390
after such a long time,

592
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,000
she hasn't changed her bad habits.

593
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,840
She even tried to harm
her daughter-in-law.

594
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,190
- Forbidden technique?
- Transformation Technique.

595
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,760
The Island Puppets.

596
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,390
Transformation Technique was created
by the ancestor of Meng Tribe.

597
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:36,390
After my late father created
Poisonous Grass World,

598
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,910
he was aware this forbidden technique
would endanger all living beings,

599
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,800
so when he came to his senses,

600
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,390
he sealed the Barrier

601
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:46,670
and kept the secret
in Momentary Tower.

602
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,870
Your mother,
relying on her exceptional talent,

603
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:51,560
unraveled the second level
of Momentary Tower

604
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,990
and entered the tower to secretly learn

605
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,190
the Transformation Technique
left by the ancestor.

606
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,000
I discovered that
and expelled her from the tribe.

607
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,800
After that, I sealed Momentary Tower.

608
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,390
No tribe members were allowed
to approach,

609
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:08,120
to prevent Transformation Technique
from getting known by others.

610
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,630
So, you wanted
to capture Ziqing's mother,

611
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,470
right?

612
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,120
Liuguang Dagger was originally
her personal belonging.

613
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Why was it in your hands?

614
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,510
Mother,

615
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,870
did you kill her?

616
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,710
I didn't kill her.

617
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,520
She jumped off the cliff herself.

618
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,030
Beiyue,

619
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,190
listen to me.

620
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,150
I had no other choice.

621
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,080
If I didn't hunt them down,

622
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,870
the King of Nanzhao would...

623
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,430
You actually colluded
with the King of Nanzhao.

624
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,270
You...

625
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
Father,

626
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,630
back then, the Minister of Nanzhao

627
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,390
forced me to take the Cursed Poison.

628
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,120
If I didn't obey them,

629
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,120
they wouldn't give me the antidote.

630
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,280
All my strength and skills

631
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,630
would come to nothing.

632
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,630
I had no other choice.

633
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,080
Your strength and skills
were learned from the evil.

634
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,470
It's better to get rid of them.

635
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,430
That's easy for you to say.

636
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,640
Back then,

637
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,430
I couldn't capture Mu Ci.

638
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,560
To avoid punishment,

639
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,280
I married into the Tianque Palace.

640
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,600
I originally thought

641
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,360
that it would allow me
to develop an antidote,

642
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,390
but I had not succeeded.

643
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,950
I was unwilling to lose my skills,

644
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,150
so I had to go back
to the Minister of Nanzhao.

645
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,630
He imprisoned me in Ice Pool.

646
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:34,320
The reason he didn't kill me

647
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,320
and even let me go

648
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,190
was that he still wanted to use me.

649
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,800
I was forced

650
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,120
to do all of this.

651
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,400
Beiyue.

652
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,310
Beiyue.

653
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,560
Are you going
to turn against your mother

654
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,950
for that woman?

655
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,710
Alright, Beiyue.

656
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,760
You have been bewitched by that woman.

657
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,870
You don't even want
your biological mother anymore.

658
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,840
What else can I expect from you?

659
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
So all of this

660
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,040
was a lie.

661
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,070
Unfilial son!

662
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Fine.

663
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,710
At this point,

664
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,320
if you insist on turning against me,

665
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,080
then let's sever all ties.

666
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,280
- Guards.
- Yes.

667
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,000
Take her down.

668
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,840
Yes, sir.

669
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,470
Come on.

670
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,000
Kill your mother.

671
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,470
Come on.

672
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,960
Take her down.

673
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,400
Yes, sir.

674
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,390
Doctor Hua, how is she?

675
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,680
Your Highness, please rest assured.

676
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,600
Although Fourth Princess' injuries
are severe,

677
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,190
fortunately, we treat her timely.

678
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,190
The bleeding has stopped.

679
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,360
She will wake up soon.

680
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,710
If there is nothing else,

681
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,040
I shall take my leave first.

682
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,880
You may go now.

683
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,430
(Sorry, Ziqing.)

684
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,070
(I was so useless.)

685
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,430
(I didn't protect you well.)

686
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,680
(I'm sorry.)

687
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,600
You're awake.

688
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,710
How do you feel?

689
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,230
What?

690
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,400
I'm hungry.

691
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,600
What do you want to eat?

692
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,780
Hot pot.

693
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,880
I'll have someone
prepare it for you right away.

694
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,310
Ziqing,

695
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,190
I hope you can recover soon.

696
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,680
Ziqing,

697
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,040
it's great

698
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,610
that you woke up so quickly.

699
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,390
Thank you for your concern, Mrs. Lu.

700
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,670
Sorry to make you worry.

701
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,670
My apology.

702
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,750
Sit down quickly.

703
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,890
You just woke up.

704
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,240
You haven't regained your energy yet.

705
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,000
Actually, we didn't do much.

706
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,080
But Beiyue is so worried about you.

707
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,950
If you don't wake up soon,

708
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:17,120
I'm afraid he won't be able
to hold on any longer.
