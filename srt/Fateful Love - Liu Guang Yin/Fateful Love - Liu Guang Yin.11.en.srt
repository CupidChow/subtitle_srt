21
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,030
Report.

22
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,870
Your Majesty, Xiling's Prince Xiang
requests a truce.

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,710
They'll withdraw.

24
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,790
Good.

25
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,080
He's going to apologize

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
at Sanjie Cliff.

27
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,270
The Cliff is the highest cliff here,

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,270
with great height and strong winds.

29
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,790
What is Chu Tiange's intention

30
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,640
in choosing there?

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,150
Has the Fourth Prince agreed?

32
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,790
Prince Xiang has announced this.

33
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,600
Father,

34
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,760
if Beiyue doesn't go,

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,680
it might become a laughingstock
for the world.

36
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,430
It might also harm

37
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,870
morale and military spirit.

38
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,320
I believe Beiyue will definitely go.

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,160
Yes, yes.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,600
Your Highness.

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,990
Chu Tiange can surrender if he wants.

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,120
No need for such a farce.

43
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,510
- Let's not go.
- Yes, don't go.

44
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,470
Your Highness.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,590
The invitation from Xiling.

46
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,560
Have the 80,000 troops
I asked for been prepared?

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,760
- Yes, they are ready.
- Yes.

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,160
Good.

49
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,230
Defend the Dongling border.

50
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,710
If it can't be held,

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,630
you may die there.

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,190
Yes.

53
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,200
Have Jun Beiyue
and Chu Tiange fully mobilized?

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
Yes, I received intelligence.

55
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,430
The Tiger Army has been mobilized.

56
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,150
Due to Xiling civil strife,

57
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,590
Prince Xiang has requested a truce.

58
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,230
Currently, the Tiger Army
is stationed outside the city,

59
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,070
awaiting withdrawal.

60
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,630
Chu Tiange,

61
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,200
I advise you to surrender.

62
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,310
Then let's see if you
have the ability to enforce it.

63
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
Good.

64
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,030
Today, you've learned this piece.

65
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
What's wrong?

66
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,070
It's nothing.

67
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,750
Continue playing.

68
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,840
You're seriously ill.

69
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,560
I'm fine.

70
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,030
It's an old ailment.

71
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,120
Continue practicing.

72
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,960
Can you answer a question for me?

73
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
You want to know

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,070
who I really am, don't you?

75
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,070
After this piece, I'll tell you.

76
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,190
Okay.

77
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,030
Chu Tiange.

78
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,030
Are your 100,000 troops

79
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,910
afraid of my mere 20,000 troops?

80
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,470
Just 20,000?

81
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,870
Otherwise?

82
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,470
Will I deploy all my forces

83
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,630
just for you?

84
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,030
It seems you truly want to kill me.

85
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,670
Your Highness.

86
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,400
Our army has invaded Xiling Royal City.

87
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,240
Your Highness.

88
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,670
The Tiger Army and the rebels in the city

89
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,240
are attacking our royal city.

90
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,430
We're surrounded.

91
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,470
Your Highness.

92
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,030
Your Highness.

93
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,190
Jun Beiyue.

94
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,630
You're despicable.

95
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,630
I'm only doing this for you.

96
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,470
Let me tell you.

97
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
I'm a Xuanyuan.

98
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm from Dongling.

99
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,870
Has anyone told you

100
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:01,910
that in Dongling,

101
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
except for the royals,

102
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,960
everyone with the surname Xuanyuan
must change to Ying?

103
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,870
So you are

104
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,960
from the Dongling royals.

105
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,070
Dongling is currently ruled by a queen.

106
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,760
It's because

107
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,920
all male descendants

108
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,400
of the Dongling royal family die young.

109
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm the only surviving prince.

110
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,920
You know, Tianque's
national strength is not strong.

111
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,720
Aside from Nanzhao and Tieyan,

112
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,720
the biggest threats to Tianque

113
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
are Dongling and Xiling.

114
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,630
Xiling has long occupied Tianque's territory,

115
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,680
and Dongling

116
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,800
has always harbored a desire for revival.

117
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,360
It constantly aims for the bordering land.

118
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,950
Crown Prince.

119
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,310
Greetings, Crown Prince.

120
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,360
We've begun the attack.

121
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,430
She said an attack.

122
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,830
Attack whom?

123
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,800
You can't guess?

124
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,390
Jun Beiyue?

125
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,360
If I'm Jun Beiyue's enemy,

126
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,390
will you hate me?

127
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,040
If you're against him,

128
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
you're against Tianque.

129
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,800
I don't want this.

130
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,920
With Dongling's national strength,

131
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,870
it was impossible to fight against Tianque.

132
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
Fortunately,

133
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,600
when the Chu Army betrayed Dongling,

134
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,430
they captured many soldiers.

135
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,510
Those soldiers

136
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,920
saw that we have hope for revival.

137
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,600
They still recognize me as the only prince.

138
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,360
So you're traveling as a guqin master.

139
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,550
Actually, you're a spy.

140
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,190
Once Dongling occupies the bordering land,

141
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,440
first,

142
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,190
it can cut off Jun Beiyue's supplies,

143
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,840
and second, it can threaten Tianque

144
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
and the northern states.

145
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,710
In this way,

146
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,990
the situation under Xiling's pressure

147
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,240
will become history.

148
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,430
Worried about Jun Beiyue?

149
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,440
You know.

150
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,510
You're not a proper lady.

151
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,630
With Jun Beiyue's status,

152
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,510
he won't make you his principal wife.

153
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,640
What do you mean?

154
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,360
Given Jun Beiyue's status

155
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,240
and ambition,

156
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
he married you

157
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,360
just to use your identity

158
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,310
as an Islander.

159
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,340
It's fine.

160
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,600
That's who he is.

161
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,160
Now, you should be the one worrying.

162
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,360
You don't have the strength
to defeat Jun Beiyue.

163
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,630
The Tiger Army is in position,

164
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,470
ready to attack.

165
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,710
Your Highness.

166
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,800
Dongling has joined the war.

167
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,640
Is that true?

168
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,920
You're truly prescient.

169
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,070
Send a message to Chu Feiyan for me.

170
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,910
Tell her

171
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,630
that if she delivers the 10,000 fine horses

172
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,870
she lost in the bet,

173
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,310
I'll let her go

174
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,720
and help her resist Dongling.

175
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,390
Understood.

176
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,800
Throw it.

177
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,240
Your Highness.

178
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,560
Something's wrong.

179
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,000
What happened?

180
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,310
Jun Beiyue's Tiger Army
hasn't fully been mobilized.

181
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,520
He's left a portion of his forces
at our border.

182
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,550
Well played, Jun Beiyue.

183
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,360
I've fallen into your trap.

184
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,630
Don't get worked up.

185
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,630
It's not a big deal.

186
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,720
Don't worry.

187
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,680
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,910
I used you as a hostage

189
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,190
to lure Jun Beiyue into attacking Xiling.

190
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,680
I'm sorry.

191
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,550
You should hate me for it.

192
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,360
I don't hate you.

193
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,720
But what you did

194
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,150
is not the act of a true man.

195
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,270
You used a woman.

196
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,030
It won't be a fair win.

197
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,630
Right?

198
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,630
You're right.

199
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,480
I don't want to argue about it.

200
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,390
For a dying man,

201
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:35,750
honor

202
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
doesn't matter much.

203
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,030
But still,

204
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,840
I feel bad for you.

205
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,670
If you really feel sorry,

206
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,800
then let me go.

207
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,910
Alright.

208
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,910
The outcome is decided.

209
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,430
No point in keeping you.

210
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,430
But I've taught you the guqin.

211
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,120
We now have a master-disciple bond.

212
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,270
I'll keep my promise

213
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,910
and teach you.

214
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,440
Take her away.

215
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,430
Yes. Let's go.

216
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,270
I'll see you out.

217
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,360
Brother,

218
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,960
let me escort her.

219
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,070
I'm Xuanyuan Lige's sister,

220
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,240
Princess Xuanyuan Zhaoxi

221
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,080
of Dongling.

222
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,750
Take care.

223
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,320
Take care.

224
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,910
Don't waste more time.

225
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,870
Do it.

226
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,190
You're pretty clever.

227
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,120
But why didn't you resist

228
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,150
when my brother was here?

229
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,720
He's very ill.

230
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,640
Leave him out of it.

231
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,550
Mind your own business.

232
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,120
You're already in enough trouble.

233
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,670
Worry about yourself first.

234
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,840
Han Ziqing,

235
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,790
you can choose to jump down now,

236
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,480
or obediently come back with me.

237
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,240
You're indeed quite pretty.

238
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,480
No wonder my foolish brother

239
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
is bewitched by you.

240
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,480
Stop talking nonsense.

241
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,880
Our great cause of restoring the country

242
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,150
has been ruined by you and your husband.

243
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,150
Do you think

244
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,360
I'll let you die so easily?

245
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,680
Guards,

246
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,110
the torture device.

247
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,360
Without your hands,

248
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,430
how will you play the guqin

249
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,360
to seduce my brother?

250
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,520
Your Highness, something's wrong.

251
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,840
Our army has been defeated.

252
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,120
Tianque's 20,000 Tiger Army,

253
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,960
along with Xiling's forces, are in pursuit.

254
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,030
They're closing in fast.

255
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,070
If Jun Beiyue dares to attack,

256
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,270
let him collect her corpse first.

257
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,150
Hurry and untie her.

258
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,030
Get lost.

259
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,080
Brother.

260
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,190
I thought you had returned to the royal city.

261
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,910
Who gave you permission

262
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,240
to act behind my back?

263
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,000
Jun Beiyue ruined our plan.

264
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,640
I must kill this woman to make him

265
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,670
- regret it.
- Stop it.

266
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,270
You promised me you'd send her away,

267
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,150
but you didn't do it.

268
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,120
Do you know Jun Beiyue's army
is now at our gates?

269
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,430
She's our only bargaining chip,

270
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,840
yet you still want to kill her?

271
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,440
Mother has ordered

272
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,240
that all military affairs
are under my command.

273
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,310
You only need to return
to the royal city and rest.

274
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,760
This matter

275
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,600
is not your concern.

276
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,030
Your Highness.

277
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,520
Jun Beiyue has sent a message.

278
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,790
He asked for Han Ziqing,

279
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:52,520
or he'd attack the southern border.

280
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,270
If I hadn't stopped you just now,

281
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,880
do you believe Mother would have killed you?

282
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,550
Then I'll take this woman to the city gates.

283
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,790
Princess, Jun Beiyue demands
that the Crown Prince

284
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,270
deliver her to the southern gate.

285
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,120
How does he know your identity?

286
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,910
It must be Han Ziqing.

287
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,390
Are you crazy?

288
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,480
What else could he have meant
by what he said?

289
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
He means you're not

290
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,910
qualified to represent the Dongling royals.

291
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,480
Leave.

292
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,750
Leave.

293
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,230
I'm sorry.

294
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,760
It's my fault.

295
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,240
Let me help you sit.

296
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,960
Ziqing.

297
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,120
Give me your hand for medicine.

299
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,560
Give it to me.

300
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,520
Luckily, I arrived in time.

301
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,310
The injury doesn't look serious.

302
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,320
Don't worry.

303
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,960
These wounds

304
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,360
will heal quickly

305
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,800
after the medicine.

306
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,320
That hand.

307
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,390
What's this medicine?

308
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,480
Why does the pain disappear
as soon as it's applied?

309
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
This is Ice Purple Mud.

310
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,310
It's made from thousand-year-old ice

311
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,070
and hundreds of rare herbs.

312
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,670
Only one in the world.

313
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,840
(So miraculous.)

314
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,150
(If only it existed in real life.)

315
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,640
Did you make this medicine?

316
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,360
I study medicine

317
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,000
in my spare time
when I'm not practicing the guqin.

318
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,550
You're good at this.

319
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,310
Why don't you heal yourself?

320
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,270
It's fate.

321
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,870
No need to struggle.

322
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,480
Alright.

323
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,520
Let the medicine dry.

324
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,390
There won't even be a scar left.

325
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
It'll be fine soon.

326
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,560
Thank you.

327
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Why did you save me?

328
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,310
On the battlefield, we are enemies.

329
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,840
But beyond that,

330
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,390
I am your master.

331
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,120
It's the notation for "Lishang".

332
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,360
And this jar of Ice Purple Mud.

333
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,390
Both are for you.

334
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,550
When you practice the guqin,
you might get hurt.

335
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,310
"Lishang"?

336
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,310
That's the piece you taught me.

337
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,880
"Lishang" has ten volumes in total.

338
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,430
With your talent,

339
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,080
you'll master it.

340
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,030
What does it have to do with my mother?

341
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,550
Why do I have to learn it?

342
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,880
When you finish learning it,

343
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,480
you'll understand.

344
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,360
Thank you.

345
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,910
Give it to me.

346
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,750
I'll wrap it up.

347
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,640
Let me go back.

348
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,430
You know he's using you.

349
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,390
Yet you're still to return to him?

350
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,720
I must go back.

351
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,030
Alright.

352
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,520
I'll have a maid help you freshen up.

353
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,960
This medicine is truly miraculous.

354
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,640
Brother, are you planning
to get yourself killed?

355
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,480
Move aside.

356
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,550
If you want to get yourself killed,

357
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,430
I won't stop you.

358
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,390
But leave behind

359
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,430
the Tiger Tally

360
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
and all your soldiers.

361
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,360
Mother has ordered

362
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,390
that all affairs in the south

363
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,720
are to be handled by me.

364
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,430
If you have the guts, take it yourself.

365
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,240
Xuanyuan Lige.

366
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,080
How dare you defy it?

367
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,600
The token is here.

368
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,760
Military orders come first.

369
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,550
(Token)
I would like to see

370
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,120
who dares to stop me.

371
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:12,740
(Yue; Lingtai Gate)

372
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,240
You might be walking into death.

373
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,360
We lost the battle.

374
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,840
I should be dead.

375
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,480
It's just a lost battle.

376
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,070
Why so discouraged?

377
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,150
If I don't die,

378
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,720
Dongling will lose half its territory.

379
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,780
(Lingtai Gate)

380
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,030
You should head back.

381
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,750
You're my master,

382
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,240
and you saved me.

383
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,390
I owe you that much.

384
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,670
Will Jun Beiyue approve?

385
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,150
That's up to him.

386
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,310
But whether I help is up to me.

387
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,390
Alright.

388
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,360
Your Highness.

389
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,640
He's escaped. Should we chase?

390
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,000
He runs faster than a rabbit.

391
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:31,990
Forget it.

392
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,260
(Lingtai Gate)

393
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,630
Your Highness.

394
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,480
Please let him go.

395
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,310
What are you doing?

396
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,240
Xuanyuan Lige saved my life.

397
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,240
Please don't hurt him.

398
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,600
You let him go like that?

399
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,070
I always repay my debts.

400
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,560
You know that.

401
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
I never intended to capture him.

402
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,480
If I knew you were doing so well,

403
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,310
I wouldn't have come.

Please.

What's going on?

407
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,000
The prince is unfathomable.

408
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,600
Let's not try to guess.

409
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440

Xuanyuan Lige.

523
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,760
The princess did it.

524
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,800
Xuanyuan Lige applied medicine.

525
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,270
It's almost healed.

526
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,590
The medicine isn't better than a physician.

527
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,590
Let Gu examine you tomorrow.

528
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,950

You'll go in my place.

535
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,720
Xiling is seeking peace?

536
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,700
This time, Xiling faced dual attacks
from Tianque and Dongling.

537
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,350
They suffered heavy casualties.

538
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,240
Chu Tiange was wounded and fled.

539
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,280
Xiling had no choice but to seek peace.

540
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,560
Alright.

541
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,590
I will serve you,

542
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,910
but please grant me a promise.

543
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,710
What promise?

544
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,110
If you find any clues about the Islanders,

545
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,950
please inform me.

546
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,800

Seeing this ring

551
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,190
is like seeing me.

552
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,240
Perhaps in times of danger,

553
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,510

Good night.

558
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,520
Master, breakfast is ready.

559

Are you going dressed like that?

560
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,270
What's wrong?

561
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,720
Master, you should change
into something brighter.

562
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
You don't look like a princess in that.

563
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,040
Does that mean bright colors?

564
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,120
I'm the princess.

565
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,910
What I wear defines

566
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:46,870
what a princess is like.

567
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,080
Master, though you disdain pleasing others,

568
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,320
don't forget

569
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,190
today we're meeting Chu Feiyan.

570
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,590
That woman is very arrogant.

571
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,080
Master, you should dress impressively

572
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,920
to enrage her.

573
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,280
I don't need to dress up to spite Chu Feiyan.

574
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,560
Master.

575
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,450
Between women,

576
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,080
it's not about who has stronger skills.

577
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,040
It's the small things

578
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,040
that can really make one's blood boil

579
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:14,910
and cause heartache.

580
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,190
I had you learn from Hongyi how to behave

581
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,030
and how to fight.

582
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:22,390
How come you also learned these tricks?

583
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,830
Your Highness, I'm ready.

584
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,400
