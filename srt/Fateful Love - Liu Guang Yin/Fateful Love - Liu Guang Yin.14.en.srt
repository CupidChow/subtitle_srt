21
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:40,430
Princess,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,680
we are not blaming you.

23
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,270
But His Highness's life is at risk now.

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,630
If he dies,

25
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,470
how...

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,410
how will you handle this?

27
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,970
Go.

28
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,710
Go.

29
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,990
Jun Beiyue.

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't blame me.

31
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,520
You must not die.

32
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,720
You must get better.

33
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,360
(I told you long ago)

34
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,240
(that this is not my home.)

35
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,240
(The place I live)

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,930
(is completely different
from Longyuan Continent.)

37
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,470
(Everything happening here)

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,190
(is just a dream.)

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
(I will leave sooner or later.)

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
(I approached you)

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,360
(just to find a way)

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,520
(to go home from you.)

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,830
(You don't need to feel guilty towards me)

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,550
(because I am also deceiving you)

45
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,140
(and using you.)

46
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,750
(And it's not what I wanted)

47
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,030
(to hurt you so badly.)

48
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,160
(You must wake up.)

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,910
(I want to fight alongside you)

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,750
(and...)

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,470
(and be true friends with you.)

52
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,510
(Jun Beiyue.)

53
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,880
(Can you hear me?)

54
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,830
(Wake up quickly.)

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,360
(Alright?)

56
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,110
Your Majesty.

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
Your Majesty.

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,640
My Queen, how is the situation?

59
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,040
The Fourth Prince's mansion is heavily guarded.

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,510
No news can be obtained.

61
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,000
Your Majesty,

62
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,640
if this time Beiyue

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,390
doesn't make it through, then...

64
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,670
What are you saying?

65
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,640
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,510
I mean if.

67
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,760
After all, today at the Judicial Office,

68
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,000
he was stabbed in the chest

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
and was seriously wounded.

70
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
If

71
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,440
something happens to him,

72
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,350
have Beichen take over
his military power immediately.

73
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,880
After all, the three Tiger Armies
cannot be leaderless.

74
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,720
Yes.

75
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
In the coming days,

76
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,920
I will try to find out more
about Beiyue's situation.

77
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
If there are any changes,

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,350
I'll report to you immediately.

79
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,720
Alright.

80
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,940
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

81
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,950
The Fourth Princess doesn't know
he's the man in black either.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,790
Is it all set up in the front yard?

83
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,720
Yes, it is.

84
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,670
What about the backyard?

85
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,510
Everyone is here.

86
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,440
Deploy more men

87
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,480
to strengthen the vigilance.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,720
Ensure the safety of His Highness.

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
- Alright.
- Go ahead.

90
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,150
Physician Gu.

91
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,070
When will he wake up?

92
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,760
I'm afraid he will never wake up.

93
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,560
Why?

94
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,000
Your stab injured his heart meridian.

95
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,200
He has lost all his internal arts.

96
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,390
If no one

97
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,070
uses internal arts
to protect his heart meridian,

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,920
he probably won't last more than two months.

99
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,640
Beiyue practices the unique
Lu's internal arts.

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,070
Except for them,

101
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,760
no one can protect his heart meridian.

102
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,670
Can they really save him?

103
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,390
Years ago, Master Lu of Liuxian Island
in the East Sea

104
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,200
accepted His Highness as a disciple

105
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,830
and taught him his internal arts.

106
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,550
He's considered an immediate disciple.

107
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,600
Now His Highness' life is in danger.

108
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,720
I believe he will definitely help.

109
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,550
Go back to your room and rest.

110
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,230
We will discuss

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,070
what to do next.

112
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,910
No need to discuss.

113
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,230
Go to Liuxian Island.

114
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,070
Now listen.

115
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,350
Head to Liuxian Island immediately.

116
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,720
Yes, ma'am.

117
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,670
We should reach Liuxian Island within ten days.

118
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,890
Alright, let's settle it this way.

119
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,350
Escort Beiyue to Liuxian Island immediately.

120
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,920
But if we go,

121
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,600
what about the Royal City?

122
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,660
You don't need to worry about that.

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,320
I will handle things back here.

124
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,070
I won't let anyone know

125
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,880
that Beiyue is not in the city.

126
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,230
Alright.

127
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,070
Well,

128
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,270
Mr. Situ,

129
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,670
Shadow and I will escort His Highness.

130
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,920
You can rest assured.

131
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,200
It's better if you stay behind for now

132
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,320
to help.

133
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,810
Stay.

134
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,750
Alright.

135
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
Be careful on the road.

136
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,790
As long as we reach Liuxian Island,

137
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:45,920
I am willing to risk my life

138
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,110
to ask Master Lu to save His Highness.

139
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,950
Go pack up.

140
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,160
Take care.

141
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,030
- Take care.
- Shadow.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,880
(Promise me.)

143
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,320
(You must get better.)

144
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,420
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

145
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,500
His Majesty the King!

146
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,670
It's early in the morning.

147
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,630
What brings Your Majesty here?

148
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,760
Greetings, Your Majesties.

149
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,990
Ziqing,

150
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,590
I'm here to see Beiyue.

151
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,550
How is his condition?

152
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,640
Let's dispense with all these formalities.

153
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,440
Lead the way. I will go see him.

154
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Your Majesty, please wait.

155
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,080
Physician Gu said,

156
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
Beiyue needs to rest quietly.

157
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,710
Except for him,

158
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,710
no one else is allowed inside.

159
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,790
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

160
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
If visiting is allowed,

161
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,400
I will notify you first.

162
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,840
What does this mean, Ziqing?

163
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,150
We are all family to Beiyue.

164
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,080
Is it not permissible for my king father
to see his own son?

165
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,640
Your Majesty,

166
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,910
I told you not to come.

167
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,910
The Fourth Princess now holds military power.

168
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,400
She dares to block anyone's way.

169
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,910
Ziqing,

170
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,280
what do you mean by this?

171
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,910
Is it not permissible for me

172
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,670
to see my own son?

173
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,070
Your Majesty.

174
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,430
Let go of me!

175
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,990
Let go of me!

176
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,320
Let go of me!

177
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,710
- Close the door.
- Stubborn old man.

178
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,910
He won't even let me in.

179
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,200
Do you know that your prince and I

180
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,230
were childhood playmates?

181
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,840
Greetings, Your Majesties.

182
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,320
His Majesty wants to see Beiyue,

183
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,550
but the Fourth Princess is blocking the way.

184
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,520
What is the meaning of this?

185
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,320
Your Majesties,

186
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,910
you cannot blame the Fourth Princess.

187
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,230
Physician Gu has always been eccentric

188
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,960
and he is very concerned about Beiyue.

189
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,440
He usually ignores us when we speak.

190
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,410
Why do you bother to argue with him?

191
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,270
Isn't that right?

192
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,280
Well, I'm

193
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,710
feeling a bit tired.

194
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,350
Look, I'm counting on you

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,440
to take good care of Beiyue for me.

196
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,670
When he feels better,

197
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,440
I'll come to see him again.

198
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,950
I'm leaving.

199
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,310
Let's go.

200
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,750
Good day, Your Majesty.

201
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,240
Good day, Your Majesty.

202
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,030
His Majesty is leaving.

203
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,630
Open the door.

204
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,840
Father, as you can see,

205
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,030
his mansion is heavily guarded.

206
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,110
We can't even get through the door,

207
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,200
let alone see him.

208
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,350
There must be something fishy going on.

209
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,790
Your Majesty is truly lenient.

210
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,320
That woman won't let us see Beiyue,

211
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,440
and you actually agreed with her.

212
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,470
I was watching from the side,

213
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,440
and I was really angry.

214
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,650
Now,

215
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,260
Beiyue is too ill to see guests.

216
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,910
We should be considerate.

217
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,040
I just can't understand it.

218
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,030
It was fine before,

219
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,960
but now

220
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,200
Jun Beiyue's life is uncertain.

221
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,520
We still have to put up with his princess.

222
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,790
I feel so stifled.

223
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,630
How dare you!

224
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,880
Beiyue is the hero of Tianque.

225
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,960
Aren't you trying to sow discord

226
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,550
between me and my son?

227
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,550
Father, my mother didn't mean that.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,640
She just felt
that you were being mistreated here

229
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,080
and spoke out of anger.

230
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,590
Please calm down, Father.

231
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,350
What I am most worried about now
is Beiyue's wound.

232
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,070
- Beichen,
- Yes, Father.

233
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,130
when you have time,

234
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,030
take good care of him.

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
Yes, Father.

236
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,920
Assassins!

237
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,350
- Get them!
- Get them!

238
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,190
Go!

239
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Your Highness.

240
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,960
- What's going on?
- There are assassins.

241
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,300
They have already been driven away
by the guards outside the courtyard.

242
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,120
Very well.

243
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,320
Let them go.

244
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,350
In my opinion,

245
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,760
these people were most likely sent
by someone

246
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,080
to disrupt our plans.

247
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
No matter who sent them,

248
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,040
just ignore them.

249
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,910
No one in our courtyard

250
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,640
is allowed to move.

251
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,480
Understood.

252
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,920
Your Highness,

253
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,840
our men can only lure out the guards,

254
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,700
but the people in the main courtyard
refuse to come out.

255
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,430
Understood.

256
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,790
Any information?

257
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,840
Han Ziqing is keeping a close watch
on their mansion.

258
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,030
We can't get any information at all.

259
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,550
As long as Beiyue dies,

260
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,320
Longyuan Continent will
be a different place.

261
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,750
It's a pity

262
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,550
the more anxious you are,
the less likely things will work out.

263
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Being anxious won't help.

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
At times like this,

265
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,880
we can only wait.

266
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,440
I guess right now,

267
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,670
someone else wants Jun Beiyue dead
more than I do.

268
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,200
After all, if he dies, Han Ziqing...

269
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,470
I am not you.

270
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
Jun Beichen,

271
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,760
we are merely partners.

272
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,000
If you dare speak nonsense again,

273
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,760
I'll make you sorry.

274
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,520
Those people outside are getting anxious.

275
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,110
They're trying every way to lure you out.

276
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,920
These people

277
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,710
can only play these little tricks.

278
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,790
But we can't keep hiding like this forever.

279
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,440
The Queen and her gang definitely
won't let it go.

280
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,230
They were turned away during the day

281
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,840
and sent assassins to cause trouble at night.

282
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,470
If this continues,

283
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,710
it's hard for us to handle.

284
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,570
Then

285
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,740
what do you suggest?

286
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,440
Simple,

287
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
find someone who can keep them in check.

288
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,710
Then no one will come to disturb us.

289
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,960
In Tianque Royal City, besides the King,

290
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,760
there's one more person
with absolute authority.

291
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,080
He can control the current situation.

292
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,920
Who is he?

293
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,080
Prince An.

294
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,240
Prince An?

295
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,920
- Someone's here.
- Go check it out.

296
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,440
Who is it?

297
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,950
He ran away.

298
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,940
Lie down, quickly.

299
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:32,710
Over there.

300
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:33,990
Get him.

301
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,070
He got away.

302
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,830
How did it go? Did it work?

303
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,830
Work my ass.

304
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,040
I almost ended up dead.

305
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,110
Are you wounded?

306
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,280
- Are there other wounds?
- I'm wounded?

307
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,160
With my lightness skill,

308
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,230
how could I get wounded?

309
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,830
They can't even see me.

310
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,040
If they see me, they get wounded.

311
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,470
This is their blood splattered on me.

312
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,350
Alright.

313
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,230
I intended to lure that woman out.

314
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,430
Who knew she would stay inside,

315
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,280
like a stone lion, not moving at all?

316
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,430
The guards guarded the courtyard heavily.

317
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,700
It's impossible to get close to her.

318
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,310
Well,

319
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,280
we can't keep waiting like this.

320
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,950
I don't want to stay here any longer.

321
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,790
Do you think I want to?

322
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,550
How about

323
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,710
I go in your place?

324
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,400
Are you crazy?

325
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,830
With your lousy skills?

326
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,000
I taught you that.

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,470
Even I can't get close to her.

328
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,310
Do you think you can?

329
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,280
I'm afraid you'll go soft.

330
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,430
Me, go soft?

331
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,410
Nonsense.

332
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,960
You are soft-hearted.

333
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,950
But...

334
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,760
She isn't like an Isolated Island puppet.

335
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,640
Could a puppet be so gorgeous?

336
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,920
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

337
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:18,670
Steady now.

338
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,950
Steady.

339
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,510
Lift it steadily.

340
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,140
(Lu Manor on Liuxian Island in the East Sea)

341
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,310
Jiang Chen.

342
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,680
Father-in-law,

343
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,430
a toast to you.

344
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,560
Best wishes to you

345
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,400
and longevity.

346
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,880
Do you all know

347
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,880
the Liuxian Island Qin Gathering
will start next month?

348
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,030
How are

349
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
your preparations going?

350
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
Father,

351
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,920
I have been diligently

352
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,230
practicing the Lu Formation with my peers,

353
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,400
not daring to slack off for even a day.

354
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,880
Jiang Chen,

355
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,680
what about you?

356
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,560
I, well...

357
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,040
Father, even Suying has been working so hard.

358
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,800
Jiang Chen naturally won't fall behind.

359
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,470
He's been practicing martial arts
every day recently

360
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,880
and working very hard.

361
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,720
Right.

362
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,560
Father, I have thoroughly mastered
the Lu Family Formation.

363
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,400
So,

364
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,760
I haven't been practicing with Suying.

365
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,040
But I've been practicing my internal arts

366
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
and secret weapons.

367
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,000
I think I've made great progress.

368
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
Jiang Chen,

369
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,590
although

370
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,350
you're our son-in-law,

371
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,310
I have taught you everything I know.

372
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,190
Yes.

373
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:19,520
Although your talent is limited,

374
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,430
as long as you are willing to work hard,

375
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,070
you can achieve something.

376
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,350
In this Qin Gathering,

377
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,280
we have high hopes for you.

378
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,160
Father,

379
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,710
I'll never forget your instructions.

380
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,640
I see that Jiang Chen is very diligent.

381
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,880
His talent is not necessarily inferior
to those of the noble families.

382
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,310
My dear, you need not worry too much.

383
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:51,160
The new round of the Liuxian Island
Family Ranking Competition

384
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,310
is about to take place.

385
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,070
The young masters of various families,

386
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,560
such as the Bai Family on the mountain

387
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,520
and the Yu and Xiao Families
at the foot of the mountain

388
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,640
have been

389
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,920
watching our family closely

390
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,350
for so many years.

391
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,070
It's a pity

392
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,920
that we don't have a son.

393
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,470
If we are not careful,

394
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,760
our top position on Liuxian Island

395
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,670
could be taken by them.

396
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,230
We must not be careless.

397
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,640
Father, you're right.

398
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,480
We must not be careless.

399
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,710
Right now, we're counting on Jiang Chen.

400
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,000
Although we don't have a choice,

401
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,040
fortunately, Jiang Chen is competent.

402
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,000
Now that you're getting old,

403
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,640
why not let Jiang Chen

404
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,950
manage the family's property?

405
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,520
This way, you can enjoy your life.

406
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,360
Well, if...

407
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,280
Our parents are healthy and strong.

408
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,040
Are you two so eager

409
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,680
to take over the Family?

410
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,800
- What do you mean by that?
- Yes.

411
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,280
I just think our parents are getting old

412
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,470
and I want them to rest.

413
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,310
Our parents are still in their prime.

414
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,830
They can manage the family for decades.

415
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,070
It's not a problem.

416
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,000
Besides,

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,230
how can we let a son-in-law

418
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,680
be the head of the family?

419
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,710
- You...
- By then, we wouldn't even know

420
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,160
if our family name is Lu or Jiang.

421
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,230
Lu Suying,

422
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,520
don't think I don't know
what you're thinking.

423
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,230
Jiang Chen is not fit
to be the Head of the Family.

424
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,070
Do you think a daughter like you is fit?

425
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:13,910
Right.

426
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,680
Do you think

427
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,950
Father would leave the family to your care?

428
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,160
It's better to pass it to me
than to an outsider.

429
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,520
Who are you calling an outsider?

430
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,360
Suying.

431
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,190
Why are you dragging me

432
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,400
into your argument with your sister?

433
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,280
Yes, I am the son of a tenant farmer,

434
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,710
but I have worked diligently in the family
for so many years.

435
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,880
I haven't eaten or drunk for free.

436
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,230
Why should I be humiliated by you?

437
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
Well, blame your wife.

438
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,070
I...

439
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,110
You and your wife

440
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:40,110
have already taken over the wharf.

441
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,150
Now you want to extend your reach

442
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,430
into all the properties of the family.

443
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,230
- What are you talking about?
- You're so greedy.

444
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,160
We may be greedy,

445
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,350
but you're shameless

446
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,000
- to fight for the head of the family.
- Exactly.

447
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,100
You know what you want.

448
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,040
- Father.
- Who are you cursing?

449
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,230
- Look at what she's saying.
- Stop arguing, all of you.

450
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,070
Shut up.

451
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,710
None of you are any good.

452
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,640
Do you think I don't know

453
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,470
what each of you is thinking?

454
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,310
Stop dreaming.

455
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,110
To be the head of the Family?

456
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,830
Ask yourselves if you're capable.

457
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,190
Get out, all of you, get out.

458
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,680
Go, go. Get out.

459
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,560
Say something.

460
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,400
My dear.

461
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,320
My dear.

462
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Please don't get angry.

463
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,800
It's not worth it to harm your health.

464
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,680
Unfilial descendants.

465
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,590
Unfilial descendants.

466
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,800
What could you do?

467
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,920
They are all your children.

468
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,560
Besides,

469
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,110
which family's children

470
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,760
don't covet the head of the family?

471
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,600
Nonsense.

472
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,880
Which family wishes their father
would die early

473
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,000
to inherit the family?

474
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,880
The children don't have that intention.

475
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,760
You've spoiled them.

476
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,670
At this moment,

477
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,470
if only Beiyue were here.

478
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,550
Report.

479
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,160
Master, Madam.

480
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,560
An important guest requests to see you.

481
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,120
Quick.

482
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,910
Hurry up.

483
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,000
Shadow!

484
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,120
Old Gu.

485
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,070
Put it down.

486
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,830
- Sir.
- Where is he?

487
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,150
Look.

488
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,030
What?

489
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,640
How did he get so badly wounded?

490
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,710
Master Lu, let's go back first.

491
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,550
Alright.

492
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,720
Quick.

493
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,760
- Get him onto the carriage.
- Alright, let's go quickly.

494
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,640
Beiyue,

495
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,310
I didn't expect that we would meet again

496
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,590
under such a circumstance.

497
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,700
Master Lu.

498
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,840
Mrs. Lu.

499
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,310
My surname is Gu.

500
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,590
I'm an imperial physician.

501
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,280
This is Guard Shadow .

502
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,110
His Highness's visit to the island

503
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,590
must be kept absolutely confidential.

504
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,310
If His Highness' condition

505
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,880
is known by those with ulterior motives,
it will be troublesome.

506
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,400
We two will also be referred to
as servants to the outside.

507
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,680
You can rest assured about this.

508
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,040
Apart from my husband and me,

509
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,230
no one else knows.

510
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,270
Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

511
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,550
Right.

512
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,880
You two can rest assured.

513
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,470
I have taught him Lu's internal arts.

514
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,040
He can be considered my disciple.

515
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,720
We'll

516
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,640
call him that for now.

517
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,480
Then

518
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,640
we should give him an alias.

519
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,310
How about we call him Nianbei?

520
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,110
Didn't you just mention him?

521
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,120
Alright.

522
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,950
Let's call him Nianbei.

523
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,360
Mr. Jiang.

524
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,070
Come in.

525
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,790
You may go.

526
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,470
Someone came? What's going on?

527
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,350
He said three men came to the island.

528
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,710
One of them is seriously wounded

529
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,830
and needs your father's treatment.

530
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,160
Do you know what's going on?

531
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,310
My parents have never said anything about it.

532
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,910
Let's go and take a look.

533
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,070
Mr. Gu,

534
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,040
can you tell me the truth

535
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,240
about Nianbei's condition?

536
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,750
Master Lu,

537
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,560
right now, only your internal arts

538
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,000
can save His Highness's life.

539
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,820
Alright.

540
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,230
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

541
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,920
I will not give up.

542
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,830
Even if I have to exhaust
all my internal strength,

543
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,310
I will save him.

544
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,150
No.

545
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,800
- You...
- My dear.

546
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,310
Although Nianbei's condition is critical,

547
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,880
you are the head of the family

548
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,950
and must prioritize your own safety.

549
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,000
Use my internal strength instead.

550
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,840
Honey,

551
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,680
the internal strength Nianbei needs

552
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,800
is too much for you to handle.

553
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,680
Alright, no more talking.

554
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,800
- His life matters.
- Please.

555
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,640
My dear!

556
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:44,790
My dear!

557
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,800
- Will it work?
- Yes.

558
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,640
Gentlemen,

559
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,000
please don't misunderstand.

560
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,110
It's not that I don't want to save him,

561
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,070
but the Liuxian Island Qin Gathering

562
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,350
and Family Ranking Competition
are starting next month.

563
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,400
If my husband's internal strength
is severely depleted,

564
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,920
I'm afraid he won't be able
to sustain himself.

565
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,680
Mrs. Lu, we're grateful.

566
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,560
Thank you very much, Mrs. Lu.

567
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
- My dear.
- Master Lu.

568
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,830
My dear.

569
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,190
Master Lu,

570
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,470
your pulse is weak.

571
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,640
You should rest a bit before...

572
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,360
I'm fine.

573
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,120
Nianbei

574
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,800
hasn't woken up.

575
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,310
Honey,

576
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,720
help me up.

577
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,560
- Continue.
- No, you can't.

578
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,400
My dear,

579
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,950
if this continues,

580
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,400
your life will be in danger.

581
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,280
But Nianbei must be saved.

582
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,400
He must be saved.

583
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,950
No, my dear,

584
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,350
if you continue to transfer strength,

585
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,990
not only will you fail to save him,

586
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,400
but you'll also lose your life.

587
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,920
Even if I have to sacrifice my own life,

588
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,950
I must save him.

589
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,070
No, my dear.

590
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,240
I'll go find Jiang Chen.

591
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,400
Let's go.

592
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,240
Go!

593
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,880
Quick. Lock the door.

594
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,110
Meiting, Jiang Chen!

595
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,710
Open the door quickly.

596
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,000
Meiting, Jiang Chen!

597
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:17,980
Open the door.

598
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,830
- Darling.
- Mother,

599
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,760
what's going on? It's so late.

600
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,760
- Where is Jiang Chen?
- What's going on? What happened?

601
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,800
- Go find Jiang Chen.
- Mother.

602
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,710
Jiang Chen.

603
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,800
Mother, what's wrong?

604
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,190
- Quick.
- Why are you looking for me so late?

605
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,310
- What's wrong?
- Quick.

606
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,110
Your father's disciple is seriously ill.

607
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,160
Your father is transferring
internal strength to him.

608
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,110
But I see he can barely hold on.

609
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,040
Quick, go help him.

610
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,070
Well, Mother,

611
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,520
it's not that I don't want to help,

612
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,640
but I ate something bad last night.

613
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,880
And now my body is very weak.

614
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,280
I'm afraid I can't help.

615
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Mother,

616
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,260
who exactly is this person?

617
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,950
Why would Father exhaust his internal strength

618
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,470
- to save an outsider?
- Right.

619
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,470
He is a disciple your father took in
from outside the island.

620
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,760
Your father is a righteous man.

621
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,110
He couldn't just let him die.

622
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,710
But, Mother...

623
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,760
Enough.

624
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,230
I'll think of another way.

625
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,480
Mother.

626
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,190
Mother.

627
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,800
This disciple is an outsider,

628
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,310
not a family.

629
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,280
Why would Father give him
his internal strength?

630
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,160
It can't be that simple.

631
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,640
What do you mean?

632
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,100
Have you ever seen this person before?

633
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,350
Not to mention seen,

634
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,760
I've never even heard of him.

635
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,000
He has never been to Liuxian Island.

636
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,430
Go check again.

637
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,600
Go now.

638
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,520
Alright.

639
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,820
- Master Lu.
- My dear!

640
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,200
My dear.

641
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,790
My dear.

642
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,000
Physician Gu,

643
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,950
if it doesn't work,

644
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,790
I'll do it.

645
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,240
No,

646
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,920
honey, you mustn't.

647
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,950
Mrs. Lu, you don't have to.

648
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,680
It's better to find a strong and healthy man

649
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,950
to ensure no harm to either.

650
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,190
Look, the Master's finger moved.

651
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,270
Good news.

652
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,760
Mr. Lu, your internal strength

653
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,040
has stabilized his heart meridian.

654
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,920
The Master is no longer in danger.

655
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,000
Good.

656
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,800
Once his internal strength recovers,

657
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,160
the coma won't last long.

658
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,640
As long as he rests quietly,

659
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,800
he will wake up soon.

660
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,700
What is it?

661
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,950
My father has exhausted seventy percent
of his internal strength.

662
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,710
The man's heart meridian has stabilized.

663
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,150
The accompanying doctor said

664
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,040
he would wake up soon.

665
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,600
Your father

666
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,000
exhausted seventy percent
of his internal strength,

667
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,240
well,

668
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,120
to save an outsider.

669
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,600
Stop pacing in front of me.

670
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,120
What exactly are you pondering about?

671
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,880
Honey,

672
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,390
the Qin Meeting is about to start.

673
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:33,230
Think about it.

674
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,180
At this critical moment, your father

675
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,680
gave his internal strength to an outsider.

676
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,300
Don't you find it strange?

677
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,300
Moreover,

678
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,980
only those who have mastered
Lu's internal arts

679
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,060
can withstand your father's
internal strength.

680
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:45,900
Don't you think

681
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,380
it's suspicious about the relationship

682
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,780
between your father and this Nianbei?

683
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,860
My father said

684
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,180
Nianbei is a disciple he took in outside.

685
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,580
What's so strange about it?

686
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,460
Besides,

687
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:58,620
with my father's character,

688
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,140
he wouldn't just stand by and do nothing.

689
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:01,860
Honey,

690
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,580
your father

691
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,850
might even pass on the family's legacy to him.

692
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:08,340
Stop talking nonsense.

693
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,250
He's not even my father's son.

694
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,900
Besides,

695
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,500
we have you, don't we?

696
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,340
Me?

697
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,940
When has your father ever
paid attention to me?

698
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,140
Jiang Chen,

699
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,900
my father was angry just now
because of Lu Suying.

700
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,740
Honey,

701
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,790
that's not what I meant.

702
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,820
Think about it.

703
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,740
This person is most likely not a disciple.

704
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,140
Your father cares so much about him.

705
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,660
This clearly indicates

706
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,100
he is your father's illegitimate son.

707
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,380
No way,

708
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,300
how could that be possible?

709
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,660
Why not?

710
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,500
Think about it.

711
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,580
If it weren't for this relationship,

712
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,100
no matter how generous your parents are,

713
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,300
they wouldn't make such a big sacrifice

714
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,500
for some random disciple.

715
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,420
Think.

716
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,620
What should we do?

717
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,500
Well...

718
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,340
Mr. Jiang.

719
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,700
Come in.

720
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,140
Master asked me to inform you

721
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,000
that from today onwards,

722
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,020
all incoming and outgoing ships
must be strictly inspected.

723
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,860
No unrelated persons are allowed to enter.

724
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,140
Please keep a close watch on the wharf

725
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,980
and be extra careful.

726
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,420
Leave.

727
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,380
Yes.

728
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,260
What does this mean?

729
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,400
Are we going to seal the island?

730
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,460
I guess I'm pretty close to the truth.

731
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,580
That person came.

732
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,460
Your father was afraid of leaking the news.

733
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,860
He even asks to seal off the island.

734
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,460
Am I right?

735
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,580
Am I?

736
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,820
But your father is not alone.

737
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,060
Your mother is also so concerned.

738
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,460
What about my mother?

739
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,020
That's right.

740
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,100
Your mother

741
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,020
has never given birth to a son in her life.

742
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,860
Now a son came out of nowhere.

743
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,780
Doesn't that mean they have an heir?

744
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,820
Of course, she would try to curry favor.

745
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,620
Don't make wild guesses without evidence.

746
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,270
Wild guesses?

747
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,040
The facts are right in front of you.

748
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,380
Are you still trying to deceive yourself?

749
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,220
Let's see.

750
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,180
From now on,

751
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,100
there will be no place for us in the family.

752
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,900
And your sister

753
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,820
is always opposing me,

754
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,860
afraid that I would steal her stun.

755
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,020
Now it's good.

756
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,820
We're all doomed.

757
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,180
Where are you planning to go?

758
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,140
I feel stifled. Can't I go out for a walk?

759
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,500
Am I sold to your family?

760
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,300
Jiang Chen,

761
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,430
what are you talking about?

762
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,290
- Has my family ever mistreated you?
- Move aside.

763
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,100
Didn't you say you had a stomachache
and felt unwell?

764
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,500
Where are you going in such a hurry?

765
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,540
As a son-in-law,

766
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,180
do I not even have the freedom to go out?

767
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,620
Miss Suying, what do you need from me?

768
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,260
Nothing.

769
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,740
I'm just passing by.

770
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,060
If there's nothing,

771
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,900
I'll go for a walk.

772
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,660
At a time like this,

773
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,990
how could you have the leisure to go out?

774
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,980
I need to talk to you.

775
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,180
I have nothing to talk about with you,

776
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,820
nothing good.

777
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,260
I agree.

778
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,260
But the guest arriving on the island tonight

779
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,380
is worth talking about.

780
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,300
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

781
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,580
A letter from Physician Gu?

782
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,420
How are they doing?

783
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,060
They're on the island.

784
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,250
Beiyue's life has been saved.

785
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,340
But he hasn't woken up yet.

786
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm still very worried about him.

787
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,380
To be cautious, Beiyue is now using
the alias Nianbei.

788
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,860
What about you?

789
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,820
How are things over there?

790
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,660
Any progress?

791
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,340
I'm really out of ideas.

792
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,980
His attendant won't even let me in the door.

793
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,740
He says there's no such person as Prince An.

794
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,220
I think even if Beiyue himself went,

795
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,620
they might not show him in.

796
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,820
Who exactly is this person

797
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,860
that's so hard to invite?

798
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,700
The King and Prince An are brothers.

799
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,900
Prince An has great prestige in Tianque.

800
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,180
If he hadn't decided to retire early

801
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,260
and live in seclusion,

802
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,080
it wouldn't be his turn now to...

803
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,130
to meddle.

804
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,340
If you can invite Prince An to guard Tianque,

805
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,940
you can go to Liuxian Island
with peace of mind.

806
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,700
Alright, in that case,

807
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,420
you stay at the mansion tomorrow

808
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,460
and I'll go.

809
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,330
You?

810
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,110
Assassins!

811
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,350
Just you?

812
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,900
Who are you?

813
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,860
I'm not as skilled as you.

814
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,260
Since you've caught me,

815
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,660
do whatever

816
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,740
you want.

817
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,300
You're young, but you talk big.

818
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,500
Speak, who sent you?

819
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,700
I sent myself. Alright?

820
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,260
Just kill me.

821
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,140
Why waste words?

822
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,220
You're quite something.

823
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,060
With so many guards around,

824
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,260
you still managed to sneak in.

825
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,660
Guards!

826
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,780
Yes.

827
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,900
- Lock him up.
- Yes.

828
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:48,940
Move.

829
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,620
Gently.

830
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,220
Gently.

831
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,980
He doesn't seem to be from Jun Beichen
or the Queen.

832
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,300
They wouldn't be foolish enough
to send a teenager.

833
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,670
Do you and Beiyue have other enemies?

834
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,140
The boy has seen the situation

835
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,700
in the room just now.

836
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,580
Be careful.

837
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,660
Don't let him escape.

838
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,340
Looks like I'll have to interrogate him
tomorrow.

839
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,180
I'll go find Prince An.

840
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,260
Hey, boy,

841
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,140
look what I got for you.

842
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,220
Your favorite braised beef.

843
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,940
Xiaosheng.

844
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,220
Xiaosheng?

845
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,860
How about I go for you?

846
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,820
Oh no.

847
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,260
This... this brat.

848
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,140
Ma'am, this is as far as I can go.

849
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,100
It should be right here.

850
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,900
Is anyone there?

851
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,060
Excuse me.

852
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,420
Who are you?

853
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,820
Han Ziqing of Tianque.

854
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,340
I wish to see Prince An.

855
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,700
There is no Prince An here.

856
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,580
Miss, please leave.

857
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,380
Little brother.

858
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,620
I really have something very important.

859
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,700
Please inform him.

860
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,900
Didn't I tell you?

861
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,260
There is no prince here.

862
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
Miss, you have the wrong place.

863
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,380
Little brother.

864
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,340
Little brother.

865
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,420
Little brother.

866
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,260
Prince An!

867
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,140
I'm Han Ziqing of Tianque.

868
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,620
I really have something very important.

869
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,620
Please come out and meet me.

870
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,380
Prince An.

871
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,940
If you don't come out,

872
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,300
I won't leave.

873
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,140
Your Highness.

874
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,260
Are we really not leaving?

875
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,740
Ten,

876
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,500
take the luggage off the carriage.

877
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,500
We will set up camp here.

878
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,900
I don't believe he won't come out.

879
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:01,740
Yes.

880
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:19,980
Help!

881
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,060
Help!

882
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:22,580
Let go of me.

883
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,420
Help!

884
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,940
Help!

885
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,580
- Stop, no one will come to save you.
- Help!

886
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,420
Master.

887
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,180
Help!

888
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,310
Let go of me.

889
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,240
Let go of me!

890
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:34,370
Help!

891
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,620
Keep shouting.

892
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,580
- Louder.
- Help!

893
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,300
Ma'am.

894
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,260
Ma'am, save me.

895
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,420
Save me.

896
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,420
Your master is here too.

897
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,340
Ten.

898
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,100
Who are you?

899
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,540
Why did you kidnap my maid?

900
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,300
Miss.

901
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,580
If you want to talk, just talk.

902
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,180
Can you not use violence?

903
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,020
Stop talking nonsense.

904
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,460
Who exactly are you?

905
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,580
Will you speak or not?

906
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,460
Nice skills.

907
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,220
Miss, let's talk nicely.

908
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,540
Why start with fighting and killing?

909
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,540
Manners.

910
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,260
You'll get in trouble.

911
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,530
Stop pretending to be crazy.

912
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,170
Who exactly are you?

913
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,460
Will you speak or not?

914
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,680
If you don't, I'll kick your ass.

915
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,620
Take your foot off.
