21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,980
One of the functions of Lishang

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,620
is to locate the Isolated Island illusion.

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,460
Besides this,

24
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,300
it can also awaken the puppets.

25
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,260
Awaken the puppets?

26
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,500
Just combine Xuezheng and Wuzheng

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,500
and play them together.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,380
When the Isolated Islanders were
persecuted by Nanzhao back then,

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,580
I was the only one who escaped.

30
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,780
While fleeing,

31
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,620
I rescued a Golden Merfolk

32
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,180
and told her about

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,380
how Nanzhao persecuted

34
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,340
the Isolated Islanders.

35
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,700
But at that time,

36
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,820
I had no other options

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,820
to expose Nanzhao's atrocities

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,220
nor the ability

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,700
to avenge the Isolated Islanders.

40
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,620
Therefore,

41
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,860
I sneaked back into the Palace of Nanzhao

42
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,580
and took back the Red Gold Scales
that had been plundered by them.

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,380
And I made a dagger

44
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,580
out of them.

45
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,460
I thought

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,380
if one day

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,500
I was captured by the King of Nanzhao,

48
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,860
I would use this dagger to end my life.

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,340
Mom.

50
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,580
Later,

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,060
I went into hiding.

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,500
I hid at different places

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,660
on the Longyuan Continent.

54
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,460
Until one day,

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,620
I found in an ancient book

56
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,660
a way to break
the Soul Devouring Pearl's spell.

57
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,580
What is it?

58
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,380
Mom.

59
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,380
It's alright.

60
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,980

61
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,860

Go.

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,700
You finally

67
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,460
woke up.

- His Highness.
- release Situ Haonan immediately.

190
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,940
So are you

191
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,220
hoping that I stay?

192
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,660
I never said that.

193
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,620
So, you don't want me to stay.

194
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,940
I don't think I said that either.

195
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,900
Then I might as well go back.

196
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,940
After all, men and women
should keep distance.

197
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,140
Who am I to you, anyway?

198
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:44,980
If I stay,

199
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,660
there'll be rumors.

200
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,660
Might as well go back.

201
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,580
You are not answering me.

202
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,460
Is it because

203
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,020
you don't want me to leave?

204
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,780
You're so narcissistic.

205
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,020
I'm narcissistic?

206
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,140
I'm giving you a chance.

207
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,380
If you ask me to stay,

208
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,500
I won't leave.

209
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,460
Say something.

210
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,660
Will you let me stay or not?

211
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,100
Mom.

212
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,220
Answer me.

213
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,860
Xiaosheng wants to leave.

214
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,900
What are you thinking about it?

215
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,140
What can I think?

216
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,780
She wants to leave.

217
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,900
I can't stop her.

218
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,820
How did I give birth to such an idiot?

219
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,780
She doesn't want to leave.

220
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,020
Can't you tell?

221
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,580
Women are really troublesome.

222
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,460
You... you did it on purpose, didn't you?

223
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,940
Can't you see she doesn't want to leave?

224
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,780
She can't bear to leave you.

225
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,740
She likes you.

226
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,420
I have made it so clear.

227
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,780
Do you still need me

228
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,500
to teach you what to do?

229
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,060
Are you really leaving?

230
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,180
What else?

231
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,580
Staying to be an annoyance?

232
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,940
Aren't you leaving?

233
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,100
For the past years, I've provided for you.

234
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,500
You can't leave just like that.

235
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,060
Are you trying to make me stay?

236
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,900
It's up to you.

237
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,340
We've been feeding you
for over ten years. Pay me.

238
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,980
Boring, go away.

239
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Hey.

240
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,500
Let go of me.

241
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,820
Let go of me.

242
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,500
If you don't let go, I'll call for help.

243
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,620
Let go.

244
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,540
Don't go.

245
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,300
What did you say?

246
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
I didn't hear it.

247
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,540
I said don't go.

248
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,260
What do you mean?

249
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,780
I can't bear to let you go, alright?

250
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
Can you stay?

251
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,580
Why did you say so just now?

252
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,660
It took me a long time to pack up.

253
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,900
You...

254
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
Mr. Baili, Miss Xiaosheng.

255
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,860
His Highness requests everyone
to go to the main hall

256
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,950
to discuss an important matter.

257
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,500
Let's go.

258
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,980
When does Tianque plan to wage war
against Nanzhao?

259
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,100
Now, Nanzhao's puppets are unstoppable.

260
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,820
If this continues,

261
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,900
the entire Longyuan Continent

262
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,140
will be completely finished.

263
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,500
Can we win?

264
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,720
Today, we

265
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,580
want to discuss this matter with you all.

266
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,700
Weisheng, I've discussed it with Beiyue.

267
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,540
You and Xiaosheng take Golden Merfolk Lady,

268
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,620
back to Sheng Manor,

269
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,200
so that your mom can enjoy
her last years in peace.

270
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,820
And you two

271
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,500
were separated shortly after the wedding.

272
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,780
Now, now that you're reunited,

273
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,140
- so...
- What do they take us for?

274
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,660
Now the Puppet Army is rampaging.

275
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,340
It is the responsibility of each of us
to stop them.

276
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,700
How can we possibly be cowards?

277
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,820
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

278
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,780
Prince Beiyue, Ziqing.

279
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,780
Haonan and I have a long future ahead.

280
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,180
The war against Nanzhao

281
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,620
cannot be won without us.

282
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,780
We are the same.

283
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,020
As long as I'm with my son,

284
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,900
wherever it is,

285
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,500
I'll be happy

286
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,100
with the company of my children.

287
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,620
We will not leave.

288
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,420
Right. What do you take us for?

289
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,140
- At this moment...
- Everyone should be aware

290
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,740
that this battle is fraught with dangers.

291
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,420
The Magical Artifact
of the Minister of Nanzhao

292
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,300
can turn any person into a puppet.

293
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,180
So what?

294
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,620
We live or die

295
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,000
together.

296
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,900
- Right.
- Right, you are right.

297
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,300
We live or die

298
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,740
together.

299
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,100
We will live or die with Tianque.

300
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,500
(Tianqi)

301
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,780
It's a sneak attack. Report it now.

302
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,700
Sneak attack!

303
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,580
Sneak attack!

304
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,940
(Tianqi)

305
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,900
Master, what should we do?

306
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,740
Don't worry.

307
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,820
The Momentary Tower records
another method.

308
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,940
I have no choice

309
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,900
but to use this move.

310
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,020
