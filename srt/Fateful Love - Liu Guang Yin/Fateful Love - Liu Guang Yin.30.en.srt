21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,710
Grandfather,

22
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,650
we've just reunited.

23
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,870
I hope you can come with us

24
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,100
to stay in Tianque for more time.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,220
I also want to spend more days with you.

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,180
But although Dream Island is small,

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,120
there are many disciples
and a lot of affairs to handle.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,190
I can't afford to delay.

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,460
I should return as soon as possible.

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,280
Alright then.

31
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,630
I'll visit Dream Island

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,690
to see you when I have time.

33
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,390
Grandfather,

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,260
if you need any help,

35
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,080
just send a letter to let us know.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,260
Alright, thank you for your concern.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,760
Grandfather,

38
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,700
I want to ask you something

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,190
about my mother.

40
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,100
What do you want to ask?

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,980
Why did my mother

42
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,420
leave Meng Tribe back then?

43
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,320
She made some minor mistakes

44
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,100
and I scolded her a bit.

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,360
Your mother was always proud
and stubborn,

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,820
so she left in a fit of anger.

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,040
Beiyue,

48
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,540
how much do you know

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,180
about your mother?

50
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,570
Since before I can remember,

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,980
my mother had already passed away.

52
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,370
I only heard

53
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,100
that my mother

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,440
had a low status in the palace

55
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,460
and was not favored by my father.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,420
Even when she died,

57
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,490
she only had a memorial tablet.

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,270
I sincerely hope

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,470
you can tell me

60
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,420
more about my mother.

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,650
Since your mother

62
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,900
has passed away,

63
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,650
let's not mention her anymore

64
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,260
to avoid us being sad.

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,540
It's getting late.

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,180
We should be going.

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,470
Take care.

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,890
See you.

69
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,930
Grandfather, take care.

70
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,250
- Take care, Grandfather.
- Alright, alright.

71
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,430
Take care.

72
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,320
Minister,

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,900
Han Ziqing has already
come out of the Barrier.

74
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,440
The two masters from Meng Tribe

75
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,750
have also been captured and taken back
to Dream Island by Chief Meng.

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,730
What should we do next?

77
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,750
If you don't want to make a big move,

78
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,730
now we have to use the trump card.

79
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,830
Alright,

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,210
then you should make a trip

81
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,630
to bring him out.

82
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,910
Yes.

83
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,040
Recently, Chu Tiange

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,320
has been writing letters to me

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,890
to ask me to declare war on Tianque.

86
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,450
It's so annoying.

87
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,640
Xiling wants to use us to destroy
Tianque and reap the benefits.

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,480
Your Majesty,

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,260
why not reply to Chu Tiange

90
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,700
and tell him to go ahead
to declare war on Tianque,

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,390
and we, Nanzhao, as the ally,

92
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,860
will support them as reinforcements.

93
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,890
As for taking the lead,

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,390
we have always been peaceful,

95
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,370
so we won't participate.

96
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,540
As for that Han Ziqing is an Islander,

97
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,040
since Tianque wouldn't admit it,

98
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,020
we might as well go along with it.

99
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,160
We can pretend
to sign an agreement with them

100
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,490
to declare that both sides
will not mention it,

101
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,980
and then we can take them by surprise.

102
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,310
Your Majesty,

103
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,890
what do you think?

104
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,930
You are indeed thoughtful.

105
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,000
If we don't want to go to war
with Tianque,

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,490
we must still put on a good show.

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,020
If we can secretly capture Han Ziqing,

108
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,820
everything will be easy.

109
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,030
Your Highness.

110
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,740
Your Highness, a secret letter
from Nanzhao.

111
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
(Qirong Hall)

112
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,260
Well, the horrid King of Nanzhao.

113
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,190
My sister was your consort.

114
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,320
But she was killed by Jun Beiyue,

115
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,490
and you didn't even care.

116
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,860
Now you only want to provide support,

117
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,880
you shameless old fox.

118
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,920
Your Highness, the Queen of Dongling
has sent a secret letter,

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,990
saying they're willing to join forces
with us to attack Tianque.

120
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,990
If Nanzhao doesn't send troops,

121
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,740
can Dongling's small force
join us in encircling them?

122
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,090
Our army has already gathered
in the Sanjie Region.

123
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,330
Should we withdraw now?

124
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:16,870
Withdraw?

125
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,370
Wouldn't that just let Jun Beiyue
laugh at us?

126
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,300
Continue to set up camps.

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,830
Even if we don't fight,

128
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,440
I still want to scare him.

129
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,280
Yes.

130
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,450
Senior Brother,

131
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,300
what's wrong?

132
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,770
Senior Brother,

133
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,860
wake up!

134
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,120
Senior Brother.

135
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:43,910
Senior Brother.

136
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,520
Senior Brother.

137
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,950
Itchy, itchy!

138
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,930
Stop scratching me.

139
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,700
Senior Brother.

140
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,390
No, don't cry.

141
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,480
Are you dying?

142
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,110
You're the one who's dying.

143
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,070
No, no.

144
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,440
You're not dead.

145
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,070
It's good that you're not dead.

146
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,930
I was so worried about you.

147
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,600
Stop crying.

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,670
You're crying as if I died.

149
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,610
Stop cursing me, okay?

150
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,020
How did you come back
from Nanzhao so quickly?

151
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,100
As soon as I heard the news about you,

152
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,070
I immediately rushed over

153
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,210
with the guards.

154
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,370
Senior Brother,

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,440
don't ever think of
leaving me behind again.

156
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,420
Wherever you go,

157
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,890
I'll go with you.

158
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,610
Even if I die, I want to be with you.

159
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,160
Alright, alright.

160
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,640
Don't press on me. You're crushing me.

161
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,480
You're too heavy.

162
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,700
Water, water.

163
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,970
Water.

164
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,310
Drink some more.

165
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,820
I saw that girl Ten

166
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,760
was so sleepy.

167
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,160
So I sent her back to her room
to have a rest.

168
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,230
Do you want more?

169
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,070
No.

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,880
No more.

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,720
It's enough.

172
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,510
Then

173
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,770
you can lie down

174
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,440
and rest for a while.

175
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,210
If you want to eat something,
just tell me.

176
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,860
I'll make it for you.

177
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,260
Can you cook?

178
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,420
Why can't I cook?

179
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,040
How do you feel now?

180
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,210
I'm not sweating.

181
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,350
How can there be sweat from poisoning?

182
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,860
Are you stupid?

183
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,270
Your Highness,

184
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,990
a secret letter from the general
of White Tiger Army.

185
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,060
(The Xiling army has been gathered
in the Sanjie Region,)

186
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,600
(but only has been beating drums
to make a bluff.)

187
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,400
(From General Feng Yuan.)

188
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,950
What's the matter?

189
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,100
The Xiling army has gathered
in the Sanjie Region,

190
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,860
but only has been beating drums

191
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,060
to make a bluff.

192
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,010
So Nanzhao doesn't plan to send troops?

193
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,500
We don't need to worry about that.

194
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,440
We'll just respond accordingly.

195
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,280
Your Highness,

196
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,880
Xuanyuan Lige

197
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,100
also said he wanted to declare war
on Tianque on behalf of Dongling.

198
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,680
What?

199
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,010
Did he want to declare war on Tianque?

200
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,060
How can he be so confident?

201
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,180
However, I did hear that Dongling

202
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,980
has a Sound Strike Army

203
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,690
that is mysterious
and nowhere to be found.

204
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,210
They use music as their weapon.

205
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,860
Does he want to rely on this

206
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,690
to challenge me?

207
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,860
I want to see

208
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,300
what tricks he has up his sleeve.

209
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,380
Beiyue, Ziqing,

210
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,740
let's part ways here.

211
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,470
You return to Tianque,

212
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,660
and I'll take Qianqian back to Tieyan.

213
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,000
Take care.

214
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,840
Ziqing, I don't want to leave you.

215
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,620
I want to be with you forever.

216
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,520
You're about to get married.

217
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,450
Stop saying such silly words.

218
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,030
From now on,

219
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,210
don't be so childish.

220
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,150
Ziqing,

221
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,640
when we get married,

222
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,540
will you come?

223
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,570
Don't worry. We'll come.

224
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,450
You don't even ask for my opinion.

225
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,890
If you don't go, I'll go by myself.

226
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,500
How can we

227
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,880
not attend Haonan's wedding?

228
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Of course, you have to come.

229
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,080
Alright, it's getting late.

230
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,000
You should hurry on your way.

231
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,860
Take care of yourself.

232
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,510
Take care.

233
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,770
Alright, let's go.

234
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Take care.

235
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,830
Let's go.

236
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,760
Slow down.

237
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,770
Remove their magical instruments.

238
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,030
Kneel down.

239
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,770
You left the island without permission,

240
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,810
and used the Barrier Technique
without authorization.

241
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,010
Do you realize your mistake?

242
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,150
Yes, I realize my mistake.

243
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,590
- I realize my mistake.
- I realize my mistake.

244
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,030
Your elder sister was so talented,

245
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,440
yet I could still be merciless
to expel her from the tribe.

246
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,300
Let alone the two of you.

247
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,210
Yes, yes.

248
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,240
Enough.

249
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,690
From today onwards,

250
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,130
you can't participate in tribe affairs.

251
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,770
Just move to the foot of the mountain,

252
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,570
and reflect on your actions
for three years.

253
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,810
You are not allowed to return
until the time is up.

254
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

255
00:12:58,990 --> 00:12:59,830
Your Highness.

256
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,760
Here.

257
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,650
Ten, go check on Mr. Baili.

258
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,100
Let me help Mr. Baili.

259
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,000
No need.

260
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
It was Fourth Prince and Princess
who asked me

261
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,670
to take care of Mr. Baili.

262
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,180
If you don't let me, I'll get scolded.

263
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,910
I can take care of my senior brother.

264
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,770
Let me do it.

265
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,770
- How can you...
- Slow down.

266
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,790
I have always been taking care
of my senior brother.

267
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,900
It was Fourth Prince and Princess
who asked me to take care of him.

268
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,400
- Be careful.
- Watch the road.

269
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,240
Slow down.

270
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,880
Slow down.

271
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,640
Can you help him properly?

272
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,490
- Here, let me.
- Mr. Baili.

273
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,540
Alright, alright!

274
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,250
Alright, I'm not dead.

275
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,150
It's fine.

276
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,990
It's okay.

277
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,880
How are you?

278
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
Let Physician Gu take your pulse.

279
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,800
Alright, alright.

280
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,280
Ziqing,

281
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,790
my illness is almost cured.

282
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,150
You should ask Gu to stop the medicine.

283
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,600
It's so bitter.
I don't want to take it.

284
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,670
If you don't take the bitter medicine,
you'll have to take poison.

285
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,510
You can choose it.

286
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,150
Sir,

287
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,910
you are also a doctor.

288
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,420
Of course, a veterinarian.

289
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,790
You feed those mules and horses

290
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,540
with sweet water, right?

291
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,210
Much sweeter than this.

292
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,150
Your Highness, the poison
has been mostly eliminated.

293
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,590
In a few more days,
it will be completely gone.

294
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,520
Thank you, Physician Gu.

295
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,540
Then I shall take my leave.

296
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,080
Gu,

297
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,910
I don't have any valuable possessions.

298
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,060
So, I'll write you

299
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,200
two prescriptions for treating horses.

300
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,220
Alright.

301
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,920
Humans and animals
require different treatments.

302
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,620
You can keep them for yourself.

303
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,320
My prescriptions are very valuable.

304
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,910
Thank you, Physician Gu.

305
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,760
Alright.

306
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,800
Thank you for your hard work.

307
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,030
Where should I put this junk?

308
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,000
What junk?

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,130
Watch your mouth. Bring it over.

310
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,860
Can't you see

311
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,680
it's so precious?

312
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,230
Ziqing,

313
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,860
I stole this Xuezheng
from Xiling Palace.

314
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,740
It was meant to be given
to Xuanyuan Lige.

315
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,000
But he insisted
that I should give the guqin to you.

316
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,880
Now it can be considered
to return to its rightful owner.

317
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,480
Alright.

318
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,570
Then I'll keep it for now.

319
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,120
I'll do it.

320
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,330
Take good care of yourself.
I'm leaving now.

321
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,760
Don't worry.

322
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,890
I'm still strong.

323
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,010
Fourth Princess, take care.

324
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,350
Take care.

325
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,510
Senior Brother,

326
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,540
what have you been doing

327
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,000
these days?

328
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,840
Alright, I'll do it.

329
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,350
How did you get all these injuries?

330
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,200
Didn't I tell you before?

331
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,250
Stay out of my business.

332
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,550
You left me alone in Nanzhao,

333
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,990
and went out causing trouble
by yourself.

334
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,440
How can I not be worried?

335
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,710
What do you mean by causing trouble?

336
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,760
Do you think I can't beat you now?

337
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,190
You're just spouting nonsense,
aren't you?

338
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,030
Anyway,

339
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,640
if you leave me alone again,

340
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,770
I'll

341
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,710
go tell the King of Nanzhao.

342
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,400
Tell the King of Nanzhao?

343
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,450
That you betrayed him,

344
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,780
and sided with Han Ziqing.

345
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,020
I wasn't sold to him.

346
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,180
Whom I side with
has nothing to do with him.

347
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,620
I can side with whoever I want.

348
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,860
It's none of his business.

349
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,500
Get out. I need to rest.

350
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,900
Take off my shoes.

351
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,180
If it weren't for your illness...

352
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,940
What?

353
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,340
Your Highness,

354
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,420
should I keep this guqin for you?

355
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,340
No need, just leave it there.

356
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
Your Highness,

357
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,220
this guqin

358
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,380
is Mr. Xuanyuan's cherished item.

359
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,180
Aren't you afraid

360
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,020
that

361
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
His Highness might mind?

362
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,260
What would he mind?

363
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,900
This is just my thought.

364
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,940
I think no man can tolerate his wife

365
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,140
keeping another man's belongings.

366
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,300
Your Highness,

367
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,620
did I say something wrong?

368
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,820
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

369
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,940
Ten,

370
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,260
I know what I'm doing.

371
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,060
You don't need to say more.

372
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,900
Leave the guqin here.

373
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,990
No one is allowed to touch it.

374
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,980
Understood.

375
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,700
Why is this guqin here?

376
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,460
Your Highness,

377
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,220
please don't be angry
with Fourth Princess.

378
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,340
She is keeping this guqin

379
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,700
out of friendship.

380
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,500
Don't be upset.

381
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,740
Over a guqin?

382
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,180
Is it necessary?

383
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,660
Leave.

384
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,220
Yes.

385
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,540
You've spoiled these girls too much.

386
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,940
What's wrong?

387
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,740
She knows little manners.

388
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,540
Since we're talking about this,

389
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,940
why don't you explain it?

390
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,620
Xuezheng?

391
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,860
This is Xuanyuan Lige's Xuezheng.

392
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,140
Baili Weisheng stole it from Xiling.

393
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,380
He asked me to keep it for him.

394
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,260
That's all.

395
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,340
As you explain,

396
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,660
I believe you.

397
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,260
I'm hungry.

398
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,540
I want something delicious.

399
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,580
I want hot pot.

400
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:08,660
Alright.

401
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,700
Let's go eat then.

402
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,860
Let's go.

403
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,260
Ten, Ten.

404
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,540
What are you doing? You scared me.

405
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,020
What are you doing?
You seem preoccupied.

406
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,540
I'm not. Don't talk nonsense.

407
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,180
You look so worried.

408
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,940
Ten, what's wrong?

409
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm fine. Don't guess me wrong.

410
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,100
Ten,

411
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,900
I have something

412
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,860
to tell you.

413
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,820
What is it?

414
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,620
Would you

415
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,780
be willing to...

416
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,620
Gu Xi,

417
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,900
I only want to learn
from Her Highness now.

418
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,420
I won't consider anything else.

419
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,140
You've always understood me
the best, right?

420
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,380
Yes, I understand.

421
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,580
Gu Xi,

422
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,420
no matter what,

423
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,020
you will always be my best friend,

424
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,080
and my most important partner.

425
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,780
Ten, no matter what happens,

426
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,220
I will always protect you
and support you.

427
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,020
- Really?
- Really.

428
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,060
What if

429
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,340
I want to be like Her Highness

430
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,860
to stand out
and be admired by thousands,

431
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,540
will you support me?

432
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,700
Like Her Highness?

433
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,580
I'm just teasing you.

434
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,860
Her Highness is a rare talent,
and the one in a million.

435
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,460
It's my great fortune

436
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,740
to be able to serve her.

437
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,540
Let's go quickly.

438
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,780
Where is Xuezheng?

439
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,020
Ten.

440
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,180
Ten.

441
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,340
Your Highness, what's wrong?

442
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,660
Have you seen Ten?

443
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,900
I just saw her go out.

444
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,060
Is she holding anything in her hand?

445
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,140
She is holding a guqin.

446
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,700
Prepare the horse.

447
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,820
If you do not cherish His Highness,

448
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,060
you do not deserve his love.

449
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,780
Today, I will bury it deeply here

450
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,220
to cut off your thoughts.

451
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,780
Why do you want to destroy it?

452
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,660
Speak.

453
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,580
This is not your guqin.

454
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,260
You should not touch it.

455
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:40,980
Your Highness,

456
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,420
I am doing all this for your good.

457
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,980
You cannot stay by His Highness' side

458
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,780
while thinking of another man.

459
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,500
You cannot betray His Highness.

460
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,500
What are you talking about?

461
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,980
Today, I must destroy this guqin,

462
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,900
so you will no longer think of him

463
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,780
and His Highness will not be upset.

464
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,780
Your Highness,

465
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,260
I am doing all this for you

466
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,180
and Fourth Prince.

467
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,860
Protect the guqin

468
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,800
and go inform His Highness.

469
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:16,860
Who are you?

470
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,260
Han Ziqing,

471
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,540
just surrender yourself

472
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,260
to save us the trouble
of doing it ourselves.

473
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,140
Jiaosha,

474
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,100
she is mine.

475
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,040
Mu Wushang,

476
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,860
the faster one gets her.

477
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,580
Who exactly are you?

478
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,420
Let me tell you the truth.

479
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,060
This time,

480
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,660
we are here to take you back to Nanzhao
for a reward.

481
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,540
So the King of Nanzhao sent you here.

482
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,300
Now that you've known it,

483
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,660
why don't you surrender?

484
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,820
Your skills are not bad.

485
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,460
You're overestimating yourself.

486
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,940
Jiaosha, kill her.

487
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,620
Now?

488
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,740
Aren't we supposed
to take her back to Nanzhao alive?

489
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,500
No, kill her now.

490
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,700
She is too powerful. We can't take her
back to Nanzhao alive.

491
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,780
Who is it?

492
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,940
Why are you meddling in this?

493
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,780
Madam,

494
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,540
who are you?

495
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,420
Why did you save me?

496
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,100
They were bullying you with numbers.
They deserved to die.

497
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,420
Thank you, Madam.

498
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,740
Ziqing!

499
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,460
What happened?

500
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,900
Two people attacked me just now.

501
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,380
This lady saved me.

502
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,540
Thank you, Madam.

503
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,220
May I ask your name, Madam?

504
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,300
No need for formalities.

505
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,100
I am just a traveler
who's wandering around.

506
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,660
Thank you for your help just now.

507
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,180
No problem.

508
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,180
I'm glad to help.

509
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,100
See you again.

510
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,380
Farewell.

511
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,420
Gu Xi, where is Ten?

512
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,860
How is she?

513
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,060
She is crying

514
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,020
in the room.

515
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,100
It seems she has realized her mistake.

516
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,180
Your Highness, don't worry.

517
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,260
The two people
who attacked me just now

518
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,220
said they wanted to take me back
to Nanzhao for a reward.

519
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,260
It seems

520
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,940
the King of Nanzhao sent them.

521
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,940
Let's return to Tianque first

522
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,990
and then make further plans.

523
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,380
You may leave now.

524
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,580
- Let's go.
- Yes, Your Highness.

525
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,300
How are we supposed

526
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,780
to sleep here?

527
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,580
You sleep inside,

528
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,420
and I'll sleep outside.

529
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,900
Is that so?

530
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,260
What if I want to sleep outside?

531
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,140
Then you can sleep outside,
and I'll sleep inside.

532
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,020
I think the inside is quite good too.

533
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,340
Where exactly do you want to sleep?

534
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,660
It depends on

535
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,940
where you want to sleep.

536
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,540
You can't sleep with me.

537
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,020
Don't you change your clothes

538
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,780
before sleeping?

539
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
I'll change after you fall asleep.

540
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,140
You did such a good job.

541
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,940
What's this thing?

542
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,620
A screen.

543
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,100
What's the screen for?

544
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,980
To avoid hearing you snore,
grind your teeth,

545
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,990
and talk in your sleep at night.

546
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,820
Have you heard me snore
and grind my teeth?

547
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,620
It seems you often spied on me

548
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,060
when we were in the Mansion.

549
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,460
I guessed it.

550
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,700
- Stop!
- What's that sound?

551
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,380
Madam?

552
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,340
You?

553
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,380
Madam,

554
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
what do you mean by this?

555
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,940
Who exactly

556
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,660
are you?

557
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,980
Speak quickly,

558
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,260
or I'll kill you.

559
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,460
Beiyue,

560
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,420
a son killing his mother

561
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,100
will be punished by the heavens.

562
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,220
Are you saying you are my mother?

563
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,500
I am your mother.

564
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,100
We have been separated for so long.

565
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,340
I didn't mean to disturb you.

566
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,740
It was just an unexpected meeting
in the small forest today.

567
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,060
I couldn't hold back for a moment.

568
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,540
So I...

569
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,780
Madam,

570
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,980
forgive me for being blunt.

571
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,700
Beiyue and I

572
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,860
thought you were already...

573
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,860
I understand.

574
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,180
So no matter how much
Beiyue hates or resents me,

575
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,100
it's all justified.

576
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,660
Back then, I faked my death
to leave the palace

577
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
and leave Beiyue behind.

578
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,660
It was my fault.

579
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,820
Why did you

580
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,700
fake your death?

581
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,620
It is a long story.

582
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,740
Back then, I was young and impulsive,

583
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,460
and had some disputes
with Beiyue's grandfather.

584
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,140
So I left home in a fit of anger.

585
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,820
After that, I wandered the world
and reached Tianque.

586
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,100
I was noticed by the King of Tianque
while he was out hunting.

587
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,340
Then I married into the Tianque Palace

588
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,660
and gave birth to Beiyue.

589
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,180
Although I left my family,

590
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,180
I missed them deeply.

591
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,580
One day, a message suddenly came
from outside the palace

592
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,140
saying that something had happened
to Meng Tribe.

593
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,860
The family was in trouble.

594
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,020
How could I sit idly by?

595
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,340
But my status in the palace was low,

596
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,900
and I had concealed my identity
as a member of the Meng Tribe.

597
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,660
At that time, I couldn't
leave the palace at all.

598
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,900
I had no choice

599
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,740
but to leave Beiyue behind

600
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,460
and to fake my death to leave.

601
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,420
However, I was kidnapped on the way.

602
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,980
It turned out that the bad news
about Meng Tribe

603
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,500
was completely fabricated
by that person.

604
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,820
He knew my identity

605
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,900
and wanted to use my Barrier Technique
for his evil deeds.

606
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,780
I refused to comply
even at the cost of my life,

607
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,220
so he imprisoned me.

608
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,300
It has been

609
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,340
20 years.

610
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,500
Who exactly was that person?

611
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,300
Where is he now?

612
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,060
I don't know who he is.

613
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,260
He always covered his face
with a black scarf.

614
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,220
I never saw his face.

615
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,660
Until a few days ago,

616
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,220
that person never came again.

617
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,980
I took the opportunity to knock out
the person who brought me food

618
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,820
and escaped.

619
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,900
Beiyue,

620
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,900
I'm sorry.

621
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,900
You were so young back then,

622
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,660
and I left you behind.

623
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,780
I'm so sorry about that.

624
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,460
After I left you,

625
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,660
I have been missing you every day.

626
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,140
Beiyue,

627
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,020
can you forgive me?

628
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:01,940
Here.

629
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,940
You can't drink alcohol.

630
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,020
This is not alcohol. It's water.

631
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,860
Just to fit the occasion.

632
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,540
To fit the occasion.

633
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,620
Aren't you here to persuade me?

634
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,340
No, I'm not good at that.

635
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,820
I don't have much experience

636
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,140
in kinship.

637
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,900
After all, I'm an orphan.

638
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,940
What I mean is,

639
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,020
in the Chancellor's Mansion,

640
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,220
I felt like an orphan.

641
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,980
Actually,

642
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,740
I quite envy you.

643
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,620
Not everyone

644
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,740
gets a second chance.

645
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,820
Let everything go as it will.

646
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,860
Are you leaving?

647
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,580
Yes.

648
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,580
I am relieved now

649
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,420
when I know that you are doing well.

650
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,580
So,

651
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,620
I won't disturb you anymore.

652
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,420
You and Ziqing.

653
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,020
Take good care of yourselves.

654
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,860
Wait a moment.

655
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,180
At your age now,

656
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,820
it's not suitable
to wander the world anymore.

657
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,140
Why not come back to Tianque with us?

658
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,420
Alright.

659
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,980
I will go back with you.

660
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,820
I'm always thinking about

661
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,700
reuniting with you.

662
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,940
Beiyue,

663
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,900
as long as you are willing,

664
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,500
I will never leave you again.

665
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,660
Madam, are you hungry?

666
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,820
Would you like to eat something?

667
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,780
No need, Ziqing.

668
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,700
I'm not hungry.

669
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,900
We should focus on our journey.

670
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,220
Madam, you don't have to be so polite.

671
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,060
We are all family.

672
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,660
Since we are family,

673
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,980
Ziqing, you don't need
to call me Madam anymore.

674
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,220
Like Beiyue, call me Mother.

675
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,860
What I mean is,

676
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,660
you are a family.

677
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,980
I haven't officially married Beiyue yet.

678
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,740
How about calling you Madam Wan?

679
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,180
Alright.

680
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,940
Beiyue and I have discussed it.

681
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,020
You faked your death back then.
It's not convenient to make it public.

682
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,900
Why not conceal your identity and live

683
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,540
in the Mansion of Fourth Prince?

684
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,500
Alright.

685
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,780
You two are thoughtful.

686
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,620
I agree.

687
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,460
Alright.

688
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,300
When I left back then,
you were still young.

689
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,580
Now you are a renowned general.

690
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,780
Seeing you so successful,

691
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,340
I am content.

692
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,780
Mother.

693
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,780
Hongyi.

694
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,220
Madam, let me
show you around the Mansion.

695
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,460
This way, please.

696
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,340
So grand it is.

697
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,740
Come back.

698
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,580
Why?

699
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,780
What's wrong?

700
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,620
Then,

701
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,460
we are leaving.

702
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:21,860
Bye.

703
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,740
So we are leaving now.

704
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,700
- We have no money for food.
- Bye.

705
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,380
Even if I starve to death here,
you won't care, right?

706
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,860
Heartless woman. Let's go.

707
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,580
- Heartless you.
- Ziqing.

708
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,980
The guest rooms are ready for you.

709
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,820
Stop acting.

710
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,020
Quickly.

711
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,100
Sometimes,

712
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,900
I wish we were outside.

713
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,060
Now that we are back at the Mansion,

714
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,100
we have to sleep
in separate rooms again.

715
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,580
I prefer to stay outside.

716
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,580
You just reunited with your mother.

717
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,420
You should spend more time with her.

718
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,260
Don't neglect her.

719
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,780
Since you are so considerate
to my mother,

720
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,100
just now,

721
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,620
why didn't you join me

722
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,060
to call her mother?

723
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,140
It's nothing.

724
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,460
It's just a random talk.

725
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,580
Good night.

726
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,420
Good night.

727
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:38,220
(West Yard)

728
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:43,020
Ten,

729
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,500
why are you here so late?

730
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,020
When we were in Xiling,

731
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,780
I saw His Highness's robe was torn,

732
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,220
so I took it to mend.

733
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,670
Now it's mended,
so I'm bringing it back.

734
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,340
Don't you know the rules of the Mansion?

735
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,940
His Highness' personal items

736
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,820
are not to be touched casually.

737
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,100
Be more careful.

738
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,460
When we were in Xiling,

739
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,620
I took care of him when he was sick.

740
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,940
Why can't I touch his clothes?

741
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,060
You are not his personal assistant.

742
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,380
You should keep distant, right?

743
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,540
Fourth Prince and Princess are asleep.

744
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,820
Let me take the robe in.

745
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,560
Since I've already touched it,

746
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:18,710
it can't be worn anymore.

747
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,180
Why send it in then?

748
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,420
Hey, you!

749
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,260
Ten,

750
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,340
what's the matter?

751
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,380
What's wrong with you?

752
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,500
You don't look happy.

753
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,340
Nothing.

754
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,900
Ten, I want to talk to you.

755
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,860
I'm not in the mood today.

756
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,340
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

757
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,820
But you've been unhappy lately

758
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,700
since you argued with Her Highness.

759
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,340
As a servant,

760
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,820
how dare I argue with the master?

761
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,340
Are you angry with Her Highness?

762
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,500
I said I'm not.

763
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,980
You like Fourth Prince.

764
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,620
Ten, I can see it.

765
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,300
Your feelings for His Highness

766
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:04,220
are different from before.

767
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:07,980
I...

768
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
I just...

769
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,780
Gu Xi,

770
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,180
do you know?

771
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,540
When Fourth Princess was not around,

772
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,980
I was so close to His Highness.

773
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,660
I took care of his every meal and tea.

774
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:26,900
I once thought,

775
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,740
if Her Highness couldn't come back,

776
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,420
I would be willing
to stay by his side for a lifetime

777
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,780
to accompany him and take care of him,

778
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,100
and I will never leave him.

779
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,060
But as soon as Her Highness returned,

780
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,180
he no longer needed me.

781
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,060
I became useless.

782
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,220
Ten, you can't think like that.

783
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,540
Her Highness treats you so well.

784
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,580
You are like her own sister.

785
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,420
You can't

786
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,100
covet her husband.

787
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:53,940
I didn't.

788
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,180
I just want to stay by his side.

789
00:44:58,140 --> 00:44:59,460
Is that wrong?

790
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,300
Well...

791
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,540
Gu Xi,

792
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,420
I have no ill intentions
towards Her Highness.

793
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,660
It's just that sometimes,

794
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,300
Her Highness makes him feel embarrassed,

795
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,460
and I feel indignant for him.

796
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,860
But that's a matter between the masters.

797
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,420
You can't meddle in.

798
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,620
Yes,

799
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,590
I am lowly,

800
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,240
and I shouldn't.

801
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,700
But none of you can control

802
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,480
my thoughts in the heart.

803
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,100
