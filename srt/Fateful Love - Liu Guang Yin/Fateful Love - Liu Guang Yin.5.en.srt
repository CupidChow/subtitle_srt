21
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,380
Where are you going?

22
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,220
I'm hungry.

23
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,360
I'm going to look for something to eat.

24
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,500
The kitchen is at the back.

25
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,620
Why do I feel like

26
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,860
you're sneaking around?

27
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,410
I'm not.

28
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,790
I'm new here.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,620
How would I know where the kitchen is?

30
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,540
I'm just looking around.

31
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,220
Your Highness, go to bed early.

32
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,060
I'll be going now.

33
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,460
If you're really hungry,

34
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,780
I'll have the kitchen cook something
for you.

35
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,660
Whatever you want to eat,
I'll eat with you.

36
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,460
Staying up late causes acne.

37
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,300
It's too late. I won't eat.

38
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,020
Acne?

39
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,980
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

40
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,460
Let's go.

41
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,780
Princess Consort is such a beauty.

42
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,060
With a little makeup,
she looks more gorgeous.

43
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:04,900
Right, Your Highness?

44
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,740
How is it?

45
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,180
What are you eating?

46
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,220
Your Highness,
you can't eat that bamboo stick.

47
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,160
What are you talking about?

48
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,660
It's a sweet cane.
Haven't you seen it before?

49
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,260
Are you a rabbit?

50
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,900
Princess Consort,
Your Highness surely likes your outfit.

51
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,300
I'm Jiang Jingbo,
Minister of Justice Office.

52
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,900
Greetings to Your Highness,

53
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,810
the Fourth Prince and Princess Consort.

54
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,620
Jiang Jingbo,

55
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,860
it's early in the morning.
Yet you've brought so many people

56
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,420
to block the gate of my mansion.

57
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
What are you up to?

58
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,940
Your Highness,
please don't misunderstand me.

59
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,100
I am here to investigate
the Chen Family murder case.

60
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,020
I would like to ask the Princess Consort
to assist in the investigation.

61
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,180
Your Highness,

62
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,660
please come with us.

63
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,340
Did you ever ask for my opinion?

64
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,260
Now there is evidence proving

65
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,500
that Princess Consort is related
to the murder case.

66
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,620
If it weren't for this,

67
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,660
I would never dare
to disturb Your Highness

68
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
and Princess Consort.

69
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:35,980
Evidence?

70
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,100
Show me

71
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,940
the evidence now.

72
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:40,860
Your Highness,

73
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,420
in the case,

74
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,940
all evidence must be kept confidential.

75
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,300
I cannot present it to you.

76
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,460
Fine.

77
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,780
You want the Princess Consort
to go with you?

78
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,060
What do you exactly mean?

79
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,100
Your Highness, please take a look.

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,340
I am fulfilling my job under orders

81
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,740
and according to the law of Tianque.

82
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,940
Please allow me.

83
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
When did His Majesty issue this order?

84
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,820
Because all the evidence and witnesses
are present,

85
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,380
and I considered it important,

86
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,740
I dare not delay.

87
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,660
I reported to His Majesty overnight.

88
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,620
His Majesty did not sleep all night.

89
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,660
After the morning court session,

90
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,340
this arrest warrant was issued.

91
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,740
Jiang Jingbo, do you think
that with this arrest warrant,

92
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,860
you can take away my princess consort?

93
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,620
Your Highness,

94
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,260
it's royal order.

95
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,420
Forgive me for the offense.

96
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,260
Someone,

97
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,560
please escort the Princess Consort
to the carriage.

98
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,540
Your Highness,

99
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,260
since there's the arrest warrant,

100
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,820
I will go with Mr. Jiang.

101
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,300
Everything must be based on evidence.

102
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,940
I believe Mr. Jiang
will handle it impartially.

103
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,580
Yes.

104
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,700
Do you know what the Judicial Office is?

105
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,380
Rest assured, Your Highness.

106
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,620
I am well aware of it.

107
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,100
If I don't go now,

108
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,660
not only will I be defying
His Majesty's order,

109
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,540
but it will also make us look guilty.

110
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,260
Don't worry.

111
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,500
I will ensure your safety.

112
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,180
Thank you, Your Highness.

113
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,980
Let's go.

114
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

115
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,620
Put it down, put it down.

116
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,780
I take my leave.

117
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,140
Move out.

118
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,380
Your Highness, what should we do?

119
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,380
Has Han Ziqing been taken in?

120
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Mother, don't worry.

121
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,620
This time, the entire Han Family
cannot escape from it.

122
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,380
The evidence is conclusive.

123
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,220
This time,

124
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,260
I wonder how they get away.

125
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,220
Your father

126
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,540
always uses the Chancellor's Mansion

127
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,580
and Mansion of Fourth Prince
to suppress us.

128
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,220
Even if we can't bring down
Han Shiqing this time,

129
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,500
when Han Ziqing is sentenced

130
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
and Han Xi'er's reputation is ruined.

131
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,780
I don't believe
that the Chancellor Han's Mansion

132
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,260
can still shamelessly ally
with the Mansion of Fourth Prince.

133
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,140
This time, it is certain.

134
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,900
- Mother, take it slow.
- Alright.

135
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,500
(Wanshou Hall)

136
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,420
Dismiss.

137
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,740
Yes.

138
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
Greetings, Father.

139
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,380
See it yourself.

140
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,220
In the Chen Family murder case,

141
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,580
all the evidence and witnesses
are present.

142
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,860
What else do you have to say?

143
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,860
Beiyue,

144
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,380
you are my pride,

145
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,820
and the face of Tianque.

146
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,900
The matter in the Grandeur Palace
has caused quite a stir in the city.

147
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,500
Yet you insisted on marrying Han Ziqing.

148
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,940
I did not stop you

149
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,720
and issued the Imperial Edict
for the ennoblement.

150
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,700
But now such a thing has happened.

151
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,060
Do you expect me to keep compromising?

152
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,460
Do you want to marry a murderer?

153
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,780
Since you have already given the order,

154
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,500
let's do it according to the law.

155
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,260
I

156
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,580
will not interfere.

157
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,660
It's easy for you to say.

158
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Why didn't you investigate thoroughly
when choosing a consort?

159
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,550
Now the Fourth Princess Consort
has become a prisoner.

160
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,540
The autumn hunt is approaching.

161
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,980
The Xiling envoy will arrive soon.

162
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,220
Your mansion has such a scandal.

163
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,490
Didn't you feel ashamed?

164
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:31,900
So now,

165
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,420
what do you intend to do?

166
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,800
Depose her.

167
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,220
Han Ziqing is not fit
to be the Fourth Princess Consort.

168
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,540
The case is still in trial.

169
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,180
How do you conclude
that Han Ziqing is the murderer?

170
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,580
Does it even need a trial?

171
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,440
She is just going through the motions.

172
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,620
If Han Ziqing signs the confession,

173
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
I can depose her.

174
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,900
Otherwise,

175
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,820
forgive me,

176
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,420
I cannot do it.

177
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,740
By the way, Father,

178
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,460
Ouyang Jingshi

179
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,220
did not comply with the Imperial Edict.

180
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,060
She

181
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,180
is still detained at my place.

182
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,940
I would like to ask you,

183
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,180
how should I deal with her?

184
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,660
Jingshi?

185
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,500
What is this about?

186
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,660
Yesterday when Eunuch Yin
announced the edict,

187
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,620
Ouyang Jingshi kept trying to stop it.

188
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,140
Chancellor Han, Eunuch Yin,

189
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,180
and those imperial physicians
can all testify to this.

190
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,860
This girl is too bold.

191
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,980
Does the Ouyang Family

192
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,700
intend to rebel?

193
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,420
Father,

194
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,980
so about Ouyang Jingshi,

195
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,660
I await

196
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,740
your decision.

197
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,380
I shall

198
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,940
take my leave now.

199
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,540
Alright.

200
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,060
Goodbye, Your Highness.

201
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,500
Your Highness.

202
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,300
Keep a close watch on Ouyang Jingshi.

203
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,820
Rest assured, Your Highness.

204
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,260
I have already assigned more guards.

205
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,100
Even if her father comes,
he won't be able to take her away.

206
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,460
Even if he rushes back,

207
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,700
he wouldn't dare to act rashly.

208
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,980
Because he knows
better than anyone else

209
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,420
that father wants to diminish his power.

210
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,500
Father wants to diminish his power,

211
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,100
and so as mine.

212
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,020
Father just wants to ensure

213
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,460
that no one

214
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,700
can overpower the other.

215
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,940
That's my father.

216
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,580
By the way,

217
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,260
as to the two people in purple clothes
you buried in the suburbs,

218
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,940
find some villagers to dig them up
and report it to the government office.

219
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,860
Yes.

220
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,740
Han Ziqing.

221
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,610
Silver mask?

222
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,660
Why is it you again?

223
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,380
It seems you still remember me.

224
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,380
Did you miss me?

225
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,300
How did you get in here?

226
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,060
I just

227
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,900
walked in openly.

228
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,060
Have you been too tired these days

229
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,220
to rest well?

230
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,300
I saw you sleeping quite soundly.

231
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,300
Really?

232
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,220
I want to see who you are.

233
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,620
Do you want to know who I am?

234
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,460
Do you want to see my face?

235
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,860
Han Ziqing, are you a dog?

236
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,620
For a rogue like you,

237
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,100
biting you is already lenient.

238
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,540
But I quite like it when you bite me.

239
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,660
Want to take another bite?

240
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,500
By the way,

241
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,780
I have already killed

242
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,260
those two people in purple clothes

243
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,860
and buried them in the suburbs.

244
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,140
But now their corpses

245
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,300
have been discovered.

246
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,140
Just consider it

247
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,180
a gift for you.

248
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,700
Who exactly are you?

249
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,900
(Why does this feel so familiar?)

250
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,420
(What exactly does he want?)

251
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,780
Your Highness, it's me.

252
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
I brought you some food.

253
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,940
Just leave it there.

254
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,100
Jiang Jingbo, that foxy man,

255
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,140
keeps saying

256
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,740
that it's only because of you

257
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,300
that they let me in.

258
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,220
But what kind of room is this?

259
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,540
At most, it's just a cleaner cell.

260
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
When we get out,

261
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,460
we must give them a hard time.

262
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,620
They are just following orders.

263
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,300
No need to argue with them.

264
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,980
You came at the right time.

265
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,820
Help me with something.

266
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Please tell me, Your Highness.

267
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,180
I understand.

268
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,060
Then tomorrow at 3 to 5 a.m,

269
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,700
come and report to me.

270
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,540
By the way,

271
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,180
what is the Fourth Prince doing?

272
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,020
This morning, after they took you away,

273
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,220
he rushed to the Imperial Study.

274
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,800
I heard he had a big argument
with His Majesty.

275
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,180
He has never been so concerned
about anyone.

276
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,780
To you, he truly is...

277
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,260
Alright, you may leave now.

278
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,680
Then I will take my leave.

279
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,900
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

280
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,540
Is she a dog?

281
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,860
Your Highness.

282
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,380
What is it?

283
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,660
Your Highness.

284
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,900
His Majesty will personally

285
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,620
interrogate the Princess Consort's case
tomorrow.

286
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,660
Did he ask me to sit in?

287
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,060
From what His Majesty said,

288
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,900
it seems he wanted you to avoid it.

289
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,820
(Tianqi)

290
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,940
(Judicial Office)

291
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,580
You may rise.

292
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:09,860
It's time for the public trial.

293
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,260
Bring the accused.

294
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,600
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

295
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,390
You may rise and speak.

296
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,940
(It seems they are planning
to deal with Han Xi'er as well.)

297
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
(The lawsuit they forced Mr. Chen
to write)

298
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,700
(will probably be used today.)

299
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,460
Han Xi'er.

300
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,820
Han Ziqing.

301
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,140
Your Majesty has appointed me

302
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,820
to preside over the trial
of Chen Family murder case.

303
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,620
Now that we have both witnesses and evidence,

304
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,020
if you confess,

305
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,700
with His Majesty's mercy,

306
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,860
I will handle it leniently.

307
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,860
If you do not confess,

308
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,140
since the ruler is subject
to the same laws as commoners,

309
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,620
even though you are a princess consort,

310
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,900
I will deal with it severely.

311
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,940
I am innocent.

312
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,900
Why should I confess?

313
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,060
Since Your Majesty is hearing the trial,

314
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,740
then please give me justice.

315
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,580
Your Majesty,

316
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,780
I do not know what crimes
my two daughters have committed.

317
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,260
Someone.

318
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,900
Bring the witnesses forward.

319
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
Your Majesty.

320
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,420
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

321
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,900
My son died unjustly.

322
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,740
Your Majesty, please seek justice
for my family.

323
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,900
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

324
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,260
- Seek justice for my family.
- You two,

325
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,140
do not make a loud noise.

326
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,420
If you have anything to say,

327
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,300
speak it up.

328
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,460
Your Majesty, Mr. Jiang,

329
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,580
my son

330
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,980
was killed by Chancellor Han's family.

331
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,660
They must have held a grudge
against my son

332
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,380
for insulting Miss Ziqing
at the Grandeur Palace,

333
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,260
so they killed my son.

334
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,020
They are the murderers, Your Majesty.

335
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,140
Do you have any evidence?

336
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,380
Yes,

337
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,700
this is what I found at home,

338
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,620
a self-written lawsuit by my son
before he was killed.

339
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,500
Please seek justice for my son.

340
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,100
Please help us, Your Majesty.

341
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,900
My son died so tragically.

342
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,220
Your Majesty.

343
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,060
Be quiet.

344
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,600
- Please seek justice for my son.
- Your Majesty.

345
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,580
Your Majesty,

346
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,700
this lawsuit indeed
bears Mr. Chen's fingerprint.

347
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,940
Mr. Chen stated in the lawsuit

348
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,140
that the incident at the Grandeur Palace

349
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,060
was incited by Han Xi'er

350
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:15,580
and Shopkeeper Chen
of the Grandeur Palace.

351
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,300
After Mr. Chen committed the act
at the Grandeur Palace,

352
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,540
he was brutally murdered the next day.

353
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,820
The Judicial Office has been
secretly investigating this case.

354
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,540
Now they have submitted this lawsuit.

355
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,020
The murderer has come to light.

356
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,780
(Who submitted the lawsuit
to the Judicial Office?)

357
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,180
(That person)

358
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,660
(is the culprit from the night
at the Grandeur Palace.)

359
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,740
In this lawsuit,

360
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:42,620
all three are major suspects.

361
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,380
Han Ziqing was insulted by Mr. Chen.

362
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,980
She must harbor resentment.

363
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,340
Han Xi'er and Shopkeeper Chen

364
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,060
hired Mr. Chen to humiliate Han Ziqing.

365
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,380
After the deed was done,
they killed him to silence him.

366
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,620
They are also highly suspicious.

367
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,580
- What's going on?
- After receiving this lawsuit…

368
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,460
I didn't know.

369
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,980
I quickly sent people
to the Grandeur Palace

370
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,460
to arrest Shopkeeper Chen.

371
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,780
But Shopkeeper Chen had disappeared.

372
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,540
He must have heard the news,

373
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,660
and feared that the Chancellor's Mansion
would silence him,

374
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,420
so he fled in advance.

375
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,220
Mr. Han.

376
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,660
Your Majesty, I am wronged.

377
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,640
Your Majesty, please investigate it
thoroughly.

378
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,780
Your Majesty, I am wronged.

379
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,500
I would never kill Mr. Chen.

380
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,180
On the night Mr. Chen was killed,

381
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,740
I was having dinner
with my mother and father.

382
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
After dinner, I went to my mother's room

383
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
to chat about family matters

384
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,580
until late at night.

385
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,820
Are there any witnesses?

386
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,660
Yes, yes!

387
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,540
Your Majesty,

388
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,620
my daughter indeed stayed with me

389
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,140
in the room until late that night.

390
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,340
There are over a dozen maids
and servants in this mansion,

391
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,660
all of whom can testify.

392
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,500
Your Majesty.

393
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,800
(This mother and daughter are testifying
for each other)

394
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,540
(to clear each other of suspicion.)

395
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,660
Han Ziqing,

396
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,740
where were you

397
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,740
on that night?

398
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,380
Your Majesty,

399
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,580
I was in my room.

400
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,010
Is there anyone who can prove it?

401
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,420
No one can prove it.

402
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,500
You were not in your room that night,

403
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,220
but at Mr. Chen's house, right?

404
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,820
Mr. Jiang,

405
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,220
Mr. Chen's lawsuit

406
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,580
only indicates that I had a motive,

407
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,020
but it doesn't prove
that I killed Mr. Chen.

408
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,660
Can you prove

409
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,540
that you didn't kill Mr. Chen?

410
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,380
(He who asserts must prove.)

411
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,540
(You don't even understand this
and yet you're judging the case.)

412
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:52,700
I can.

413
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,500
Your Majesty,

414
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,220
I have a request.

415
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,980
Speak.

416
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,180
I would like to request an autopsy
on Mr. Chen on the spot.

417
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,740
The Judicial Office has done that.

418
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,980
There is no need to do it again.

419
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,660
I know someone

420
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,460
who can not only determine the time
of death

421
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,780
but also infer the murder weapon

422
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,980
and the murderer's martial arts

423
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,100
based on the wounds of the deceased.

424
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,940
This person is just outside the hall.

425
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,100
Please summon him, Your Majesty.

426
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,260
Who's that?

427
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,820
Xie Zhe.

428
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,260
Who is the best coroner in Tianque?

429
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,630
The best coroner in Tianque

430
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,580
would be Xie Zhe.

431
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,900
Help me invite him over.

432
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,940
But Xie Zhe has been in seclusion
for a long time.

433
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,060
I may not be able to invite him.

434
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,340
Use the Fourth Prince's name.

435
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,300
There should be no problem.

436
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,660
(Xie Zhe was a famous coroner)

437
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,900
(on the Longyuan Continent.)

438
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,020
(But he has not come out of seclusion
for a long time.)

439
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,420
(How capable is Han Ziqing)

440
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,540
(to be able to invite him.)

441
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,940
It's Beiyue again.

442
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,260
Jiang Jingbo.

443
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,410
Summon

444
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,530
Xie Zhe.

445
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,700
My son.

446
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,740
My son.

447
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,300
You died so tragically.

448
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,980
My son.

449
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,980
You died so tragically.

450
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,980
Mr. Jiang, please seek justice for us.

451
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,940
Mr. Jiang.

452
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,860
My son.

453
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,060
My son.

454
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,780
You died so unjustly.

455
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,180
My son.

456
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,420
Your Majesty.

457
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,540
The wound is about four inches long.

458
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,940
It's a single sword strike
that killed him.

459
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,220
Judging from the technique,

460
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,300
the murderer is highly skilled.

461
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,460
So the Princess Consort's martial arts
are not bad.

462
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,140
Mr. Jiang, you are overestimating me.

463
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,340
I don't know any martial arts.

464
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,100
Judging from the height of the wound,

465
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,100
the murderer
is about seven feet eight inches tall.

466
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,580
It should be a man.

467
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,940
The sword strike is very special.

468
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,900
Most people strike from left to right,

469
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,260
so the wound is deeper on the right
and shallower on the left.

470
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,660
But the wound on this corpse

471
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,180
is deeper on the left
and shallower on the right.

472
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,060
This indicates

473
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,180
that the murderer struck from right to left.

474
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,140
It makes the wound deeper

475
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,980
and more lethal.

476
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,100
Though this sword strike is special,

477
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,900
it doesn't prove that it was not done
by the Princess Consort.

478
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,460
Your Majesty.

479
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,620
Yesterday, suburban villagers
dug up two corpses.

480
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,140
They were dressed in purple clothes.

481
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,340
The bodies were intact.

482
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,900
They had weapons on them.

483
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,540
I examined them carefully.

484
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,820
Their body shapes

485
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,620
and the blades of the swords they carried

486
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,460
matched perfectly
with Mr. Chen's wounds.

487
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,580
Xie Zhe,

488
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,900
what do you mean?

489
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,260
Mr. Chen was killed

490
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,380
by those two people in purple clothes.

491
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,380
It's too smelly.

492
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,220
Take it away.

493
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,540
Your Majesty,

494
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,620
since Mr. Xie has proven

495
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,740
that Mr. Chen was killed
by the two people in purple clothes,

496
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,980
it has nothing to do with me.

497
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,180
I have been wronged.

498
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,420
Please justify for me, Your Majesty.

499
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,300
Those two people's swords
are not ordinary.

500
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,460
I have reported the autopsy report
and their identities

501
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,820
to the Judicial Office.

502
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,420
Mr. Jiang, can you review it?

503
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,100
Jiang Jingbo.

504
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,180
I am here.

505
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,260
What's wrong with you?

506
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,260
What exactly are the identities
of those two people in purple clothes?

507
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,460
Those two people in purple clothes

508
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,060
both are

509
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,900
the first-class guards in the palace.

510
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,100
First-class guards?

511
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,500
Who ordered them?

512
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,060
Well…

513
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
Xu Xiancai.

514
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,060
I am here.

515
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,420
Your Majesty, please have mercy.

516
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,700
I am guilty.

517
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,420
I neglected my duties.

518
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,140
I deserve to die a thousand times.

519
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,220
You lost two people

520
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,020
and they were found dead in the suburbs.

521
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,660
What is going on?

522
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,260
I do not know when these two
left the palace.

523
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,860
A few days ago,
someone reported them missing.

524
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,100
I was confused for a moment

525
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,400
and afraid of being held accountable,

526
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,420
so I concealed it and didn't report it.

527
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,900
It was my negligence.

528
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,540
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

529
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,380
So you mean to say,

530
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:55,420
you don't know the connection

531
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,380
between these two
and the Chen Family murder case?

532
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,180
I, I don't know.

533
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:03,080
Xu Xiancai neglected his duties,

534
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,860
deceived his superiors
and misled his subordinates.

535
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,020
Immediately demote him

536
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,990
from first-class commander

537
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,980
- to a sixth rank.
- Yes.

538
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,940
You may leave.

539
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

540
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,940
Jiang Jingbo.

541
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,300
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

542
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,820
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

543
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,300
It's my fault that the Princess Consort
was wrongfully accused.

544
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,180
I acknowledge my guilt.

545
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,060
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

546
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,340
As the minister of Judicial Justice,

547
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,660
you were ordered to investigate
the Chen Family murder case,

548
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,260
but the evidence you presented
was utterly absurd,

549
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,820
and there are suspicions
of framing the Fourth Princess Consort.

550
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,340
Someone.

551
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,540
Dismiss Jiang Jingbo from his position

552
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,140
and hand him over
to the Ministry of Justice.

553
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,820
- Yes.
- Your Majesty, please forgive me.

554
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,820
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

555
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,660
Your Majesty.

556
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,700
Your Majesty, have mercy.

557
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,180
Your Highness, have mercy.

558
00:31:58,780 --> 00:31:59,620
Senior Brother.

559
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,500
This is the Fourth Princess Consort.

560
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,460
Can we take her down?

561
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,740
To know oneself and one's enemy
is the key to a hundred victories.

562
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,260
Before we act, we need
to check her out first.

563
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,980
However…

564
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,540
What?

565
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,660
Think about it.

566
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,100
A mere weak woman

567
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,460
was so sharp and eloquent in court

568
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,600
and managed to escape perfectly.

569
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,320
She is not to be underestimated.

570
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,060
Yes, yes.

571
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,380
It seems

572
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,420
they have wronged you.

573
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,300
Your Majesty.

574
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,900
I have a request.

575
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,780
Speak.

576
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,460
According to Mr. Chen's lawsuit,

577
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,940
he was incited by Han Xi'er
and Shopkeeper Chen

578
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,220
to humiliate me.

579
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,500
What's the decision of it?

580
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,580
Your Majesty.

581
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,340
My daughter is of pure and kind nature.

582
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,660
It is impossible for her

583
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,260
to commit such heinous acts.

584
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,860
Mr. Chen was brutally murdered.

585
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,300
Maybe he was coerced

586
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,980
into writing this lawsuit.

587
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,540
Fourth Princess Consort.

588
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,060
Regarding the accusation
that it's incited by Han Xi'er,

589
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,620
the evidence is insufficient

590
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,820
and we cannot make a judgment.

591
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,020
How about this?

592
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,260
Once we have conclusive evidence,

593
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,220
we will re-investigate the case.

594
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,420
What do you think?

595
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,820
Thank you, Your Majesty.

596
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

597
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

598
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,460
I'm waiting for you
to find out the truth, Your Majesty.

599
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,140
After all, before the truth is revealed,

600
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,020
my sister

601
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,860
is always bearing the stigma
of framing her sister,

602
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,860
which will tarnish the reputation
of the Chancellor's Mansion.

603
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,700
Ziqing.

604
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,420
I heard Beiyue left the city today.

605
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,620
When he returns,

606
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,780
ask him to bring you to the palace.

607
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,980
I'm still waiting to celebrate for you.

608
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,700
Set off.

610
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,500
Come, take a look.

611
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,940
Sachets.

612
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,980
Sachets.

613
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,220
Stop!

614
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,860
Kites.

615
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,340
Selling kites.

616
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:58,630
Let's go.

617
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,100
Wonton.

618
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,380
What are you doing?

619
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,140
Fresh meat wonton.

620
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,260
Hot wonton.

621
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,500
Stop!

622
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,420
Hurry up.

623
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,700
Who exactly are you?

624
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,140
Why are you helping me?

625
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,500
If you can catch up with me,

626
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
I'll tell you.

627
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,460
Come on.

628
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,180
Get down here.

629
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,780
Your Highness, quickly jump over
the fire basin

630
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,620
to ward off bad luck.

631
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,080
Your Highness, jump quickly.

632
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,080
Welcome back, Your Highness.

633
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,940
- Welcome back, Your Highness.
- Welcome back, Your Highness.

634
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,940
Your Highness, you are the best.

635
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,980
What best?

636
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,340
It's spread all over the royal city.

637
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,700
You are the most beautiful woman

638
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,220
and the best princess in the world.

639
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,100
They have good taste.

640
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:40,980
Your Highness,

641
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,820
where have you been?

642
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,260
You're back.

643
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,940
What were you doing?

644
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,220
You didn't even attend my court trial.

645
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,220
I did have some important work to do.

646
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,340
Although I didn't attend your court trial,

647
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,740
I heard of it.

648
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,860
You handled it

649
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,340
extremely well.

650
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,260
(Didn't you say you would protect me?)

651
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,300
(You didn't even show up
in the court trial.)

652
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,420
(Men's words are indeed deceitful.)

653
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,460
It's all thanks to your blessing,

654
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,840
that I was able to turn danger
into safety.

655
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,100
You're quite good at flattering.

656
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,580
What are you looking at?

657
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,340
Your Highness,

658
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,660
in this hot weather,

659
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,780
why are you wearing a high collar?

660
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,940
Though I'm wearing a high collar
in such hot weather,

661
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,020
what does it have to do with you?

662
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,020
I not only don't feel hot,

663
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,460
but also feel a bit cold.

664
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,780
What?

665
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,890
Why are you concerned about me?

666
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,800
I'm not.

667
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,780
Hongyi,

668
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,820
it's still early.

669
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,700
Take her out to buy some clothes.

670
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,520
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Make sure they have high collars.

671
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,380
No need, I have enough clothes.

672
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,220
Hurry up and go.

673
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,340
What a weird man.

674
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Was Xie Zhe

675
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,180
invited over

676
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,460
by using the Fourth Prince's name?

677
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,300
That's for sure.

678
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,980
But it seems Xie Zhe knew early on

679
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,260
that we were going to invite him.

680
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,620
He was waiting at home very early.

681
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,300
When we were there,

682
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,940
someone must have informed him
in advance.

683
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,100
Mother, don't be angry.

684
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,540
What should we do next?

685
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,820
What else can we do?

686
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,460
We've lost two great helpers.

687
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,180
I don't know when we can recover
our strength.

688
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,940
The entire trial

689
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,680
was manipulated
by someone behind the scenes.

690
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,540
Otherwise, how could Han Ziqing

691
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,100
have such great ability?

692
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,140
Just inviting Xie Zhe alone

693
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,820
is beyond her capability.

694
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,500
The person behind this

695
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,700
must be the Fourth Prince.

696
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,980
If we don't

697
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,460
get rid of him,

698
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,660
when will you rise to power?

699
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,220
To deal with him,

700
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,620
we must start with Han Ziqing.

701
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,980
This woman is not simple.

702
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,460
I underestimated her before.

703
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,380
- Look at this piece.
- Your Highness,

704
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,620
those fabrics were quite beautiful.

705
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,300
They were too complicated.

706
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,140
Not suitable for me.

707
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,620
But

708
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,180
His Highness told me

709
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,300
to buy you some beautiful clothes.

710
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,820
Just say I didn't like any of them.

711
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,940
- Your Highness.
- Miss.

712
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,820
Come and see if there's anything
you like.

713
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,580
Come and take a look.

714
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,340
- What is this?
- This is a wind chime.

715
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,740
Calligraphy works and paintings.

716
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,140
This is not quite

717
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,340
what I imagined.

718
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,180
Imagine?

719
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,180
You still dare to run?

720
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,140
Stand still.

721
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,900
Do you want to die?

722
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,020
I'll beat you to death.

723
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,500
Beat you to death, beat you to death!

724
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,540
Stop there.

725
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,660
- Your Highness.
- Still running?

726
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,620
Beat you to death. Stop right there!

727
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,060
Stop him!

728
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,300
You little brat, stop right there!

729
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,660
How can you just hit her like that?

730
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,900
She stole my steamed buns.

731
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,580
- Your Highness.
- Let's go take a look.

732
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,420
Your Highness.

733
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,550
We are outside the mansion.

734
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,940
It's better not to meddle
in others' affairs.

735
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,860
No, we must help her.

736
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,700
Beat you to death.

737
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,380
Your Highness.

738
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,420
You should stay out of this.

739
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,100
Let's just avoid unnecessary trouble.

740
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,150
Let go.

741
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,980
- Beat you to death.
- Your Highness.

742
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,010
You thief.

743
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,140
I'll beat you to death.

744
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:29,360
Who are you?

745
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,700
Why are you beating her?

746
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
She stole my steamed buns.

747
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,840
Are your steamed buns more important
than her life?

748
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,380
My steamed buns are valuable.

749
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,660
- Will you compensate me?
- Yes, let me.

750
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,020
How much?

751
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,580
Ten wen.

752
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,020
Give her ten taels of silver.

753
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,260
Ten taels of silver?

754
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,740
Get lost.

755
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,820
Silver.

756
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,340
Alright, alright, she's yours now.

757
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,220
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

758
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,060
It's ten taels of silver.

759
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,420
Dismiss, you all.

760
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,700
Get up.

761
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,020
Why did you steal?

762
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,180
Where are your parents?

763
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,860
Answer her. Are you mute?

764
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,620
You stole so many steamed buns.

765
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,840
You can't eat them all by yourself.

766
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,700
They are starving.

767
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,300
You…

768
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,180
They?

769
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,220
Your Highness.

770
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,260
Follow her and take a look.

771
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,100
Yes.

772
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,180
Stop.

773
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,740
Your Highness.

774
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,140
