21
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,750
Why isn't Prince Xiang coming with us?

22
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,730
He has returned to Xiling
to wait for us.

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,390
When will our ship arrive?

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,890
Don't worry. It's coming.

25
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,060
If you need to pass through
Yaoshun Island,

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,370
you must get Dongling's approval.

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,540
We have to go to Dongling Royal City

28
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,700
to get my mother's consent first.

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,060
Crown Prince Xuanyuan,
are you planning to

30
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,300
make a move against me in Dongling

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,420
and use the opportunity
to rescue Han Ziqing?

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,100
Without Dongling's approval,

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,620
you cannot pass through Yaoshun Island.

34
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,940
But I'm here.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,140
I can represent Dongling.

36
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,430
You're doing this behind Mother's back

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,500
and betraying Dongling.

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,540
You will face retribution.

39
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,380
Don't worry.

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,820
Regarding borrowing the route
to Consort Yun,

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,620
I have already obtained Mother's decree.

42
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,570
I am acting under the decree.

43
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,820
Brother,

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,180
you don't need to worry about it.

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,380
Brother, it seems your illness
has come back,

46
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,180
you should return to Dongling
for treatment.

47
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,900
Don't stare at me like that.

48
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,460
I'm doing this for your good.

49
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,140
I'm also doing this
so you can get the antidote.

50
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,500
That's why I'm working for them.

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,820
You two, stop arguing.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,020
Both of you will be credited
once the task is done.

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,140
As for who gets the credit,

54
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,020
that's not my concern.

55
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,460
Consort Yun, the ship has arrived.

56
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,820
Your Highness.

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,090
Your Highness, this way.

58
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,100
Under the nose
of the Tianque Royal Family,

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,940
someone has built

60
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,980
such a massive secret chamber.

61
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,980
Clear.

62
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,780
Clear.

63
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,420
Clear.

64
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:06,980
Clear.

65
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,940
Beiyue, look.

66
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,580
Yaoshun Island.

67
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,580
Could it be that they plan
to take the water route?

68
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,540
Let's go

69
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,660
to check the dock.

70
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,220
Yes.

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,100
(Xuanyuan)

72
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,460
As an Islander,

73
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,500
you don't deserve to live in this world.

74
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
You took away Jun Beiyue
and ruined my life.

75
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,180
Han Ziqing,

76
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,100
this is the price you should pay.

77
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Enjoy it well.

78
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,140
Princess Zhaoxi,
be careful of your brother.

79
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,820
He has deep feelings

80
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,220
for Han Ziqing.

81
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,420
As long as I'm here,

82
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
he won't have a say

83
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,820
in Han Ziqing's case.

84
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,140
If you want to clear obstacles,
you must be decisive.

85
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,280
Don't let him cause trouble.

86
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,060
What did she tell you?

87
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,580
Consort Yun said
you have deep feelings for Han Ziqing

88
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,940
and told me to be wary of you.

89
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,700
What are you doing?

90
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,500
What are you doing?

91
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,980
From now on,

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,650
we will increase the dose of poisons
for Han Ziqing

93
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,770
to torture her

94
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,980
and make her life worse than death.

95
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,100
No.

96
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,900
Your Highness,

97
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,980
they are setting sail.

98
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,820
Trying to escape?

99
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,260
Blow up the bottom of the ship.

100
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,620
Don't let anyone escape.

101
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,300
No.

102
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,260
Zhaoxi,

103
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,500
Chu Feiyan is deceiving you.

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
She just wants to use Tianque's soldiers
to attack Dongling.

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,820
Don't be fooled by her.

106
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,100
You should think
about how to save yourself first.

107
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,500
Do you think if something happens to me,

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,740
Mother will spare you?

109
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,860
I won't let you die so easily.

110
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,500
Mother is right.

111
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,260
Your value

112
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,620
is to pave the way for me
to become the queen.

113
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
At least I have some value.

114
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,220
But you

115
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,900
are worthless.

116
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,420
Your Highness.

117
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,100
Your Highness.

118
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,900
Your Highness, there's a situation.

119
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,940
What situation?

120
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,700
A lot of men in black
suddenly appeared on the sea

121
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,900
and started fighting with our people.

122
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,740
They are ruthless.

123
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,100
Could it be Jun Beiyue?

124
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,180
Quick, set sail.

125
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,180
Release the falcons

126
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,020
and send out the message

127
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,180
that the Fourth Prince of Tianque
is attacking Dongling's ship.

128
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,460
- Yes.
- Stop.

129
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,580
Xuanyuan Zhaoxi, stop.

130
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,660
You are no match for Jun Beiyue.

131
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,260
The only solution now
is to release Han Ziqing

132
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,860
and tell him about Chu Feiyan
and Chu Tiange.

133
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,900
There is no other way!

134
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,100
The only solution now

135
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,980
is for both of you to die together.

136
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,260
Xuanyuan Zhaoxi!

137
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,220
Quickly notify Consort Yun.

138
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,460
Ziqing.

139
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,460
Ziqing.

140
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,580
Ziqing.

141
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,660
Ziqing, don't be afraid.

142
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,940
Go.

143
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,700

to catch up so quickly.

254
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,340
Luckily, I escaped in time

255
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,900
and didn't face him directly.

256
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,950
Do you think that's the end of it?

257
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,250
Xuanyuan Zhaoxi will expose you.

258
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,410
By then, you will have to
be held responsible for that.

259
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,020
I won't admit it.

260
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,810
What can he do to me?

261
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,360
Forget it.

262
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,400
After all, Jun Beiyue doesn't have
any substantial evidence.

263
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,300
The Sand Worship Ritual
is coming in ten days.

264
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,300

265
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,970
I will have something to say to him.

266
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,580
What do you plan to do?

267
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,210
Han Ziqing has been confirmed

268
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,210
to be an Islander.

269
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,410

270
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,030
and dares to provoke us,

271
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,810
you should write to the King of Nanzhao

272
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,900
and unite with other countries
to declare war on Tianque.

273
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,680
Declare war on Tianque?

274
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,820
What?

275
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,060
Are you reluctant?

276
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,420
Let me tell you.

277
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,500
You kidnapped Han Ziqing.

278
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,800
Are you still dreaming that Jun Beiyue
will fall in love with you?

279
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,580
You must abandon all your fantasies
about him now

280
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,980
and defend yourself from his revenge.

281
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,260
Also,

282
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,660
if the King of Nanzhao
finds out about this,

283
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,220
you won't have a good time either.

284
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,580
You must actively show your loyalty

285
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,660
to the King of Nanzhao now,

286
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,380
so that when we need it,

287
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,580
we can leverage Nanzhao's power

288
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,900
to achieve our goals.

289
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,020

things would turn out this way,

290
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,180
I wouldn't have gotten involved
in this mess.

291
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,700
Shouldn't you take the blame?

292
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,540
It was a flawless plan,

293
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,820
but you messed it up.

294
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,060

295
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,140

Chu Feiyan entered Tianque
without permission

343

344
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,220
Jun Beiyue chased her
to Dongling's ship

to have rescued Han Ziqing

346
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,620

347
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,700
The situation is quite complicated.

348
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,780
Chu Feiyan suddenly left the palace

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,420

350
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,740
I didn't expect her
to interfere in Tianque.

351
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,060
What exactly is she trying to do?

352
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,780
Chu Feiyan has always hated Han Ziqing.

353
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,500
If she kidnapped her
out of personal vendetta,

354
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,580
it's not hard to understand.

355
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,700

- Yes, he's awake.

359
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,260
He didn't say a word.

360
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,460

361
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,740
He refused to take the medicine either.

362

363
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,660

364
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,860
you are seriously injured.

Come on.

368
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,660
There's a saying that the body and skin
are received from one's parents.

369
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,340
Why make things difficult for yourself?

370
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,300
Right?

371
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,860
You need to recover from the illness.

372
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,540
Baili Weisheng, I won't take it.

373
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,260
You don't need to worry about my body.

374
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,020
Let me go.

375
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,100
That's not possible.

376
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,770
I went through a lot of trouble
to save you.

377
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
I spent so much money

378
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,220
to buy you new clothes

379
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,700
and the good medicinal herbs.

380
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,540
What if you jump into the sea again?

381
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,820
Then my effort would be in vain.

382
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,460
It took me a lot of effort to save you.

383
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,580
Fine.

384
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,500
I promise you.

385
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,900
I won't seek death.

386
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,980
I just want to leave.

387
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,820
Where to?

388
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,660
Han Ziqing has already been rescued.

389
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,580
Jun Beiyue saved her.

390
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,780
She's fine, and so are you.

391
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,060
Isn't that good?

392
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,140
Come on, take the medicine.

393
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Who exactly are you?

394
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,180
I am a veterinarian.

395
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,060
You are a Golden Merfolk.

396
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,140
What is a Golden Merfolk?

397
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,980
Go away.

398
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,860
Get well first,

399
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,940
and you can say I'm a Golden Merfolk.

400
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,420
You can also go wherever you want.

401
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,660
I won't stop you, okay?

402
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,100
Golden Merfolk

403
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,180
is a branch
of the Nanzhao's Merfolk Tribe.

404
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,100
But their status and position

405
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,900
are much more noble than other merfolk.

406
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,060
Though you're young,
you know quite a lot.

407
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,260
The Golden Merfolk

408
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,140
was extinct decades ago.

409
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,620
So?

410
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,360
You are the last surviving
Golden Merfolk.

411
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,980
What? Are you investigating me?

412
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,500
Even though I'm a veterinarian,

413
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,660
I can still take a human pulse.

414
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,540
Xuanyuan Lige,

415
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,100
you have a hidden illness.

416
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,300
Moreover, you've been soaking
in seawater for so long.

417
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,580
The cold has invaded your body.

418
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,740
No way.

419
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,600
I need to change your prescription.

420
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,780
- Stop grinding.
- Baili Weisheng,

421
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,900
where are you going?

422
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,060
Unlock the acupuncture points
on my body.

423
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,220
I'll change your prescription.
You should rest well.

424
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,660
Why did you
save the Crown Prince of Dongling?

425
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,380
I saw injustice and acted to help.

426
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,780
What's wrong?

427
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,820
Could it be

428
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,460
because he saved Han Ziqing,

429
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,820
you consider him a comrade?

430
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,700
So what if I do?

431
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,460
Then you're in trouble.

432
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,140
So many people like Han Ziqing.

433
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,460
Even if you wait for 300 years,

434
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,060
it won't be your turn.

435
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,020
Get lost.

436
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,660
Brother, you are here.

437
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,260
Brother, please sit.

438
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
Brother,

439
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,620
since the Queen

440
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,780
and Second Prince passed away,

441
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,580
my health has been deteriorating.

442
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,780
Thank you

443
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,820
for managing the state affairs, Brother.

444
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,380
But you are the King of Tianque.

445
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,100
Han Ziqing has gone missing,

446
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,860
and Beiyue is in conflict
with Dongling again.

447
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,980
It will cause much discussion.

448
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,020
Tianque must take a stance
on this matter

449
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,860
to stabilize

450
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,740
the people and the situation.

451
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,410
But the imperial edict

452
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,540
must be issued by you.

453
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,580
Your Majesty,

454
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,380
I believe

455
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,580
we should send a letter
to Fourth Prince

456
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,860
to inform him of the situation
in the Royal City.

457
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,100
Alright,

458
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,020
let's do as you say, Brother.

459
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,980
These are troubled times.

460
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,500
I wonder

461
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,180
how Beiyue is doing.

462
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,500
Beiyue

463
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,220
is busy with Ziqing's matters.

464
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,940
I believe

465
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,460
no matter what changes occur,

466
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,860
he will not forget his responsibilities.

467
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,300
That's good.

468
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
Your Majesty,

469
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,300
just focus on the recuperation.

470
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,500
Alright.

471
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,580
Take care, Brother.

472
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,860
She's starting to sweat.

473
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,860
That's good.

474
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,980
She should wake up soon.

475
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,580
Sha, don't forget.

476
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,500
Don't receive other patients these days.

477
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,980
I wouldn't dare break my promise

478
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,540
to Your Highness.

479
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,380
Don't worry.

480
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,220
Alright then.

481
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,220
Sha, thank you.

482
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,020
Ziqing,

483
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,740
you must get well soon.

484
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,460
For all the suffering you endured today,

485
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,380
I will make them pay back double.

486
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:47,580
I will go to Xiling right now

487
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,940
to retrieve
what rightfully belongs to you.

488
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,020
I wonder if Prince An
can stabilize the situation

489
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,260
in Tianque Royal City.

490
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,500
As for the Royal City,

491
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,580
I have already made arrangements.

492
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,580
(Xiling Territory)

493
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,940
Fourth Prince, long time no see.

494
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,940
It is a great honor

495
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,980
to have you here.

496
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,620
I apologize for making you wait so long.

497
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,500
I am truly sorry.

498
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,580
You must drink a few more with me later.

499
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,500
Sure.

500
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,420
Well,

501
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,100
please.

502
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,300
(Linze Gate)

503
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,260
Your Highness, will you attend
the welcome banquet tomorrow night?

504
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,940
Jun Beiyue is here for me.

505
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,340
I cannot let him see me for now.

506
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,620
Tell them I am unwell.

507
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,580
I will not attend the welcome banquet.

508
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,250
Yes.

509
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,500
Your Highness,

510
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
His Majesty has instructed

511
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,660
that you should not wander around
after arriving in Xiling.

512
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,500
I came to Xiling

513
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,980
to attend the Sand Worship Ritual,

514
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,020
not as a prisoner.

515
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,180
Why can't I go out for a walk?

516
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,900
Your Highness, it's His Majesty's order.

517
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,420
Please follow it,

518
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,770
and do not make it difficult for me.

519
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,420
Then bring Situ Haonan to me.

520
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,820
If His Majesty finds out

521
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,100
you meet Mr. Situ privately,

522
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,620
I will be doomed.

523
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,940
At least bring Fourth Princess to me.

524
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,020
She is my friend.

525
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,460
Can't I see her?

526
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,660
I have asked around.

527
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,580
Fourth Princess did not come this time.

528
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,220
Ziqing didn't come?

529
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,700
Impossible.

530
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,060
Could it be

531
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,100
something happened?

532
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,100
I didn't expect Jun Beiyue

533
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,900
to dare come to Xiling alone.

534
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,580
How do you think he will deal with us?

535
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,780
We have known

536
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,140
the secret of Han Ziqing's identity.

537
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,020
If Jun Beiyue dares to provoke us,

538
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,860
I will not be polite to him.

539
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,340
But where did he hide Han Ziqing?

540
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,500
Has he sent her back to Tianque?

541
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,340
No, it can't be.

542
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,860
Now Jun Beiyue is like
a bird on a wire.

543
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,980
He would never let Han Ziqing
return to Tianque alone.

544
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,700
She must be hiding somewhere
to heal herself.

545
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,620
Even if she recovers from her injuries,
so what?

546
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,260
That ugly mark on her face

547
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,060
won't just disappear, will it?

548
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,100
Han Ziqing was right.

549
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,660
You are jealous of her.

550
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,540
So what if I am?

551
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,860
I don't care about your petty thoughts.

552
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,300
Just remember this,

553
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,500
Han Ziqing must not
fall into anyone else's hands.

554
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,820
We must find her as soon as possible.

555
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,060
(Xiling Palace)

556
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,340
King of Tieyan,

557
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,340
I have heard that Princess Qianqian
is an exceptional dancer.

558
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,740
Do we have the honor today

559
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,500
to watch her dance?

560
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,300
King of Xiling,

561
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,460
I come here with my daughter.

562
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,840
We have no grand gifts to offer.

563
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,100
So let my daughter perform a dance

564
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,940
to express our gratitude.

565
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,580
Qianqian,

566
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,900
please dance to the song.

567
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,020
Princess Qianqian is indeed

568
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,460
a beautiful and great dancer.

569
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,140
It is our fortune to watch this today.

570
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,620
Additionally,

571
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,700
I have another announcement to make.

572
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,460
My youngest son, Chu Tiange,

573
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,980
will marry Princess Nangong Qianqian
of Tieyan.

574
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,740
Congratulations, King of Xiling.

575
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,820
Congratulations, King of Tieyan.

576
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,140
Since it is a joyous occasion,

577
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,020
I have also prepared a gift

578
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,180
for Prince Xiang.

579
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,220
Bring it in.

580
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,660
Jun Beiyue,

581
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,340
what is the meaning of this?

582
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,180
Fourth Prince.

583
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,820
Fourth Prince,

584
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,020
I was wrong.

585
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,820
Everything I did

586
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,820
was under the orders

587
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,380
of Chu Tiange and Chu Feiyan.

588
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,260
I was wrong.

589
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,900
I shouldn't have colluded
with the Chu siblings.

590
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,340
Please forgive me, Fourth Prince.

591
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,140
Please let me return to Dongling.

592
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,420
Prince Xiang, I wonder

593
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,260
if you are satisfied with my gift.

594
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,420
As to the despicable things
you and Chu Feiyan did,

595
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,620
I will make you repay them doubly.

596
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,780
Sit down.

597
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,460
How did you feel

598
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,990
when you saw Qianqian today?

599
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,740
She seemed

600
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
very unhappy today.

601
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
You are worrying about her.

602
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,420
Have you ever thought about
meeting her alone?

603
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,660
Meeting her alone?

604
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,980
If you can't let go,

605
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,060
I can help you.

606
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,020
Are you just going to watch

607
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,500
she marries Chu Tiange?

608
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,580
Beiyue,

609
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,220
what do you plan to do
with Xuanyuan Zhaoxi?

610
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:41,900
In my opinion,

611
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,780
if we send Xuanyuan Zhaoxi back now,

612
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,300
firstly, we can avoid
a diplomatic conflict,

613
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,520
and secondly, it would
give the Queen of Dongling a favor.

614
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,940
Currently, Tianque should not
make too many enemies.

615
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,540
Alright,

616
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,100
let's do as you say.

617
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,320
Look at the fog and the wind.

618
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,580
Can we arrive before dawn?

619
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,620
It's going to rain.

620
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,460
Baili Weisheng,

621
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,580
why did you

622
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,340
abduct me?

623
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,900
What do you mean by "abduct"?

624
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,260
That's such an unpleasant way to put it.

625
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,740
I'm taking you to find a doctor

626
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,740
to save your life.

627
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,740
I don't need you to save my life.

628
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,900
I've told you before.

629
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,940
Put me down,

630
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,300
and let me walk on my own.

631
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,780
Didn't we discuss this already?

632
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,300
Look at you.

633
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,740
Even if I leave you halfway,

634
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
you would still die.

635
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,980
Just lie down here.

636
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,860
Be good.

637
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,700
Once you're cured...

638
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,620
I don't need treatment.

639
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,140
How about

640
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,860
unlocking my acupuncture points first?

641
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,860
Oh,

642
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,380
can't you just listen to me for once?

643
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,500
Do you know how much effort
I've spent to save you?

644
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,800
Can't you be a little considerate?

645
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:01,140
Well,

646
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,020
just do me this favor

647
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,860
and be sensible.

648
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,500
What favor?

649
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,260
Baili Weisheng, unlock me.

650
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,480
Unlock my acupuncture points.

651
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,300
Alright. It's right here.

652
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,300
Sha.

653
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,500
Sha, Sha!

654
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,860
I will not take any patients these days.

655
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,700
Go away.

656
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,540
What?

657
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,820
Don't take patients?

658
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,300
I need to see you.

659
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,140
Open the door,

660
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,460
or I'll break the door

661
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,620
and break the window.

662
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:50,940
Sha.

663
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,300
Fine.

664
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,420
You geezer.

665
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,140
Open the door.

666
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:03,860
You geezer.

667
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,300
Sha, open the door quickly.

668
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,500
Shh.

669
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,340
Be quiet.

670
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,340
I told you I would not
take any patients.

671
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Just go away.
