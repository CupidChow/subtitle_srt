21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,310
You finally woke up.

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,470
Do you know who I am?

23
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,830
You are Meng Wanyue,

24
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,520
Jun Beiyue's mother.

25
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,720
Since you know me,

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,910
I won't beat around the bush then.

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,190
Do you know?

28
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,160
I saved you.

29
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,360
Where is this?

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,160
Yangshan Mountain.

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Yangshan Mountain?

32
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,750
Why did you bring me here?

33
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,960
The Crown Prince of Dongling
is indeed arrogant.

34
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,670
I saved your life after all.

35
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,360
You didn't even say thank you.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,160
You saved me?

37
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,630
What did you bring me here for?

38
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,960
I am a Barrier Master.

39
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,240
I know it by a glance

40
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,160
that your vital energy is sealed
by the Barrier within your body.

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,240
Only then could you survive.

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,470
But that's not important.

43
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,080
You probably don't know it yourself

44
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,320
that when your vital energy was sealed,

45
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,910
the Five Elements Essence in your body
was awakened,

46
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,110
which greatly enhanced your abilities.

47
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,160
Didn't you notice?

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,660
Five Elements Essence?

49
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,510
That's right.

50
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,800
It is a very special vital energy

51
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,910
which is transformed
from the five elements.

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,910
It only resides in the body
of the destined one.

53
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,490
It's a rare chance in a millennium.

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,340
And you are

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,320
the destined one.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,800
I didn't expect that when I followed
Han Ziqing and the others to Xiling,

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,470
I would yield such a harvest.

58
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,160
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

59
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,960
Is this why you saved me?

60
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,800
Smart.

61
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,520
You have such a rare body
with Five Elements Essence.

62
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,470
If it can't be properly utilized,

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,470
wouldn't it be a waste?

64
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,000
So you will kill me?

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,720
Silly child, how could I kill you?

66
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,830
To be honest with you,

67
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,110
I was afflicted with a Curse Poison
by the Minister of Nanzhao.

68
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,550
And this Curse Poison

69
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,320
will cause me to lose all my skills

70
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,230
if I don't take the antidote regularly.

71
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,390
But now it's fine.

72
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,070
Your Five Elements Essence

73
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,110
can help me neutralize the poison

74
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,390
and break the shackles.

75
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,230
In your dreams!

76
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,390
Alright.

77
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,040
Don't waste your energy.

78
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,760
You have lost a lot of vital energy.

79
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,160
Without my help,

80
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,600
you won't be able to leave this cave.

81
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,230
Silly child, you can't hurt me.

82
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,160
After all, I am a Barrier Master.

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,920
I can instantly set up a Barrier
on my body.

84
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,440
I am determined
to take your Five Elements Essence.

85
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,320
Do you know why?

86
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,390
Once I have cleaned the Curse Poison
from my body,

87
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,880
I have a monumental work to do.

88
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,920
You are familiar with Han Ziqing,
aren't you?

89
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
What are you going to do?

90
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,350
You do have feelings for her.

91
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,600
Then I must tell you even more.

92
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,790
Once I have
neutralized the Curse Poison,

93
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,920
the first thing I will do

94
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,760
is to use Han Ziqing to create a puppet.

95
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,270
She is the only Islander
on the Longyuan Continent.

96
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,440
She is also the other destined one.

97
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,200
Stay away from her.

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,320
Stay away from her!

99
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,950
It's not up to you.

100
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,790
Xuanyuan Lige,

101
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,760
you better fend for yourself.

102
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,140
Mr. Baili,

103
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,840
thank you for saving me.

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,210
How did you find this place?

105
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,230
It's a piece of cake.

106
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,330
This is the only path
through Wuxie Gorge.

107
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,470
Wuxie Gorge is 10 li away
from Yangshan Mountain.

108
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,600
Meng Wanyue
was carrying the injured Xuanyuan Lige.

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,020
They wouldn't run far.

110
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,700
They must be on this mountain.

111
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,720
His Highness is in great danger now.

112
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,050
I want to find him immediately.

113
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,020
If that old woman

114
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,770
wants to avoid attention,

115
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,070
she must be hiding
in some inconspicuous place.

116
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,160
Let me tell you.

117
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,000
It's just like

118
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,300
that I can sense her demonic aura.

119
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,630
Let's go and take a look.

120
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,650
You brat.

121
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,770
Your Five Elements Essence
has only the last ten percent left.

122
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,170
Once I have absorbed all your essence,

123
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,300
you will be not needed anymore

124
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,450
and you can die in peace.

125
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,930
You brats, do you want to die?

126
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,720
Xuanyuan Lige!

127
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,930
Meng Wanyue, what are you doing?

128
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,920
- Your Highness!
- What have you done to him?

129
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,440
Let go of His Highness.

130
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,960
- Let go of His Highness.
- You brat.

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,280
- Your Highness!
- Let go.

132
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,790
Let me finish my business first,

133
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,740
and I'll deal with you.

134
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,840
Let go, you old hag.

135
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,890
I told you to let go!

136
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,300
Your Highness,

137
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,210
I'm Xiaomeng.

138
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,350
Open your eyes and look at me.

139
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,650
I am Xiaomeng.

140
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,620
Let him go!

141
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,790
Five Elements Essence.

142
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,630
Release him.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,030
You are forcefully activating
the Five Elements Essence

144
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,010
in your body.

145
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,030
Are you

146
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,100
trying to perish with me?

147
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,130
Stop!

148
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,620
Your Highness, Your Highness!

149
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,300
Lige!

150
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,830
No!

151
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,300
Lige!

152
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,600
You...

153
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,210
You lunatic.

154
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,010
Xuanyuan Lige.

155
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,810
Xuanyuan Lige!

156
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,980
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

157
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,880
Your Highness.

158
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,420
Your Highness, bad news.

159
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,540
Princess Qianqian suddenly fainted.

160
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,130
Let's go and check.

161
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,080
Physician Gu,

162
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,680
how is she?

163
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,330
Your Highness,

164
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,470
Princess Qianqian has been depressed
for many days

165
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,640
and hasn't eaten anything.

166
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,010
Her body is extremely weak.

167
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,060
Judging from her pulse,

168
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,980
it is indeed very dangerous.

169
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,230
What should we do?

170
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,940
I have increased her medication.

171
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,010
But whether she can get through this,

172
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,690
will all depend on the next two days.

173
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
Qianqian.

174
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,560
Qianqian.

175
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,620
You must get better.

176
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,570
We still have much work to do.

177
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,240
Qianqian.

178
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,220
Haonan.

179
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,740
Haonan.

180
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,380
Haonan.

181
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,450
Don't go.

182
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,210
Don't leave me alone.

183
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,760
Qianqian.

184
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,760
Ziqing,

185
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,740
I just dreamed of Haonan.

186
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,210
I want to go with him.

187
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,770
But he wouldn't let me.

188
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,330
He walked faster and faster.

189
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,570
I couldn't keep up.

190
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,880
Ziqing,

191
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,300
I am so sad.

192
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,330
- Quickly, give her some borneol.
- Okay.

193
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,030
Princess Qianqian,

194
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,770
your illness is caused by anxiety.

195
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,890
Please take care of yourself.

196
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,910
Qianqian,

197
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,540
don't be sad.

198
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,620
You still have us.

199
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,540
We will all be with you.

200
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,550
You must take good care of yourself.

201
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,650
When you are well,

202
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,570
let's go together to avenge Haonan,

203
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,030
alright?

204
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,240
Lige.

205
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,300
Xiaomeng.

206
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
Xiaomeng,

207
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,280
where is Crown Prince Lige?

208
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,120
Where is Lige?

209
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,200
She...

210
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,100
She killed Crown Prince Lige.

211
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,540
I am going to see him.

212
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,130
What did that woman

213
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,380
do to Lige?

214
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,030
Lige.

215
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,680
Lige.

216
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,100
Lige!

217
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,650
What exactly is going on?

218
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,470
Without my permission,

219
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,570
he led the Sound Strike Army
to attack Xiling,

220
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,450
and got captured

221
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,280
and killed.

222
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,130
Your Majesty,

223
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,330
we must avenge the Crown Prince.

224
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,130
He was taken away
by Jun Beiyue's mother.

225
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,740
But that woman is now dead.

226
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,280
We must

227
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,860
seek revenge on Jun Beiyue.

228
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,000
Your Majesty.

229
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,120
Forget it.

230
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,300
Lige has never listened to me
since he was a child.

231
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,570
It's his own fault

232
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,180
to end up like this.

233
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,100
Your Majesty.

234
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,250
Now, with the strength of Dongling,

235
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,180
how can it oppose Tianque?

236
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,650
Besides,

237
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,010
I have never placed my hope on Lige.

238
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,060
He was just a dying man.

239
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,010
Whether he died earlier

240
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,250
or later,

241
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,060
what difference does it make?

242
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,180
Since he was already dead,

243
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,880
I will announce Yinyue

244
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,420
to be the Crown Princess

245
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,980
and give out the decree tomorrow.

246
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,110
- Dismissed.
- Your Majesty.

247
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,950
Get out.

248
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,890
All of you, get out!

249
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,650
Her Majesty said

250
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,180
that she's busy with state affairs,

251
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,910
and there's no need for you
to pay respects in the coming days.

252
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,280
I need to find her and ask her

253
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,690
- why treat me this way.
- Your Highness.

254
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,420
Her Majesty has an order.

255
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,790
Without permission,

256
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,810
you're not allowed to go out.

257
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,670
Your Highness.

258
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,620
I am a legitimate princess.

259
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,400
Do you take me for a criminal?

260
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,240
Your Highness,

261
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,060
Her Majesty is preparing for
the banquet.

262
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,770
If you rush in now,

263
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,330
you will cause great trouble.

264
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,830
What did you say?

265
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,380
- Your Highness.
- Preparing for the banquet?

266
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,440
What kind of banquet?

267
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,950
Her Majesty plans to announce
Princess Yinyue as the Crown Princess.

268
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,210
Today, a grand banquet is held

269
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,680
to give out the imperial edict.

270
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,470
To announce Yinyue
as the Crown Princess?

271
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,760
Yinyue is still a child.

272
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,980
She is only five years old.

273
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,380
I am her eldest legitimate daughter.

274
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,600
Your Highness.

275
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,300
- I am her eldest legitimate daughter!
- Your Highness.

276
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,280
Your Highness, step back.

277
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,120
Your Highness.

278
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,250
Your Highness.

279
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,300
Now it's different from the time

280
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,810
when you can give any orders.

281
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,230
Your Highness,

282
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,450
Her Majesty has a new heir now.

283
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,140
If you continue to act this way,

284
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,810
your life will be in danger.

285
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,740
I am her eldest legitimate daughter.

286
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,270
Your Highness.

287
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,040
Are you blind?

288
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,140
How dare you to stop me.

289
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
Put it down.

290
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,800
So it's Ms. Qin.

291
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,640
Please calm down.

292
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,570
This is Her Majesty's arrangement.

293
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,500
I dare not disobey.

294
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,570
After all, she is a princess.

295
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,230
Now she has lost her power.

296
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,640
But you treat her like this.

297
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,280
What if she makes a comeback?

298
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,560
How many lives do you have

299
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,810
to ease her anger?

300
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,400
Don't worry.
I'll just go in and say a few words.

301
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I'll leave right after I'm done.

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,450
I won't make things difficult for you.

303
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,690
Ms. Qin, please hurry back.

304
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,440
Close the door.

305
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,110
Your Highness,
instead of being sad here,

306
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,830
why not find a way to save yourself?

307
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,690
Why are you here?

308
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,620
I heard you were grounded.

309
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,260
I came over to take a look.

310
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,660
You are working for my brother.

311
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,690
You have always looked down on me.

312
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,980
Stop pretending to be nice here.

313
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Back then, when you were
going against your brother,

314
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,860
I did hate you.

315
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,690
But now that when I think about it,

316
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,170
such conflicts are also good,

317
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,080
because

318
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,170
it'll never happen again.

319
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,330
What do you mean?

320
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,450
Your brother, he...

321
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,620
What happened to my brother?

322
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,360
He's dead.

323
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,290
What did you say?

324
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,400
Say that again.

325
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,620
He's dead?

326
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,190
Yes.

327
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,290
He died.

328
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,930
No way.

329
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,110
His body has just gotten better.

330
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,040
How could he possibly die?

331
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,040
I also want to ask that question.

332
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,780
His body has gotten a bit better.

333
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,350
He could have lived a bit longer

334
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,140
and inherited the Dongling throne.

335
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,740
How would he die?

336
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,100
Lige.

337
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,330
Oh, Prince Lige.

338
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,530
Lige.

339
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,860
How did he die?

340
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,570
Jun Beiyue's mother killed him.

341
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,170
How could this happen?

342
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,040
I haven't had the chance
to apologize to him yet.

343
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,260
How could this happen?

344
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,620
Do you want to avenge your brother?

345
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,570
All along,

346
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,830
I have always thought

347
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,810
that I was the only candidate
to inherit my mother's throne.

348
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,690
I didn't expect that, like my brother,

349
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,050
I was also a pawn in our mother's game.

350
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,900
It turns out my brother
had seen through it all long ago.

351
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,900
That's why he resisted so much.

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,980
But I have always gone against him.

353
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:57,750
Your brother

354
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,530
was killed by Jun Beiyue's mother.

355
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,050
But that woman is already dead now.

356
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,920
So we must

357
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,690
revenge on Jun Beiyue for this.

358
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,050
And Han Ziqing.

359
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,530
If it weren't
for my brother's deep affection for her,

360
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,900
he wouldn't have ended up
in today's situation.

361
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,230
Ms. Qin,

362
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,280
I want to avenge my brother.

363
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,860
I will make all of them

364
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,930
pay the price.

365
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,710
Ms. Qin, take care.

366
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,810
Thank you.

367
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,720
Stop right there.

368
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,630
Where are you going?

369
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,190
I have something

370
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,470
to entrust Princess Zhaoxi,

371
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,020
so I ask this girl to come with me
to retrieve it.

372
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,520
How about the Princess?

373
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,800
She has slept.

374
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,110
You little rascal,

375
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,860
do you want my money again?

376
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,430
Don't be so greedy,

377
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,260
or I'll report you to your general.

378
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,800
Let's go.

379
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,360
Your Highness,

380
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,170
is there still no news?

381
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,470
Since Mr. Xuanyuan disappeared
in Xiling Royal City,

382
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,800
our people have been unable
to track him down.

383
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,690
I heard that Tianque
is also looking for him.

384
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,310
Your Highness,

385
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,690
Princess Zhaoxi requests an audience.

386
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,570
Xuanyuan Zhaoxi?

387
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,560
Bring her in.

388
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,400
Yes.

389
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,350
Princess Zhaoxi,
why would you visit so late at night?

390
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,570
I don't think it's good.

391
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,980
Consort Qin,

392
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,620
sorry to bother you.

393
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,810
I have something important to tell you.

394
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,310
What is it?

395
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,150
Feel free to speak.

396
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,830
Consort Qin,

397
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,780
I know

398
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,570
that you have a very good relationship
with Crown Prince Lige.

399
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,860
Now, he has met with misfortune.

400
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,900
There are no remains left.

401
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,780
Consort Qin,

402
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,660
please avenge him.

403
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,110
What did you say?

404
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,330
In the battle at Xiling Royal City,

405
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,780
my brother was seriously injured.

406
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,330
He was hunted by Han Ziqing

407
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,930
and went missing.

408
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,510
Later,

409
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,880
Ms. Qin saw

410
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,930
my brother falling from the cliff
of Yangshan Mountain

411
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,290
into Wuxie Gorge.

412
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,380
Your Highness.

413
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,600
Impossible.

414
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,900
No, no.

415
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,320
No.

416
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,780
He can't be dead.

417
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,830
I don't believe it.

418
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,660
It's true, Your Highness.

419
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,170
I saw it with my own eyes.

420
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,450
I don't believe it.

421
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,380
I don't believe it.

422
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,740
It's impossible.

423
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,530
If it weren't for that woman,

424
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,330
Lige wouldn't have died.

425
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,280
It's all that woman's fault.

426
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,500
I hate that woman.

427
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,410
If we want revenge,

428
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,430
we need to come up with a plan

429
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,690
to lure that woman over here.

430
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,050
Princess Zhaoxi, Ms. Qin,

431
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,750
do you know

432
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,760
what method Lige used

433
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,980
to contact that woman?

434
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,510
I know.

435
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,140
Lige used to have a pair
of Sound Transmission Stones.

436
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,020
Later, he gave one to Han Ziqing.

437
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,450
This is the other one.

438
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,260
I gave him the Sound Transmission Stones.

439
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,170
I didn't expect
he would give it to that woman.

440
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,200
Lige,

441
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,690
even if you are dead,

442
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,140
do you still want to hurt me once more?

443
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,020
Consort Qin, don't be sad.

444
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,290
Lihe was just deceived by that woman.

445
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,380
That's why he couldn't see you.

446
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,210
He is already gone.

447
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,450
Please don't blame him.

448
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,620
Why would I blame him?

449
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,210
I'll avenge him first,

450
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,330
and then I don't have a reason to live.

451
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,620
I never expected to see this item again

452
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,810
in such a circumstance.

453
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,620
Han Ziqing,

454
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,860
since you took my item,

455
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,380
just repay me with your life!

456
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,950
Now I can't be sure

457
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,930
if this plan will work.

458
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,210
Let me come up with a foolproof one

459
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,760
to lure Han Ziqing over

460
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,900
and capture her successfully.

461
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,100
You can go back
and wait for my news first.

462
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,810
Thank you, Consort Qin.

463
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,660
Master, you have returned.

464
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,230
During the few days I was away,

465
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,450
is there any news in the palace?

466
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,520
Consort Qin once secretly
sent messages out of the palace.

467
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,810
I've intercepted two of them secretly.

468
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,510
Please take a look.

469
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,820
(Lige, I am very worried about you.
Let's meet at the old place. Qin.)

470
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,930
I didn't expect this woman

471
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,530
actually had an affair
with the Crown Prince of Dongling.

472
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,740
She even sent letters
to ask for a meeting.

473
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,860
The Crown Prince of Dongling

474
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,000
went missing

475
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,700
after he was defeated in Xiling's Royal City,
didn't he?

476
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,780
Your Highness, the Minister has arrived.

477
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,110
What is the Minister doing here?

478
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,160
This is the harem.

479
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,050
Since you know you are in the harem,

480
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,380
you should follow the rules here.

481
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,720
Isn't that right?

482
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,350
What do you mean by this, Minister?

483
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,570
Don't you know

484
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,740
what I mean?

485
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,450
Or are you playing dumb?

486
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,810
Minister, please state your point.

487
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,930
I don't know what you are talking about.

488
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,140
You have betrayed His Majesty.

489
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,800
Do you still want me

490
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,330
to repeat it to you?

491
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,210
I don't.

492
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,800
These are the letters

493
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,590
you wrote to Xuanyuan Lige,
the Crown Prince of Dongling.

494
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,020
Do you still need me to read it to you?

495
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,170
You are supposed to serve His Majesty.

496
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,530
Why are you

497
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,330
thinking about another man?

498
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,500
If His Majesty finds out,

499
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,900
what should you do?

500
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,210
Now that you've known it,

501
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,620
whether it's right or wrong,

502
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,660
I have nothing more to argue.

503
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,050
But I beg you to show mercy.

504
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,660
Give me some time

505
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,570
to kill Han Ziqing.

506
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,410
Once I fulfill this wish,

507
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,570
I will be willing

508
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,740
to do anything for you.

509
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,870
Indeed,

510
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,450
Han Ziqing is an Islander.

511
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,170
As long as she is alive,

512
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,050
His Majesty will always be anxious.

513
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,740
Tell me,

514
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,210
what's your plan?

515
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,210
Nanzhao and Tianque
is in a tense situation.

516
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,380
Han Ziqing must be very vigilant

517
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,100
and would not dare to leave Tianque
even for a moment.

518
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,560
But she will be willing

519
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,600
to take risks for Xuanyuan Lige.

520
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,030
Really?

521
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,280
Previously,

522
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,330
I have sent people
to clean up this place

523
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,740
to wait for Han Ziqing to take the bait.

524
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,170
Now, with your help,

525
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,170
it will be even more foolproof.

526
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,290
Consort Qin,
you truly have a brilliant strategy.

527
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,530
I should have collaborated
with you earlier.

528
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,570
Xuanyuan Lige.

529
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,530
Where exactly are you?

530
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,450
How could you kill Haonan?

531
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,930
Do you even consider me a friend?

532
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,290
This is a pair
of Sound Transmission Stones.

533
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,280
Even if we are thousands of miles apart,

534
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,330
we can still communicate.

535
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,330
You attach this Sound Transmission Stone
to the strings of the guqin.

536
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,020
When you start playing,

537
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,290
even if I'm thousands of miles away,

538
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,560
I can hear the sound of your strings

539
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,860
through this Sound Transmission Stone.

540
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,940
(What's the sound?)

541
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,390
Lige?

542
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,940
Haven't I already brought Xuezheng back?

543
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,470
Your Highness.

544
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,870
Hongyi, you go out first.

545
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,710
Yes.

546
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,290
Ziqing, why are you here?

547
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,320
I think I have news about Xuanyuan Lige.

548
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,160
Where is he?

549
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,140
I don't know yet.

550
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,460
This is the Sound Transmission Stone
that Xuanyuan Lige gave me.

551
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,320
I heard something from it just now.

552
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,840
As long as we follow this sound,

553
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,940
we can find his location.

554
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,290
Let's go to find him.

555
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,800
No way.

556
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,120
You just recovered from your illness.
You can't take risks.

557
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,120
I'll go alone.

558
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,770
No, I want to go with you.

559
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,190
I can't wait to kill that scoundrel
right now.

560
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,030
No way.

561
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,950
The situation is still unclear.

562
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,970
It's better if I go alone.

563
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,420
Ziqing,

564
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,490
are you planning to save him?

565
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,670
I knew it.

566
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,770
You have an unusual relationship
with that scoundrel.

567
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,730
How would you kill him for Haonan?

568
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,490
I have misread you.

569
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,990
Qianqian,

570
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,800
Xuanyuan Lige and I

571
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,900
were master and disciple,
as well as friends.

572
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,840
I must find him first

573
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,220
to find out the truth.

574
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,180
If he really did that,

575
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,090
you can decide
whether to kill or punish him.

576
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,120
Qianqian,

577
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,570
I will make him give you an explanation.

578
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,470
Why not

579
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,970
wait for Fourth Prince to return

580
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,220
and discuss it with him?

581
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,940
Now, Xuezheng is with me.

582
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,530
How did the sound come through?

583
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,770
I'm afraid...

584
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,190
Your Highness.

585
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,030
It should be the place.

586
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,710
Wait here.

587
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,700
- I'll go in and take a look.
- Okay.

588
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,620
Your Highness, be careful.

589
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,700
(It seems to be a Barrier.)

590
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,660
(Are Lige and Meng Wanyue really here?)

591
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,660
So it was you.

592
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,570
Fourth Princess,

593
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,100
you finally arrived.

594
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,560
I have been waiting for you
for a long time.

595
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,420
Where is Xuanyuan Lige?

596
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,080
You're on the brink of death now.

597
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,500
Are you still thinking
about another man?

598
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:55,050
You won't need to play the guqin
anymore.

599
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,120
Your Highness.

600
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,140
Fourth Princess, it's been a while.

601
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,810
You won't be able to leave today.

602
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,730
Fourth Princess,

603
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,140
do you know what this is?

604
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,490
It is the Soul Devouring Ball.

605
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,940
It has been waiting for you
for a long time.

606
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,760
You think you can control me
with a crappy ball?

607
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,600
In your dreams!

608
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,280
- Gu Xi.
- Your Highness.

609
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,120
Why are you here?

610
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,600
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

611
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,490
I failed to protect Fourth Princess.

612
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,920
What happened to her?

613
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,220
She disappeared in a cave
in Yangshan Mountain.

614
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,100
Gu Xi, lead the way.

615
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,640
Let's go.

616
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,120
Is it here?

617
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,120
It's here.

618
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,460
When I woke up, it was already
the next day.

619
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,040
There is nothing left.

620
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,280
I only found

621
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,180
four Nanzhao soldiers' bodies nearby.

622
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,670
It's all my fault.

623
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,510
Back then,

624
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:30,810
I should have stopped Ziqing.

625
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,900
It's all my fault.

626
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,150
Ziqing is a very determined child.

627
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:37,530
You can't stop her.

628
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,570
Alright, stop crying.

629
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,150
Fourth Prince,

630
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,900
we need to quickly find a way
to rescue Ziqing.

631
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,470
Minister?

632
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,670
Yes, it's Minister.

633
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,150
He forced us

634
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,230
to go to Momentary Tower

635
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,840
to look for
some kind of magical artifact

636
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,050
and its instructions.

637
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,510
Magical artifact?

638
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,660
(Ziqing? The Islander?)

639
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,910
(Nanzhao? Human Puppet?)

640
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,180
Beiyue, what's wrong with you?

641
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:13,770
No way.

642
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,730
We must stop Nanzhao's conspiracy.

643
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,670
Alright, count me in.

644
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,000
I want to go with you.

645
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,140
We must rescue Ziqing.

646
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,380
Since we are going to a battle,

647
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,080
count me in.

648
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,080
Let me out.

649
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:48,970
Let me out.

650
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:50,660
(Map)

651
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,050
Everyone,

652
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:08,010
His Majesty has issued a decree

653
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,400
to order me to attack Nanzhao.

654
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,700
This battle is fraught with dangers.
We need to make a meticulous plan.

655
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,850
Your Highness, please rest assured.

656
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,730
Nanzhao has always used the merfolk
to guard the coastline.

657
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,050
Our Golden Merfolk Tribe has declined,

658
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,620
but we are still the royal family
of the merfolk.

659
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,100
The merfolk wouldn't dare to act rashly
when they encounter us.

660
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,990
Just leave them to me.

661
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:25,840
Good.

662
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,710
Shadow.

663
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,550
Yes.

664
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:30,900
Pass down my orders.

665
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:33,180
The Tiger Army
should strengthen their defenses

666
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,940
to ensure the stability
of the northern border.

667
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:37,900
In this way,

668
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,800
we can address our concerns
during wartime.

669
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,640
Yes.

670
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,140
Fourth Prince, I want
to go to the battlefield with you.

671
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:45,710
You can't go.

672
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,190
Ziqing is not here.

673
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,900
I must ensure your safety.

674
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,050
Stay in the mansion.

675
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,050
I will bring her back.
