=Episode 23=

21
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,370
Your Majesty has arrived.

22
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,910
Consort Yun,

23
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,520
you are so beautiful

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,490
and captivating.

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,680
Consort Yun?

26
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,490
This is the title I bestow upon you.

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,850
Didn't you say you long for freedom?

28
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,720
I will grant you the freedom

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,030
like the clouds in the sky.

30
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,870
Is that good?

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,570
Thank you, Your Majesty.

32
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,630
Your Majesty,

33
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,570
you must not break the promise

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,010
you made to me.

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,030
When have I

36
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,370
ever gone back on my word?

37
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,570
After tonight, I will be your consort.

38
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,490
No matter what happens in the future,

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,490
will you always stand by my side?

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,100
Of course.

41
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,710
Come here.

42
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,430
Sit.

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,960
My beloved,

44
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,290
how can you not trust me?

45
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,290
Take Xiling for example,

46
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,420
if I am your support,

47
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,930
why fear Dongling and Tianque?

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,850
Would you be willing

49
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,100
to attack Tianque

50
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,770
and make Jun Beiyue surrender?

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,260
Conquering is a man's duty.

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,700
You just need to be my good consort.

53
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,490
What about Han Ziqing?

54
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,180
How do you plan to deal with her?

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,850
I've promised you.

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,390
As long as we have solid evidence,

57
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,230
I guarantee

58
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,060
she will be exposed.

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,480
Your Highness,

60
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,450
you have been standing here
for four hours.

61
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,770
Four hours?

62
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,370
He should be arriving soon.

63
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,400
Someone!

64
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,510
Close the palace gates
and summon the Ceremonial Officer.

65
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,350
Yes.

66
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,310
Your Highness.

67
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,740
What has happened?

68
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,610
In His Majesty's bridal chamber,
the candles have gone out.

69
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,590
Gone out?

70
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,070
Let's go and check.

71
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,800
Your Majesty,

72
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
according to the temple's rules,

73
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,390
on the wedding night,

74
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,960
if the dragon and phoenix candles
went out,

75
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,370
it is an ominous sign.

76
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,330
We must go to Guyue Cave

77
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,050
to pray for blessings to resolve it.

78
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,230
Hurry and make the arrangements.

79
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,070
Yes.

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,220
I will handle it immediately.

81
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,920
Your Majesty, I never expected

82
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,770
to bring such misfortune to you.

83
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,020
I am ashamed to serve you any longer.

84
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,050
I deserve to die.

85
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,050
Consort Qin has arrived.

86
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,350
Your Majesty,

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,260
I rushed over
as soon as I heard about this.

88
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,700
Are you alright?

89
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,000
Consort Qin, you came at the right time.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,300
I have something to discuss with you.

91
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,370
I have heard the details.

92
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,100
I have an idea.

93
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,740
Go ahead and speak.

94
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,110
Consort Yun has known it all.

95
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,950
She is one of us now.

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,490
Since we are going to Guyue Cave,

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,370
why not test Han Ziqing once more?

98
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,820
Why are you arriving now?

99
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,370
Didn't you just arrive as well?

100
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,100
I have been waiting for you.

101
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,540
But something happened
in His Majesty's bedroom.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,260
So I rushed over to take a look.

103
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
What happened?

104
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,540
The dragon and phoenix candles
suddenly went out.

105
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,860
This is an ominous sign.

106
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,110
Therefore,

107
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,420
tomorrow you will be invited
to Guyue Cave to pray for blessings.

108
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,890
However...

109
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,350
What?

110
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,610
His Majesty plans to deal with
Han Ziqing there.

111
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,450
He intends to make a move
in Guyue Cave?

112
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,540
What will it take for you to speak?

113
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,450
After the blessing ceremony,

114
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,370
could you stay in Nanzhao
for a few more days?

115
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,230
I have a house

116
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,210
outside the Imperial City.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,200
It has been built for a long time.

118
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,260
All the furnishings inside

119
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,740
are arranged as you like.

120
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,580
It's waiting for you to come.

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,120
Alright.

122
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,720
I promise you.

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,740
Since you promised,
don't go back on your word.

124
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Will you speak or not?

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,980
I'll tell you.

126
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,980
Your Highnesses,

127
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,550
the King of Nanzhao

128
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,200
urgently summons you two
to enter the palace.

129
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,190
What is the matter?

130
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,070
Last night,
in the King of Nanzhao's bridal chamber,

131
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,480
the dragon and phoenix candles went out.

132
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,270
The Ceremonial Officer said
this is an ominous sign.

133
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,330
So he invites all the envoys to discuss.

134
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,400
Sir,

135
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,300
under what circumstances

136
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,650
can one go to Guyue Cave?

137
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,690
Well,

138
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,640
to pray for blessings
or to ward off evil,

139
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,990
one can go there during the celebration.

140
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,740
But generally speaking,

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,250
Nanzhao's Guyue Cave is not open
to the public.

142
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,210
Unless...

143
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,680
What?

144
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,350
Unless in the night
of the King's wedding,

145
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,650
the dragon and phoenix candles go out.

146
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,650
According to the rules of Nanzhao,

147
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,110
the dragon and phoenix candles

148
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,670
must remain lit throughout the night.

149
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,250
If they go out before dawn,

150
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,300
it is an ominous sign.

151
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,790
All the guests must go to Guyue Cave

152
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,980
to pray for the newlyweds.

153
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,510
Good idea.

154
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's go.

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,500
Let's go watch the fun.

156
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,400
When the wedding ceremony ended,

157
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,620
I was planning to leave.

158
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,860
Unexpectedly, I couldn't leave.

159
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,060
Do we really have to go to Guyue Cave?

160
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,350
We can go there since it's on the way.

161
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,650
That place rarely opens to the public.

162
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,890
It's a chance to feast our eyes.

163
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,670
- Let's go.
- Alright.

164
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,980
What ominous sign?

165
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,960
I think someone is causing trouble

166
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,450
and trying to make my sister unhappy.

167
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,480
Isn't that right, Fourth Princess?

168
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,940
What are you talking about,
Prince Xiang?

169
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,650
I don't understand you.

170
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,420
Everyone knows you don't get along
with my sister.

171
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,940
It just happened on the wedding day.

172
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,810
Don't you have anything to say?

173
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,420
How would I know
about your sister's matters?

174
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,470
Everyone,

175
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,840
it's regrettable

176
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,680
that this happened.

177
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,320
I have discussed
with the three tribe leaders.

178
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,540
Although Guyue Cave is a forbidden area,

179
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,540
for everyone's safety,

180
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,110
I am willing to make an exception
this time

181
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,250
to lead you
to listen to the divine music

182
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,690
and receive the blessings
of our Earth King

183
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,280
to pray for everyone.

184
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,710
Please go back and rest for a while.

185
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,690
We will depart from the palace gate
at noon.

186
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,880
Your Majesty,

187
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,030
everyone,

188
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,860
the music altar for listening
to the divine music is ahead.

189
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,570
Please stay close to the team.

190
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,330
Do not wander off on your own.

191
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,400
We will split into two groups

192
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,640
at the stone tablet.

193
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,990
Men to the left, and women to the right.

194
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,810
We will meet in front of the altar.

195
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
Everyone,

196
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
please proceed.

197
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,060
(Guyue Cave)

198
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,580
(Music Scores)

199
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,240
(That's right.)

200
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,010
(These are all Lishang's music scores.)

201
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,590
This arrangement is meticulous.

202
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,910
If it turns out that Han Ziqing
has a problem,

203
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,980
Your Majesty can order

204
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,010
to seal off the entire cave immediately.

205
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,540
She won't be able to escape.

206
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,100
The cave is filled with mechanisms.

207
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,650
I have prepared the antidotes

208
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,200
just in case.

209
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,880
(This totem should be related)

210
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,980
(to the one we discovered earlier.)

211
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,330
(But which place does it represent?)

212
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,150
Everyone, look,

213
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,130
there are two paths here.

214
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,200
One is the Vermilion Bird,
and the other is the Black Tortoise.

215
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
From here on,

216
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,500
we must separate by gender.

217
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,440
Your Majesty,

218
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,860
why must we part ways now?

219
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,030
The path to divine enlightenment
must follow the heavenly way.

220
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,660
The Vermilion Bird represents
the Fire God,

221
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,320
while the Black Tortoise represents
the Water God.

222
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,010
Fire is yang, and water is yin.

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,910
Men are yang, and women are yin.

224
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,570
Thus, water and fire cannot coexist,

225
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,570
and yin and yang must not be confused.

226
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,570
So, I hope you will follow the rules
and separate.

227
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,500
But please rest assured.

228
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,910
We will all reunite at the exit.

229
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,750
Please follow me.

230
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,200
Be careful.

231
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,150
See you at the exit.

232
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,380
What is this?

233
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,060
Come and take a look.

234
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,150
What's going on?

235
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,880
- Your Highness.
- Ziqing.

236
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,230
- Your Highness.
- Ziqing, where are you?

237
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,960
- Your Highness.
- Ziqing, help!

238
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,000
Quickly, go tell His Majesty.

239
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Your Highness.

240
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,880
Your Highness!

241
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,740
What are you doing?

242
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,880
What is this place?

243
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,500
Why did you drag me in here?

244
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,200
The lights went out just now,

245
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,380
and someone suddenly pushed me.

246
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,800
Sorry,

247
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,060
I brought you in here.

248
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,320
Open the door!

249
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,640
Open the door!

250
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,000
It's poison gas.

251
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
(Luckily, I took an antidote
beforehand,)

252
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,300
(or I would have died with her.)

253
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,680
Han Ziqing.

254
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,540
How could anything happen to you?

255
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,300
You better not die now.

256
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,210
You pushed me just now, right?

257
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,350
I'm telling you.

258
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,300
I will come for you even as a ghost.

259
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,620
Han Ziqing.

260
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,320
Han Ziqing.

261
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,320
Han Ziqing, you can't die.

262
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,840
You can't just die like this.

263
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,680
Wake up.

264
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,230
Open the door.

265
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,790
Someone, someone!

266
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,930
Han Ziqing has died.

267
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,510
Ziqing.

268
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,110
Ziqing.

269
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,140
Your Highness, leave quickly.
There's poison gas.

270
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,800
Let's go.

271
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,320
Fourth Prince,

272
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,380
all these mechanisms are for defense.

273
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,190
Fourth Princess suddenly barged in.

274
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,140
We didn't expect it.

275
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,280
Fortunately, the time was short,
and it was not fatal.

276
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,340
I'll find an imperial physician
to check on Fourth Princess.

277
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,400
She will recover soon.

278
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,980
King of Nanzhao, you just speak so.

279
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,000
Ever since we came to Nanzhao,

280
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
Fourth Princess has been in danger
for multiple times.

281
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,440
If it happened once,
it could be a coincidence.

282
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,270
But this is the third time.

283
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,170
How do you explain this?

284
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,520
Fourth Prince, don't be angry.

285
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,590
This happened suddenly.

286
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,660
We didn't know either.

287
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,680
Where is the Imperial Physician?

288
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,990
Physician!

289
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,960
No need.

290
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,140
I don't trust you.

291
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,950
Fourth Prince.

292
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,790
Fourth Prince!

293
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,800
What's going on?

294
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,260
Didn't you say it wasn't fatal?

295
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,260
Why is it so serious?

296
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,740
Chief Yao said it wouldn't be fatal.

297
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,740
Look at you two, so clumsy.

298
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,150
You just caused all the trouble.

299
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:36,310
Beiyue,

300
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,760
how was my acting just now?

301
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,640
I spat in Chu Feiyan's face.

302
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,610
Luckily, you arrived early.

303
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,510
- Otherwise, I would have...
- Shh.

304
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,450
Your acting was good.

305
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,530
But the King of Nanzhao
is too suspicious.

306
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,430
We still need to be careful

307
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,370
and leave as soon as possible.

308
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,620
Let's pack up.

309
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,480
We'll set off tomorrow.

310
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,800
Alright.

311
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,830
You are such a good actor.

312
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,780
You too.

313
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,590
- Really?
- Yes.

314
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,780
Your anger was so real.

315
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,020
I was genuinely worried about you.

316
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,680
Your Highness, it's too hot.

317
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,050
I'll make you some iced tea
when we get back.

318
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,200
You go back first.

319
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,600
Thank you.

320
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,170
You came all the way here

321
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,110
to say these two words?

322
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,470
You helped me.

323
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:46,170
I should say thank you, right?

324
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,170
How do you know their plan?

325
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,900
You don't need to know.

326
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,390
It is

327
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,780
not worth mentioning.

328
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,110
Forget it.

329
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,210
Today, in Guyue Cave,

330
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,810
the divine music is a new tune
of Lishang.

331
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,680
I also saw the music scores

332
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,830
on the wall of the women's passage.

333
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,020
Do you remember it all?

334
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,030
Of course.

335
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,320
That's great.

336
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,870
Pick one

337
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,910
and I'll give it to you.

338
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,030
What is this?

339
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,350
This is a pair
of Sound Transmission Stone.

340
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,980
Even if we are thousands of miles apart,
we can still communicate.

341
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,260
It's just like a mobile phone.

342
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,020
A mobile phone?

343
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,150
How can I use it?

344
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,660
You attach this Sound Transmission Stone
to the strings of the guqin.

345
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,930
When you start playing,

346
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,350
even if I'm thousands of miles away,

347
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,980
I can hear the sound of your strings.

348
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,620
So if you have any questions
while practicing the guqin,

349
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,530
you can use the Sound Transmission Stone

350
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,870
to ask me anytime.

351
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you willing
to give such a precious gift to me?

352
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,140
The better the thing is,

353
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,150
the more it should be given
to someone worthy.

354
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,990
Thanks.

355
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:35,400
Qianqian,

356
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,880
your ways of talking are so interesting.

357
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,800
How about

358
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,640
going to Tianque with me?

359
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,810
What are you eavesdropping on?

360
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,350
Jun Beiyue,

361
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,500
what's going on with Han Ziqing?

362
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,000
What about her?

363
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,920
She has such a good relationship
with Nangong Qianqian.

364
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,150
Does she really consider her a friend?

365
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,660
It is none of your business.

366
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,200
You...

367
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,630
You guys are here.

368
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Just in time. I'm about
to go back to Tieyan.

369
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,830
I came to say goodbye.

370
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,670
Qianqian,

371
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,660
have you been to Tianque?

372
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,830
Ziqing just invited me to go.

373
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,160
Maybe another time.

374
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,350
Father is waiting for me to return.

375
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,380
I also welcome you to come.

376
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,020
The sooner the better.

377
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,360
Alright.

378
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,260
I won't disturb you.

379
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,100
Take your time.

380
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,220
Wait.

381
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,460
Wait a moment.

382
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,740
What's the matter?

383
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
Nothing.

384
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,780
I have figured it out.

385
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,660
It's just a marriage alliance.

386
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,900
Tieyan and Xiling's marriage alliance

387
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,940
was decided long ago.

388
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,980
It's also my mission as a princess.

389
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,700
However,

390
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,980
if you are willing to invite me
to Jian'an City for a visit,

391
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,180
I might consider eloping.

392
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,020
No, no.

393
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,260
You better hurry back to Tieyan.

394
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,300
I dare not provoke you.

395
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,420
Look how scared you are.

396
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
Don't worry.

397
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,300
I won't bother you anymore.

398
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,860
Wait a minute.

399
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,820
Have you changed your mind?

400
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,540
I should

401
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,900
return it to you,

402
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,740
so you won't blame me

403
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,580
if you can't get married.

404
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,060
Your Majesty, Consort Yun is here.

405
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,580
Send her back.

406
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,380
I don't need her to serve me.

407
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Yes.

408
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,940
Greetings, Your Majesty

409
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,220
and Consort Qin.

410
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,860
Consort Yun,

411
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,420
you are so rude.

412
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,060
His Majesty hasn't summoned you.

413
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,220
How can you enter the hall
without permission?

414
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,900
I have something to talk to His Majesty.

415
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,860
You messed up the task.

416
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,140
What else is there to say?

417
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,940
Can't you see

418
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,990
that Han Ziqing dragged me
into the mechanism deliberately

419
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,100
and tried to frame me?

420
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,740
Please believe me, Your Majesty.

421
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,260
Consort Yun,

422
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,220
don't speak recklessly without evidence.

423
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,380
Be careful not to bring trouble
upon yourself.

424
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,900
Your Majesty.

425
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
You should go back.

426
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,850
Your Majesty, Fourth Prince
has sent a message

427
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,160
saying Fourth Princess is seriously ill,

428
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,420
and they need to return to Tianque
for treatment as soon as possible.

429
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,290
They are departing today.

430
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,820
Given the current situation,

431
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,940
we can't do anything about them.

432
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,740
Let them leave if they want to.

433
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,380
We'll discuss other matters later.

434
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,300
Yes.

435
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,660
Your Highness,

436
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,220
this was sent by Consort Qin.

437
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,020
She said it was a pattern
from Guyue Cave.

438
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,260
I think I've seen this pattern before.

439
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
What is this?

440
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
This is a totem.

441
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,940
Indeed, I have seen it before.

442
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,260
Where have you seen it?

443
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,100
What does this totem represent?

444
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,940
I can't remember it for the moment.

445
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,100
But I have seen it indeed.

446
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:22,380
It should have been a long time ago.

447
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,220
How long ago?

448
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,180
It was when I was
still by Her Majesty's side.

449
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,660
I remember now.

450
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,620
It was at Mingsha Mountain.

451
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,700
Mingsha Mountain?

452
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,340
Yes, it was Mingsha Mountain.

453
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,420
Back then, when I was
running an errand for Her Majesty,

454
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,380
I went to Mingsha Mountain.

455
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,780
I stayed in a temple at Mingsha Mountain
for three days and three nights.

456
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,900
I won't remember it wrong.

457
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,900
Your Highness,

458
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,460
Princess Zhaoxi has already returned.

459
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,060
You should also return
as soon as possible.

460
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,900
Her Majesty is getting old,

461
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,020
and she is easily influenced.

462
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,620
If Princess Zhaoxi continues
to sow discord,

463
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,980
Her Majesty will punish you again.

464
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,380
Do you want me to be like Zhaoxi,

465
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,060
and also try to please my mother?

466
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,780
If I were like Zhaoxi,

467
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,060
Dongling

468
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,980
would be hopeless.

469
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,500
Zhaoxi is ruthless enough,

470
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,620
but her talents are limited.

471
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,260
The future of the Dongling Royal Family

472
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,900
rests on you, Your Highness.

473
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,300
Even if you all say so,

474
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,700
everyone knows

475
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,260
that I won't

476
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,420
live a long life.

477
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,500
The future of Dongling

478
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,500
does not rest on me.

479
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,740
It's just that the path to the future

480
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,180
needs to be paved by me.

481
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,860
- Your Highness...
- Enough.

482
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,340
About this matter,

483
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,420
I have no complaints.

484
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,260
Your Highness,

485
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,540
how has your health been recently?

486
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,780
How else could it be?

487
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,580
It's just the same as always.

488
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,940
If only we could find a good doctor...

489
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,180
If my time is up,

490
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,620
even an immortal won't help.

491
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,940
If my time is not up,

492
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,100
the things that need to be done

493
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,180
must all be done.

494
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,900
Ms. Qin,

495
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,940
you don't need to worry about this.

496
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,380
Greetings,

497
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,540
Your Majesty.

498
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,540
I previously suspected
that the Fourth Princess of Tianque

499
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,420
had a special identity,

500
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,700
but after several tests,

501
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,580
I found that this woman
is not immune to all poisons.

502
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,990
She should have nothing to do
with the Isolated Island.

503
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,380
Your Majesty, have you forgotten?

504
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,180
Besides the trait of being immune
to all poisons,

505
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,060
every Islander has a special mark

506
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,660
on their face.

507
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,940
But there is no such mark
on Han Ziqing's face.

508
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,580
Your Majesty,

509
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,620
even if she is an Islander,

510
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,780
she wouldn't openly expose the mark

511
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,340
on her face.

512
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,780
Although the mark is special,

513
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,660
it is not impossible

514
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,860
to hide it from others.

515
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,540
Jun Beiyue just set off for Tianque.

516
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,180
He should still be
within the borders of Nanzhao.

517
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,340
Send someone to investigate again.

518
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:26,980
Your Majesty,

519
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,980
the previous action
might have alerted them.

520
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,900
It would be better to wait
until they lower their guard,

521
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,060
and then act at the right moment.

522
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,180
Is the woman who escaped
from the Isolated Island

523
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,140
really dead?

524
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,140
The people we sent out earlier

525
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,780
reported that they had killed her,

526
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,420
but they didn't bring back the body.

527
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,300
So it's hard to be completely sure.

528
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,220
But even if she isn't dead,

529
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,820
her age is so different

530
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,140
from Han Ziqingi's.

531
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,820
Even so,

532
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,220
there is still one possibility.

533
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,660
What is it?

534
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,180
What if that woman has offspring?

535
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,780
The Islanders are a threat to Nanzhao,

536
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,060
and even more so to Longyuan Continent.

537
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,940
We must be careful.

538
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,140
You may leave.

539
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,420
Yes.

540
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,660
His Majesty has summoned Consort Yun
to go there immediately.

541
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,620
Your Highness, it's time
to attend to your duties.

542
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,460
I won't go.

543
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,460
I said I won't go.

544
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,300
His Majesty has sent people
to urge you three or four times.

545
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,660
If you don't go, it might displease him.

546
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,780
Earlier they wanted me to leave,
and now they want me to come back.

547
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,620
When something happens,
they immediately cast me aside.

548
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,860
What exactly do they want?

549
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,340
Your Highness, keep your voice down.

550
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,540
Be careful, walls have ears.

551
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,900
I need to speak it out.

552
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,260
I need to speak it out.

553
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,020
- Your Highness.
- I need to speak it out.

554
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,220
Let's see what they can do to me.

555
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,340
Your Highness,

556
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,340
this is Nanzhao,

557
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,700
not Xiling.

558
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,300
Your Highness,
you shouldn't be so willful.

559
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,660
If you truly anger His Majesty,

560
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,180
it could bring great disaster.

561
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,660
Your Highness,

562
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,740
even for the sake of Xiling,

563
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,580
you should...

564
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,940
Your Highness.

565
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,620
Let's go.

566
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,660
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

567
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,220
I will go right away.

568
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,860
I will write a letter
to my elder sister.

569
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,900
Once Han Ziqing returns to Tianque,

570
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,340
she will find a way

571
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,380
to check if she has a totem mark
on her face.

572
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,100
If she does,

573
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,220
my sister will arrange to capture her

574
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,980
and secretly send her to Nanzhao.

575
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,300
It needs careful planning.

576
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:07,940
There must be no more mistakes.

577
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,260
I do not wish to become enemies
with Jun Beiyue right now.

578
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,100
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

579
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,860
My sister will handle this

580
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,260
and cooperate with us in secret.

581
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,100
Even if Jun Beiyue suspects us,

582
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,460
there will be no evidence.

583
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,980
Does she have any requirements

584
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,920
for helping us?

585
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,940
My sister has no other wishes,

586
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,940
except for her only son, Jun Beichen,
who is her dearest.

587
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,900
As long as you can support Beichen

588
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,340
to ascend the throne in the future.

589
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,140
If she can truly help me,

590
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,380
I will fulfill her wish.

591
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,180
Then I will thank you

592
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,220

Hongyi,

621
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,460
- did you miss me?
- Yes.

622
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,380
I think about you every day

623
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,990
and I wonder what you will eat,
you little glutton.

624
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,460

625
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,620

627
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,460
I finally get to see you again.

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,220

629
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,260
You two chat slowly.

630
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,100
I'll head back first.

631
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,220
When did you arrive?

632
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,260
Did Father and Mother know?

633
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,020
Father and Mother knew
I came to find Brother Beiyue.

634
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,140
They were completely at ease.

635
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,300
Don't worry about me.

636
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,660
Brother Beiyue,

637
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,860
I just arrived today.

638
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,980
What delicious food
are you planning to take me to eat?

639
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,100
You're so grown up now,

640
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,280
but still thinking about food?

641
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,820
Stop fooling around.

642
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,380
We just got back and need to rest.

643
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,220
Your Highness,

644
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,700
greetings.

645
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,620
What's the matter?

646
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,420
His Majesty heard you have returned

647
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,300
and specially arranged
a welcome banquet at the palace.

648
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,700
Please attend the banquet tomorrow.

649
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,620
There's a palace banquet?

650
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,460
Great, I want to go too.

651
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,100
What do you mean to go?

652
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,540
The palace is not a place
you can go casually.

653
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,380
Her Majesty heard that Mr. Situ

654
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:48,380
returned with Fourth Prince

655
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,580
and specially instructed me

656
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,980
to invite Mr. Situ and Miss Situ
to attend together.

657
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,820
I knew it.

658
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,820
Her Majesty always cares for me.

659
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,700
Got it.

660
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,220
Tomorrow

661
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,740
we will go there on time.

662
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,860
I take my leave now.

663
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,060
Brother Beiyue,

664
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,740
since we are going
to the banquet together,

665
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,380
why not let me stay
at your place tonight

666
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,340
so that we can go together tomorrow?

667
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,940
Alright.

668
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,580
You two can stay at my mansion today.

669
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,540
But remember to keep an eye on her.

670
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,220
Don't let her run around.

671
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,540
I understand.

672
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,620
Please follow me, both of you.

673
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,380
Stop.

674
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,660
Stop right there, Hongyi.

675
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,180

00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,540
Cheers.

744
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

745
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,620
Xin'er.

746
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,660
Your Majesty, today is truly lively.

747
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,620
I want to make a toast to you.

748
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,980
May you have good health.

749
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,540
Xin'er always knows what to say.

750
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,380
Come on.

751
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,980
Xin'er, come here.

752
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,660
Sit down quickly.

753
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,020
Your Majesty.

754
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,820
You have become even more beautiful
these past few days.

755
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,500
I missed you so much, Your Majesty.

756
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,300
Cheers.

757
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,460
Xin'er is always so obedient.

758
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,860
Xin'er.

759
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,180
Come on. Cheers.

760
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,740
Brother Beichen.

761
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,220
Yesterday at the Mansion
of Fourth Prince,

762
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,740
Han Ziqing didn't treat you well,
did she?

763
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,580
I didn't bother with her.

764
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,460
Anyway, Brother Beiyue
still supports me.

765
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,380
You can't say that.

766
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,780
After all, they are married.

767
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,420
Listen to me.

768
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,580
You should go and give her a toast

769
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,940
to make peace with her.

770
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,140
What a good thing it is.

771
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,260
- Yes.
- Give her a toast?

772
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,500
She isn't even worthy to carry my shoes.

773
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,900
That's not right.

774
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,460
Everyone knows

775
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,980
you don't like Han Ziqing.

776
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,900
But you can't disrespect
your Brother Beiyue.

777
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:31,740
He is caught in the middle
and it's difficult for him.

778
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,580
Yes.

779
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,020
Eat more.

780
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,580
Let's forget it.

781
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,620
Even if I offer a toast to her,

782
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,460
she might not drink it.

783
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,300
You are still acting like a child.

784
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,940
That is your courtesy.

785
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,780
If she doesn't accept it,

786
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,100
she is the one being rude.

787
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,620
- Yes, indeed.
- Moreover,

788
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,580
if you go to make peace,

789
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,300
Beiyue will see it.

790
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,780
How could he
not understand your intentions?
