Move your foot.

22
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,720
- Move it away.
- Will you talk or not?

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Move your foot. I'll talk.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't you want to see Prince An?

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,770
I've been watching you in the tree
for a long time.

26
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,510
Move your foot first.

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,800
I'll take you to see Prince An. Alright?

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,640
Hurry up.

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,760
You take me to see Prince An?

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,120
Get up.

31
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,910
It hurts so much.

32
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,360
You are such a fierce woman.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
How are we going to see Prince An?

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm a veterinarian.

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,630
I cured his mules and horses.

36
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,880
He owes me a big favor.

37
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,830
It's not difficult to see him.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,360
But Prince An has long secluded himself.

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,990
It's very difficult for you to see him.

40
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,870
But I have a way.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
What is it?

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,720
We need to make a deal first.

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,640
What kind of deal?

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,000
Didn't you capture a child last night?

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,080
How do you know?

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,030
Are you his accomplice?

47
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,680
What accomplice?

48
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,390
My junior and I are neither traitors
nor thieves.

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,520
How can you call us accomplices?

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,520
We are educated, you know?

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,550
He just had an itch for a moment

52
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,750
and wanted to steal some jewelry.

53
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,550
The child is ignorant.

54
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,880
Don't be so tough on him.

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,750
Just let him go.

56
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,470
Anyway, you have no other way now.

57
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,470
You can't see Prince An either.

58
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,440
Why not give it a try?
Maybe you'll see him, right?

59
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,800
Just say what you have to say.

60
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
If you keep this up, I'll kill you.

61
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,160
You can't even speak fluently.

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,630
You little girl.

63
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,670
Stop chattering away.

64
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,970
You can't kill me with your lousy skills.

65
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,770
Stop talking nonsense.

66
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,240
How can I see Prince An?

67
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,320
Release my junior,
and I'll take you to see him.

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,160
Alright.

69
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
I'll make this deal.

70
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,320
I'll release your junior.

71
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
You take me to see Prince An.

72
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,270
But this girl can't come.

73
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,320
Prince An likes peace and quiet.

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
This little girl is chattering away.

75
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,190
If she annoys Prince An,

76
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,470
he definitely won't see you.

77
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,510
I can only help you this far.

78
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,160
Ten, you should go back first.

79
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,750
Ma'am, but he, he...

80
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,190
Don't worry. He can't hurt me.

81
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,320
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait a moment.

82
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,160
My stick.

83
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,470
You're trouble.

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,550
Han Ziqing.

85
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,110
When Prince An comes out of seclusion,

86
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,000
what are your plans next?

87
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,880
Don't call me by my name.

88
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,910
Are we that familiar?

89
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,800
Aren't names meant to be called?

90
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,110
Then I'll call you Ziqing.

91
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,950
Shut up.

92
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,470
Why are you so fierce?

93
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,110
After all, I'm helping you.

94
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,110
I don't mind if you don't pay me.

95
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,080
At least be polite.

96
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,910
Why do you talk so much?

97
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,990
Are you really a veterinarian?

98
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,110
Of course I am.

99
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,600
I'm a righteous man

100
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,440
and the best veterinarian
on Longyuan Continent.

101
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,000
Little brother.

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,230
Didn't I tell you the person
you're looking for isn't here?

103
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,070
Why are you still here?

104
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,910
Do you recognize this?

105
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,790
Give this to your master.

106
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,560
Wait a moment.

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,230
It seems you really have some connection
with Prince An.

108
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,070
Without some skills,

109
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,230
how dare I make a deal with you,
Fourth Princess?

110
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,160
Will that thing of yours work?

111
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,880
In the world of martial arts,

112
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,920
every one of us

113
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,350
has our unique skills.

114
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,950
Fourth Princess, don't you know?

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Please come in.

116
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,510
I can only help you this far.

117
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,510
The rest depends on your luck.

118
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,910
Thanks.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,840
Go in.

120
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,320
Where is he?

121
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
What's your name?

122
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,510
I'm Baili Weisheng.

123
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,390
Ziqing,

124
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,670
don't forget our deal.

125
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,720
When you're back, release my junior.

126
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,440
If he doesn't come back,

127
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,550
I'll go to you.

128
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,110
He's really strange.

129
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,440
Let's go.

130
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,550
Sir,

131
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,600
the guest is here.

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,440
Got it.

133
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,790
I'm Han Ziqing from Tianque.
Nice to meet you, Prince An.

134
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,040
I have been hiding in this secluded place

135
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,200
for some peace and quiet.

136
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,440
But there are always those
with extraordinary abilities

137
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,640
who can find me.

138
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm sorry

139
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
for disturbing you.

140
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,550
Do you know Baili Weisheng?

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,760
I met him by chance on the road.

142
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,110
He said he could help me meet you.

143
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,270
So I followed him here.

144
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,670
This young man casually used me as a favor.

145
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,720
Had I known,
I wouldn't have promised him anything.

146
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,440
Prince An, I...

147
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,040
You should go back.

148
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I have not concerned myself

149
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,670
with worldly matters for many years.

150
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,160
No matter what your request is,

151
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,510
I'm unable to help.

152
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,560
Prince An.

153
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,790
Prince An.

154
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,070
For the sake of the people of Tianque,

155
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,320
please come out of seclusion to help.

156
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,480
Why do you insist on this?

157
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,350
Get up quickly.

158
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,350
If you do not agree,

159
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,600
I won't get up.

160
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,230
Do you think that by being unreasonable,

161
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,510
I will agree to help you?

162
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,040
I know

163
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,950
although you have lived in seclusion
for many years,

164
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,810
you still care deeply about the people
of Tianque.

165
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
If it weren't for desperation,

166
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,040
I would not have sought your help.

167
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Prince, you are wise and just.

168
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,720
Please listen to my reasons.

169
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,440
Alright.

170
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,760
Then I will listen.

171
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,200
What are your reasons?

172
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,000
Prince,

173
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,320
please help Jun Beiyue.

174
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,790
Beiyue?

175
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,160
First, tell me.

176
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
How is Beiyue's wound?

177
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,100
It has affected his heart meridian.

178
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,760
He has not woken up yet.

179
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,880
I am a bit worried

180
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,720
and want to go see him.

181
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,190
Alright.

182
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,950
Before Beiyue fell unconscious,
his greatest concern

183
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,040
was the people of Tianque.

184
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,280
Prince,

185
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,440
please, for Beiyue's dedication to Tianque,

186
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,640
come out of seclusion to guard

187
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,830
and manage military affairs.

188
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,920
I'll be immensely grateful.

189
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,280
The people of Tianque will not forget you.

190
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,670
For the sake of your and Beiyue's loyalty

191
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,670
to Tianque,

192
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,880
I agree to guard the Royal City.

193
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,760
Remember, for one month only.

194
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,440
Not a day more.

195
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,390
Alright.

196
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,310
Thank you, Prince.

197
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,600
Mr. Gu.

198
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,000
What is it?

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,150
My Master has invited a physician
from the foot of the mountain

200
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,000
to prescribe this.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,550
We would like you to take a look at it.

202
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,150
We will fetch the usable medicine.

203
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,590
They are all nourishing medicines.

204
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,230
Send my gratitude to Master Lu.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
Shadow,

206
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,160
go with him.

207
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
Alright.

208
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,800
Mr. Gu.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,030
Coming.

210
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,550
- What is it?
- Miss Suying is here.

211
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,920
Hi, Miss Suying.

212
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,390
Mr. Gu,

213
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,790
I have recently acquired some ginseng.

214
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,030
But I'm unsure of their quality and age.

215
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,440
I would like you to take a look.

216
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,230
If these are indeed centennial ginseng,

217
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,280
I plan to use them to make soup for my parents.

218
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,350
It would be good for their health.

219
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,000
Please take a look, sir.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,880
Alright.

221
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,720
Alright.

222
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,880
This ginseng is of good quality.

223
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,840
However, it has been stored for too long.

224
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,280
Its roots have already weathered.

225
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,480
It has lost its medicinal properties.

226
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,550
They charged me quite a fortune for it.

227
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,030
It's alright, sir.

228
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,280
Please take a look at another one for me.

229
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,120
Alright.

230
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,960
This is an excellent piece.

231
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,240
But Miss Suying,

232
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,790
unless absolutely necessary,

233
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,550
do not use it.

234
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,840
I understand, sir.

235
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
I've learned a lot.

236
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,960
It's getting late.

237
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,110
I won't disturb you any longer.

238
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,720
Let's go.

239
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,990
Alright.

240
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,280
Miss Suying, take care.

241
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,720
Shadow.

242
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,110
How is His Highness?

243
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,950
He's fine.

244
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,120
Shadow.

245
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,320
- What's wrong?
- Quickly, bring Master Lu here.

246
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
Alright.

247
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,000
What's going on?

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How could this happen?

249
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,680
Master Lu.

250
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,990
His Highness's pulse is in chaos.

251
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,080
It seems his blood flow is reversed.

252
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,710
If we don't use internal arts to suppress it,

253
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,230
the blood flow could damage his brain.

254
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,880
The consequences would be unimaginable.

255
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,840
Where is Jiang Chen?
Quickly, find Jiang Chen.

256
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,400
There's no time.

257
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,470
I'll do it.

258
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,550
Honey, you mustn't.

259
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,670
Honey, your body is too weak.

260
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,510
If something happens...

261
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,880
- No, you can't.
- This is too risky.

262
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,350
Quickly, help him up.

263
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,950
Shadow.

264
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,840
- Honey.
- Mrs. Lu.

265
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,030
Honey.

266
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,870
Honey.

267
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,360
Quick, let me take a look.

268
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,920
How is my wife?

269
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,200
Mrs. Lu has injured her vitality.

270
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,640
She needs to rest and recuperate.

271
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,480
Goodness.

272
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,720
Master Lu,

273
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,710
I thank you on behalf of His Highness
for your kindness.

274
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,430
Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

275
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,440
Mr. Gu, please get up.

276
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,080
As long as Nianbei is safe, it's good.

277
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,080
Take good care of him.

278
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,280
Then we will take our leave first.

279
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,750
Alright.

280
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,750
Honey.

281
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,280
Alright.

282
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,200
Old Gu.

283
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,720
Be careful.

284
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,710
Slowly.

285
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,470
Mrs. and Mr. Lu

286
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,520
are truly kind to His Highness.

287
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,100
Indeed.

288
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,230
But why do I feel something is off?

289
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,390
What's off?

290
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,440
Yesterday, His Highness' pulse was stable.

291
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,280
Why is it...

292
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,870
You mean...

293
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,470
It might not be safe to stay here anymore.

294
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,880
We need to wake up His Highness quickly.

295
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,640
You've been training for three months.

296
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,350
Today we will assess your achievement.

297
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,320
Let's start.

298
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,160
Yes.

299
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,630
Good, stop.

300
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,280
Very good.

301
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,030
From today, you're guards in the mansion.

302
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,350
You'll serve me.

303
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,000
Gu Xi will be your leader.

304
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,150
You must obey him.

305
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,800
Yes.

306
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,550
Ten.

307
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,000
Send a few maids

308
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,710
to take care of their daily needs.

309
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,200
Yes, Your Highness.

310
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,590
Good for you, Ziqing.

311
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,440
I didn't expect you to have your own men.

312
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,070
Don't move.

313
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,600
Stingy.

314
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,590
Can I join them?

315
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,590
- No.
- Why?

316
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,430
You are not worthy.

317
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,670
Am I not even as good as these boys?

318
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
Just kidding.

319
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,240
Just kidding.

320
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,110
Don't take it seriously.

321
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,950
At ease.

322
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,480
Haonan,

323
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,710
you come from a martial family

324
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,710
and possess great mastery.

325
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,640
Would you be willing to teach them a bit?

326
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,040
Sure.

327
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,110
Boys,

328
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,320
do you want to learn from me?

329
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,590
Call him Master.

330
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,550
Master.

331
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,390
Louder.

332
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,840
Master!

333
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:41,430
Good.

334
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,900
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

335
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,600
Princess!

336
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:54,950
Princess!

337
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,280
- Princess!
- What's wrong?

338
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,870
The King's Imperial Carriage has already
arrived at the gate of the Mansion.

339
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,110
They just won't give up, huh?

340
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,950
Let's go and receive them.

341
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,400
Slow down.

342
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,350
His Majesty the King!

343
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,990
I didn't know Your Majesty was coming

344
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,330
and failed to welcome you earlier.

345
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Greetings.

346
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:25,520
I have been in the Palace all day,

347
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,470
waiting for news of Beiyue's recovery.

348
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,950
But your mansion is like a fortress.

349
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,830
Not a single word gets out.

350
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,280
I'm concerned about Beiyue,

351
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,950
so I came personally.

352
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,400
Your Majesty,

353
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,880
the prince needs to rest quietly.

354
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,430
When he's better, we'll let Your Majesty know.

355
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,760
Han Ziqing,

356
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,430
don't deceive me.

357
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,070
How is Beiyue today?

358
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,280
I must see him with my own eyes.

359
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,120
Your Majesty,

360
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,760
please stay here.

361
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,760
I'll see who dares to stop me.

362
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,430
My brother.

363
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,520
Brother,

364
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,160
long time no see.

365
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,830
Why are you still so impatient?

366
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,880
Brother,

367
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,830
what are you doing here?

368
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,470
I heard Beiyue was ill.

369
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,590
I was worried.

370
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,590
So I came back to check on him.

371
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,880
Shortly after I arrived,

372
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,040
I heard you making a fuss here.

373
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,350
Brother, it's a misunderstanding.

374
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,470
I'm also worried about Beiyue's condition,

375
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,640
so I was a bit anxious.

376
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
Beiyue is fine,

377
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,400
but he needs to rest quietly.

378
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,070
I heard that in the Judicial Office,

379
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,710
there was some misunderstanding
between you and your son.

380
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,190
Well,

381
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,160
there was indeed a small misunderstanding.

382
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,190
If it's just a misunderstanding,

383
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,310
once Beiyue recovers, you can resolve it.

384
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,280
However, in the current condition,

385
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,710
Beiyue does require quiet rest.

386
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,680
You'd better not meet with him now

387
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,710
so as not to trouble his mind.

388
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Don't you think so?

389
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,720
Brother,

390
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,760
we haven't seen each other for many years.

391
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,430
Look, come to the Palace with me now

392
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,400
and stay for a few more days.

393
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,160
I won't go to your palace.

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,280
I will stay at this mansion.

395
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,110
In this mansion?

396
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,400
I forgot to tell you.

397
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,120
Starting today,

398
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,640
I'll focus on taking care of the prince.

399
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
All the household affairs

400
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,280
will be handled by Prince An.

401
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,400
Prince An has been in seclusion for many years.

402
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,190
It's amazing that you can

403
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,070
invite him out of seclusion.

404
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,520
That's truly astonishing.

405
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,430
You flatter me.

406
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,710
If I don't come out of seclusion,

407
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,830
should I just watch Tianque fall into chaos

408
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,470
without anyone to attend to?

409
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Brother,

410
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,430
are you saying

411
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,520
that I'm incapable of governing the country?

412
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,560
Brother,

413
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,110
do you think I didn't compete with you

414
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,110
for the throne because I was inferior to you?

415
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,640
I just wanted to stay away from politics

416
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,880
and enjoy my life.

417
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,720
But unfortunately,

418
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,560
fate has its own plans for us.

419
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,110
I truly can't bear to see

420
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,430
the kingdom our ancestors
worked so hard to build

421
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,160
destroyed in your hands.

422
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,430
Alright.

423
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,160
His Majesty was just joking.

424
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,190
Why take it so seriously, Prince An?

425
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,920
You're brothers.

426
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,280
Let's not hurt our harmony.

427
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,000
Look,

428
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,830
my brother still has the same temper as before.

429
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,640
Brother, with you overseeing this mansion

430
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,160
and all household affairs managed,

431
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,760
I couldn't be happier.

432
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,480
Brother,

433
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,400
don't be angry.

434
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
How about this?

435
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,640
Let's go to the palace now and have a feast.

436
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,000
We'll have a few drinks together.

437
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,160
I won't go for drinks.

438
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,280
I just hope you can be a good king.

439
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:58,110
A king should act like a king.

440
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,920
It's getting late.

441
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,070
Your Majesty should return
to the palace early.

442
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:15,350
Then I'll leave it to you, Brother.

443
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,840
Let's go.

444
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,590
His Majesty is leaving.

445
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,280
Take care, Your Majesty.

446
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,970
(Prince Yao's Mansion)

447
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,840
Alright.

448
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,320
Han Ziqing is unbelievable.

449
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,830
Your Majesty is the ruler.

450
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,760
And Prince An is your servant.

451
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Why does Your Majesty defer to him?

452
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,240
Although Prince An has been in seclusion
for many years,

453
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,430
this old guy has quite a high prestige
in the military.

454
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,470
His protégés are everywhere.

455
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,830
I can only cotton up

456
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,760
this brother of mine.

457
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,000
However,

458
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,400
he is already quite old.

459
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,310
He won't outlast me.

460
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,760
Where did that woman
find that old man?

461
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,400
You're leaving today?

462
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,040
I'm still worried about Beiyue.

463
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,190
I want to see him as soon as possible.

464
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,840
Ziqing,

465
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,040
actually, I can see clearly,

466
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,880
with your abilities,

467
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,830
you can completely deal with the King.

468
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,830
Even if Beiyue doesn't wake up,

469
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,710
you can ensure Tianque's security.

470
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,400
Alright,

471
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,950
I'll wait for you and Beiyue

472
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,760
to return soon.

473
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,070
Alright.

474
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,790
I will leave things here to you, Prince.

475
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,480
Thank you, Prince.

476
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,430
Let's go.

477
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,880
Your Highness, you must be very careful
on this journey.

478
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
Take good care of yourself.

479
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
If anything happens,
write a letter immediately to report.

480
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,640
Do not neglect any orders from Prince An.

481
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,480
I got it.

482
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,720
Alright,

483
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,760
let's say goodbye here.

484
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,520
Ma'am, I also want to go with you.

485
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,110
You must listen to Hongyi's orders

486
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,880
and take good care of those boys.

487
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,830
Your Highness, don't worry.

488
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,110
The boys and I

489
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,800
will guard the mansion well

490
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,990
until Your Highness returns.

491
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,950
Do you want me to see you off for a bit?

492
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,360
No.

493
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,830
I knew you would say that.

494
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,670
Be careful on the road.

495
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,680
Take care of things here for me.

496
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,600
Be safe.

497
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,150
Weisheng,

498
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,710
the sea is so rough.

499
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,880
Are we really going to follow her out to sea?

500
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,240
What else can we do?

501
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,800
We have been waiting for her
to leave the mansion.

502
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,310
If we don't follow her,

503
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,310
how will we survive?
Do you want to starve?

504
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,920
Where do you plan to make your move?

505
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,800
Why don't you go instead of me?

506
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,550
No, no.

507
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,400
I know my skills are inferior.

508
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,160
Last time I got caught.

509
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,760
It was so embarrassing.

510
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,680
I won't act recklessly again.

511
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,350
Glad that you know yourself well.

512
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,520
So stop bossing me around.

513
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,160
Listen to me. No more nonsense.

514
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,430
What are you doing?

515
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,710
Old Gu, he moved.

516
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,110
His Highness moved.

517
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,800
His Highness.

518
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,480
Your Highness.

519
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,000
Your Highness.

520
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,880
Shadow.

521
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,800
Shadow, quickly go invite Master Lu.

522
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,070
Your Highness' pulse and blood energy
are about to recover.

523
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,560
He will wake up within five days.

524
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,400
- Quickly go.
- Alright.

525
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,360
Your Highness.

526
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,160
Master Lu.

527
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,070
Alright.

528
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,230
Come, please.

529
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,030
Mr. Gu.

530
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,190
You said Nianbei will wake up
within five days.

531
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,070
Is this true?

532
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,430
His Highness' pulse is stable.

533
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,000
He will definitely wake up within five days.

534
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,600
Alright.

535
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:10,760
That's great.

536
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
After he wakes up,

537
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,470
he will need some time to recuperate.

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,160
If you need anything, just let me know.

539
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,190
Alright.

540
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,040
Thank you, Master Lu.

541
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,880
You're welcome.

542
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,040
It's getting late. You should rest.

543
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:23,910
Alright.

544
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,400
Please.

545
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,110
Nianbei is about to wake up.

546
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
You can finally be at ease now.

547
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,470
If Nianbei wakes up,

548
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:45,230
all my efforts will not be in vain.

549
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,110
After Nianbei recovers,

550
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,000
you can invite him to stay a bit longer.

551
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,000
Nianbei has great potential.

552
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,040
When he wakes up,

553
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,400
let Suying and the others

554
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,160
spar with Nianbei.

555
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,280
With their mediocre skills,

556
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,760
Nianbei can deal with them with one finger.

557
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,350
Even if you cherish talent,

558
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,310
you shouldn't

559
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,830
look down on your own children.

560
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,920
I'm not looking down on them.

561
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,350
Among these three children,

562
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,040
which one can take on great responsibilities?

563
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,470
For our family to prosper,

564
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,800
we really have to rely on Nianbei.

565
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,640
What?

566
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,680
You want to make Nianbei
the head of the family?

567
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,760
I do intend to pass it on to him.

568
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,230
But I'm not sure

569
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,070
if he will accept it.

570
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,070
Nianbei is a noble.

571
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,190
We're just a prestigious martial family.

572
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,000
If he accepts it, it's out of kindness.

573
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,430
If he doesn't, it's his rightful choice.

574
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
Mr. Jiang.

575
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,070
What's wrong with you again?

576
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,430
I heard that person is about to wake up.

577
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,520
Really?

578
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,190
I heard it from Father

579
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,400
once that person wakes up,

580
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,310
he'll take over

581
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,720
the family.

582
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,310
Will he?

583
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,950
Once he takes over the family,

584
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:37,230
what you did...

585
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,030
Jiang Chen,

586
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,760
we must act quickly.

587
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,800
- Mother.
- This color is really nice.

588
00:30:57,590 --> 00:30:58,590
- Mother.
- Mother.

589
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,470
Do you feel better today?

590
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,520
- Jiang Chen.
- Mother,

591
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,710
look what your son-in-law has brought you.

592
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,160
Jiang Chen went through tremendous effort

593
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,310
and spent a lot of money
to buy this Blood Spirit Grass.

594
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,070
Meiting, isn't this what I should do?

595
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,070
I just hope that Mother and Father

596
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,280
can live long and healthy lives.

597
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,160
Jiang Chen, you are very considerate.

598
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,560
Mother, look how filial Jiang Chen is.

599
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,470
He knows that you and Father
have lost your vitality,

600
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,990
so he specifically bought this tonic.

601
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,070
Mother, I'll take the Blood Spirit Grass
to the kitchen now

602
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,110
and have the servants kill a chicken
to stew it together.

603
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,950
Go quickly.

604
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,350
Jiang Chen is really filial.

605
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,350
Got it.

606
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,190
Silly girl.

607
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,710
Jiang Chen,

608
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,920
if your father knew about your filial piety,

609
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,430
he would be very comforted.

610
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,470
Mother, come sit down.

611
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,920
You should rest more now.

612
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,760
Take it slow.

613
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,030
Jiang Chen,

614
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,520
from now on,

615
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,710
you must work harder in your training.

616
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,640
Yes.

617
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,760
When you become the head of the family,

618
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,590
your father and I will be at ease.

619
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,430
The head of the family?

620
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,560
Mother,

621
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,110
you and Father have shown great care to me
over these years.

622
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:10,000
I will never forget it.

623
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,920
Mother, I promise

624
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,160
I will follow your teachings

625
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,590
and live up to everyone's expectations.

626
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,950
Mother.

627
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:19,470
Mother. Mother.

628
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,070
We have a problem.

629
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,990
Just now, I went to the kitchen
to get the Blood Spirit Grass

630
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,070
to make soup for you,

631
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,110
but in the blink of an eye,

632
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,230
the Blood Spirit Grass disappeared.

633
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,070
It was in the kitchen.

634
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,590
How could it just vanish?

635
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,000
Mother, I spent countless efforts

636
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,430
and a big fortune

637
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,760
on that Blood Spirit Grass.

638
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,430
Yes, Mother, what should we do?

639
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,110
Who took the Blood Spirit Grass?

640
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,430
The thief

641
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,920
really got some guts to steal in the manor.

642
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,950
If I catch him,

643
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,950
I will skin him alive.

644
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,830
What should we do now?

645
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,560
Who could it be?

646
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,710
It must have been stolen by someone.

647
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,550
Stolen?

648
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,560
Mother,

649
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,400
don't forget.

650
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,400
We currently have

651
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,590
a few outsiders staying with us.

652
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,800
- Exactly.
- How dare they!

653
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,230
We treat them as guests.

654
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,520
But they're a bunch of thieves.

655
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,600
I'll go find them.

656
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,640
Come back!

657
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,590
Mother, slow down.

658
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,920
Meiting, you can't go.

659
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,760
Meiting.

660
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,280
Meiting, you can't go!

661
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,310
Meiting.

662
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,150
Meiting.

663
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,190
Mother.

664
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,240
Mother.

665
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,400
- My foot!
- Mother.

666
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,830
- Madam.
- Mother, are you alright?

667
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,880
Mother, are you alright?

668
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,110
Mother, your constitution is weak now.

669
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,400
You mustn't get anxious.

670
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,400
I'm fine. Don't worry.

671
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,920
Quick, stop your sister.

672
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,840
- Alright.
- After all, they are guests.

673
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,710
- Alright.
- Hurry.

674
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,360
We'll handle it.

675
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,710
- Alright.
- What are you standing there for?

676
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,710
Help my mother back to rest.

677
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,920
- Yes.
- Go quickly.

678
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,190
Go quickly.

679
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,280
Take good care of the madam.

680
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,120
Yes.

681
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,160
Slowly.

682
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,000
Madam, be careful.

683
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,200
Miss Meiting.

684
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,360
Found it. You thieves!

685
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,910
What? Miss Meiting,

686
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,360
what do you mean by that?

687
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,560
Your master is seriously ill.

688
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
My parents treated him sincerely,

689
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,800
providing internal strength
and precious herbs.

690
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,390
How can you repay kindness with ingratitude

691
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,910
and even steal from us?

692
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,840
When did we ever steal from you?

693
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,760
This is the evidence. You can't deny it.

694
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,280
Do you know how precious

695
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,430
this Blood Spirit Grass is?

696
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,190
My husband went through
tremendous effort to get it.

697
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,760
It was meant to nourish my parents.

698
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,000
How dare you steal it?

699
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,630
You are shameless.

700
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,790
Who stole anything from your house?

701
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,670
Stop.

702
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,630
- I don't know who put it on the table.
- Help!

703
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,990
- On what basis are you accusing us?
- He hit me!

704
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,000
Is there no justice? No law?

705
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,870
Meiting. Meiting, what happened?

706
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,430
Goodness.

707
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,520
So it is indeed with you.

708
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,870
You dog.

709
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,080
How dare you steal from us and hurt her?

710
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,680
Mr. Jiang, there must be
some misunderstanding.

711
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,420
Meiting, get up quickly.

712
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,630
Good deeds really go unrewarded.

713
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,320
It's truly a waste of my parents' kindness.

714
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,490
- Exactly.
- You're caught red-handed

715
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,630
and you hit me.

716
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,280
Miss Meiting, I will say it again.

717
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,230
We did not take anything from you.

718
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,520
I don't know who put it here.

719
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,100
How dare you dare to deny it
with solid evidence?

720
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,000
You are breaking the law.

721
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,280
This...

722
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,470
Do you still want to command respect?

723
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,320
Jiang Chen.

724
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,360
Now that Father is not here,

725
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,910
you'll manage the household affairs.

726
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,670
Tell me, how should they be dealt with?

727
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,910
How else can they be dealt with?

728
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,360
Since the evidence is conclusive,

729
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,390
we will handle it according to the rules
of Lu Manor.

730
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,800
Then I will have to lock you up

731
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,080
for a few days of confinement.

732
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,950
When my father-in-law returns,

733
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,990
he will make the final decision.

734
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,840
Mr. Jiang,

735
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,080
are you going to put us under house arrest?

736
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,920
Let's see if you dare.

737
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,150
Not to mention we didn't steal your medicine,

738
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,230
even if we did,

739
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,280
our master will decide our punishment.

740
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,230
It's not up to you.

741
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,190
What are you going to do?

742
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,150
You can't use violence here.

743
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,710
Miss Meiting,

744
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,710
Mr. Jiang, I beg you all.

745
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,710
Our master is still unconscious.

746
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,390
He cannot be left alone.

747
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,520
For the master-disciple relationship

748
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,600
between our master and Master Lu,

749
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,080
could you wait until our master wakes up

750
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,120
before you deal with us?

751
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,390
This might not be appropriate.

752
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,470
This is wishful thinking.

753
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,470
Since the Blood Spirit Grass

754
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,870
was found in your room,

755
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,360
that is conclusive evidence.

756
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,840
You must be punished.

757
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,320
Otherwise, in this vast manor,

758
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,520
how can I command respect?

759
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,840
Yes, they should be punished.

760
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,840
Moreover,

761
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,360
we have so many people here.

762
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,320
How could your master be left unattended?

763
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,160
Right?

764
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,550
Shadow,

765
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,840
it seems we can no longer stay in this manor.

766
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,400
Go,

767
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
bring Mrs. Lu here.

768
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,100
We will pack our things and leave.

769
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,750
What are you doing?

770
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,150
Let go of me.

771
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,990
Shadow.

772
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,470
- Shadow.
- Let go of me.

773
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,550
What's going on?

774
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,190
Mr. Jiang, what are you doing?

775
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,040
What's happening?

776
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,390
- Why are they being tied up?
- Take them away.

777
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,120
Madam, slow down.

778
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:42,360
- What are you doing?
- What's going on?

779
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,390
Be careful.

780
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,230
What's happening?

781
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,070
Mrs. Lu.

782
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,670
- Quickly gag him.
- Why are they being tied up?

783
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,840
Mother, look,

784
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,000
they stole it.

785
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,870
Yes.

786
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,080
Mother, they were caught red-handed
by my sister.

787
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,320
- They even tried to hurt her.
- You all...

788
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,390
Mother, they not only stole
but also tried to hit me.

789
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,760
- You must stand up for me.
- Mother,

790
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,320
we caught them red-handed.

791
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,520
We have so many eye-witnesses.

792
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,560
They must be punished according
to the rules of Lu Manor.

793
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,800
Mother, we cannot let them go.

794
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,630
Your father is not here.

795
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,470
This is...

796
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,470
Mother, if we don't punish them today,

797
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,360
it'll be difficult to silence public opinion.

798
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,430
Mother, you can't let them go.

799
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,630
Mother, you can't hesitate any longer.

800
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,390
It's not that I look down on them.

801
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,520
Which one of these three children

802
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,280
can take on great responsibilities?

803
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,910
If our family wants to prosper,

804
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,280
we still have to rely on Nianbei.

805
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,120
What?

806
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,120
You want to make Nianbei
the head of the family?

807
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,120
If that's really the case,

808
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,560
let's confine the two for a few days.

809
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,840
You must not mistreat them.

810
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,360
- Yes.
- Hurry up and take them away.

811
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,840
Let go of me.

812
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,790
Mrs. Lu.

813
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,310
Mrs. Lu.

814
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,910
Let go of me.

815
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,160
Mother,

816
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,950
the two servants are punished.

817
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,120
Shall we assign new servants to Nianbei?

818
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,670
Find a couple of maids to take care of him.

819
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,040
Do we really need

820
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
to take care of him personally?

821
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,080
Meiting, that's inappropriate.

822
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,000
No matter what,

823
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,800
Nianbei is a distinguished guest
of our family.

824
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,710
If we neglect him,

825
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,910
wouldn't that make us a laughingstock?

826
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Alright then,

827
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
what do you suggest?

828
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,600
Mother, how about this?

829
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,520
The wharf has been closed recently anyway.

830
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,840
So I'm free.

831
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,280
I can take care of Nianbei.

832
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,320
Yes, Mother.

833
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,840
Nianbei is a man.

834
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,630
It's more convenient to have a man

835
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,150
- take care of him.
- Indeed.

836
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,600
If my brother-in-law gets too busy,

837
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,000
I can lend a hand outside.

838
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,520
Is that appropriate?

839
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,870
Why wouldn't it be?

840
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,190
Nianbei is a guest of you and Father.

841
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,760
And now he's seriously ill.

842
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
We should be more attentive.

843
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,630
Mother, Suying is right.

844
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,600
We can't neglect Nianbei anymore.

845
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,320
Or else, when he wakes up,

846
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,520
he might hold it against us.

847
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,360
Yes.

848
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,510
Alright.

849
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,480
Then you two take care of him for a few days.

850
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,750
Oh God.

851
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,600
They cannot go unpunished.

852
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,760
Now that they're punished,

853
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,150
Nianbei is left...

854
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,000
Mother,

855
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,320
you have already done your utmost.

856
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,520
They can't find any fault with you.

857
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,600
Yes.

858
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,910
Today's matter must not be publicized.

859
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,290
It would not sound good if it got out.

860
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,120
It's hard to explain it to your father either.

861
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,840
Confine them for a few days as a warning.

862
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,040
Do not neglect them.

863
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,910
Did you hear me?

864
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,750
Yes.

865
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,320
- Mother, slow down.
- Madam.

866
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,190
Mother, slow down.

867
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,520
Fortunately, we gave him
some medicine earlier.

868
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,390
Otherwise, he would have woken up by now.

869
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,230
But if the medicine's effect doesn't last,

870
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,360
he might wake up at any moment.

871
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,320
Without my sister's commotion today,

872
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,870
we probably wouldn't have
had this opportunity.

873
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,600
Aren't you going to thank me?

874
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,800
I spent quite a bit of silver

875
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,280
on that Blood Spirit Grass.

876
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:07,750
Thank you?

877
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,150
It's foolish of you

878
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:21,040
to compete with me

879
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,120
for the head of the family.

880
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,200
Is...

881
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,630
Is he about to wake up?

882
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,840
Quickly give him more medicine.

883
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,280
It will be troublesome if he wakes up.

884
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,870
Watch him here. I'll go get the medicine.

885
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,710
Hurry up.

886
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,870
Truly, you never know someone's true nature.

887
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,800
We treat them sincerely,

888
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,710
but they did such disgraceful things.

889
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,840
Mother,

890
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,120
what exactly are you worried about?

891
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,190
Are you afraid that Nianbei will wake up

892
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,520
and cause trouble for our family?

893
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,430
What is his true identity

894
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,710
that makes you and Father value him so much?

895
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,520
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask.

896
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,040
Even if I don't ask, I know.

897
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,840
Mother,

898
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,230
tell me the truth.

899
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,070
Is that Nianbei

900
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,150
my father's illegitimate son?

901
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,990
Meiting,

902
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,160
don't speak nonsense.

903
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,880
Alright,

904
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,510
I won't say it anymore.

905
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,950
But Mother,

906
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,190
don't worry too much.

907
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,800
They are just two servants.

908
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,120
As you said,

909
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,520
confine them for a few days as a lesson

910
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,670
and then release them.

911
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,200
How is it?

912
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,040
Now he's completely weak

913
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,430
without the slightest bit of strength.

914
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
That was close.

915
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,520
Without this medicine,

916
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,080
he might have woken up by now.

917
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,520
What do you think

918
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,630
we should do next?

919
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,120
We can't just keep him sleeping forever.

920
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,320
That's not very appropriate

921
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,560
Do you plan to take care of him
for the rest of your life?

922
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,360
What?

923
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:04,390
Are you saying

924
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,630
that we simply

925
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,120
kill him?

926
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,310
What do you think?

927
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,230
If you want to do it, go ahead.

928
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:13,710
Don't drag me into it.

929
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,160
What do you mean?

930
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,360
After all, he is my father's disciple.

931
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,470
Although we don't know his identity,

932
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,150
from his two followers,

933
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,360
I can tell he's not an ordinary man.

934
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,870
If you really kill them,

935
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,430
whatever consequences arise,

936
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,520
it's none of my business.

937
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,430
You think you can wash your hands off it?

938
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,470
Don't forget.

939
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,390
Who came to me first to conspire this?

940
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,190
We're just taking what we need
from each other.

941
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,440
Yes.

942
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,280
I know your ambitions, Suying.

943
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,800
And I believe you know my intentions.

944
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:51,230
Don't worry.

945
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,080
As long as we get rid of this thorn
in our side,

946
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,440
everything between us

947
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:57,390
will be easy to resolve.

948
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,910
Until we find out this person's identity,

949
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,520
we can't harm him.

950
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:04,870
So you mean

951
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,000
to let him continue sleeping?

952
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,150
Don't worry.

953
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:10,840
As long as the effect of your medicine lasts,

954
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,950
even if he doesn't die by then,

955
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,710
he will become a cripple.

956
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,230
What threat could he pose to us?

957
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:21,990
Mr. Jiang.

958
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,910
