I miss you.

Are you looking for Weisheng?

Weisheng

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,000
went somewhere a few days ago.

31
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,510
What?

32
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,240
He's away again.

33
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,830
He left a letter saying he had something
to take care of

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,470
and should be back in a few days.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,880
Don't worry for now.

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,270
Why don't you stay at home
and wait for him to come back?

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,440
Alright.

38
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,950
Let's go.

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,110
How are your parents?

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,950
They're doing well.

41
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,980

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,910
The defeated troops in the city,

45
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,960
hand over the Fourth Princess.

46
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,470
Otherwise,

47
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,080
our troops will take the city down.

50
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,110
Jun Beiyue's army is at the city gate.

51
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,020
There is no time to lose. Release her.

52
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,860
Release Han Ziqing.

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,360
Didn't you hear me?

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,550
I told you to release Han Ziqing.

55
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,630
Though Your Majesty has given an order,

56
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,470
I can't do that.

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,440
What did you say?

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,290
Are you trying to rebel?

59
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,830
Guards!

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,070
Guards!

61
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,490
If Your Majesty insists on this,

62
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,740
I have to let Your Majesty suffer a bit.

63
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,890
Your Majesty leaves no choice.

64
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,980
Kill them.

65
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,930
Capture the Minister alive.

66
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,070
Your Majesty,

67
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,540
haven't you recognized

68
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,370
these people by now?

69
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,490
Puppets.

70
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,610
They are puppets.

71
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,770
But aren't the islanders...

72
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,240
That's right.

73
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,610
Now, even without the islanders,

74
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,200
I can also make common people

75
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,610
immortal and indestructible puppets.

76
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,910
When...

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,170
When did you do these things?

78
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,100
Why didn't I know about it?

79
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,910
What...

80
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,770
What have you done?

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,930
Why should I listen to you?

82
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,880
You're suspicious and weak.

83
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,370
Just another foolish idiot.

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,790
You don't dare to oppose Tianque.

85
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,230
But you don't know my ambitions

86
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,820
are not confined to a small Tianque.

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,540
Now, I have the Magical Artifact

88
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,650
and can turn common people into puppets
at any time.

89
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,600
And Han Ziqing

90
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,770
is a more invincible weapon for me.

91
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,210
You want me to let her go?

92
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,260
Minister, are you planning
to usurer the throne?

93
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,070
You promised me

94
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,490
that you would kill Han Ziqing.

95
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,120
What?

96
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,540
Do you want to command me?

97
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,420
I just want Han Ziqing dead.

98
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,870
And you

99
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,740
want to use her to control
the entire Longyuan Continent.

100
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,860
What great ambition you have!

101
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,150
Foolish woman.

102
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,740
Who do you think you are?

103
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,980
How dare you negotiate with me?

104
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,640
Consort Qin!

105
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,480
Consort Qin!

106
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,240
Don't be afraid.

107
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,300
I won't kill you.

108
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,580
You are still useful.

109
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,140
(Tianque)

110
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,260
(Beikun Gate)

111
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,140
Soldiers, listen up!

112
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,880
Whoever captures the King of Nanzhao

113
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,260
will be generously rewarded.

114
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,890
The Tianque Tiger Army is impressive.

115
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,540
You're all brave and skillful in battle.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,260
Admirable.

117
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,490
King of Nanzhao,

118
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,580
you persecuted countless islanders
twenty years ago.

119
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,450
Now you captured the Fourth Princess
of Tianque.

120
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,930
Today, I will

121
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,330
seek justice for all.

122
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,300
Jun Beiyue,

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,250
I will give you one more chance.

124
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,910
Withdraw your troops immediately

125
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,690
and immediately proclaim to the world

126
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,960
that from this moment on,

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,420
Tianque submits to Nanzhao.

128
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,840
I don't want to waste words
with you here right now.

129
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,470
If you insist on provoking a conflict,

130
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,100
I will definitely take your head

131
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,330
and hang it above the City Tower.

132
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,010
What arrogant words!

133
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,010
However, we accept your challenge.

134
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,690
Open the city gate.

135
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:38,300
(Beikun Gate)

136
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:44,880
Your Highness?

137
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,300

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,110
while I'm still conscious,

191
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,190
kill me.

Your Highness!

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,400
Retreat, quickly retreat!

215
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,500
Yes.

216
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,950
Retreat!

217
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,790
Retreat quickly!

218
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,260
Protect His Highness!

219
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,060
(Yue)

220
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,940
(Beikun Gate)

221
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,350
Jun Beiyue, oh Jun Beiyue!

222
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,450
Weren't you very arrogant?

223
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,140
Now you've lost both the lady
and the soldiers.

224
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,620
You guys,

225
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,380
take the King back to the Palace

226
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,430
and take good care of him.

227
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,680
- Yes.
- Yes, go.

228
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,520
How dare you?

229
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:32,930
I'm the King of Nanzhao.

230
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,960
Go!

231
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,380
- Go!
- Go!

232
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,700
(Tianqi)

233
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,080
Mr. Baili.

234
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,430
- What's wrong with Xuanyuan Lige?
- Quickly get the physician!

235
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,560
Get Physician Gu.

236
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,400
Yes.

237
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,530
Where did you find him?

238
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,690
In a cave in Yangshan Mountain.

239
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,680
When I arrived,

240
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,300
Meng Wanyue was absorbing
his internal strength.

241
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,740
To protect us,

242
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,780
he was going to perish together with her.

243
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,050
I saw him fall off the cliff.

244
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,570
But I didn't want to give up.

245
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,830
So I went to search for him.

246
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,410
I searched for several days and nights.

247
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,020
Finally, I found him under a tree.

248
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,170
Fortunately, the ground there was soft.

249
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,070
A branch must have caught him

250
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,140
before he fell onto the grass.

251
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,260
So his bones aren't shattered.

252
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,190
The wounds are too much

253
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,570
for his frail body to take.

254
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,020
I'll do my best.

255
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,040
I'll write him a prescription.

256
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,780
Alright, I'll go with you.

257
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,920
It looks like he's about to wake up.

258
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,100
Go fetch some water.

259
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,040
Xuanyuan Lige!

260
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,980
Princess Qianqian.

261
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,330
Princess Qianqian.

262
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,600
You killer!

263
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,710
Today, you have walked into my trap.

264
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,020
- Qianqian!
- Pay for my husband's death!

265
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,760
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!

266
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,160
I'll kill him right now!

267
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,800
- Calm down.
- Let go of me!

268
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,310
- He's about to die!
- Situ Haonan.

269
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,000
Do not mention my husband's name.

270
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,880
You are not worthy.

271
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,900
I will kill you right now!

272
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,680
- He is not dead.
- Calm down. Let's wait for the Fourth Prince.

273
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,810
He didn't die.

274
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,020
What did you say?

275
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,710
I don't believe it.

276
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,230
I will kill you!

277
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,260
I'm not lying to you.

278
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,780
Situ Haonan is really not dead.

279
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,930
It was an illusion I created
with demonic sounds.

280
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,450
It was meant to deceive Chu Tiange.

281
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,290
So where is he now?

282
00:22:59,120 --> 00:22:59,980
He is now

283
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,110
in the secret prison
of the Dongling Royal Family.

284
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:02,950
I don't believe it.

285
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,740
Help me up.

286
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,020
Get me some paper and a pen.

287
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:17,990
Put it down.

288
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,230
Mr. Xuanyuan.

289
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,070
Lige.

290
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,900
(Lige)

291
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,450
(Upon seeing this note,
release Situ Haonan immediately.)

292
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,860
(This is my final order. Lige.)

293
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,540
(Lige)

294
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,380
Go quickly.

295
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,980
Ms. Qin is my trusted confidante.

296
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,690
She recognizes my handwriting

297
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,020
(Lige)
and will definitely comply.

298
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,020
For now, I will spare your life.

299
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,810
If you deceive me again,

300
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,500
when I come back,
I will definitely kill you.

301
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,290
I may not be able to live
until you return.

302
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,690
Go quickly.

303
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,100
Where is Ziqing?

304
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,930
I need to find her.

305
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,100
I'll take you to her right away.

306
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,320
Come on.

307
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,630
Hurry up.

308
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,210
I need to tell her...

309
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,620
Go get the Xuezheng now.

310
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,590
Get the Xuezheng.

311
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,430
Alright.

312
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,840
Sorry.

313
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,800
Ziqing.

314
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,900
I'll play the complete Lishang for you.

315
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,020
I hope it can send you home.

316
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,780
You will definitely hear it.

317
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,810
Wake up.

318
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,230
Ziqing.

319
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,450
We finally meet again.

320
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,660
Where are we?

321
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,870
Look.

322
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,560
Sweetie,

323
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,620
may I ask where this place is?

324
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,110
Excuse me.

325
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,290
Where are we?

326
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,260
They ignore me.

327
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,410
Did you see the totems on their faces?

328
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,980
Are they the Islanders?

329
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,910
Boatman,

330
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,330
excuse me, where is this place?

331
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,620
It seems like they can't see us.

332
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,210
Ziqing.

333
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,500
Is that you?

334
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,360
Mom?

335
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,200
Go ahead.

336
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,010
That's great.

337
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,950
Ziqing.

338
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,290
You have fulfilled my wish.

339
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,360
Mom.

340
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,770
Why are we here?

341
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,860
Where exactly is this place?

342
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,620
This is the Isolated Island.

343
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,810
The Isolated Island?

344
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,330
This is the Isolated Island?

345
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,500
Then the people here...

346
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,530
Why do they all seem to not see us?

347
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,140
I was the Holy Maiden
of the Isolated Island.

348
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,900
The Lishang Music Score

349
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,660
is the Sacred Object
of the Isolated Island.

350
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:04,320
The Grand Musician of the Isolated Island,
Nangong Jun, traveled to various places,

351
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,950
recorded the sounds of nature,
and composed it.

352
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,640
The sound of the guqin can make an illusion.

353
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,220
At critical moments, it can protect
the clan members.

354
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,630
Unfortunately, the incident occurred
suddenly back then.

355
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,660
I fled in a hurry

356
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,150
and was hunted.

357
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,290
To be safe, I destroyed part of the score

358
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,360
and left totems to guide the way.

359
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,000
Later, I diligently practiced my skills

360
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,470
but I could only conjure up parts
of the Isolated Island's illusion,

361
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,810
hoping that Lishang would open
the way home for you.

362
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,510
Mom,

363
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,010
you've been waiting for me
in the illusion.

364
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,860
Is there something you want to tell me?

365
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,900
Is the Longyuan Continent

366
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,290
suffering from the pains of war?

367
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,860
The Minister of Nanzhao has obtained
a magical artifact.

368
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,180
Now, the Longyuan Continent is in ruins.

369
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,620
It resembles a living hell.

370
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,670
I know.

371
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,940
This magical artifact

372
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,700
is called the Soul Devouring Pearl

373
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,900
