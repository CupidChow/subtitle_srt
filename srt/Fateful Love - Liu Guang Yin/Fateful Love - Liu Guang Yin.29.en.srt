=Episode 29=

21
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,500
The entrance to the Barrier

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,290
is right in this house.

23
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,710
Really?

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,440
Where?

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,460
I need to check further

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,220
to confirm the specific position.

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,070
Then

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
how should we check it?

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,100
Let us set up a formation

30
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,730
to reveal the Barrier.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,280
Everyone,

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,610
please step back.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
Alright.

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,390
Why are these two masters so young?

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,570
Especially this Third Master.

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,190
Unexpectedly,

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,750
the entrance

38
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,180
is actually at his chest.

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,990
But

40
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,420
he is about to wake up.

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,370
There are too many people now.

42
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,240
We have to keep him asleep.

43
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
Alright.

44
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,880
We can set up a formation

45
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,130
to keep him unconscious

46
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,460
and asleep.

47
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,030
Masters,

48
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,870
how is it?

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,130
We have checked

50
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,770
all positions here,

51
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,100
but we still cannot confirm

52
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,900
where it is.

53
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,290
Today we have run out of our energy.

54
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,960
We can only check it again tomorrow.

55
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,830
Alright, I will arrange for you
to rest immediately

56
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,990
and let's get back to work tomorrow.

57
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,160
Alright.

58
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Please.

59
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,550
Thank you.

60
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,070
Ziqing.

61
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,470
Ziqing.

62
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,470
Where is the Chief?

63
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,240
My master just used his power
to save your life.

64
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,370
He is resting now.

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,610
Saved my life?

66
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,370
Is my illness cured?

67
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,160
Your illness is no longer a major issue.

68
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,160
My master used the Sealing Technique

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,330
to seal your vital energy.

70
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,040
As long as the power
of the Five Elements Seal is not broken,

71
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,830
you can always rely on the power

72
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,670
to live on.

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,720
The vital energy is your life.

74
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,760
Will this seal break on its own?

75
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,280
There are two possibilities
for it to break.

76
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,640
The first one

77
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,050
is relying on the accumulation
and explosion of your own power.

78
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,600
Now your body is so weak,

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,610
so there is no need to worry.

80
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,210
The other one

81
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,440
is relying on someone
who knows the Barrier Technique

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,580
to break your seal.

83
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,020
Are you awake?

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,420
Thank you for saving my life, Chief.

85
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,640
I will repay you in the future.

86
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,790
Alright, alright.

87
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,000
No need for such formalities.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Please rise.

89
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,190
Chief,

90
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,210
you have already saved my life today.

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,020
I shouldn't have asked for more favors.

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,110
But this matter is of great importance,

93
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,170
and it is urgent.

94
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,650
I have no choice

95
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,980
but to ask you for help once more.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,840
Chief,

97
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,000
please open the Barrier
under Mingsha Mountain

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,580
to save the Fourth Princess of Tianque.

99
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,650
So you also came for this matter.

100
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,740
It seems you've known about this.

101
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,610
Please save her.

102
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,880
I swore long ago

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,860
that I would never get involved
in this matter in my lifetime.

104
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,140
You should leave.

105
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,300
I can't help you.

106
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,640
But Chief...

107
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,480
Don't say more.

108
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,580
The Poisonous Grass World
is an evil place.

109
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,200
I advise you

110
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,300
to stay away from such troubles.

111
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,450
Poisonous Grass World?

112
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,540
So the Barrier is called
Poisonous Grass World.

113
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,770
It was a Barrier set up
by our ancestors.

114
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,170
Because it is too evil,

115
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,880
I established the rules

116
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,330
that no descendants of Meng Tribe
should get involved in this matter.

117
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,860
But Ziqing is innocent.

118
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,980
She is not an evil person, Chief.

119
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,000
Mr. Xuanyuan,

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,880
your illness has been cured.

121
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
Changsheng,

122
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,870
see the guest out.

123
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,350
Chief,

124
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,880
you didn't even know me before,

125
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,210
yet you couldn't bear to see me die.

126
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,260
You are a compassionate person.

127
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,020
How can you bear
to see an innocent person die unjustly?

128
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,680
Chief,

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,890
you know Poisonous Grass World
is an evil place,

130
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,330
and it was set up
by the ancestors of Meng Tribe.

131
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,770
Only the one who tied the knot
can untie it.

132
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,170
Please reconsider it, Chief.

133
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,540
I cannot undo

134
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,860
the mistake my late father made.

135
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,540
I can only ensure that our tribe members

136
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,270
stay away from it
and never touch it again

137
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,490
to atone for my late father's mistake.

138
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,700
Forgive my bluntness,

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,100
but as long as
Poisonous Grass World exists,

140
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,540
Meng Tribe can never stay away

141
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,160
from the mistake committed
by the ancestors of Meng Tribe.

142
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,020
Shut up! Stop talking nonsense.

143
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,990
If you keep talking nonsense,
I'll throw you out.

144
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,590
Chief,

145
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,210
the way to atone for the mistake

146
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,260
is not to escape,

147
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,650
but to resolve it.

148
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,490
Now is the best time.

149
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,120
Thank you, Chief.

150
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,280
Ziqing,

151
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,770
my illness is cured.

152
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,170
I can finally get close to you

153
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,580
and love you.

154
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,240
Brother,

155
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,880
are you sure the entrance

156
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,140
is on Jun Beiyue's chest?

157
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,580
Sure.

158
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,890
How could I get that wrong?

159
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,330
While it's quiet at night,

160
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,160
let's go open the Barrier

161
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,100
to find Han Ziqing,

162
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,450
and go back early.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,840
Alright.

164
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,310
Brother,

165
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,640
if this succeeds,

166
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,200
you will be the future chief
of Meng Tribe.

167
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,620
Don't forget me then.

168
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,130
How could I forget you?

169
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,130
When I become the chief,

170
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,380
you will be my right-hand man.

171
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,830
At that time,

172
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,770
you won't miss out on any benefits.

173
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,350
Let's go.

174
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,910
Brother,

175
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,550
this is a great opportunity.
No one is around.

176
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,390
Let's go.

177
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,590
What are you doing?

178
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,570
I couldn't sleep at night,

179
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,280
so I wanted to walk around.

180
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,120
Yes, yes.

181
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,620
You cannot move around freely here.

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,760
Please return to your rooms.

183
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,600
If there's anything,

184
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,760
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

185
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
Alright.

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,100
You should sleep early too.

187
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,000
Sleep early.

188
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,940
Where did it go?

189
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,560
Why isn't it moving?

190
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,510
Let's go.

191
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,910
You're circling again.

192
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,940
Are you playing with me?

193
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,770
This bug doesn't work well either.

194
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,940
None of them are normal.

195
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,560
Please.

196
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,950
Physician Gu,

197
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,990
why does His Highness
seem to be sleeping more deeply?

198
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,500
Didn't you say he would wake up soon?

199
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,740
The pulse is still stable,

200
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,770
but indeed he is sleeping more deeply
than yesterday.

201
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,570
What's going on?

202
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,880
Masters, please keep working today.

203
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,470
If we can find the Barrier early,

204
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,440
when Fourth Prince wakes up,

205
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,570
we can give him a surprise.

206
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,980
There were too many people
and it was noisy yesterday.

207
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,330
I hope everyone can wait
outside the room,

208
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,810
so that we two can be more concentrated.

209
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,200
Alright.

210
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,270
Please.

211
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,440
Physician Gu, do you think
they can make it?

212
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,890
Why is Beiyue sleeping even deeper?

213
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,120
Brother,

214
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,280
should we take action?

215
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,120
No.

216
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,890
We can't take action now.

217
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,540
They are all waiting outside.

218
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,960
As soon as there is any movement,

219
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,890
it will alert them.

220
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,860
Even if we open the Barrier
and find Han Ziqing,

221
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:13,710
under the watchful eyes of everyone,

222
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,690
what can we do?

223
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,030
Then what should we do?

224
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,980
Since we have already found the Barrier,

225
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,790
we need to reinforce it

226
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,060
and let him continue to sleep.

227
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,380
We can report
to the King of Nanzhao then.

228
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,690
Alright, come on.

229
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,060
Beiyue, save me.

230
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,510
Beiyue.

231
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,510
Beiyue,

232
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,240
save me.

233
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,740
I feel so uncomfortable.

234
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,370
Chief Meng is arriving soon.

235
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,760
The masters from Meng Tribe
have arrived.

236
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,880
Why did you come back so late?

237
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,910
Did they come yesterday?

238
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,750
Who are they?

239
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,350
Oh no.

240
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,240
Quick.

241
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,200
Who are you?

242
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,590
Get out of the way.

243
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,450
How is His Highness?

244
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,080
Fortunately, he's fine.

245
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,860
Just sleeping even deeper than before.

246
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,030
Didn't you say Chief Meng was coming?

247
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,130
Let's see if he has any solutions.

248
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,420
Since you two are from Meng Tribe,

249
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,110
now the Chief has arrived,

250
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,540
you should also pay your respects.

251
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,680
Brother.

252
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,580
(Sha)

253
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,830
Mr. Lige.

254
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,990
This is Chief Meng,
the leader of Meng Tribe.

255
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm Situ Haonan from Jian'an City.
Greetings, Chief Meng.

256
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,620
How is Jun Beiyue now?

257
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,650
Fourth Prince is bedridden
due to a rush of anger.

258
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,400
He's unable to welcome Chief Meng.

259
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,240
Please forgive him.

260
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,080
No need for such formalities.

261
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,810
Let's first check on
Fourth Prince's condition.

262
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,240
What happened?

263
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,710
Did something go wrong?

264
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,790
A couple of days ago,

265
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,980
two masters from Meng Tribe
arrived first.

266
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,100
Do you know about this, Chief Meng?

267
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,180
Masters from Meng Tribe?

268
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,380
- Greetings, Father.
- Greetings, Father.

269
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,550
Without permission,

270
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,060
why did you leave the island?

271
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,180
What is your purpose here?

272
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,450
Father,

273
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,420
Brother and I have lived on Dream Island
for a long time

274
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,840
and inevitably yearned
for the outside world,

275
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,640
so we thought of going out for a walk
and to see the world.

276
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,550
On the way, we heard

277
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,790
that they were looking for someone
who knows the Barrier Technique,

278
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,860
so we thought

279
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,740
we could come and help.

280
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,320
Nonsense!

281
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,910
How dare you violate the tribe's rules
and leave the island without permission.

282
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,130
You should be severely punished!

283
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,230
Father, I know I was wrong.

284
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,180
I know I was wrong, Father.

285
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,650
Did you cause any trouble?

286
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,150
Father, I wouldn't dare.

287
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,060
No, no.

288
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,140
I'll deal with you later.

289
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,480
You two,

290
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,110
stay here and reflect on your actions.

291
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,410
Do not wander around.

292
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,500
We will heed your teachings, Father.

293
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,360
Chief Meng,

294
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,190
let's first check on His Highness.

295
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,310
He has not awakened for a long time.

296
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,290
We're so worried.

297
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,290
Alright, please lead the way.

298
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,450
Chief, His Highness is here.

299
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,660
Chief, is there anything unusual?

300
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,480
Nothing.

301
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,320
Chief,

302
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,280
no wonder Fourth Prince
has been in a deep sleep.

303
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,930
A Confinement Technique was used here.

304
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,330
It seems they do have some skills.

305
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,450
Break the Barrier.

306
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,270
Your Highness.

307
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,260
Your Highness, you are awake.

308
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,860
(Strange.)

309
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,980
(This is my first encounter
with this Fourth Prince.)

310
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,660
(Why does he feel familiar?)

311
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,740
Beiyue, you are awake.

312
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,920
This is the Chief of Meng Tribe.

313
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,740
He was invited by Xuanyuan Lige
to save Ziqing.

314
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,630
Chief,

315
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,230
thank you for your help.

316
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,530
Have you found anything?

317
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,260
Indeed, I have found it

318
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,310
and I can confirm now

319
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,500
that the entrance is right here.

320
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,400
To be more precise,

321
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,210
it is on your chest.

322
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,830
At the moment when the Barrier closed,

323
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,930
the entrance is moved to your chest.

324
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,950
Do you have any way

325
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,430
to quickly open the Barrier?

326
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,050
We need to find Fourth Princess

327
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,830
and locate the exact position
within the Barrier,

328
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,040
and then use you as the switch

329
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,570
to open the Barrier.

330
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:45,870
Alright.

331
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,150
There is no time to lose.

332
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,040
Let's set off now.

333
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,100
Your Highness, your body...

334
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,080
Change clothes for me.

335
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,360
Quickly.

336
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,440
Yes.

337
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,930
Greetings, Father.

338
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,170
Did you two set up the confinement?

339
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,440
Father,

340
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,560
indeed.

341
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,290
We discovered the entrance

342
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,590
is in that room.

343
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,950
We were afraid it would move,

344
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,930
so we set up that confinement.

345
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,260
It seems you two were quite thoughtful.

346
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,170
We dare not deceive you, Father.

347
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,960
Enough.

348
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,020
I won't hold it against you for now.

349
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,400
You dared to act on your own

350
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,290
and almost caused a grave mistake.

351
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,430
After I finish dealing with this matter,

352
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,020
you will return to the island with me
to receive punishment.

353
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,840
Yes,

354
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,270
Father.

355
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,720
Father,

356
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,880
are you

357
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,980
going to rescue the person?

358
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,530
Can we go together?

359
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,840
Alright.

360
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,800
You might be helpful.

361
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,640
However,

362
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,000
do not act rashly.

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,290
Follow my instructions.

364
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,710
Yes,

365
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:24,570
Father.

366
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,140
This eerie place

367
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,170
only has this one fruit tree.

368
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,620
Anyway, I ate it last time

369
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,690
and didn't die from poison.

370
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,740
It should be fine this time too.

371
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,020
It still hurts so much.

372
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,200
Chief,

373
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,440
it's here.

374
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,170
Fourth Prince,

375
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:08,470
I'll used Meng Tribe's secret technique

376
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,400
to open the entrance for you.

377
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,830
You need to use your consciousness

378
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:17,140
to find the exact position
of Fourth Princess.

379
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,040
The Barrier under Mingsha Mountain
is vast.

380
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,900
The process will exhaust
much of your energy.

381
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,410
If you can't concentrate,

382
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,100
your consciousness will become chaotic.

383
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,290
I'm afraid...

384
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,780
As long as I can save Ziqing,

385
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,570
I'm willing to do anything.

386
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,530
Alright, please.

387
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,430
Use your inner strength

388
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,110
to guard the hexagonal talisman.

389
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,170
- Quickly.
- Quickly.

390
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,720
Where is he?

391
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,390
Your Highness.

392
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,680
Where is Ziqing?

393
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:06,270
Ziqing.

394
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,750
Ziqing.

395
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,100
Ziqing.

396
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,440
Ziqing

397
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,990
Ziqing.

398
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,290
Ziqing.

399
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,110
Ziqing.

400
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,910

Your Highness.

Ziqing,

457
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,500
you finally came back.

458
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,640
I told you,

459
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,620
I have great fortune and will be fine.

460
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:41,990
Your Highness.

461
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,230
Fourth Princess.

462
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,070
Are you alright?

463
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,530
You must have suffered a lot.

464
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,980
I'm fine.

465
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,680
Thank you all.

466
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,980
Lige, thank you for saving me last time.

467
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,320
It's good that you're back.

468
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,800
How is your illness?

469
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,640
My illness

470
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,960
has been cured.

471
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,390
That's good.

472
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,230
Ziqing...

473
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,070
Everyone,

474
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,690
let's have Fourth Princess
go back and rest early.

475
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,530
Fourth Princess, this way, please.

476
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,090
- Ziqing, let's go back.
- Alright.

477
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,370
Ziqing is back. We should celebrate.

478
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,470
I'm starving.

479
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:15,210
- Let's go.
- Go back and make me some food.

480
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,630
Alright.

481
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,800
Be careful.

482
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,660
I'm fine.

483
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,140
I'm perfectly fine.

484
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:20,990
(Ziqing,)

485
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,410
(you must wait for me.)

486
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,410
(Wait for my success.)

487
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,560
Mr. Lige,

488
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,170
let's go. I'll treat you to a drink.

489
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,020
I don't have time to drink with you.

490
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,350
We are at least life-and-death friends.

491
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,800
Who is life-and-death friends with you?

492
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I've saved you several times.

493
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,280
Isn't that considered
life-and-death friends?

494
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,320
Thanks.

495
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,600
That's it?

496
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:54,910
Let's go.

497
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,300
My legs are uncomfortable.

498
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
Slow down.

499
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,800
Ziqing,

500
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,530
quickly thank Chief Meng.

501
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,220
He opened the Barrier for us.

502
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,470
Thank you,

503
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,470
Chief Meng.

504
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,390
Kid, you are too injured.

505
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,330
Come on, sit down.

506
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,710
Sit down.

507
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,010
Fourth Prince, may I ask

508
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,220
what your mother's name is?

509
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,970
My mother was Meng Wanyue.

510
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,140
She passed away many years ago.

511
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,660
You may not know.

512
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,000
The Barrier Seal on your chest

513
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,180
was made by a technique
that only my daughter knew.

514
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,560
Your daughter?

515
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,000
My daughter is Meng Wanyue.

516
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,380
You are her son.

517
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:35,490
That makes you my grandson.

518
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,390
Wanyue was an outstanding Barrier Master

519
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:40,940
from our Meng Tribe.

520
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,470
I intended to make her my inheritor,

521
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,330
but later,

522
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,730
she left Dream Island.

523
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,490
I never expected her
to marry into Tianque.

524
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,810
Jun Beiyue,

525
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,250
you are my grandson.

526
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,900
Greetings,

527
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,100
Grandfather.

528
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,900
You may rise.

529
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:10,870
Fortunately, your mother
placed a seal on you,

530
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,700
thus allowing us to meet.

531
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,420
No wonder when I first saw you,

532
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,050
I felt a sense of familiarity.

533
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,290
This is all thanks to the heavens

534
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,420
showing mercy on me.

535
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,230
Chief Meng,

536
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,280
why did Beiyue's mother

537
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,860
place a seal on his chest?

538
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,010
I think,

539
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,180
this is the Yin his mother left for him.

540
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,620
Yin is a term in Barrier Techniques.

541
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,000
If the Yin is placed on you,

542
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,950
when you are harmed
by external forces,

543
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,420
it'll protect your body
and preserve your essence.

544
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,840
If I'm not mistaken,

545
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,900
you have suffered
serious injuries before.

546
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,120
Without this Yin,

547
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,940
you might not have survived.

548
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,800
His Highness indeed
suffered severe injuries,

549
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,470
and barely survived.

550
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,310
But eventually, he recovered.

551
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,220
This Yin has another use.

552
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,810
When a Barrier appears around the Yin,

553
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,390
and the entrance moves,

554
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,430
it will guide itself to you.

555
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,910
I never thought

556
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,470
that we would meet in this way.

557
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,080
This is all thanks
to the heavens' special favor

558
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,330
on the declining descendants
of Meng Tribe.

559
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
(Sha)

560
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,970
From now on,

561
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,320
you have gained a new family member.

562
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,880
And so have you.

563
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,620
Actually, I always believed

564
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,620
you will come to save me.

565
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:23,880
Show me.

566
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,560
Jun Beiyue,

567
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,560
promise me.

568
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,770
No matter what happens in the future,

569
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,700
you must cherish yourself.

570
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,840
Do you understand?

571
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,670
I promise you.

572
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,460
Can I hug you?

573
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,220
When you were there alone,

574
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,140
were you scared?

575
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,330
I wasn't scared at all.

576
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,050
You heartless person.

577
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,670
With you here,

578
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,030
what do I have to fear?

579
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:19,900
I will always protect you.

580
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,400
(Jun Beiyue,)

581
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,530
(don't be so nice to me.)

582
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,950
(If you are like this,)

583
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,810
(I won't be able to leave.)

584
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,770
What are you drinking?

585
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,840
Ziqing.

586
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,220
This is a special tonic I made.

587
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,900
It's too hot today.

588
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
Really?

589
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,160
Yes.

590
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,190
What's wrong? Why did you come so early?

591
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,330
Shouldn't you rest a bit more?

592
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,250
I came to thank you.

593
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:07,800
Thank me for what?

594
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,970
We are friends.

595
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,220
Of course, we are friends.

596
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,180
And there's Xuanyuan Lige.

597
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,560
Yes.

598
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,250
I don't know where he went.

599
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,470
Do you know?

600
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,140
No, I don't.

601
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,490
But I stopped him.

602
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,340
It was useless.

603
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,190
From what I can tell,

604
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,100
he seems to want to oppose Jun Beiyue.

605
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,940
But don't worry.

606
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,280
This is Xiling.

607
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,470
They won't cause a big commotion.

608
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,310
Don't worry.

609
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,170
Ziqing,

610
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,100
Chu Tiange has people
watching here every day.

611
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,190
I'm afraid the news
that you escaped from the Barrier

612
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,770
is known
across the entire Longyuan Continent.

613
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:52,010
So we need to return
to Tianque as soon as possible.

614
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,840
Fortunately, we are close
to the border here,

615
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,760
and we also have White Tiger Army
on its guard.

616
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,550
But you,

617
00:40:59,000 --> 00:40:59,840
where are you going?

618
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,290
I haven't decided yet.

619
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:05,150
I probably won't go back to Nanzhao.

620
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,230
It's too hot there.

621
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,170
Hot and humid.

622
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,390
Going back would be suffering for me.

623
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,660
I would have to drink this every day.

624
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:13,050
But I'm still worried
about my junior brother.

625
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,600
I don't feel at ease with him
over there.

626
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,440
In that case,

627
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,910
come back with us.

628
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,570
I will send someone to bring him over.

629
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,430
That's good.

630
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,990
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing, nothing.

631
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,280
Drinking this tonic
makes me feel unwell.

632
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,420
That palm strike you gave me earlier
almost did me in.

633
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,620
Don't worry.
I will get better after a while.

634
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,180
You should use this tonic less.

635
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,120
Don't worry.

636
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,600
I have to endure the bitterness
before sweetness, right?

637
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,860
Alright, I'll be going then.

638
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,290
You do know where to hit.

639
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,720
The characters from ancient times
are so complicated.

640
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,730
Yes, they are very complicated.

641
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,080
Fourth Princess, this is red date tea
made for you.

642
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,940
It's to warm your body.

643
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,870
Fourth Prince, this is ginseng soup
made for you.

644
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:14,710
Put it down.

645
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,430
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

646
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,860
Come on, have a sip.

647
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,800
Your Highness.

648
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,120
Come in.

649
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,600
Your Highness.

650
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,620
Mr. Baili has fainted.

651
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,100
Fainted?

652
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,750
How is he?

653
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,880
Fourth Princess,

654
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,810
Mr. Baili has been poisoned.

655
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,670
What kind of poison?

656
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,000
I don't know what poison it is yet.

657
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,120
It seems he was poisoned earlier.

658
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,520
The poison has remained in his body
without being neutralized.

659
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,280
So it has been attacking his body

660
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,050
and making him get weaker.

661
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,140
This poison is not fatal.

662
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,640
But...

663
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,560
Your Highness, look.

664
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,290
The skin around his wound
is hard and charred.

665
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,700
It looks like fish scales.

666
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,780
It's very strange.

667
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,860
Why is it?

668
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,330
Master Jin, that guy.

669
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,120
You're awake.

670
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,250
I'm fine. I won't die.

671
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,970
I'm so handsome.

672
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:41,620
A good sleep will fix it.

673
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,860
Aren't you all very curious?

674
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,180
Ask whatever you want to know.

675
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,870
Are you curious about who I am?

676
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,040
Anyway, I know

677
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,490
you are more than just a veterinarian.

678
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,620
I am a merfolk.

679
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,050
Merfolk Tribe belongs to Nanzhao.

680
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,660
I am a Golden Merfolk.

681
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:10,940
Golden Merfolk went extinct decades ago.

682
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,430
Since I can remember,

683
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,770
I have never seen any
of my tribe members.

684
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,660
Only Changning Pharmacist

685
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,050
knows about this matter.

686
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,100
Then why did you tell us?

687
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,530
Aren't friends supposed
to have no secrets?

688
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:24,750
Don't worry.

689
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,420
We will keep your secret.

690
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,840
Shadow,

691
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,330
send someone to Nanzhao

692
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,730
to bring Xiaosheng here.

693
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,430
Alright.

694
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,150
Your Highness,

695
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:51,560
Physician Gu
just gave Mr. Baili some medicine.

696
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,670
He instructed
that he would become drowsy.

697
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,630
I am worried
that he might catch a cold at night.

698
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,040
So I added an extra blanket for him.

699
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,840
I will also stay by his side all night.

700
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,010
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

701
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,990
Ten,

702
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,330
thank you for your work.

703
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:05,490
When I was not around,

704
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,570
thank you
for taking care of His Highness.

705
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,150
This is part of my duty.

706
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,560
I'm just afraid I'm too clumsy

707
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,810
to take good care of His Highness.

708
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:17,190
In the future,

709
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,420
just take good care of Fourth Princess.

710
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,660
Let him rest for a while.

711
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,250
Let's go back first.

712
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,140
Hongyi is not here.

713
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,320
If you need anything,

714
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,290
you can also call for Ten.

715
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,570
Having you is enough for me.

716
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,220
Why does that sound so cheesy?

717
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:43,880
What do you mean?

718
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,800
Cheesy.
