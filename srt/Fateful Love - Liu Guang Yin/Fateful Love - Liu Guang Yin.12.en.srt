Now you understand what we want, right?

22

I understand.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,230
Xiling's Chu Feiyan.

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,440
They'll think our terms

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
are too harsh.

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,960
It depends on how you persuade them.

27
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
I've thought it over.

28
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,670
Wait for the news.

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
Beiyue.

30
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,600
You...

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,510
Did you send her to talk to Chu Feiyan?

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
Beiyue.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,510
Though Xiling is seeking peace,

34
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,280
we haven't gained the upper hand.

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,040
Why are you here?

36
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:57,990
To negotiate.

37
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
You're kidding.

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Where is Jun Beiyue?

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,840
Fourth Princess Han Ziqing of Tianque

40
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,760
is here on behalf of the Tianque royal family

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,150
to accept Xiling's peace request.

42
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,040
Did Jun Beiyue send you?

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
Of course.

44
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,070
Why should it be you?

45
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,840
Why should he send you?

46
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:23,630
Princess Feiyan.

47
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,840
How sincere are you?

48
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,590
Sincerity?

49
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,200
Let's see your sincerity first.

50
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,150
I've been waiting here for two hours

51
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,230
for Jun Beiyue,

52
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,790
not you.

53
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,590
This is a city captured by Tianque.

54
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,840
You are the envoy seeking peace.

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,590
If you don't even have

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,230
basic sincerity,

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,790
then please go back.

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,510
Do you think

59
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,590
Xiling is really seeking peace?

60
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,430
What else?

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,960
You've been waiting here for four hours.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
What are you doing?

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,590
Tell Jun Beiyue to come.

64
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
Otherwise, I...

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,880
Otherwise what?

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Will you give it up?

67
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,070
I'm warning you again, Han Ziqing.

68
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,960
Tell Jun Beiyue to come.

69
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,630
If Tianque shows such a lack of sincerity

70
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,310
by sending a woman to negotiate,

71
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
don't blame Xiling for being unreasonable.

72
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,030
Aren't you a woman too?

73
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,310
Since you're so lacking in sincerity,

74
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
goodbye.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,400
An envoy must have its status.

76
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,750
I'm not representing Princess Feiyan today.

77
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,510
I'm representing Xiling's generals.

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,560
And you?

79
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
Are you here as a concubine's daughter?

80
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,280
Does having status mean we can negotiate?

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,190
Of course.

82
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
Then look at this.

83
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,960
Seeing this ring is like
seeing the Fourth Prince.

84
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,160
Jun Beiyue's scorpion ring.

85
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
Princess Feiyan.

86
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,190
Can we negotiate now?

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,350
What's your plan?

88
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,000
That depends on whether Tianque

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,070
accepts our conditions.

90
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,960
Let's hear it.

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,000
We want Tianque to never ally with Dongling.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,350
For the next five years,
you shall not wage war against Xiling.

93
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,880
So, does that mean

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,750
your country will no longer
seek passage through Tianque

95
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,470
but the Snow Region?

96
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,280
The flames of war won't reach Tianque.

97
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,350
You would agree with that.

98
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,750
(This condition.)

99
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,070
(Jun Beiyue might accept it.)

100
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,310
(If he agrees,)

101
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,720
(the border will have
at least 5 years of peace.)

102
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,280
(Xiling's conflict would shift)

103
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,030
(to the Snow Region.)

104
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,000
In that case,

105
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,880
if Xiling agrees to a few
of Tianque's conditions,

106
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,070
Tianque might consider

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Xiling's proposal.

108
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,470
Let's hear it.

109
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,070
Not much.

110
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,910
We have only three conditions.

111
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,150
First,

112
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,750
Xiling must acknowledge

113
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,000
that the three western cities,

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,510
Yihe City,

115
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,280
and Erhe City

116
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,280
belong to Tianque's territory.

117
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,590
Second,

118
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,280
compensate for the war losses
with 20,000 war horses.

119
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
Third,

120
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,910
King of Xiling must publicly apologize

121
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,120
to the people of both countries.

122
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,680
Who gave you the audacity

123
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,720
to make such demands?

124
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,280
I did.

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,960
Apologies are fine.

126
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,440
Xiling can afford the 20,000 horses,

127
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,440
but Tianque must return
the five cities to us.

128
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,280
Otherwise,

129
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,600
Xiling will never withdraw its troops.

130
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,350
If that's the case,

131
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,560
a five-year ceasefire
is impossible for Tianque.

132
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,280
What did you say?

133
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,600
Returning the five cities is impossible.

134
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,750
If you can't make the decision,

135
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
I won't waste words with you.

136
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:17,350
Xiling is indeed seeking peace,

137
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,310
but

138
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,560
if you walk out this door today,

139
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,440
the war between us
will continue because of you.

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,350
Think carefully.

141
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,520
Han Ziqing.

142
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,350
I agree.

143
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,820
(Truce)

144
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,940

150
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,960
wants to marry you.

151
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,190
At least you're somewhat useful.

152
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,030
He can use you.

153
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,990
Do you think he really likes you?

154
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,280
He's just using you.

Who would like a withered flower?

156
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,510
That means you're useless.

157
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,990
I'm going to kill you.

158
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,830
Dare you?

159
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,190
I need to remind you.

160
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,510
If you dare touch me,

161
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,800
you'll break the rules of the continent,

162
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
and you'll never

163
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,240
return to Xiling in this lifetime.

164
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,390
Go ahead.

165
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,070
I also want to ask you.

166
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,160
After losing your virtue in Grandeur Palace,

167
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,990
will Jun Beiyue still touch you?

168
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,400
Whether he touches me or not, I don't care.

169
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,480
You didn't disappoint me.

170
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,390
Xin'er.

171
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,360
Brother Beiyue.

172
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,670
Brother Beiyue.

173
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,550
Brother Beiyue.

174
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,920
Did you sneak out again?

175
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,110
I was so bored.

176
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,510
But I left a letter at home,

177
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,350
saying I came here.

178
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,160
By the way, let me introduce you.

179
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,480
This is Miss Situ Xin'er

180
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,320
from the Situ family.

181
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,910
Xin'er.

182
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,880
Hurry up.

183
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,510
Greet my wife.

184
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,920
So you're the famous Han Ziqing

185
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,750
from Grandeur Palace.

186
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,960
Am I that famous?

187
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,320
Yes.

188
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,870
Your reputation

189
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,870
is well-known across the Longyuan Continent.

190
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,960
Stop talking nonsense.

191
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
So well-known.

192
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,200
Are you jealous?

193
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,480
Be quiet. Don't say more.

194
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,190
Shadow, take Miss Situ back quickly.

195
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,720
- Yes.
- Why go back?

196
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
I want to stay with Brother Beiyue.

197
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:14,150
Xin'er.

198
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:17,830
Go.

199
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,510
Every time I see you, you cause trouble.

200
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,600
Prepare to return to the city.

201
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,440
Yes.

202
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,160
Xiling has invaded our borders.

203
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,310
The princess actually managed
to make King of Xiling

204
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,310
apologize to the people of both countries.

205
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,160
Isn't it Xiling slapping itself in the face?

206
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,560
Your Highness.

207
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,670
From these two terms,

208
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,360
it seems Xiling is aiming
for the Snow Region.

209
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,880
- Shadow.
- Yes.

210
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,240
Have you found her?

211
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,080
Your Highness.

212
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,600
I've searched everywhere

213
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,800
but haven't found the princess.

214
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,840
Brother Beiyue.

215
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,070
I offended her.

216
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,750
If necessary, I'll find her myself.

217
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,670
You...

218
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,750
Once your brother arrives,

219
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,480
you should return with him.

220
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,920
This is not a place for you.

221
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,510
Shadow,

222
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
take Xin'er away.

223
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,390
Yes.

224
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,470
Beiyue.

225
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,550
We're returning to the royal city.

226
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,630
No time to lose.

227
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,280
We should discuss how to report to Father.

228
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,000
Second Brother,

229
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,070
you don't need to worry

230
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,360
about the merits and rewards.

231
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,470
What do you mean?

232
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,360
Do I have no credit
for going to war with you?

233
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,800
I ordered you to lead
20,000 troops as the vanguard.

234
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,320
And you?

235
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:45,600
You retreated outside the city,

236
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,990
losing several thousand troops.

237
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,080
Second Brother,

238
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,670
you should have known better

239
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,480
about the merits and rewards.

240
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,240
The 20,000 troops
were withdrawn by your order.

241
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,080
You...

242
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,120
Fine.

243
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,870
I won't argue with you today.

244
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,400
When we return to the royal city,
let Father decide.

245
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,550
I've already reported this matter to Father.

246
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,310
Good, Beiyue.

247
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,550
I risked my life to accompany you to war,

248
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,870
not to play around.

249
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,070
- Prince.
- Speak.

250
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,910
Jun Beiyue has left.

251
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,670
Where's Situ Xin'er?

252
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:47,510
Still in the camp.

253
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes.

254
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,960
Aren't you trying

255
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,720
to credit Han Ziqing with the achievements?

256
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,800
Today, I'll make sure she can't get away,

257
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,110
settling both old and new scores.

258
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,360
Miss Situ, His Highness has ordered

259
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,310
that you cannot leave

260
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,550
until he returns.

261
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,110
I'm a guest, not a prisoner.

262
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,310
Why can't I go out?

263
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,630
What's the matter?

264
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,960
Who made Miss Situ so angry?

265
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
Who else

266
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,960
but that vixen, Han Ziqing?

267
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,600
Brother Beiyue is also to blame.

268
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,990
I came all this way to find him,

269
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,400
and he doesn't spare me some time.

270
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,840
He's too focused on his business.

271
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,040
(Longyuan Continent)

272
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,480
Han Ziqing went out,
and he was looking for her.

273
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,550
What a vixen.

274
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,750
Beiyue has always

275
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,750
been a busy person.

276
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,040
Sorry for that.

277
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,600
I also have some urgent matters
to discuss but can't find him.

278
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,960
What should we do?

279
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,550
What do you need to see Brother Beiyue for?

280
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,960
It's not a big deal,

281
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,040
but I need Beiyue to check it out.

282
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,400
What is it?

283
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,990
Stop keeping me in suspense.

284
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,400
A soldier found a cave

285
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,920
not far from our camp,

286
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,750
filled with boxes.

287
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,600
It's suspected to be left by Xiling's troops.

288
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,040
But now no one dares to touch it.

289
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,240
Beiyue needs to see it.

290
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,990
Could it be treasure?

291
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,040
Take me there quickly.

292
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,760
Beiyue said you shouldn't go out.

293
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,310
What if something happens to you?

294
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,880
What could happen?

295
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,520
I've grown up already.

296
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,910
Brother Beichen.

297
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,270
Just take me there.

298
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,390
If there really is treasure,

299
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,430
and you're afraid to open,

300
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,030
I'll take responsibility.

301
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,310
If Brother Beiyue blames you later,

302
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,150
I'll cover for you.

303
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,840
Brother Beichen.

304
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,760
Really?

305
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,840
Really, really.

306
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
Let's go, let's go.

307
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,390
No.

308
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,720
There are guards at the door.

309
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,760
Brother Beichen.

310
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,260
Let's go.

311
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,550
I'll take her to find Jun Beiyue.

312
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,990
Yes.

313
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,360
Princess, why are you here?

314
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,670
The prince is searching for you.

315
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,720
Who exactly is Situ Xin'er?

316
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,070
She is Situ Haonan's sister.

317
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,480
He's a close friend of His Highness

318
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,000
and the young lord of Jian'an City.

319
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,190
His Highness always treats her
like his sister,

320
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,190
doting on her.

321
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,000
But apart from His Highness,

322
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,240
she looks down on everyone else.

323
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,640
Why is she with the Second Prince?

324
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,480
Where are they going?

325
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,600
Princess, where are you going?

326
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,110
Just ahead.

327
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:04,960
Slow down.

328
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,000
Miss Situ, slow down.

329
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,480
This path is too difficult to walk.

330
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,150
By the way, Miss Situ,

331
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,430
why isn't your brother here?

332
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,190
Could it be that you snuck out to find Beiyue

333
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,550
without telling your family again?

334
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,550
I'm not a child.

335
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,480
I won't get lost.

336
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,120
I see you came to see the Fourth Princess.

337
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,120
My sister-in-law is indeed
talented and beautiful

338
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,520
and has great abilities.

339
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,910
No wonder Beiyue trusts her,

340
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,550
even giving her the scorpion ring.

341
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,070
I originally thought

342
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,960
that apart from Miss Situ,

343
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,270
Beiyue wouldn't marry anyone else.

344
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
It's a pity.

345
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,550
Why can Han Ziqing
become the Fourth Princess?

346
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,960
Why do you all think she's good,

347
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,310
but I can't see it at all?

348
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,790
Miss Situ, slow down.

349
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,760
How much further?

350
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,360
- Brother.
- Who is it?

351
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,440
Brother Beichen.

352
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Who are you?

353
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
- What do you want?
- We are ordered here

354
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,240
to remove the excess women around Jun Beiyue.

355
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,320
Kill her.

356
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,790
Help!

357
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,430
Help!

358
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,840
Help!

359
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,030
Help!

360
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,910
Help!

361
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,480
Help!

362
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,000
(Jun Beichen)

363
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,600
(wants to kill Situ Xin'er)

364
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,440
(and frame me.)

365
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,000
(He wants to use someone else to kill me.)

366
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,760
(How vicious.)

367
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,840
Despicable.

368
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,030
Retreat.

369
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,030
Miss Situ.

370
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,720
Miss Situ, how are you?

371
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Were you hurt?

372
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,000
Han Ziqing, how dare you try to kill me?

373
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,960
Ziqing, what are you doing?

374
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,240
If I really wanted to kill you,

375
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,390
you wouldn't be talking here.

376
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,550
- You harmed me.
- Princess.

377
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,840
You wicked woman.

378
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,240
Miss Situ, you misunderstood.

379
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,480
Miss Situ, calm down.

380
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,360
The princess is not...

381
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,150
You have no say in this.

382
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:08,990
Ziqing, you...

383
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,070
My people are not for you to hit.

384
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,720
How dare you hit me?

385
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,600
I hit you to teach you respect.

386
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,310
I only hit a servant.

387
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,190
Servants are people.

388
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,600
Fine.

389
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,070
You want to fight?

390
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,910
I'll fight you.

391
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,270
Let go of me.

392
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,310
- Stop.
- Miss Situ.

393
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,310
You wicked woman.

394
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,790
- I'll kill you.
- Miss Situ.

395
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,360
- Miss Situ.
- Move.

396
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,790
- Kill you.
- You'll get justice.

397
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,600
Miss Situ, stop.

398
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,030
Let's see where you're hurt.

399
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,960
Where are you hurt?

400
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,440
Your Highness.

401
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,390
What do you want?

402
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,720
You play the guqin really well.

403
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,070
- Upset?
- No.

404
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,790
Your face is almost on the floor.

405
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,370
Don't lie to me.

406
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,600
I heard about today's events.

407
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,630
Your good intentions were misunderstood.

408
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,840
You were wronged.

409
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,700
Xin'er has been willful

410
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,540
since childhood.

411
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,060
But she's not a bad person.

412
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,580
She's just stubborn

413
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,700
and easily manipulated.

414
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,980
You're magnanimous.

415
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,220
Don't argue with a child.

416
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,980
Okay?

417
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
Tell that girl

418
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,980
not to provoke me anymore.

419
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,780
I've already scolded her.

420
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,060
She knows she's wrong.

421
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,860
She specifically asked me

422
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,740
to apologize to you on her behalf.

423
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,940
Alright.

424
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,140
I can see

425
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,980
that she likes you.

426
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,300
So that's why

427
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,540
you've been uncomfortable.

428
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,060
I didn't.

429
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,980
You didn't what?

430
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,020
You care about me so much.

431
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,420
Xin'er is

432
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
my good friend

433
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,580
Situ Haonan's younger sister.

434
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,540
The three of us grew up together.

435
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,380
I really treat Xin'er

436
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,020
as my sister.

437
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,700
So don't overthink.

438
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,420
You don't need to explain to me.

439
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,340
I don't care about it.

440
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,900
Is that so?

441
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,740
Then if one day

442
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,460
I really make Xin'er my concubine,

443
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,980
would you be willing?

444
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
As long as you want.

445
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,100
Rest early.

446
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:06,980
Princess,

447
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:11,500
I advise you not to be angry
with His Highness.

448
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,060
It's not good for either of you.

449
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,980
Actually, I can see

450
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,780
that you both have feelings for each other,

451
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,540
but neither of you wants to admit it.

452
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,940
I don't.

453
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,140
Actually, men

454
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,340
are quite easy to coax.

455
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,100
Crying, acting spoiled.

456
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,340
These methods work well.

457
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,420
As long as you show him you care.

458
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,260
You can leave now.

459
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
(This is just a dream.)

460
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,260
(I will wake up.)

461
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,860
(Everyone here)

462
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,660
(is irrelevant.)

463
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,020
(They don't matter.)

464
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,020
Xuanyuan Lige?

465
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,540
This is Tianque's territory.

466
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,380
How dare he come?

467
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,180
Xuanyuan Lige.

468
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,020
You're quite bold.

469
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,370
Just a rotten corpse.

470
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,780
If he wants it,

471
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,940
take it.

472
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,180
Perfect timing.

473
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,620
I have some questions for you.

474
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,220
Alright.

475
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,500
Let's talk.

476
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,180
Where did you learn guqin from my mother?

477
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,060
Qinse Valley.

478
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,620
Qinse Valley?

479
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,100
Where is that?

480
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,940
Qinse Valley is on a small island.

481
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,500
It's called Liuxian Island.

482
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
I'm an Islander,

483
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,420
and so is my mother.

484
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,260
Right?

485
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,140
Did you know my mom was

486
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,740
an Islander before we met?

487
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,740
No.

488
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
And

489
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,620
why did you insist I learn "Lishang"?

490
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,420
When your mother

491
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,700
was teaching me this,

492
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,660
she once told me

493
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,980
that behind this piece

494
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,940
lay a huge secret.

495
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,220
This secret concerns
the entire Longyuan Continent.

496
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,730
She placed her hope

497
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,660
of uncovering this secret on me.

498
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,740
But I am dull-witted.

499
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,820
After she left,

500
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,100
I haven't played "Lishang" completely since.

501
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,340
Luckily, I met you.

502
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,580
You are her daughter.

503
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,060
You must be better.

504
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,100
Ziqing,

505
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,460
learning the whole piece of

506
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,140
is not only for your mother's wish

507
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,100
but also for the continent.

508
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,500
You're willing to try.

509
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,100
Right?

510
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,820
(Does this piece really have
such a big effect?)

511
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,580
(If I solve the secret of "Lishang",)

512
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,820
(can I go home?)

513
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,980
Ziqing?

514
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,260
What's on your mind?

515
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,780
Nothing.

516
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,220
Alright, I promise you.

517
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,980
I'll learn the piece.

518
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,700
Show me how to play it.

519
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,660
Okay.

520
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,340
You seem to have lost a lot of weight.

521
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,060
Do you feel better?

522
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
You look great.

523
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,260
You've recovered.

524
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,380
Come on.

525
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,380
Show me your fingers.

526
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,540
Do this with me.

527
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,380
What's this for?

528
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,740
Does it hurt?

529
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,060
A little sore.

530
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,700
It seems you've practiced the guqin well.

531
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,420
"Lishang" has ten volumes in total.

532
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,540
If your fingers start to feel sore,

533
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
it means you've practiced the first volume.

534
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,220
Congratulations.

535
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,180
"Lishang" not only strains
the mind but also the hands.

536
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,820
Yes.

537
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,380
But aside from you,

538
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,340
no one else can play it.

539
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,020
So even if it hurts, endure it.

540
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,820
Come on.

541
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,260
Play what you've learned for me.

542
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,780
Xuanyuan Lige.

543
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,620
You let the princess of Tianque

544
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,900
play the guqin for you so late.

545
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,900
Did you get permission from me?

546
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,940
Why are you here?

547
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,700
Princess, what are you doing?

548
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,780
Are you afraid I'll kill him?

549
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,940
Since I decided to spare him

550
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,780
at the gate,

551
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,580
I won't go back on my word.

552
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,820
Just a worthless life.

553
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,100
If you want it, take it.

554
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,780
Since you said it's a worthless life,

555
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,380
what's the use

556
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,460
of taking it?

557
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Get down now.

558
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,740
What's wrong?

559
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,940
Why say such things?

560
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,700
Mr. Xuanyuan,

561
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,220
if I were in your place,

562
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,460
I wouldn't have this mood

563
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,460
in a time of national crisis.

564
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,980
Let's go.

565
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,700
I've said not to be lenient with that woman,

566
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,260
but you didn't listen.

567
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,860
If you keep sneaking around to follow me,

568
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,540
don't blame me for being rude.

569
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
What does that mean?

570
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,380
Wasn't it you who invited me?

571
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,060
I just arrived a bit early.

572
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,740
What agreement did Jun Beiyue
and Xiling sign?

573
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,300
Remember.

574
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,220
You've betrayed me once.

575
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,500
If you play any tricks in this cooperation,

576
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,980
don't blame me for turning against you.

577
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,940
Between you and me,

578
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,580
it's only about benefit.

579
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,580
Contracts can be made or broken.

580
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,580
What's there to say?

581
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,570
It's the agreement
between Tianque and Xiling.

582
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,540
Why does it all depend on Jun Beiyue?

583
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,580
(The content of the ceasefire agreement)

584
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,260
Xiling's ambitions are quite large.

585
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,820
If they really destroy

586
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,340
the weak Snow Region tribe,

587
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,600
it will threaten

588
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,090
your Dongling.

589
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:59,100
(The content of the ceasefire agreement)

590
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,740
This agreement was negotiated

591
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,420
and signed by Han Ziqing.

592
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,460
Do you think that woman is easy to deal with?

593
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,860
She's as ruthless

594
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,140
as Jun Beiyue is,

595
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,300
acting without mercy.

596
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,100
Why are you staring at me?

597
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,660
I know

598
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,060
you want to be friends with that woman.

599
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,020
You should know better than I do.

600
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,860
You

601
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,580
can only be enemies.

602
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,620
Are you lecturing me?

603
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,020
We're partners.

604
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,620
We should rely on each other.

605
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,140
Jun Beiyue is so arrogant now.

606
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,860
Can you swallow this anger?

607
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,740
I don't need you to stir up trouble.

608
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,780
I know what to do

609
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,140
when the time comes.

610
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,780
(Ziqing.)

611
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,820
(Even so, I won't blame you.)

612
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,260
(I'm dying soon.)

613
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,340
(For the days I have,)

614
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,860
(I'll protect you as long as I can.)

615
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,620
Your Highness, what's wrong?

616
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,700
Are you asking me?

617
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,460
Do you know what you were doing just now?

618
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,740
I was learning the guqin.

619
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,340
A man and a woman learning the guqin so late?

620
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,780
I acted properly

621
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,020
and did nothing wrong.

622
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,260
Han Ziqing, do you think
you've done nothing wrong?

623
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,740
You are my princess.

624
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,780
In the dead of night,

625
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,540
what you did is inappropriate.

626
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,580
Your Highness,

627
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,900
are you jealous?

628
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,340
What do you mean?

629
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,220
You're acting like this now.

630
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,920
So you're retaliating, aren't you?

631
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,340
Why would I retaliate?

632
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,240
It's none of my business.

633
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,330
Just go.

634
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,020
If you want to play,

635
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,930
go ahead.

636
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,620
Alright, I'll go practice the guqin.

637
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,640
Stop.

638
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,780
What is it?

639
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,780
Han Ziqing, I've exhausted

640
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,100
all my patience with you.

641
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,380
Alright.

642
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,780
Whether you learn the guqin

643
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,620
or take a master,

644
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,300
do whatever you want.

645
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,300
I won't interfere anymore.

646
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:09,620
Okay, Your Highness.

647
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,220
Get up.

648
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,550
- What for?
- You.

649
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,700
You still spent money on alcohol.

650
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,420
We can't even afford food now.

651
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,020
If this continues,

652
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,280
the innkeeper will kick us out.

653
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,500
Why disturb my peaceful dream?

654
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,410
What do you think we should do next?

655
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,940
Tell the innkeeper to give us

656
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,860
a few more days.

657
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,500
Once it's done, I'll definitely pay.

658
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,380
Then you

659
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,300
hurry up

660
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,860
and catch that girl

661
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,700
to get it done.

662
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,140
Isn't it uncertain if she's an Islander?

663
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,740
We don't even know where she is now.

664
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,460
- Wait, wait.
- Then hurry up and find her.

665
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,140
Otherwise, we won't be able
to return to Nanzhao

666
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,380
or stay in Tianque.

667
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,650
We'll sleep on the streets.

668
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,450
We lack big money, not small change.

669
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,060
Don't worry.

670
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:30,940
You, you...

671
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:32,620
Drink, drink, drink.

672
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,210
Drink yourself to death, you fool.

673
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,620
Get up.

674
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,980
I never get drunk despite the time.

675
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,820
Get up.

676
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,940
Master, the celebration banquet
is very lively.

677
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,090
Let's go and have a look.

678
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,380
Yes, it's really lively down there.

679
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,220
Master.

680
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,380
If you want to join the fun,

681
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,420
you can go.

682
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,580
They must be arguing again.

683
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,180
They quarrel and reconcile.

684
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,860
We maids are worried.

685
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,380
In this battle, we achieved a great victory.

686
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,980
It was won with the lives of our brothers.

687
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,460
Come on.

688
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,060
