=Episode 3=

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,480
Father, you summoned me urgently.

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,090
Could it be

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,840
that you just want me to play chess
with you?

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,450
Has the matter of selecting a consort
been settled?

25
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,930
Yes.

26
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,970
Which family's young lady

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
was chosen?

28
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,570
Father.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,360
Why do you ask
when you've already known the answer?

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Haven't you been asking me

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,690
to marry with Chancellor Han's daughter?

32
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,690
I will

33
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,240
comply with it.

34
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,160
It sounds

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,490
that

36
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,080
you are somewhat unwilling.

37
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,330
No, I'm not.

38
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,570
But the person you chose

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,720
is truly unexpected.

40
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
Father.

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,690
Since I have already complied with

42
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,570
your wish

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,720
to marry Chancellor Han's daughter.

44
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,850
As for choosing which daughter

45
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,990
from the Chancellor Han's Mansion,

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
can I make my own decision?

47
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,930
Play chess then.

48
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:19,020
(Tianqi)

49
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,530
Shadow.

50
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,250
Gu.

51
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,690
Where is His Highness?

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,800
He has been inside for quite a while

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,880
and still hasn't come out.

54
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
I'm also anxious.

55
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,330
Let me tell you.

56
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,490
His Highness has caused trouble.

57
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,210
With his temperament,

58
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,690
he won't come out
without some punishment.

59
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,410
Well, I just don't understand.

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,850
Although that woman was poisoned
because of His Highness,

61
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,130
there was no need to marry her.

62
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,410
Then you have misunderstood

63
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,490
His Highness's intentions.

64
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,970
What do you mean?

65
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,410
Think about it.

66
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,570
Moxun is a rare poison in the world.

67
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,160
That woman was poisoned

68
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,600
yet she is living well.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,880
There must be something important
behind this.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,080
With His Highness's character,

71
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,760
how could he
not investigate it thoroughly?

72
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,040
That makes sense.

73
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,290
Moreover, that woman has even fought
with His Highness.

74
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,040
Her martial arts are quite impressive.

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,570
(Tianqi)
About why such a concubine's daughter

76
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,990
has such skills, we must find out the truth.

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,800
Keeping her close
will be more convenient indeed.

78
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,290
This move in chess is not good.

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,040
Just change it.

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,610
You are

81
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,800
still as stubborn as
when you were a child.

82
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,920
As long as you are determined,

83
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,200
even if you've known it's wrong,

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,240
you resolutely refuse to change.

85
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,800
Listen to me.

86
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,410
Change it.

87
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,850
Otherwise,

88
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,730
you will surely lose.

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,850
I have not lost yet.

90
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,360
This is just the beginning.

91
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,700
Will you change it or not?

92
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:55,010
The pieces are scattered,

93
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,040
so the outcome is already decided.

94
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:00,970
Father,

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,080
how can this be changed?

96
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,520
Beiyue,

97
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,890
if you don't like that Han Xi'er,

98
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,760
you can make her a concubine.

99
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,290
I will not oppose it.

100
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,730
But you

101
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:22,610
insist on marrying an infamous girl.

102
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,640
You are deliberately

103
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,920
bringing shame
to the Tianque royal family.

104
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,890
Jun Beiyue,

105
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,890
what are your true intentions?

106
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,130
I like her.

107
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,410
You…

108
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,010
Someone!

109
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,290
Your Majesty.

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,080
Lock him up for me.

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,240
Starve him for a few days first.

112
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,040
Your Majesty, this is not appropriate.

113
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,690
If you dare to plead for him,

114
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,640
I'll lock you up too.

115
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,970
No need to trouble you.

116
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:12,810
I'll go myself.

117
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,290
Starve him for a few days first.

118
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,200
If he doesn't change,

119
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,640
he can never come back.

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,610
Your Majesty.

122
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,480
Please stop stepping around.

123
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,640
Sit down and calm your anger.

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,040
Please sit.

125
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,640
Your Majesty,

126
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,970
take it easy.

127
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,240
Don't harm your health.

128
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,010
Take it easy?

129
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:56,170
Because of the few military achievements
he has made over the years,

130
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,240
he has been disregarding me.

131
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,240
How can I take it easy?

132
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,320
Your Majesty,

133
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,450
isn't it because you have
overly favored him?

134
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,800
Moreover,

135
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,690
the Fourth Prince
has unparalleled achievements,

136
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,760
and he has kept Tianque in peace.

137
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,970
Your Majesty,

138
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,890
but on the other hand,

139
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,690
if we give Beichen a chance,

140
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,130
he might not lose much.

141
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,570
Beichen.

142
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,930
You know how capable Beichen is.

143
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,290
He is not good

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,170
at leading troops,

145
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,000
but does well at forming factions.

146
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
Your Majesty,

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,520
now it's Beiyue who has upset you.

148
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,730
Why bring Beichen into this?

149
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,090
Moreover,

150
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,760
you wanted Beiyue
to marry Chancellor Han's daughter.

151
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,170
That was originally a kind gesture.

152
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,680
But he didn't have to bring back
an infamous woman.

153
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,680
He deliberately chose such a woman.

154
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,080
That was clearly to oppose you.

155
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,520
Alright, alright.

156
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,360
Stop talking.

157
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,880
This still requires you
to personally handle it.

158
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Your Majesty, rest assured.

159
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,120
For the prestige of the royal family,

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,680
I will have to play the villain.

161
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,080
You understand me best.

162
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,770
Your Majesty.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,490
Will the Fourth Prince return tonight?

164
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,640
I don't know.

165
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,850
But His Highness never stays overnight
in the palace.

166
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,990
- He should be coming back.
- Cui'er.

167
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,760
Watch your mouth.

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,810
You are so talkative.

169
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,650
I might as well mute you.

170
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,640
Hongyi,

171
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,930
Princess Consort asked me that.

172
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,370
Since when is she a Princess Consort?

173
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,440
You call her so affectionately.

174
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,960
Leave.

175
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,010
Yes.

176
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,120
Miss Han,

177
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,490
you'd better not wait.

178
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,490
The Fourth Prince is busy
with official duties.

179
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,640
Even if he returns, he won't have time
to come over.

180
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
Alright, I understand.

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
You may leave.

182
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,600
Wait.

183
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,330
I'm hungry.

184
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,400
Get me something to eat.

185
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,810
Hongyi.

186
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
What is it?

187
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,680
Someone from Yiqing Palace is here.

188
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,520
Yiqing Palace?

189
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
It's almost dark.

190
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,520
What are they here for?

191
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
I'm not quite sure.

192
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,250
The Queen has issued a decree.

193
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,930
She invites Miss Han to the palace.

194
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,680
But His Highness has ordered

195
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,000
that Miss Han is not allowed to leave.

196
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,400
Hongyi,

197
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,410
do you dare to defy the decree?

198
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,350
(The Queen has always been at odds
with His Highness.)

199
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,100
(It's not worth offending her
over Han Ziqing.)

200
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,560
(If something really happens,
it would be good.)

201
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
(It would just get rid of this woman)

202
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,830
(and save His Highness
from being ridiculed.)

203
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,610
(Moreover, it would provide an excuse
to trouble the Queen.)

204
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,760
(Killing three birds with one stone.)

205
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,850
(Why not do it?)

206
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,610
I dare not.

207
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,640
I'll get the carriage ready now.

208
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:13,810
Miss Han.

209
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,250
Then let's have a meal at Yiqing Palace.

210
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
Let's go.

211
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,960
Stop right there.

212
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,040
This has nothing to do with you.

213
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,760
You were suddenly summoned
to the palace.

214
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,850
Aren't you afraid at all?

215
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,930
What should I be afraid of?

216
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,610
Yiqing Palace is not a simple place.

217
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,050
It's easy to go in but hard to leave.

218
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:57,890
Is that so?

219
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,850
I'm even more looking forward to it.

220
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,760
You do have some courage.

221
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,560
I underestimated you before.

222
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,050
The Queen is summoning me
to the palace at this time.

223
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:10,890
What could it be?

224
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,640
What else could it be?

225
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,410
It's to give our mansion a hard time.

226
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,330
A hard time?

227
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,880
She had a grudge
against the Fourth Prince?

228
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,000
The Fourth Prince's reputation
is widespread,

229
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,050
and the Queen has long seen him

230
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,680
as a thorn in her side.

231
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,730
She's afraid he will block the path
of the Second Prince Jun Beichen.

232
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,560
In recent years,

233
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,640
the Ouyang Family
has been gaining momentum,

234
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,610
and with her brother General Ouyang

235
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,000
backing her up,

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,850
she can no longer tolerate His Highness.

237
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,370
And now,

238
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,850
the Fourth Prince has allied with
the Chancellor's Mansion by marriage.

239
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,370
She naturally won't be happy.

240
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,040
I see.

241
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,330
So,

242
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,170
she's picking on me as the easy target.

243
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:06,060
(Tianqi)

244
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,550
When you get to the palace,

245
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,650
mind your manners.

246
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,850
You'll suffer.

247
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,420
(Tianqi)

248
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,490
Jingqin,

249
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,810
did your father like the tea
I gave him yesterday?

250
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,880
The tea you chose is always excellent,

251
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,610
so my father naturally likes it.

252
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,250
Your Majesty and General Ouyang

253
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,290
truly share a deep sibling bond.

254
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,320
General Ouyang

255
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,290
has made great contributions to Tianque,

256
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,680
and recently quelled
the southern rebellion.

257
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,200
I believe His Majesty will

258
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,930
reward him handsomely again this time.

259
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:21,640
The General's Mansion indeed has merits,

260
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,080
but where do you

261
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
put the Mansion of Fourth Prince at?

262
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,410
After all, the Fourth Prince is still young.

263
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,120
How could he be as mature and steady
as the General?

264
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,050
The grand scheme of Tianque

265
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,760
still requires an experienced general
like General Ouyang

266
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,290
to assist His Majesty.

267
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,130
Indeed.

268
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,760
Your Majesty, Han Ziqing has arrived.

269
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

270
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,730
She doesn't understand the rules at all.

271
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,930
She didn't perform the kneeling ceremony
when greeting Her Majesty.

272
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,320
Who knows if she doesn't understand,

273
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,410
or if she is unwilling?

274
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,250
I have lived a secluded life,

275
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,080
and don't know the palace rules.

276
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,810
As the saying goes, ignorance
is not to be blamed.

277
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,120
Your Majesty, as the mother of the nation,

278
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,290
wouldn't be harsh over such matters, right?

279
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,970
(Are they forcing me to kneel?)

280
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,370
(This girl is not simple.)

281
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,760
Which family

282
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,200
is Miss Han Ziqing from?

283
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,370
Your Majesty,

284
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,410
she is Chancellor Han's second daughter.

285
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,680
She has just been chosen
as the Fourth Princess Consort.

286
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,520
Nonsense!

287
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,610
His Majesty has not yet decreed it.

288
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,290
How can she be called a princess consort?

289
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,320
Since you're chosen
by the Fourth Prince himself,

290
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,730
you must be virtuous and talented,

291
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,080
and a top-notch talent.

292
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,810
Come over quickly.

293
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,290
Indeed, you have a beautiful appearance.

294
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,610
I heard you have a younger sister
who is also a beauty.

295
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,280
Mother,

296
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
you are mistaken.

297
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,680
This is the younger sister.

298
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,330
The younger sister?

299
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,080
How is that possible?

300
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,520
I heard that the sister

301
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,640
is a…

302
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,080
An infamous girl.

303
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,170
When in Grandeur Palace…

304
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,760
So it was her.

305
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,000
How can this be acceptable?

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,810
Has the Fourth Prince been bewitched
by her?

307
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,080
- I think so too.
- Exactly.

308
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,970
(I thought it was a big trap.)

309
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,680
(But it's just a bunch of gossip ladies.)

310
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,490
In my opinion,

311
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,800
there must be some misunderstanding.

312
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,130
She's chosen by the Fourth Prince.

313
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,680
How could she be an infamous person?

314
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,450
Ziqing,

315
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,530
about the matter in Grandeur Palace,

316
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:27,490
is it true?

317
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,850
Your Majesty,

318
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,770
- it's true.
- What?

319
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,030
You…

320
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,890
You still have the nerve to admit it.

321
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,850
Someone, come here.

322
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Did the Fourth Prince really choose her?

323
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,440
Your Majesty,

324
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,560
the Fourth Prince personally brought her
back to his mansion.

325
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,730
What should we do now?

326
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:51,280
How can our Tianque royal family

327
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,800
marry such a woman
as a princess consort?

328
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,490
- Indeed.
- If this gets out,

329
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,970
it would ruin
the royal family's reputation.

330
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,490
Your Majesty,

331
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,610
it was indeed the Fourth Prince

332
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,130
who personally brought me back.

333
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,440
If Your Majesty wants
to hold someone accountable,

334
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,850
then go ask the Fourth Prince.

335
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,130
Since the Fourth Prince
personally chose you,

336
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,040
he must have his reasons.

337
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,680
I am neither his biological mother,

338
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,800
nor is it appropriate for me
to interfere.

339
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,920
(So you understand it.)

340
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,000
Your Majesty is too kind.

341
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,520
Come on,

342
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,530
Ziqing.

343
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,010
Today I invited you here

344
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,040
to taste some tea.

345
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,370
This is the newly tributed
Autumn White Dew.

346
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,770
I specially saved it for you.

347
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,160
(Isn't this Huajin Poison?)

348
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,890
(The Huajin Poison won't let you
live through seven days.)

349
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,370
(Han Ziqing,)

350
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,800
(I want to see)

351
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,730
(if you can still live
to be the Princess Consort.)

352
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,530
You are too restrained.

353
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:27,450
Come here.

354
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,820
I will personally serve you tea.

355
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,800
Ziqing,

356
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,200
Mother treats you well.

357
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,610
You should not refuse her kindness.

358
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,010
Since Your Majesty
is personally serving tea,

359
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,970
how can I not drink it?

360
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,570
Thank you.

361
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,370
(If you're playing tricks,
I'll play with you.)

362
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,810
(Since you want to act,)

363
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,800
(why not make it real?)

364
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,530
How does it taste?

365
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,370
This tea has a strong color and aroma.

366
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Although it's autumn tea,

367
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,890
it is not inferior to the taste
of spring tea.

368
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,530
I didn't expect that you know about tea.

369
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,920
Alright, it's getting late.

370
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,200
Everyone should probably rest now.

371
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,160
Ziqing,

372
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,250
I won't keep you any longer.

373
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,680
Thank you for your hospitality,
Your Majesty.

374
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,490
By the way, Ziqing,

375
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,800
there's something I forgot to tell you.

376
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,920
His Majesty values the Fourth Prince,

377
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,320
so before the selection of the consort,

378
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,850
he had discussed it with Chancellor Han.

379
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,890
On the fourth day of next month, they will
go your home to announce the engagement.

380
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,200
There are only seven days left.

381
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,400
You should go back and prepare well.

382
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,010
(No wonder you chose a slow poison
like Huajin.)

383
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,560
(The poison will take effect
in seven days.)

384
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,990
(The decree will be announced
in seven days.)

385
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,530
(So the auspicious day you chose)

386
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,920
(is actually my death day.)

387
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,610
(I must expel the poison quickly.)

388
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,860
(Tianqi)

389
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,130
You come out so quickly.

390
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,970
Did they give you a hard time?

391
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,650
Did they do anything to you?

392
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:54,160
Say something.

393
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,160
What's wrong with you?

394
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,160
You, you…

395
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,080
- Are you okay?
- Shut up.

396
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:11,040
If you dare to say another word,

397
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
I'll cut your tongue out.

398
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,770
You seem like a different person.

399
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,330
Move aside.

400
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,680
Your Majesty,

401
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,130
drink this cup of tea and then rest.

402
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,280
Was it

403
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,560
handled properly?

404
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,770
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

405
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,080
The symptoms of Huajin Poison

406
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,890
are indistinguishable from those
of tuberculosis.

407
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,200
Ordinary doctors won't be able
to tell the difference.

408
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,800
That woman

409
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,370
will only lament her misfortune.

410
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,200
She has had this incurable disease,

411
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,530
before she could become
a princess consort.

412
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,920
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

413
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,770
Within seven days, that woman
will surely be dead.

414
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,200
You need not worry about it anymore.

415
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,370
Is there something on my face?

416
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,770
No.

417
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,650
Then why are you staring at me?

418
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,160
I, I…

419
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,010
I don't dare.

420
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,400
You were the one who sent me
to Yiqing Palace.

421
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,130
This poison in me

422
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
is thanks to you.

423
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,920
Your Highness,

424
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,040
I

425
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,440
fail to recognize a great person.

426
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,920
Please, spare me.

427
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,760
I won't dare anymore.

428
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,090
Won't dare what?

429
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,130
I won't dare to be disrespectful
to you anymore.

430
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,850
Don't look down on people anymore.

431
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,210
Hongyi,

432
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,200
about today's matter,

433
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
I can let it go.

434
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,440
If His Highness asks,

435
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,490
I will even help you explain.

436
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,770
Thank you, Your Highness.

437
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,370
Don't thank me yet.

438
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,040
I haven't finished speaking.

439
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,680
Please give your orders, Your Highness.

440
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,530
About everything that happened today,

441
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,040
you cannot tell anyone.

442
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,970
Not even His Highness?

443
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,490
The Fourth Prince and the Queen
are already at odds.

444
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,530
If their conflict escalates,

445
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,320
what if they start fighting?

446
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,010
I see.

447
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,970
I won't speak out.

448
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,610
I heard that the Fourth Prince

449
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,200
is quite remarkable.

450
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,160
Indeed,

451
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,440
that's the Fourth Prince.

452
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,770
Not just in Tianque,

453
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,160
but across the entire Longyuan Continent,

454
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,920
whether it's Xiling, which stands
against Tianque,

455
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,970
Tieyan, which borders Xiling,

456
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,010
the weakest Dongling,

457
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,530
or the powerful Nanzhao,

458
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,280
they all admire the Fourth Prince
greatly.

459
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,770
I see that the Fourth Prince

460
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,920
always carries a dagger.

461
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:55,920
That dagger is very exquisite.

462
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,770
Is it his treasure?

463
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,850
Since I entered the mansion,

464
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:04,010
I've seen the dagger on his waist.

465
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,970
He indeed cherishes it.

466
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,080
Always carries it?

467
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,160
Alright.

468
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,160
I see.

469
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,370
Don't talk to me anymore.

470
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,890
You, you…

471
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,890
This

472
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
wound…

473
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,520
Don't touch it.

474
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,240
Forget it.

475
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,610
After tomorrow night's dinner,

476
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,560
let Beiyue and the others go back.

477
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,700
That's not advisable, Your Majesty.

478
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,920
The Fourth Prince has many capable men
around him.

479
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,970
If he goes back,

480
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,680
and finds out that the woman is poisoned,

481
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,850
all our efforts will be in vain.

482
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,610
Release him on the sixth day.

483
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,200
By then,

484
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,970
the woman will be critically ill,

485
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:55,920
and beyond cure.

486
00:26:57,250 --> 00:27:00,770
Even if the Fourth Prince finds out,
it won't help.

487
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,590
You

488
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,010
have thought it through thoroughly.

489
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,090
Your Highness,

490
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,680
your medicine is ready.

491
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,680
What kind of medicine is this?

492
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,650
Are you feeling unwell?

493
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,280
I have my reasons.

494
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:37,530
Your Highness,

495
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,530
how are you resting in the new room?

496
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,890
Do the meals suit your taste?

497
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,040
Quite good. Keep it up.

498
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,090
Yes, Your Highness.

499
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,040
Yesterday, the Queen put on

500
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,520
such a big show in front of me.

501
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,160
I must repay her properly.

502
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,120
Is there anything else?

503
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,730
The Second Princess Consort
and Miss Ouyang Jingshi have arrived.

504
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,760
Who?

505
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,490
The Queen's niece.

506
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,440
Ouyang Jingqin and Ouyang Jingshi.

507
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,320
They are General Ouyang's daughters

508
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,550
and they are biological sisters.

509
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,970
Ouyang Jingqin

510
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,920
married her cousin Jun Beichen.

511
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Thus, the two families
are closely related.

512
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,200
She is the Second Princess Consort
I met yesterday.

513
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,090
Exactly.

514
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,440
The Second Princess Consort is good,

515
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,250
but her sister Ouyang Jingshi

516
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,400
is notoriously arrogant and spoiled.

517
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,020
But His Majesty is very fond of her.

518
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,660
If it weren't for her
being from the General's Mansion,

519
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,760
she would have been betrothed
to the Fourth Prince long ago.

520
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,830
She is here with ill intentions.

521
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,970
Your Highness,

522
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,770
Yiqing Palace
has always been dissatisfied

523
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,690
with the marriage alliance
between our two mansions.

524
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,500
These two sisters must be here
to cause trouble.

525
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,990
What should we do?

526
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,240
It's a good chance to test the medicine.

527
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,760
Come on,

528
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,000
change the clothes for me.

529
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,400
What an attitude she has,

530
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,200
making us wait here.

531
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
We are guests,

532
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,160
and she is the host.

533
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
Waiting a bit is no big deal.

534
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,970
What kind of host is she?

535
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,920
This is the Mansion of Fourth Prince.

536
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,920
What does it have to do
with that woman?

537
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,760
Jingshi,

538
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,850
mind your manners.

539
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,280
As the General's daughter,

540
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,400
you should not speak so crudely.

541
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,920
Sit down.

542
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,320
The Princess Consort has arrived.

543
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,520
Slow down.

544
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:45,450
Your Highness, be careful.

545
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,970
Be careful.

546
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:51,970
Sis.

547
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,160
Aunt is right.

548
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,130
This woman has been poisoned
by Huajin.

549
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,970
- Slow down.
- She won't survive much longer.

550
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,640
Be careful.

551
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:07,710
Your Highness.

552
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,610
I didn't know we had
such esteemed guests.

553
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:17,450
I

554
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,250
am gravely ill.

555
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,850
Apologize for not welcoming you
properly.

556
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:29,680
You're a concubine's daughter.

557
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,040
How dare you speak to us sisters.

558
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,160
Shameless.

559
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,970
What did you say?

560
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,810
You wretch.

561
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,450
You

562
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,010
say that again.

563
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,810
Your Highness.

564
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:44,770
Your Highness.

565
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,800
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

566
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,040
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness, wake up.

567
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,410
- Your Highness, what's wrong?
- Your Highness.

568
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,650
- Han Ziqing, what's wrong?
- Your Highness.

569
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,850
Call the imperial physician, hurry!

570
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,690
Yun Xi.

571
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
I told you to silence yourself.

572
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,220
If something happens to her now,

573
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,440
it will be because you make her angry.

574
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,770
How will you absolve yourself from this?

575
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,920
- Your Highness.
- Sis.

576
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,300
- I didn't expect this either.
- Your Highness.

577
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,680
Ziqing,

578
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,040
you must hold on.

579
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,320
The imperial physician is on his way.

580
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,490
Han Ziqing,

581
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,010
please wake up.

582
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,890
I'll apologize to you.

583
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,990
Please hold on there.

584
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,970
Don't drag me into this.

585
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,130
Why are you pointing at me?

586
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,650
It's not my fault.

587
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:44,850
Come here.

588
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,450
Hurry.

589
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,040
Get closer.

590
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,380
You said who's the wretch?

591
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,760
I...

592
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,040
Who's the wretch?

593
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,850
I am.

594
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,400
I am the wretch, alright?

595
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,080
Han Ziqing, I was wrong.

596
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,770
I won't speak out of turn again.

597
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,500
You must hold on.

598
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,680
And who am I?

599
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,920
You, you are

600
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:27,450
the Princess Consort appointed
by the Fourth Prince.

601
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,320
Alright?

602
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,650
Your Highness.

603
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,420
Ziqing,

604
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,610
you are the Fourth Princess Consort.

605
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,730
Such a great fortune is waiting for you.

606
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,290
You must hold on.

607
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,570
Sorry.

608
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,680
I vomited blood all over you.

609
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,530
I don't even know

610
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,250
if it is contagious or not.

611
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,250
Maybe in a few days,

612
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,530
you'll be just like me.

613
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,330
You…

614
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,130
You, you…

615
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,730
- You, you…
- What…

616
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,850
What about me?

617
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,690
Stop.

618
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:12,850
Jingshi means to say

619
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,440
you are the Princess Consort.

620
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,100
The Princess Consort.

621
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:17,970
Right, Jingshi?

622
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,370
Right, right.

623
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,400
You are the Princess Consort.

624
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,730
You can't die now.

625
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,600
- Your Highness.
- Where is the imperial physician?

626
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,760
Why hasn't he come yet?

627
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,200
If the Fourth Princess Consort's life
can't be saved today,

628
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,560
you all will lose your heads.

629
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,610
Your Highness.

630
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,160
The imperial physician is here.

631
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,010
Your Highness.

632
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,970
- Your Highness.
- Quickly, check her.

633
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,810
Yes.

634
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,770
Your Highness.

635
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
Physician, what's wrong
with Her Highness?

636
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,760
What's wrong?

637
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,920
Your…

638
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,280
Your Highness.

639
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,560
The Fourth Princess Consort

640
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,370
has contracted tuberculosis.

641
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,000
Is it serious?

642
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,250
Tuberculosis is an incurable disease.

643
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,490
There's no way to cure it.

644
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,330
But with acupuncture treatment,

645
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,570
it should be possible
to extend her life for a few days.

646
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,880
Then quickly apply her some needles,

647
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,050
so she can see the Fourth Prince
after he returns.

648
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:15,890
- Yes.
- Quickly.

649
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,280
Your Highness.

650
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,680
It's getting late.

651
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,120
We should leave now.

652
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,960
Sis.

653
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,570
Sis.

654
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,050
She just vomited blood all over me.

655
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,440
Will this poison be contagious?

656
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,250
I told you not to provoke her,
but you wouldn't listen.

657
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:39,590
How would I know
if it's contagious or not?

658
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,400
What should I do now?

659
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,360
Aunt just wanted me to join the fun.

660
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,880
(Prince Yao's Mansion)
What if I get infected?

661
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,730
What will I do then?

662
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,570
Shut up.

663
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,130
However,

664
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:01,400
when this poison acts up,

665
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,730
the symptoms
are exactly like tuberculosis.

666
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:05,330
Even the imperial physician
couldn't tell.

667
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,040
It seems

668
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,360
the Mansion of Fourth Prince

669
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,250
will have to prepare her funeral
in a few days.

670
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:14,170
Sis.

671
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,800
I don't care if anyone

672
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,970
will handle Han Ziqing's funeral.

673
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,600
I just want to know
if the blood she vomited on me

674
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,440
is contagious or not.

675
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,730
I shouldn't have brought you along.

676
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,250
With your behavior,

677
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,810
do you still want to marry Jun Beiyue?

678
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,650
If you marry him,

679
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
the General's Mansion will be sold out
by you.

680
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,610
Sis.

681
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,050
You acted quite well.

682
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,570
I learned it from Your Highness.

683
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,330
Let's go back to the West Garden.

684
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,120
Your Highness, aren't you disgusted?

685
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,650
Your Highness.

686
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,680
Your Highness.

687
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,840
It's okay. You all go about
to your business.

688
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,680
Leave, leave.

689
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,520
Your Highness,

690
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,010
- Your Highness.
- Are you feeling better?

691
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,730
Quickly, get some water.

692
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,640
- Hurry, hurry.
- Okay, okay.

693
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,840
This outfit is quite comfortable.

694
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,530
Yun Xi, take that blood-stained dress
to wash.

695
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,370
Yes.

696
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,400
Your Highness, it was so impressive
today.

697
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,280
Ouyang sisters

698
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,840
probably have never been as miserable
as today

699
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,680
in their entire lives.

700
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,480
Especially Ouyang Jingshi,

701
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,220
she was so scared of you
that her legs went weak.

702
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
Her makeup was ruined,

703
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,900
and she was sprayed with blood by you.

704
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,340
If I didn't know beforehand,

705
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,220
I would have thought
Your Highness was going to die.

706
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,660
Pff, pff!

707
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,660
I don't know

708
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,460
how to speak properly.

709
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,180
Go about your business.

710
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,610
By the way,

711
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,980
get some more duck blood.

712
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,500
Use the method I taught you before

713
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
to make more blood packs,

714
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,550
and keep them for future use.

715
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,660
I got it.

716
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,980
You scared me to death.

717
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,100
How did I teach you?

718
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,020
You don't even knock?

719
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,300
No manners.

720
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,380
If I have no manners,
it's because you taught me so.

721
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,900
You took me in,

722
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,340
but only to wander the world with me.

723
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,580
We are homeless and displaced.

724
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,740
What's there to be proud of?

725
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,580
Without me,

726
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,780
could you grow up?

727
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
If I met a wealthy family,

728
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,260
would I still be suffering here
with you?

729
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,820
Do wealthy families take that path?

730
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,300
It's just my bad luck to run into you.

731
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,260
Can this thing

732
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,020
test if that girl

733
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:36,860
is an Islander?

734
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,580
People from there are immune
to all poisons.

735
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,580
If she doesn't fall from this poison,

736
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,340
then she is an Islander.

737
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,300
But what if she isn't?

738
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,020
Then don't we

739
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,890
just get her killed?

740
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,980
Are you stupid?

741
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,620
If she wasn't,

742
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,180
we can just save her

743
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,340
with the antidote.

744
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Yes, you're right.

745
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,660
So you're saying

746
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,340
if we caught the right person,

747
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,900
is there really a bounty?

748
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,980
That's what the King of Nanzhao said
at the time.

749
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,820
Get up.

750
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,100
But

751
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,300
the Nanzhao royal family sent people
to find them,

752
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,340
not just us.

753
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:20,860
It's been so many years,

754
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,020
and no one has found them yet.

755
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,820
That's because they are not capable.

756
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,860
If we golden pair go,

757
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,820
wouldn't it

758
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,340
be easy?

759
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,180
Of course.

760
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,660
I've heard that these Islanders

761
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,820
are cruel and violent,

762
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,580
and they've committed
numerous evil deeds.

763
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,820
If we can catch one,

764
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,980
not only will we get the bounty,

765
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,780
but we will also be doing justice.

766
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,620
This…

767
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,340
(Wanshou Hall)

768
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:13,700
(Tianqi)

769
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,660
(Wanshou Hall)

770
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,820
Your Majesty,

771
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,340
the Fourth Prince is here.

772
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,100
Greetings to you,

773
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,580
Father.

774
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,760
Go back.

775
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,180
You won't leave?

776
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,500
You're staying here?

777
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,500
Do you think I want you to stay here,

778
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,980
and get angry with you?

779
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,900
I hope

780
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
you can fulfill my wish.

781
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,900
You've been starving for days,

782
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:15,260
yet you still have the strength
to negotiate with me?

783
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,700
Your Highness,

784
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,380
you have been starving for days.

785
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,260
You're harming your own body,

786
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,820
and it's breaking His Majesty's heart.

787
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,380
Beiyue,

788
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,060
we are both ruler and subject,

789
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,020
and father and son.

790
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,170
If you

791
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,170
are so determined,

792
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,280
as your father,

793
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,140
I will disregard the world's opinions

794
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,580
and fulfill your wish.

795
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,910
However,

796
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,400
I hope you

797
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,920
understand my difficulties

798
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,280
and do not resent me.

799
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,500
So you've agreed to let me

800
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,180
marry Han Ziqing?

801
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,180
Tell me, in this world,

802
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,820
which parents can be more stubborn
than their children?

803
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,420
I dare to ask you

804
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,540
to issue a decree

805
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,690
to confer with Han Ziqing
as my principle consort.

806
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,860
Alright,

807
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,020
I will fulfill your wish.

808
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:27,300
Tomorrow, I will have Yin Zhong
go to her home to announce the decree.

809
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,360
Now you can rest assured.

810
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,120
Thank you for your grace, Father.

811
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:41,120
(Wanshou Hall)

812
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,980
Master.

813
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,460
Your Highness.

814
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,460
You two have been waiting here
all this time?

815
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,100
I was just about to report to you.

816
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,420
His Majesty detained both me

817
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,340
and Physician Gu.

818
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,300
We were just released today.

819
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,740
That's my father.

820
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,700
By the way, Master,

821
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,980
a guard reported

822
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,980
that after you left,

823
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,420
the Fourth Princess Consort was invited
by the Queen for tea.

824
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,440
Later, the Fourth Princess Consort
contracted tuberculosis.

825
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,220
Tuberculosis?

826
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,500
Yes.

827
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,180
