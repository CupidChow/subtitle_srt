What are you doing?
Give me back my sheng.

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
Just borrowing it for a moment.

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,550
Who is she?

24
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,390
Yeah.

25
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,160
Is she here to cause trouble?

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
Will she?

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,930
Xiaosheng is...

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,650
Who is this?

30
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,730
Where does she come from?

31
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,730
How can she
play the Phoenix Tail Sheng?

32
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,670
Is she from Sheng Family?

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,100
How would Xiaosheng know this?

34
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,540
I don't know either.

35
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,830
Your Majesty.

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,260
- That's impressive.
- Amazing.

37
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,850
The Heavenly Pool has opened.

38
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,650
This young girl is remarkable.

39
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,190
Your Highness,

40
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,240
we found a few bodies

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,550
in the Heavenly Pool.

42
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,730
- Bodies?
- Bodies?

43
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,100
Bodies?

44
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,600
How could there be a body
in the Heavenly Pool?

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,830
Bring two bodies here.

46
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,030
- Why?
- Yes.

47
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,420
What happened here before?

48
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,830
It smells so bad.

49
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,670
Such an odor.

50
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,620
It is very strange.

51
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,490
King of Nanzhao,

52
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,650
do you

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,290
know about these bodies?

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,470
Fourth Prince, what do you mean by this?

55
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,700
How would I know?

56
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,190
They

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,650
are the Islanders.

58
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,980
You all may have heard the story

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,020
that the Puppet Islanders
brought disaster to the world.

60
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,740
But this is not the case.

61
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,100
We all know

62
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,140
that the totems on the faces
of the Islanders

63
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,540
are black,

64
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,890
but their totems are red.

65
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,390
Because they were trained

66
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,480
by malicious methods,

67
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,320
and thus became

68
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,880
the inhumane puppets.

69
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,020
The Islanders? Trained?

70
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,520
Who was training them?

71
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

72
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,370
- What training?
- What training?

73
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,140
The Islanders have borne the stigma
for a lifetime

74
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,770
and been buried beneath the ice lake.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,370
The one who should be responsible
for these killings is none other than

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,890
the honored

77
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,020
King of Nanzhao!

78
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,350
Nonsense.

79
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,720
What evidence do you have to accuse me?

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,210
Of course, I have evidence.

81
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,370
Even if the puppets' body is exposed,

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,760
the King of Nanzhao won't admit it.
What should we do then?

83
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,830
I have a solution.

84
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,100
The books in Archive Pavilion

85
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,600
record that if they're
going to train puppets,

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,740
they will have to use soul bugs.

87
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,820
As long as everyone sees

88
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,210
the soul bugs flying out of the bodies,

89
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,020
the King of Nanzhao
will be unable to escape from it.

90
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,300
What do they look like?

91
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,910
I'll draw one for you.

92
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,300
I've seen such bugs before.

93
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,980
When I was in Poisonous Grass World,

94
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,070
someone tried to use the bugs

95
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,020
to bewitch my mind.

96
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
Yes, they exist.

97
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,350
They are soul bugs.

98
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,450
They were secretly raised
by the Nanzhao Royal Family.

99
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,140
I'll catch a few at that time

100
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,610
to place them on the chest
of the fake bodies.

101
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,860
There really are little bugs
inside this body.

102
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,120
It...

103
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,100
Look, the little bug has disappeared!

104
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,160
It did disappear.

105
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,390
- Yes.
- Right.

106
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,450
How could it disappear?

107
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,330
Were they trained
by using this small thing?

108
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,490
After the Islanders are trained,

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,490
their facial totems will turn red,

110
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,650
and in their bodies,

111
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,260
there will be a soul bug.

112
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,840
This is a soul bug.

113
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,170
Throughout the Longyuan Continent,

114
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,930
they can only be found
in Nanzhao Royal Family's ancient cave.

115
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,300
The Islanders were imprisoned
by the King of Nanzhao.

116
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
After they were trained,

117
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
their minds and actions
were no longer under their control,

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
so there's the legend

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,300
that they were cruel and brought disaster
to the Longyuan Continent.

120
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,000
In fact,

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,550
they used to be normal humans as well.

122
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,760
The Nanzhao Royal Family

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,100
made them to be like this.

124
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,650
The Nanzhao Royal Family...

125
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,170
Nonsense!

126
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,920
The bugs only grow in Nanzhao.

127
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,930
What makes you so sure it was me?

128
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,770
Under the Ice Pool in Nanzhao,

129
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,650
I discovered many puppets
that had been similarly trained.

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,170
Let me ask you, King of Nanzhao,

131
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,450
you hid their bodies under Ice Pool.

132
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,820
How do you plan to use them

133
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,170
for your evil purposes?

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,260
What kind of conspiracy
does the King of Nanzhao have?

135
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,300
Did he do it?

136
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
Well, it's totally...

137
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
King of Nanzhao,

138
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,640
do you still want to deny it now?

139
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,480
That's shameful.

140
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,920
Didn't you train the Islanders
into puppets?

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,700
Didn't you commit these heinous acts?

142
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,440
What a joke!

143
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,950
Just based on your few words,

144
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,950
do you think you can convict Nanzhao?

145
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,510
Even if these are the trained Islanders,

146
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,920
what evidence is there to prove

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,510
that Nanzhao did this?

148
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,350
I have

149
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
evidence.

150
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:15,190
You?

151
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,980
Who are you?

152
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
You are Golden Merfolk.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,110
King of Nanzhao, Minister,

154
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,950
it's been a long time.

155
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
You probably think

156
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,180
I've already been silenced
by Silver Merfolk, right?

157
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,300
I am Lady Golden Merfolk
of Mitian Deep Sea.

159
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,130
Back then,

160
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,000
at the banquet in Nanzhao Palace,

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,520
there was a horrifying uprising
of the Puppet Islanders.

162
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,710
I am a witness.

163
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,810
I can testify.

164
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,300
The Islanders

165
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,590
were controlled and trained into puppets
by the Nanzhao Royal Family.

166
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,840
What conspiracy is Nanzhao hiding?

167
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,680
They

168
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,670
were the victims.

169
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,880
The King of Nanzhao is so ruthless.

170
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Indeed.

171
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,180
The truth is actually like this.

172
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,280
Poor Islanders.

173
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,150
This crazy woman

174
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,990
is talking nonsense.

175
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,800
King of Nanzhao,

176
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,850
both the evidence and witness
are present.

177
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,860
Do you have anything else to say?

178
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,330
It has been such a long time.

179
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,540
Just based on your one-sided story,

180
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,500
do you want to ruin my reputation?

181
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,650
This is outrageous.

182
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,330
Just let him go like that?

183
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,160
One day, I will make him admit
to this crime.

184
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,080
Yes, indeed.

185
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,250
- What a shameless person.
- Here.

186
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,810
Xiaosheng.

187
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,500
My daughter.

188
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,210
- You finally came back.
- What are you doing?

189
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,280
- Senior Brother.
- Do you know

190
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,740
how much I miss you?

191
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,510
- You...
- What are you doing, old man?

192
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,620
She is my daughter.

193
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,180
- You...
- Chief,

194
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,440
how can you prove

195
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,770
that this child is your daughter?

196
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
Madam,

197
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
my daughter

198
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,060
went missing at the age of five.

199
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,320
However,

200
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,960
just now
when I heard her play the sheng,

201
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,520
I just knew she was my daughter.

202
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,360
It can't be wrong.

203
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,640
She's the only person
who can play my family's unique melody.

204
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,300
Chief, please calm down.

205
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:20,110
This child
was a wandering orphan indeed.

206
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,400
Her background is unknown.

207
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,890
But for now, it's best
to find out the truth first.

208
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,810
We must not be hasty.

209
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,690
Madam, you are right.

210
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,590
Xiaosheng suffers
from a chronic illness.

211
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,550
From time to time,
she would suddenly faint.

212
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,180
- Yes.
- No one has been able to cure it.

213
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,680
I wonder...

214
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,840
Don't worry. I have many remedies here.

215
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,030
Plenty of them.

216
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,870
That's great.

217
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,890
Xiaosheng will be fine.

218
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,830
Are you

219
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,200
really my family?

220
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,620
I am your father.

221
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Since you went missing,

222
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,110
your mother has been crying a lot.

223
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:05,210
She has been hoping for your return
every single day.

224
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,510
Senior Brother,

225
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,760
is he really my father?

226
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,810
Yes, I am your father.

227
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,000
Everyone,

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,690
you are all great benefactors
of Sheng Family.

229
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
May I

230
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,570
invite you to our Sheng Manor?

231
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,080
So that I can express my gratitude

232
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,250
and show a bit of hospitality.

233
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,400
Will you give me the chance?

234
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,880
Let's go.

235
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,180
Xiaosheng,

236
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,910
you found the family.

237
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,860
Aren't you happy?

238
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,210
But for so long,

239
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,940
my senior brother

240
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,060
is my only family,

241
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,330
and now I have you as well.

242
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:02,640
Silly girl.

243
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,080
You'll have more relatives.

244
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,010
Wouldn't that be better?

245
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,680
Senior Brother,

246
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,860
what do you think?

247
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,980
Should I acknowledge them?

248
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,960
Are you stupid?

249
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,470
If they are truly your blood relatives,

250
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,520
it would be a great thing.

251
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,500
Why don't you acknowledge them?

252
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,200
Will you

253
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,740
leave me then?

254
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,000
I...

255
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,100
I don't want to be separated from you.

256
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,940
Silly girl.

257
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,400
You need to stay at Sheng Manor
for treatment.

258
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,670
But don't worry.

259
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,810
Once we are done with our tasks,

260
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,770
we will come back to see you again.

261
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,690
I knew I wasn't wrong.

262
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,640
You really planned to leave me behind.

263
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,110
No, it's not.

264
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,950
Weisheng

265
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,060
will come back to pick you up.

266
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,470
He...

267
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,840
You've grown up.

268
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,810
How can you be so immature?

269
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,810
Do you know
that with your current status,

270
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,420
it is very likely

271
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,150
that you will be the Chief
of the Liangye Tribe in the future.

272
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,360
Don't be so fussy, or how can you
achieve anything great in the future?

273
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,810
I don't want to achieve anything great.

274
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,840
I just want to be with you.

275
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,790
You are useless.

276
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,570
Don't call me Senior Brother later.

277
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,250
Alright, stop crying.

278
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,470
Mother.

279
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,210
Don't cry anymore.

280
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,390
Weisheng.

281
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,880
Is something wrong with your brain?

282
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,690
Do you know how fortunate you are?

283
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,080
Han Ziqing
can't even find her blood relatives.

284
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,920
But you found them.

285
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,500
Do you know how much she envies you?

286
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,100
Don't cry, Xiaosheng.

287
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,180
Once your illness is cured,

288
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,030
we will

289
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,130
come to take you back.

290
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,130
Senior Brother,

291
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,380
I will listen to you.

292
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,210
If you want me to stay, I will stay.

293
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,670
That's more like it.

294
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,320
You should stay at Sheng Manor

295
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,150
to achieve something great.

296
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,810
I will rely on you in the future.

297
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,030
Don't cry anymore,

298
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,450
or you won't look pretty.

299
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,340
Don't, don't cry.

300
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,800
If you keep crying,
the cart will collapse.

301
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,900
It's so comfortable
to change back into my clothes.

302
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,690
My own clothes fit me better.

303
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Beiyue, I have an idea.

304
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,000
The missing notes in the playing
of the Phoenix Tail Sheng

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
can be complemented
by the White Jade Xiao.

306
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,230
This way, we can gather

307
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,300
all the music scores of Lishang.

308
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,980
Just think about it.

309
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,030
Sheng and Xiao.

310
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,420
Where there is Sheng, there is Xiao.

311
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,210
The missing notes in the playing
of the Phoenix Tail Sheng

312
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,450
can be complemented
by the White Jade Xiao.

313
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:53,710
What do you think?

314
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,570
I think we can give it a try.

315
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,690
Once we gather all the music sores,

316
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,230
let's return this White Jade Xiao

317
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,180
to its rightful owner.

318
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,640
Have you ever thought about

319
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,650
giving this xiao to Xiaosheng?

320
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,230
This xiao might be useful to her.

321
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,300
But Xiaosheng

322
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,810
might not want to stay in Sheng Family.

323
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,250
That will depend on her.

324
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,920
(Sheng Manor)

325
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,320
I really appreciate it

326
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,550
that this time Xiaosheng can return.

327
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,810
- Let me pour tea for you.
- Xiaosheng.

328
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,510
Xiaosheng.

329
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,950
Xiaosheng.

330
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,150
Xiaosheng.

331
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,180
Xiaosheng.

332
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,060
Xiaosheng.

333
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,800
Look at you, silly girl.

334
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,840
What are you standing there for?

335
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,680
Just go!

336
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,420
Xiaosheng,

337
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,060
can I hold you, my child?

338
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,300
Xiaosheng.

339
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,420
Xiaosheng.

340
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,620
My child,

341
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,520
sorry to make you suffer so much.

342
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,620
Mother.

343
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:04,910
Mother.

344
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,910
Xiaosheng,

345
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,210
tell me,

346
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,510
back then,

347
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,690
why did you
go into the deep mountains alone?

348
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,860
What happened?

349
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,060
I only remember

350
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,860
that day I fell asleep,

351
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,860
and when I woke up,

352
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,570
I was with the human trafficker.

353
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,030
Oh, my child.

354
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,890
Later,

355
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,250
I arrived in Nanzhao.

356
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,770
My senior brother took me in.

357
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,130
Oh Xiaosheng.

358
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,250
- Mother.
- You must have a hard time.

359
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,030
Mother.

360
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,100
Please believe me, Mother.

361
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,990
Speak the truth!

362
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,800
Why did you lie?

363
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,640
Speak!

364
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,410
Why did you say

365
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,590
Xiaosheng was eaten by a tiger?

366
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,430
Speak!

367
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Speak!

368
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,810
Speak!

369
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,920
Father,

370
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,200
I am innocent!

371
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
I have nothing to do
with little sister's missing.

372
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,860
You monster.

373
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,500
Back then, it must be you
who took her out

374
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,950
and handed her over
to the human trafficker.

375
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,470
You monster.

376
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,040
You even harmed your own sister.

377
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,050
I didn't do it.

378
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,380
Actually, I knew long ago

379
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,390
that back then

380
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,680
the bloody clothes you brought back
from the mountains

381
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,860
was suspicious.

382
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,710
Because I remember,

383
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,050
Xiaosheng was not wearing that outfit
before she went missing.

384
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,100
But I didn't ask you more.

385
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,980
Do you know why?

386
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,570
Because I think you are very motivated,

387
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,870
very hardworking,

388
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,810
and very capable
of alleviating Sheng Family's worries.

389
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,740
So I just deceived myself

390
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,740
and found a way to exonerate you.

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,660
But I never expected

392
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,050
you were so despicable

393
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,210
and so cruel to your own sister.

394
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,930
Now I wish I could kill you.

395
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,260
So what if I did that?

396
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,800
If it weren't for Xiaosheng's missing,

397
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,690
would you have ever thought of me?

398
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,520
No matter how hard I try,
and how excellent I become,

399
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,980
in your eyes, I am
just an illegitimate child.

400
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,230
Xiaosheng
was only five years old that year.

401
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,400
Why did she
deserve all the love and affection?

402
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,680
Why?

403
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Why? I'll tell you the reason.

404
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,000
Because she has a kinder heart,

405
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,040
and is better talented than you.

406
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,020
Apart from her, Sheng Family
can rely on no one.

407
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,380
Thank god.

408
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,100
Xiaosheng has finally returned now.

409
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,050
She is

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,680
the only hope of Sheng Family.

411
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,690
Are you clear?

412
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,510
Now,

413
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,590
get out of Sheng Family immediately!

414
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,830
You are not my son anymore.

415
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,670
Get out!

416
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,470
Xiaosheng, it's a wonderful place.

417
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,390
You can even find

418
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,590
such a hidden cave.

419
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,680
Of course.

420
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
During the day,

421
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,930
I took the opportunity

422
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,040
to explore the entire manor thoroughly,

423
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,140
including all the hidden paths.

424
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,780
You need to be careful
with your brothers from now on.

425
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:39,950
Why?

426
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,260
Can't you see this yet?

427
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,140
Your father

428
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,330
wants you to take over the family.

429
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,110
Can your brothers

430
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,950
accept it?

431
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,900
I don't want it.

432
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,810
This is not up to you.

433
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,080
Look.

434
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,570
This White Jade Xiao
and Phoenix Tail Sheng

435
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,380
should be a match.

436
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,620
I have learned a little before.

437
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:04,160
Let's play a bit.

438
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,050
Let's work together.

439
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,840
You start first.

440
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,150
How about it?

441
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,290
All the musical scores of Lishang

442
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,140
should have been found.

443
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,290
But...

444
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,980
What?

445
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,050
But there's nothing special about it.

446
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,270
Well...

447
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,810
It's nothing. Here.

448
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,190
This White Jade Xiao
belongs to Xiao Family.

449
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,590
You can decide

450
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:52,800
if to return to its rightful owner.

451
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,620
However, having a treasure at hand

452
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,860
is also a bargaining chip.

453
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,560
Okay.

454
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,210
I'll keep it.

455
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,280
If they dare to disobey me

456
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,500
and set traps for Sheng Family,

457
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,810
I will smash the White Jade Xiao.

458
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,390
Let's go back.

459
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,400
You leave first.

460
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,590
I need to think about it more.

461
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,430
Fine.

462
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,740
Walking together
draws too much attention.

463
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,320
I'll go first.

464
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,720
What are you going to do?

465
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,930
I didn't expect
that after so many years,

466
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,860
you would still be alive.

467
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,500
Why did you come back?

468
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,260
Because of you, Father has already
expelled me from the family.

469
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,570
I am no longer one of the Sheng Family.

470
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,230
Why?

471
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,760
How could you ask me why?

472
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,920
Because of you.

473
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,410
Me?

474
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,190
- I...
- Because you have returned.

475
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,680
Sheng Family has a successor.

476
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,530
I'm just an illegitimate child.
They don't need me anymore.

477
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,510
Tell me,

478
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,720
what should I do?

479
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,330
What should I do?

480
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,780
You ruined my everything.

481
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,590
Do you know how hard I've worked

482
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,980
to get me to this position?

483
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,520
You ruined all of it.

484
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,620
Xiaosheng,
you should never have come back.

485
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,470
What good is it
if you can play the sheng well?

486
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,400
What good is it if you weren't killed
by the human trafficker?

487
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,330
You will never surpass me.

488
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,290
You will never surpass me!

489
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,430
With such a venomous heart,

490
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,470
do you still want to become the Chief
of Liangye Tribe?

491
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,300
You're not worthy
to carry my junior brother's shoes.

492
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,470
Just wait and see.

493
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,520
People in the manor
will catch you and punish you.

494
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,810
You even dare to harm
the Young Master of Sheng Family.

495
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,920
This is outrageous.

496
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,560
You deserve to die ten thousand times.

497
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,400
This is outrageous.

498
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,710
You deserve to die ten thousand times.

499
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,550
And you too.

500
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,500
How did I tell you?

501
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,950
I told you not to take the small path
at night.

502
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,720
Yet you still took it.

503
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,290
Stop scolding me.

504
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,330
I'm scared to death.

505
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,620
And I twisted my ankle.

506
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,140
Is your foot okay?

507
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,210
Help me up.

508
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,150
My sheng.

509
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:31,990
My treasure.

510
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,290
Senior Brother,

511
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,930
can you not leave me?

512
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,270
If you're not here,

513
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm scared.

514
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,230
Why are you dawdling like a woman?

515
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,400
Didn't I tell you before?

516
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,830
We still need to return to Tianque.

517
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,800
We have important work to do.

518
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,450
I am a woman by nature.

519
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,450
It's just that you don't take me
as a woman.

520
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,800
I know

521
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,330
that you refuse to stay with me

522
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,000
because you want to go back

523
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,170
to help Fourth Princess.

524
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,900
As long as you understand.

525
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,050
In your heart, there is
always Fourth Princess.

526
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,140
Senior Brother,

527
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,800
did I say something wrong again?

528
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,810
No, you didn't say anything wrong.

529
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,760
That's exactly why

530
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,100
I want to help her fulfill her wish.

531
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,740
I won't give up on her.

532
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,900
Help me.

533
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,810
Momentary Tower was established
by the ancestor

534
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:28,980
to store
the tribe's highest Barrier Techniques.

535
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,100
However, it also secretly housed
many forbidden techniques.

536
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,920
The descendants

537
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,170
should have preserved
the ancestor's belongs.

538
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,230
However, if these forbidden techniques

539
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,430
are leaked out,

540
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,900
it will endanger all living beings.

541
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,980
After much deliberation,

542
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,500
I'm determined to destroy the Tower

543
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,380
- as a warning to the tribe.
- It...

544
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,450
You two have handled things this way.

545
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,330
How can you still come to see me?

546
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,860
Because we were working for His Majesty,

547
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,410
my brother and I

548
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,400
were punished by Father

549
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,170
and we were confined in the dark yard.

550
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,860
We have no other way to go,

551
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,170
so we come to seek your help.

552
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,210
The matter has not been resolved.

553
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,500
What use is it for you to come to me?

554
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,620
Please speak well of us to His Majesty

555
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,470
to help us achieve a great cause.

556
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,710
My brother and I

557
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,260
will be so grateful for your kindness.

558
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,380
With the skills you have,

559
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,450
how can I speak well of you
to His Majesty?

560
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,860
You're making things difficult for me.

561
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,910
Minister,

562
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,070
we have come here this time

563
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:24,430
to tell you some good news.

564
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,270
Yes.

565
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,920
After my father

566
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,560
rescued Han Ziqing
from Poisonous Grass World,

567
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,310
he brought back a treasure.

568
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,020
It is said that it was formed
after the Grass World was transformed.

569
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,210
My father hid it in Momentary Tower.

570
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,810
We would like to invite you
to appraise it.

571
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,270
Really?

572
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,410
We wouldn't dare to lie in front of you.

573
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,190
Although we do not know the power
of this treasure,

574
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,740
it must be useful.

575
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,660
If you can assist us in a great cause,

576
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,380
we are willing to offer this treasure

577
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,140
to you.

578
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,310
Momentary Tower

579
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,800
has been accessible
only to the Chief of the Tribe.

580
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,830
It is said that it stored

581
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,690
the most advanced Barrier Techniques.

582
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,620
The magical artifact is formed
by the transformation of the Barrier.

583
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,230
If

584
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,740
you can go and see it for yourself,

585
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,780
it will surely help
to clear your confusion.

586
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Unfortunately, the Chief

587
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,230
has announced he will destroy the Tower.

588
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,070
Well...

589
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,680
What?

590
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,590
To destroy Momentary Tower?

591
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,660
- Yes.
- Yes.

592
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,200
Minister,

593
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,950
the Tower is a treasure
of our Meng Tribe.

594
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,110
The Chief is now determined
to destroy it.

595
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,680
As descendants of the Tribe,

596
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,810
we are deeply saddened.

597
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,810
If you can stop this,

598
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,080
we brothers

599
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,740
will be grateful.

600
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,210
You offer me the treasure

601
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,470
ostensibly to save the Tower,

602
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,000
but in reality, you are
coveting the treasures in your tribe

603
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,100
and the chief position, right?

604
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,450
Minister, you might not know,

605
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,160
my elder sister was brought back
by my father.

606
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,110
If we don't take the initiative,

607
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:42,210
as we wait for more time,

608
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,900
I'm afraid

609
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,900
my brother may not have a chance
to get the chief position.

610
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,230
Has Meng Wanyue returned to Meng Tribe?

611
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,100
Yes.

612
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,410
Your sister is indeed smart.

613
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,170
You should be cautious.

614
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,810
It's urgent.

615
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,690
It seems

616
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,260
I have to make a personal trip.

617
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,800
We're ready to follow your orders.

618
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,740
Yes.

619
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,020
(I can't.)

620
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,860
(I can't accept it.)

621
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,690
(All my skills)

622
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,780
(is about to be destroyed
in the Barrier.)

623
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,500
(I can't accept this.)

624
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:13,660
(Momentary Tower)

625
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:36,410
(Momentary Tower)

626
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,800
Keep an eye on the outside.

627
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,050
Yes, Master.

628
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,710
Ancestors above.

629
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,070
Momentary Tower

630
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,660
carries hundreds of years
of glory and effort of Meng Tribe,

631
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,900
and also the indelible sins.

632
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,290
I'm Meng Xigu, an unfilial descendant
of the 38th generation.

633
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,660
I've decided to destroy the Tower.

634
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,810
Hope

635
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,210
you can forgive me.

636
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,480
You...

637
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,400
Mr. Xianweng, you have passed away

638
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,020
for more than 20 years.

639
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,860
All these years,

640
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,330
I haven't had the time
to come and see you,

641
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,880
but I have missed you dearly.

642
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,050
How dare you

643
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,410
enter Meng Tribe's forbidden area?

644
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,410
After all, back then, your father and I

645
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,660
were good friends.

646
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,590
So why can't I

647
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,520
come to your forbidden area?

648
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,290
- You...
- Don't move.

649
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,780
You have been poisoned
by my zombie poison bug.

650
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,710
If you move recklessly,

651
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,980
the blood will flow in reverse,

652
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,050
and that could be fatal.

653
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
You horrid thief.

654
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,290
What do you want to do?

655
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,500
Nothing much.

656
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,780
However, I have read some books lately,

657
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,410
and found some puzzles.

658
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,100
I would like
to borrow your precious place

659
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,620
to solve them.

660
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,270
You...

661
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,810
- Father.
- Father.

662
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,640
- Father!
- Father!

663
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,640
- Father!
- Father!

664
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,040
Minister, you...

665
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,910
Minister,

666
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,000
didn't we agree
to only seize the chief stamp?

667
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
- Why are you...
- You idiot.

668
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,120
If he doesn't die,

669
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,950
even if you have the stamp,

670
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:29,490
you two also find it hard
to convince others.

671
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,910
Do you still

672
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,420
need me to teach you this?

673
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,660
- Father!
- Father!

674
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,030
(The Barrier.)

675
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,570
(It's broken.)

676
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,290
(I am free.)

677
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,010
(Could it be Father...)

678
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,860
This is the appointment letter
issued by His Majesty.

679
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,860
After the funeral is completed,

680
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,900
get ready to take over the tribe.

681
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:12,470
Go.

682
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,380
(Puppet Training)

683
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,380
(...personally created
human puppet training...)

684
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,380
I didn't expect your grandfather

685
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,120
to record his association with me

686
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,290
in this tower.

687
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,050
Minister, rest assured.

688
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,570
You assist us in our great cause.

689
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,900
We'll never forget your great kindness.

690
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,320
As for

691
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,530
the grievances between you
and the ancestor,

692
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,420
we brothers

693
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,900
will never interfere.

694
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,530
You two have no right to interfere.

695
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,660
- Yes.
- That's right.

696
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,910
Back then, your grandfather and I

697
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,140
once allied.

698
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:14,470
Your grandfather and I

699
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,810
trained puppets together

700
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,220
to help Nanzhao unify Longyuan.

701
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,730
This Poisonous Grass World

702
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,730
was established by him.

703
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,390
Unexpectedly,

704
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,560
after Poisonous Grass World
was established,

705
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,330
he inexplicably gave it up,

706
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,220
and ended our relationship.

707
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,700
I still can't figure out why

708
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,100
until I see this.

709
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:46,100
I named it Poisonous Grass World.

710
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,760
Back then, I was focusing
on training human puppets,

711
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,390
and didn't consider anything else

712
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,190
until I found the energy
of the Poisonous Grass World

713
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,670
was too powerful.

714
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,530
It can even transform
into a magical artifact

715
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,290
which can not only transform the Islanders,

716
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,950
but also ordinary people.

717
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,420
And I felt so regretful.

718
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,050
I am a guilty person

719
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,770
and can't bear seeing
the Longyuan Continent in ruins.

720
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,230
Therefore, I abolished my techniques

721
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,660
sealed the entrance to the Barrier,

722
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,530
and locked the secret in the tower.

723
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,330
Any disciple of my tribe
who can enter the tower

724
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,810
must heed my teachings

725
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,860
and shall never engage in

726
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,330
puppet training.

727
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,330
Rest assured, Minister.

728
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,140
If we brothers

729
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,320
reveal any of

730
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,700
what we see in the tower today,

731
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,460
we'll suffer

732
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,420
from a horrible death.

733
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,360
Don't worry.

734
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,770
These are just some old stories.

735
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,100
It's better not to mention them.

736
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,430
Second Master,

737
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,840
just rest assured,

738
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,570
and be the 39th chief of Meng Tribe.

739
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,710
Brother.

740
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,230
Thank you, Minister.

741
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,070
Thank you, Minister.

742
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,120
Minister,

743
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,190
this item was brought back by my father

744
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,860
from Poisonous Grass World.

745
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,970
If you like it,

746
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,100
I'll offer it to you.

747
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,840
You may leave now.

748
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,330
I will stay here a bit longer.

749
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,080
Remember

750
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,220
to take good care of your father's body.

751
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:50,970
- Yes.
- Yes.

752
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,670
Let's go.

753
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,150
I have named this magical artifact
Soul Devouring Ball

754
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:23,320
and found that with the blood
of the Island Saintess,

755
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,950
the magical artifact can be activated

756
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,250
to devour souls.

757
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,910
Back then, the King of Nanzhao
imprisoned the Islanders.

758
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,770
I discovered that the Island Saintess
was among them.

759
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,390
She was the daughter of the Chief
of the Isolated Island.

760
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,040
But just as I was about
to take her fresh blood,

761
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,570
the Saintess escaped
and I have never seen her again.

762
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,620
Soul Devouring Ball?

763
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,290
Island Saintess?

764
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,860
Mu Ci?

765
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,530
Han Ziqing?

766
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,100
Indeed, those who work hard
will be rewarded.

767
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,290
- Minister.
- Minister.

768
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,710
Slow down.

769
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,080
Right here.

770
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,190
Brother.

771
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,320
No one is here.

772
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,180
This is impossible.

773
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,320
The Chief set a Death Curse Knot
for Sister.

774
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,190
Once the Chief dies,

775
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,460
the Barrier will break on its own.

776
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:54,670
I suppose

777
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,050
Sister has already
taken the opportunity to escape.

778
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,990
Don't worry.

779
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,010
I have already poisoned her.

780
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,900
If she doesn't take the antidote
on time,

781
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,010
all her skills will be destroyed.

782
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,670
She can't just stand by

783
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,900
and watch herself become incapable.

784
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,100
I believe

785
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,900
she will come back.

786
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,710
Let's go.

787
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,080
Brother.

788
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,840
Let's go.

789
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:29,950
Go.

790
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,180
(Tieyan)

791
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,900
Your Majesty!

792
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,570
Your Majesty,

793
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,630
our royal city defenses
cannot hold any longer.

794
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,490
Your Majesty.

795
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,740
- Your Majesty.
- What is it?

796
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,760
The Eighth Prince has rebelled

797
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,870
and led troops to attack the city.

798
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,970
How could he rebel?

799
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,670
Xiling colluded with the Prince

800
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:16,100
to battle from inside and outside.

801
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,250
The Prince Consort is fighting him.

802
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,700
Such a traitor!

803
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,230
I want to kill him!

804
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,180
Your Majesty,

805
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,710
I'm afraid our royal city's defenses
won't hold.

806
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,670
We should retreat.

807
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,950
Your Majesty, let's retreat.

808
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:29,000
We should retreat.

809
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,100
Your Majesty!

810
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,620
Your Majesty.

811
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,280
Your Majesty, our city's defenses
can't hold any longer.

812
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,390
The enemy is advancing.

813
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,470
Let's retreat immediately.

814
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,390
Let's retreat.

815
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:40,320
Such an unfilial son.

816
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,160
Someone!

817
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,190
Protect His Majesty and retreat.

818
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,180
- Such an unfilial son!
- Quick.

819
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,550
Why are you here? Go back!

820
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,630
My brother is attacking the city.
The rear can't hold either.

821
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,770
I'll fight to the death with you.

822
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,860
Be careful.

823
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,250
Haonan.

824
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,490
Don't move.

825
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,190
Retreat.

826
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:31,280
Don't let them escape.

827
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,860
- Chase them.
- Hurry, chase them.

828
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:44,770
How is the situation?

829
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:47,040
Your Highness,

830
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,420
Xiling has occupied five cities
in Tieyan.

831
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:51,810
The momentum has slowed down.

832
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,710
It seems that they want to quit
while they're ahead.

833
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:55,900
Quit?

834
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,000
Does he intend to

835
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,900
support the Eighth Prince of Tieyan
to seize the throne,

836
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,490
instead of taking the opportunity
to attack Tieyan Royal City?

837
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,080
At this rate, within three days,

838
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,660
the Xiling army will retreat.

839
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,330
But our plan...

840
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,970
Chu Tiange is such a coward.

841
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,230
I've overestimated him.

842
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,070
Your Highness.

843
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,080
Your Highness.

844
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,250
Your Highness, military report.

845
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,740
(Xiling army retreated. Situ Haonan
and Nangong Qianqian were captured.)

846
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,570
Your Highness, what changes
have occurred in the situation?

847
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,730
Chu Tiange won the battle.

848
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,380
I should go

849
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,330
and offer congratulations.
