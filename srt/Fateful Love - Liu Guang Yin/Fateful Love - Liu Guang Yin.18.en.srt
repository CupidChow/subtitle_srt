Beiyue, please sit down.

Beiyue, you are...

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,640
Is there anyone else
who wants to raise the bid?

24
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,260
90,000 taels.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,130
- 90,000?
- 90,000?

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,190
1,000,000 taels.

27
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,880
- 1,000,000?
- 1,000,000?

28
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,910
So much.

29
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,880
So much.

30
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,800
1,000,000.

31
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,390
(Are these two just playing around
with their wealth?)

32
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,470
(Let's see how this ends.)

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,670
Someone has bid 1,000,000 taels.

34
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,000
Han Ziqing.

35
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,080
Let's see if anyone else
will raise the bid.

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,670
Alright.

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,720
1,000,000 taels

38
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,270
going once.

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,240
1,000,000 taels

40
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,910
going twice.

41
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Wait.

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,750
Who is this?

43
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,910
There's a saying goes,

44
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,240
the Divine Tree cannot be violated
or insulted.

45
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,750
The Divine Tree

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,110
stands tall to the sky,

47
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,240
and is firmly rooted to the ground.

48
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,340
It takes ten years to grow a tree,

49
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,470
a hundred years to nurture a person,

50
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,230
and a thousand years
to cultivate the Divine Tree.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,000
The Divine Tree

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,160
is worth far more than 1,000,000 taels.

53
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,830
(What is he doing?)

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,450
(Does he come
to cause me trouble again?)

55
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,030
Alright.

56
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,470
Sir, if you say so,

57
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
are you going to raise the bid?

58
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,270
Of course.

59
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,390
I'll bid...

60
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,470
How much exactly are you going to bid?

61
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,750
Hurry up and say it.

62
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,680
Yes, say it.

63
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,830
What are you standing there for?

64
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,520
- Say it.
- Just place your bid.

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,880
Hurry up.

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,550
1,000,000 taels

67
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,040
and one copper coin.

68
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,110
I think you're here to cause trouble.

69
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,720
Which family are you from?

70
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
Adding one copper coin
should be worth it.

71
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,600
The Divine Tree is priceless,

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,720
and it's extremely difficult to cultivate,

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
even harder to keep it alive.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,960
No matter how precious it is,

75
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,880
it won't grow into a towering tree
in a hundred years.

76
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,670
1,000,000 taels and one copper coin

77
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,110
is enough.

78
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,110
Alright.

79
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,200
1,000,000 taels and one copper coin.

80
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,790
Does anyone else want to raise the bid?

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,160
How could anyone raise it further?

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,110
Only a fool would raise it.

83
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,440
With so much money, who would raise it?

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,830
Deal.

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:16,920
What a pity.

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,550
I thought bringing this much money
would be enough.

87
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,510
That's 1,000,000 taels.
How can we compete with that?

88
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,920
Congratulations, Sir.

89
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,720
You have won the Fusang Seed.

90
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,320
No, this...

91
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,200
What, this...

92
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,110
No, it's not...

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,550
Masters.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,500
I will donate all the money
from this auction

95
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,270
to the Qin Gathering.

96
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,390
- Please accept it.
- This won't do.

97
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,760
- Alright.
- Good.

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,600
Thank you, Miss.

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,140
You're welcome.

100
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,720
Everyone,

101
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,950
I announce

102
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,790
the Qin Gathering
is successfully concluded.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,390
In the Family Ranking Competition

104
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,440
of Liuxian Island,

105
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,040
the Lu Family still
holds the top position.

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,880
Good, good!

107
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:04,920
No...

108
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,350
Ziqing, how is this mine?

109
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,230
- Congratulations, Master.
- As it should be.

110
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,110
As it should be.

111
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,070
This...

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,230
Well, why did it just end?

113
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,620
(Qinse Valley)

114
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,550
(Du Family)

115
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,920
I'll sell it cheaper. Who wants it?

116
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,900
How about you...

117
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,100
(Qinse Valley)

118
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,040
Why is everyone leaving?

119
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,320
I just got here.

120
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Why did it end so quickly?

121
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,200
It's laughable.

122
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,920
Before we left home,

123
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,230
I was counting on you all

124
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,880
to win something for the Lu Family.

125
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,920
Look at you now.

126
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,920
As disciples of the Lu Family,

127
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,270
don't you feel shamed?

128
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
If it weren't for Han Ziqing
stepping up,

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,110
today,

130
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,440
the Lu Family's fame

131
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,790
would have been completely lost by you.

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,390
Father,

133
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,440
it's my lack of strength.

134
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
I couldn't compete with the Bai Family.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,670
I had no choice.

136
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,390
What do you think?

137
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,950
Will Jun Beiyue

138
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,110
know that we were the ones

139
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,350
who poisoned him?

140
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,600
What's the use of being afraid?

141
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,060
Just deny it.

142
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,420
I...

143
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,740
With the couple's personalities,

144
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,780
do you think if we deny it,

145
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,460
they will let it go?

146
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,540
What do you mean by that?

147
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
You don't mean to have me
take the blame alone, do you?

148
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,700
Jiang Chen, you're a grown man.

149
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,020
Is it all the nerve you got?

150
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,300
But I'm not the mastermind.

151
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,620
This, well...

152
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,380
Poisoning

153
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,500
was your idea in the first place.

154
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,700
You idiot.

155
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,420
Even if I am willing to take the blame,

156
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,620
the couple will still find a way

157
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,300
to expose you and Miss Bai.

158
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,660
Do you think hiding will help?

159
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,700
Anyway,

160
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
if they check on me,

161
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,580
I will certainly deny it.

162
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,180
As for how you and Miss Bai
will handle it,

163
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,460
that's up to you.

164
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,780
Move aside.

165
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
I can do it myself.

166
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,460
What?

167
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,780
You are my princess.

168
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,260
Are you shy?

169
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,500
It's not a serious injury.

170
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,460
It's fine.

171
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,740
There are no maids here.

172
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,300
I'm the only one
to help you apply the medicine.

173
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,460
I can't ask Gu to help you
apply the medicine, can I?

174
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:39,780
Agreed.

175
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,340
Ask Physician Gu to help.

176
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,740
But I don't agree.

177
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,180
Does it hurt?

178
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,140
No, it doesn't.

179
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,180
But why did you say argh?

180
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,300
I didn't.

181
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,220
I'll be gentle.

182
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:15,980
You didn't want

183
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,780
that seed at all.

184
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,540
Why did you bid for it?

185
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,540
If I didn't bid,

186
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,100
how could Xuanyuan Lige
have come out to bid?

187
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:29,820
So

188
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,420
you were targeting Xuanyuan Lige
all along

189
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,540
and wanting him to be the fool
who overpays.

190
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,860
Yes.

191
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,620
Among the entire Qin Gathering,

192
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,300
you two are the wealthiest.

193
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,380
By the way,

194
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,100
who was that fool

195
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,180
that suddenly flew down today?

196
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,500
His name is Baili Weisheng.

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,220
He's a veterinarian.

198
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,220
He was the one

199
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,620
who helped me invite Prince An earlier.

200
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,660
And he also helped you

201
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,660
detoxify the poison.

202
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,100
It seems this person

203
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,140
is not that simple.

204
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,100
What was that move

205
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,100
you used today?

206
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,500
You mean

207
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,460
Sound Strike?

208
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,060
Xuanyuan Lige taught you that?

209
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,580
He really taught you all his best moves.

210
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,820
He taught me to play the guqin
and Sound Strike

211
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,100
without charging me any tuition.

212
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,300
I should thank him indeed.

213
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:37,980
Thank him?

214
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,580
What about me?

215
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,740
Why should I thank you?

216
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,940
Done.

217
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,060
Thank you.

218
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,420
Thank me for what?

219
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,420
Thank you

220
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,180
for helping me apply the medicine.

221
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,260
You should thank me

222
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,380
for many things.

223
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,780
Thank you, too.

224
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,420
Just

225
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,620
take good care of yourself for me.

226
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,460
Don't get hurt again.

227
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,620
Got it.

228
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,090
Then...

229
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,700
- Then...
- Your Highness.

230
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,700
Rest early.

231
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,860
I'll help you apply the medicine again
tomorrow.

232
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,900
Get out.

233
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,660
All of you, get out.

234
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,540
It's

235
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,180
such a good item.

236
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,660
We

237
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,780
rarely see each other.

238
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,620
I should

239
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,740
get in,

240
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,940
not get out.

241
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:46,980
Fine.

242
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,580
Get in then.

243
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Where is Miss Suying?

244
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,420
If you like pugs,

245
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,220
I can bring you two more.

246
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,020
How does it sound?

247
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,180
Miss Bai.

248
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,740
Miss Suying,

249
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,780
you are a person of integrity.

250
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,380
It's just a pity you're in the Lu Family

251
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,580
and unable to achieve your ambitions.

252
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,500
Unlike me, I have possessed

253
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,620
- men's power though I'm a girl.
- Indeed.

254
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,220
Isn't it more glorious and respectable?

255
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,860
Miss Bai, I also want to be like you

256
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,580
to support the entire family

257
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,900
with a girl's strength.

258
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,460
However

259
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,220
I don't want to hide my identity
as a girl,

260
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,980
nor do I want to keep a pug.

261
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,140
Suying,

262
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,780
you don't have to be sarcastic
with me all the time.

263
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,980
In my heart

264
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,420
there is only Miss Bai.

265
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,380
I'm sorry to your sister,

266
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,340
but I have no choice.

267
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,860
I hope both of you

268
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,740
won't forget our agreement.

269
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,740
We are an ally.

270
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,620
We'll prosper together

271
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,420
and suffer together.

272
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,180
Rest assured.

273
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,100
I will never ignore it.

274
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,260
Hurry up and leave.

275
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,860
Let me massage your shoulders.

276
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,780
It's outrageous.

277
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,100
How can I live like this?

278
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,140
I was doing a good deed

279
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,980
but incurred millions of debts.

280
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,940
I was just joining in the fun.

281
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,220
What should I do?

282
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,940
It's outrageous.

283
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,580
How can I live like this?

284
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,380
Who is playing that awful guqin?

285
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,140
It's outrageous.

286
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,020
It's so inappropriate.

287
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,900
Who is it?

288
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,060
What is money?

289
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,300
It has driven me, a little beggar,
to a dead end.

290
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,940
It's so unfair.

291
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,660
Heavens, can you hear me?

292
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,180
You don't have such wealth.

293
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,100
Why did you have to act tough?

294
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,020
If you can't pay the money,

295
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,660
the two masters

296
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,660
won't let you go.

297
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,980
I regret it so much now.

298
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
I was just joining in the fun

299
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,820
and ended up owing them 1,000,000 taels.

300
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,330
It serves you right.

301
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,540
Please help me.

302
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,340
If you don't help me,

303
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,180
my junior brother and I
will be homeless.

304
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,740
We'll go hungry.

305
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,820
We'll starve to death.

306
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,740
We even scraped our meal money together.

307
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,700
So you came to me late at night

308
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,740
to ask for my help?

309
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,220
Yes.

310
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,420
Really.

311
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,500
If I can't pay 1,000,000 taels,

312
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,460
those two old masters

313
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,940
will find some way to deal with me.

314
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,380
I'll die here.

315
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,380
And who knows

316
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
how they'll torture me in the future.

317
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,780
Ziqing, please help me.

318
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,500
Help me.

319
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,340
My dear Ziqing,

320
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,980
please help me.

321
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,780
Help me.

322
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,820
What are you two

323
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,260
talking about so late?

324
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,500
Let go.

325
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,020
Jun Beiyue?

326
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:04,940
You can

327
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,620
handle it too.

328
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,900
It's because of you

329
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,740
that I got tricked

330
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,420
and ended up owing a huge debt.

331
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,300
Do you know

332
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,180
I even saved you?

333
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,460
Thank you.

334
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,580
Thanks are not enough.

335
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,420
Well,

336
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,620
aren't you going to show some gratitude?

337
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,900
How do you want me to show it?

338
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,860
Lend me some money.

339
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,820
Because of you

340
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,860
I owe 1,000,000 taels today.

341
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,340
In this world,

342
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,220
only the Fourth Prince of Tianque

343
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,900
can save me now.

344
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,340
You might consider it

345
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:39,900
as medical expenses.

346
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,460
Did I ever say

347
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,260
I needed you to save me?

348
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,220
Ziqing,

349
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
look at this person,

350
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,140
how unreasonable he is.

351
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,020
He has no sense of gratitude.

352
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,700
He, he...

353
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,860
It's so outrageous.

354
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,420
What do you do?

355
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,780
I am a veterinarian.

356
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,180
You should be treating cows
and horses at home.

357
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,260
Why are you running around?

358
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,500
Your Highness, that is not correct.

359
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,460
As a veterinarian,

360
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,380
I must be knowledgeable.

361
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,660
So I'm traveling the world

362
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,900
to broaden my experience.

363
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,740
What do you mean by running around?

364
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,940
I think

365
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,860
you should speak less.

366
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,380
I...

367
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,460
I would...

368
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,640
- What would you do?
- I would have...

369
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,660
You, you...

370
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,140
Forget it.

371
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,420
You will need my help in the future.

372
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,180
Remember, Ziqing,

373
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:43,700
you owe me.

374
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:47,700
Ziqing, remember,

375
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,380
you owe me.

376
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,420
It's outrageous.

377
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,660
It's outrageous.

378
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,540
It's outrageous.

379
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,140
I must say, you are so kind.

380
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,020
You can get along with anyone.

381
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,940
What are you doing here

382
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,700
so late at night?

383
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,060
If I didn't come, how long
would you two keep talking?

384
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,260
Are you jealous?

385
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,100
Why would I be jealous of you?

386
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,500
He saved you.

387
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,900
So what if he saved me?

388
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,580
I can repay the 1,000,000 taels for him.

389
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,020
Really?

390
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,560
I should thank you on his behalf.

391
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,760
What's your relationship?

392
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,540
Why are you thanking me on his behalf?

393
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,940
I should

394
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,990
be considered his friend, I guess.

395
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,860
You should see him less in the future.

396
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,300
Why?

397
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,100
Just do as I told you.

398
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,820
You can give your orders,

399
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
but I can choose to do it or not.

400
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,620
What did you say?

401
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,940
Help me up.

402
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:17,900
You...

403
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,220
Help me or not.

404
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,500
Lige,

405
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,020
how much do you know

406
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,500
about Han Ziqing?

407
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,100
Masters,

408
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,990
what do you mean by this?

409
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,860
Her appearance and temperament

410
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,900
are very similar to Mu Ci's.

411
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,940
Therefore, we suspect

412
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,580
that she is Mu Ci's daughter.

413
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,940
You indeed have sharp eyes.

414
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,900
Han Ziqing

415
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,060
is Master's daughter.

416
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,740
So it is true.

417
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,820
When I first came to Qinse Valley

418
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,300
to learn the guqin and treat my disease,

419
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,020
I was still very young.

420
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,820
My impression of Master

421
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,820
is somewhat vague.

422
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,620
But when I first met Han Ziqing,

423
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,220
I felt her familiar.

424
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,540
Later, after a few interactions

425
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,780
with Ziqing,

426
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,900
I heard her talk about her mother,

427
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,990
and only then did I confirm
her identity.

428
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,860
Back then, Master

429
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,780
left behind two guqins, Wuzheng and Xuezheng.

430
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,900
I have already gifted Wuzheng
to Han Ziqing,

431
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,380
hoping

432
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,740
that she could take this opportunity

433
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,020
to inherit her mother's legacy.

434
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,820
You did the right thing.

435
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,660
This is probably also Mu Ci's wish.

436
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,820
But there is one thing
I still don't understand.

437
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,780
Please enlighten me, Masters.

438
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,900
Go ahead and tell us.

439
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,420
When I first came to Qinse Valley,

440
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,500
Master was already here.

441
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,180
But Master was not a disciple
of Qinse Valley.

442
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,740
What is her connection to Qinse Valley?

443
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,500
Many years ago,

444
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,260
we rescued her from the sea.

445
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,140
At that time,

446
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,300
she was drifting in the sea
near Qinse Valley,

447
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,740
carrying two guqins on her back,

448
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,900
and was on the verge of death.

449
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,250
We pitied her and saved her,

450
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,820
and kept her in Qinse Valley
to recuperate.

451
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,500
After she recovered,

452
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,700
to repay our kindness,

453
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,620
she stayed in Qinse Valley

454
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,740
to do laundry and cleaning for us.

455
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,860
She was exceptionally talented
and skilled in music.

456
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,300
At that time,

457
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,860
we considered her as the heir
to the Qu Family's legacy.

458
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,540
Later, the Dongling Royal Family

459
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,700
sent you to Qinse Valley for treatment.

460
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,620
Besides treating and nurturing you,

461
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,100
we also entrusted you to her,

462
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,940
and let her teach you guqin skills.

463
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,500
Did she

464
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,420
ever tell you

465
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,300
where she came from

466
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,540
and why would she drown?

467
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,140
Regarding her past,

468
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,540
she always kept silent,

469
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,340
as if her background was very secretive.

470
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,740
We didn't want to pry either.

471
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,100
And a few years passed like this.

472
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,100
One day she suddenly disappeared.

473
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,300
She only left behind those two guqins
and the ten volumes of music scores.

474
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,420
Since you were her only disciple,

475
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,460
the guqins and the music scores
were entrusted to you.

476
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,740
Mu Ci once said,

477
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,540
whoever can master these two guqins
in this world

478
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,220
would be their owner.

479
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,220
Now,

480
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,140
you have Xuezheng

481
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,220
and Han Ziqing has Wuzheng.

482
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,020
They both have found
their rightful owner.

483
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,820
Lige,

484
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,700
should we tell Han Ziqing

485
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,500
about her mother's connection
with Qinse Valley?

486
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,180
Do you mean

487
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,980
to reunite with Han Ziqing?

488
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,380
When Mu Ci left Qinse Valley,

489
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,780
she left suddenly

490
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,300
without leaving a single word.

491
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,660
Master Se and I
have always felt sorry.

492
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,580
We don't know what she encountered,

493
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,500
and we couldn't do anything to help.

494
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,020
We feel quite regretful about that.

495
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,620
If we can reunite with her daughter,

496
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,300
it would somewhat make up
for the regret of those years.

497
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,300
Master Qin and I

498
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,420
have jointly managed Qinse Valley
for over 20 years.

499
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,980
Now, we are getting old,

500
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,940
and have been thinking
about getting retired.

501
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,020
And your health condition is...

502
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,420
If

503
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,780
Han Ziqing is willing
to inherit Qinse Valley,

504
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,740
that would be the best outcome.

505
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,860
Alright.

506
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,620
Beiyue,

507
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,620
how are you feeling?

508
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,460
Don't worry, Master.

509
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,980
I'm good.

510
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,140
That's good.

511
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,340
If something were to happen to you,

512
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:04,990
I would feel shamed

513
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,900
to face your mother's spirit in heaven.

514
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,540
Master,

515
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,420
you know that all these years,

516
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,300
I've always had something on my mind.

517
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,100
You want

518
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,990
to ask about my relationship
with your mother, right?

519
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,500
Since childhood,

520
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,300
I knew very little about my mother.

521
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,220
I hope

522
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,780
to know more about her.

523
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:48,740
Beiyue,

524
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,620
because you were too young at that time,

525
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,580
there were some things

526
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,780
that couldn't be mentioned to you.

527
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,540
Now that you have grown up,

528
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,140
you can distinguish right from wrong.

529
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,700
So

530
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,260
there is no need to hide the truth
from you anymore.

531
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,980
Speaking of which,

532
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,460
back then,

533
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,980
it was your mother

534
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,580
who saved my life.

535
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,900
Mother saved your life?

536
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,460
Yes.

537
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,620
Back then,

538
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,660
I was traveling alone,

539
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,730
and while I was passing through
the mountains,

540
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,190
I was ambushed by a tiger.

541
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,020
During the chase,

542
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,690
I fell off a cliff accidentally.

543
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,340
I thought I was going to die,

544
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,460
but coincidentally,

545
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,940
your mother was passing by.

546
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,560
She saved me.

547
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,740
Later, we had feelings

548
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,020
for each other.

549
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,900
We returned to Liuxian Island together.

550
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,570
I even promised

551
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,030
to teach her the Lu's internal arts.

552
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,740
However,

553
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,300
to my surprise,

554
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,960
one day she left without saying goodbye.

555
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,050
I searched everywhere
but couldn't find her.

556
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,740
At that time, my heart

557
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,420
was in great torment

558
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,780
and pain.

559
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,290
Two years later,

560
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,940
I came to Tianque again.

561
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,540
By chance, I saw your mother

562
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,640
accompanying the King of Tianque
on a tour.

563
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,620
Only then did I realize

564
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,440
that your mother

565
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,860
had become the Princess of Tianque.

566
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,750
From then on,

567
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,600
I knew it was impossible
to bring her back again.

568
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,780
Master, do you know why Mother left

569
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,940
without saying goodbye back then?

570
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,220
I don't know.

571
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,300
She must have had her reasons.

572
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,540
But,

573
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,780
I have always been looking for her
to ask for the truth.

574
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Unfortunately,

575
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,040
I never received any news.

576
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,620
In the end,

577
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,080
I heard the news of your mother's death.

578
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,830
Fortunately, you were born by then,

579
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,380
so I decided to teach you
the Lu's internal arts.

580
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,970
Firstly,

581
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,400
it's to repay your mother

582
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,900
for saving my life,

583
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:10,860
and secondly,

584
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:12,740
it's to fulfill

585
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,940
my promise to her.

586
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,140
Alright, that's the story.

587
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
By the way, Beiyue,

588
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,540
about what happened a few days ago,

589
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,500
I will investigate it thoroughly

590
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,060
and give you an explanation.

591
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,660
Master,

592
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,820
thank you for your kindness
to my mother and me.

Before I brought you here,

623

what wish did you make?

00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,240
I can't say.

648
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,620
If I say it,

649
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,640
it won't come true.

650
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,540
Not necessarily.

651
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,980

652
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,540
and I'll tell you mine?

653
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:20,940
I won't say.

654
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,060
Why is there a guqin here?

655
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,380
Could it be that someone was here
just now?

656
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,260
Look at these stools.

657
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,740
They all have musical notes on them.

658
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,420
(Why is this stool crooked?)

659
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,260
What's wrong?

660
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,740
This stone stool

661
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,700
seems a bit strange.

662
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,020
What is this?

663
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,780
Some kind of pattern.

664
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,180
We can take a look at all.

665
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,340
I'll make a rubbing of this pattern first,

666
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,480
and we can study it slowly later.

667
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,460
Listen.

668
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:16,980
What's that sound?

669
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:25,820
It seems like

670
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,980
the sound of nature.

671
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,580
That's right.

672
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,340
The sound of Qinse Valley

673
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
is indeed the sound of nature.

674
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,060
Why are you here?

675
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,020
If you can come,

676
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,540
why can't I?

677
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,940
Listen to this piece.

678
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:53,820
It doesn't seem to be from Lishang.

679
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,180
No.

680
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,460
It's from Lishang.

681
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:05,380
But,

682
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,700
it's not from the ten volumes.

683
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,420
Are you saying

684
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,180
there are more than ten volumes?

685
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,380
Exactly.

686
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,660
(If I can find
the remaining music scores,)

687
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,700
(I should be able to go back.)

688
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,060
Ziqing,

689
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,420
today the Masters invited you here

690
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,620
mainly to confirm with you

691
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,340
that your mother, Mu Ci,

692
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,220
was my master.

693
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,260
She was also from Qinse Valley.

694
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,620
And here

695
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,500
was your mother's residence.

696
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,420
So,

697
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,660
this is the room my mother lived in.

698
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,900
We came here this time

699
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,140
mainly to know

700
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,100
who Ziqing's mother

701
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,180
really was.

702
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,820
I want to know

703
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,100
why she left Qinse Valley.

704
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,100
Your mother

705
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,020
kept her background a secret.

706
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,220
We don't know much.

707
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,540
But I always have a feeling

708
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,460
that your mother was hiding
from someone.

709
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,140
What do you mean?

710
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,940
Although Mu Ci lived in seclusion here,

711
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,380
she often

712
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,900
felt extremely frightened.

713
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,220
Whenever an outsider
entered Qinse Valley,

714
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,980
she became very alert.

715
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,540
As if this person

716
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,420
was here to kill her.

717
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,860
According to what you said,

718
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,860
someone was trying to kill Mu Ci.

719
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,420
It's my speculation,

720
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,460
but with no concrete evidence.

721
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,020
When Mu Ci left,

722
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,900
it was very sudden.

723
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,460
She didn't take anything with her.

724
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,380
She even left behind Xuezheng
and Wuzheng.

725
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,460
These two guqins
were Mu Ci's beloved items,

726
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,820
and they were very extraordinary.

727
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,260
But She left them behind.

728
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,900
She must have left in a great hurry.

729
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,420
Masters,

730
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,980
have you ever seen this dagger?

731
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,100
Mu Ci

732
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,020
always carried this dagger with her

733
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,220
and never left it.

734
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,660
Speaking of which,

735
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,940
since she left,

736
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,300
I have never seen this dagger again.

737
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,940
I thought she took it with her.

738
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,220
Now,

739
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,380
it has been passed on to you.

740
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,340
Fourth Princess,

741
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,700
we

742
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,820
have a request.

743
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,480
Please go ahead.

744
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,300
Qinse Valley is looking for a successor.

745
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,500
We want you to stay

746
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,940
to take over the Qu Family.

747
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,460
Don't look at me.

748
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,900
This was not my suggestion.

749
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,940
Besides you,

750
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,230
there is no one else
who can take over the Qu Family.

751
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540
Your guqin skills are superb,

752
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,940
and your talent is extraordinary.

753
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,140
In today's guqin world,
no one can match you.

754
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,380
Therefore,

755
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,940
we hope

756
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,260
you can take over the Qu Family,

757
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,340
and lead the family to make a difference

758
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,460
in the art of guqin.

759
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,100
Masters,

760
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,020
you are overestimating me.

761
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,660
I

762
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,460
cannot bear such a heavy responsibility.

763
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,540
You should find someone else.

764
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,740
You

765
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,900
almost scared me to death.

766
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,140
Masters, if you

767
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,820
keep my princess here

768
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,100
and take over the Qu Family,

769
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,860
what should I do?

770
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,440
Alright then.

771
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,040
Thank you, Masters.

772
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:26,980
Let's go.

773
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,340
I never expected the Liuguang Dagger

774
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,620
to had once belonged to your mother.

775
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,260
When I was young,

776
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,660
I saw it in my mother's box.

777
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,660
But after my mother passed away,

778
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,100
it disappeared as well.

779
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,660
So, the first time
when you saw it with me,

780
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,140
you were so interested.

781
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,420
But since it's your mother's relic,

782
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,300
why was it in my mother's possession?

783
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,700
I don't know.

784
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,700
Could it be

785
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,780
that they two knew each other?

786
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,620
I can investigate it thoroughly

787
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,060
when l I return to Tianque.

788
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:43,940
And,

789
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,020
if Lishang has more than ten volumes,

790
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,580
why didn't your mother leave them all?

791
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
I don't know.

792
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,780
Xuanyuan Lige didn't know either.

793
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,600
He was also very shocked at the time.

794
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,420
So Lishang

795
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,960
has more than ten volumes.

796
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,020
But where could the remaining scores be?

797
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,060
Do you think
they might be in Qinse Valley?

798
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,460
Because you heard a different piece

799
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,660
of Lishang there.

800
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,700
No matter what,

801
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,980
I want to collect all scores of Lishang.

802
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,700
Because my mother said

803
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,140
Lishang can take me home.

804
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,100
Now it seems all the secrets

805
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,580
are hidden in Lishang.

806
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,700
(Can Lishang)

807
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,060
(really take me home?)

808
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,340
Lige, your letter.

809
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,660
The messenger asked me to tell you

810
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,740
to reply immediately

811
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,420
without delay.

812
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:06,580
Thank you.

813
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,740
This is already the fourth letter.

814
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,420
Why don't you read it?

815
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,340
It's just some questioning

816
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,500
and blaming

817
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,100
of asking why I didn't take advantage
of Jun Beiyue's illness

818
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,460
to kill both him and his wife,

819
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,060
and why I didn't take this opportunity

820
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,170
to provoke a war between Xiling
and Tianque.

821
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,500
Since they know so well what to do,

822
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:50,980
why not

823
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,700
let them handle it themselves.

824
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:55,420
Your Highness,

825
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,740
Her Majesty has placed the hope

826
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,220
of restoring the nation entirely on you.

827
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,820
You neither reply,

828
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,460
nor take any action.

829
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,660
Naturally, she is anxious.

830
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,140
It's just

831
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,140
that she fears that if I die,

832
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,420
there will be no one
to act as their pawn.

833
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,500
Your Highness.

834
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,100
Ms. Qin.

835
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,990
I am more urgent than anyone else

836
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,060
to restore the nation.

837
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,820
- It's just that...
- It's just

838
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,820
that you have made new friends

839
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,140
in Tianque.

840
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,020
Your Highness.

841
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,300
I have watched you grow up.

842
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,380
I know exactly

843
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,460
what you are thinking.

844
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,060
But since you bear the name Xuanyuan

845
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,180
and carry the responsibility,

846
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,860
you should forget

847
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,020
about making friends.

848
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,060
Han Ziqing...

849
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,580
Ms. Qin,

850
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:47,860
rest assured.

851
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,780
I know what I am doing.

852
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,380
I have my own plans for the future.

853
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,220
You need not say more.

854
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:55,980
You may leave now.
