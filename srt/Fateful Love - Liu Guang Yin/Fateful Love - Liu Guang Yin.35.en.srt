21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,440
The Yuqiong Heavenly Pool

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,350
is located
at the top of Yuqiong Mountain.

23
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,630
It's in the southeast corner of Tianque,

24
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,510
and is adjacent to Nanzhao.

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,150
There is

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,550
a small tribe

27
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,110
called Liangye Tribe.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,200
It is said that Liangye Tribe has many
talented and extraordinary individuals,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,300
and they are good at medical science.

30
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,510
Why don't we take Xiaosheng over there?

31
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,480
Maybe it could help

32
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,320
with her condition.

33
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,680
Great.

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,590
There's no time to lose.

35
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,480
Let's set off quickly.

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,190
Although Liangye Tribe is a small tribe
on the border,

37
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,670
we are a big team here.

38
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,600
There must be a reason.

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,440
I heard that after some time,

40
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,720
Liangye Tribe

41
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,550
is going to hold Sheng Xiao Assembly
at Heavenly Pool.

42
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,800
They are inviting royal envoys
from all countries.

43
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,000
Moreover, every year

44
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,120
the event

45
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,270
is quite grand.

46
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,800
Let's take this opportunity

47
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,630
to join the fun.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,440
Alright.

49
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,750
Everyone, get ready.

50
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,160
Weisheng,

51
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,440
I will go with you all.

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,870
Mother,

53
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
we have important matters to attend to.

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
We will be back soon.

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,320
Moreover, this trip will be exhausting.

56
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,830
You can wait for us on Liuxian Island.

57
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,440
It's important to you.

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,000
Isn't it important to me?

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,910
Weisheng,

60
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,160
after so many years,

61
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,100
we have finally reunited.

62
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,700
Don't talk about
how tiring the journey will be.

63
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm not afraid.

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,360
As long as I can be with you,

65
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm not afraid of anything.

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800
Alright.

67
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,240
Then let's go together.

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
Okay.

69
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,390
Didn't you say
you would bring Xiaosheng along?

70
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,750
It's perfect

71
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,440
that I can take good care of her.

72
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,000
Last time in the Barrier,

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,320
I saw her risking her life
to save others.

74
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,520
Now I know that she is a girl.

75
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,440
I like her even more.

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Mother, she is my junior brother.

77
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,000
What junior brother?

78
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,830
She's a girl.

79
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,160
- I...
- She's your junior sister.

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm used to calling her Junior Brother.

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,670
You'll take care

82
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,960
of Xiaosheng tonight.

83
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,270
Didn't you just say

84
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,520
you would take care of her tonight?

85
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,910
Do you know any of filial piety?

86
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,160
Are you just going to stand by
and watch your mother suffer?

87
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,000
But you just now...

88
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,830
By the way,

89
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,440
do you know Xiaosheng's birth time?

90
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
I'd like to tell the fortune for you.

91
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,750
Your Highness,

92
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,320
they caught a woman at the camp.

93
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,440
She said she was here to see you,

94
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,270
so I brought her here.

95
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,350
Mr. Xuanyuan.

96
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,160
It's you.

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,510
It's me, Yu Xiaomeng.

98
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,600
How did you find me?

99
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,610
Last time I saw the map
that you were looking at.

100
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,270
So I tried to find my way here.

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,720
I didn't expect to actually find you.

102
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,190
So

103
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,720
do you want to stay?

104
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,200
It wasn't easy for me

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,040
to find you here.

106
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,200
I want to follow you.

107
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,600
Alright.

108
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,670
However, I need you to know

109
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,350
that you saved my life,

110
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,190
but,

111
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,670
you are not my friend.

112
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,200
If you insist on staying,

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,000
you can only be a maid.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,070
You must follow my orders.

115
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,440
If you don't agree, you can go back.

116
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,950
I agree.

117
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,670
Have you thought it through?

118
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,110
I have thought it very clearly.

119
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,510
As long as you're willing
to let me stay,

120
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,720
I can do anything.

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Ms. Qin,

122
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,390
take her away.

123
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,320
Yes.

124
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,880
What are you standing there for?

125
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,720
Let's go.

126
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,550
This is not your tribe.

127
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,000
You must understand the rules.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,510
You must greet him
when you see His Highness.

129
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,640
Watch your mouth

130
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,510
and be smart.

131
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
This is the military camp.

132
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
Don't run around.

133
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,390
I understand.

134
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,230
Your Highness.

135
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,660
(Snow Region)

136
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:32,950
Sir,

137
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,720
where is this place on the map?

138
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,600
Wuxie Gorge.

139
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,720
Wuxie Gorge?

140
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,640
Can you find any problems?

141
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,390
I

142
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,190
can't.

143
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,880
If you can't, just be quiet.

144
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,920
If you're not allowed to comment,

145
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,880
don't say a word.

146
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,670
Take her away.

147
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,560
Yes.

148
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,060
(Snow Region Tribe)

149
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,570
If people from other royal cities

150
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,740
find out that my tribe is secretly
in contact with Dongling,

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,140
the consequences

152
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,200
would be disastrous.

153
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,510
But you have no other choice.

154
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,110
Dongling now has nothing

155
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,790
but a plateau in the northern frontier.

156
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,880
How can you despise me?

157
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,600
What qualifications do you have

158
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,230
to collaborate with Snow Region?

159
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,510
What qualifications do I have?

160
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,440
I believe

161
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,600
you can judge it yourself.

162
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,190
Who is she?

163
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,070
Just a maid.

164
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,160
Xuanyuan Lige,

165
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
you came to find me.

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,110
Do you want Xiling?

167
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,440
Exactly.

168
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,640
So, do you plan to get cross Wuxie Gorge

169
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,200
to form a pincer attack with Snow Region
from the east and west?

170
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,790
Or do you plan to use
Jun Beiyue's Sanjie Region

171
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,760
to form a pincer attack with Snow Region
from the north and south?

172
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,720
What is it?

173
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,400
This is the map of Wuxie Gorge.

174
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Beneath Wuxie Gorge

175
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,790
is Mitian Deep Sea.

176
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,640
(Sanjie Cliff)
And here,

177
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,710
I have dug a tunnel.

178
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,320
It was dug several hundred zhangs down
from the southern part of the plateau

179
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,640
to reach the walkway on the cliff.

180
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,020
(Xiling Royal City)
Here, a bridge will be hung to the gorge,

181
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,030
and there will be a tunnel
that gets to Xiling Royal City.

182
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,350
How did you come up with the idea

183
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,550
of digging a tunnel under Wuxie Gorge?

184
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,840
My Sound Strike Army

185
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,320
will soon reach the eastern part
of Xiling.

186
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,670
If you are interested,

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,710
I can give you

188
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,470
the northern part of Xiling.

189
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,590
Sound Strike Army?

190
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,000
Does the Sound Strike Army

191
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,520
truly exist?

192
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:49,200
The Sound Strike Army
is the elite under my command.

193
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,710
It is said that the army

194
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,710
consists of the masters of music.

195
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,280
They use the music sound as arrows.

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,910
Music can kill.

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,840
Is it

198
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,000
true?

199
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,910
If you don't believe me,

200
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,400
I shall take my leave now.

201
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,600
However,

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm afraid

203
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,200
you may have to miss

204
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

205
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,520
to occupy the northern part of Xiling.

206
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Let's go.

207
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,190
Are you sure

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,150
your tunnel will soon reach Xiling?

209
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,960
If you're interested,

210
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,110
come and take a look in person.

211
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,520
Let's take a break ahead.

212
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,360
Okay.

213
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,640
Sir, please have some water first.

214
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Thank you.

215
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,550
I'm not hungry. Eat it yourself.

216
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,070
Okay.

217
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,980
(Nanzhao Palace)

218
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,390
Master,

219
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,400
I just got the news

220
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,470
that Han Ziqing and her team

221
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,880
are going to Yuqiong Mountain.

222
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,720
Yuqiong Mountain?

223
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,760
What are they going there for?

224
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,600
I heard that Liangye Tribe
is going to hold the Sheng Xiao Assembly

225
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,600
at Yuqiong Heavenly Pool.

226
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,400
They are widely inviting envoys
from all countries.

227
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,300
However, His Majesty said

228
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,520
he didn't want to go

229
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,500
and had already declined them.

230
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,150
Sheng Xiao Assembly?

231
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,670
Who is in charge?

232
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,790
I heard it is Sheng Zimo,

233
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,280
the son of the current chief
of Liangye Tribe.

234
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,720
Let's go.

235
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,710
Enter the palace.

236
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,790
Master, what do you mean?

237
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,910
Go see His Majesty.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,640
It's such a grand event
for Liangye Tribe.

239
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,230
Since Tianque is going to attend it,

240
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,280
Nanzhao, as a neighboring country,

241
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,520
cannot stand by idly.

242
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
We should also attend
to show our support.

243
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,920
Would you like a drink?

244
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,880
Grandfather should be home by now.

245
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,280
We haven't received any news.

246
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,470
It's been so many days.

247
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,500
He should have arrived by now.

248
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,150
How many secrets of the Isolated Island

249
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,760
are there that we still don't know?

250
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,790
Actually, for us,

251
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,080
the most important thing right now

252
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,000
is to make Nanzhao confess

253
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,440
and clear the name of the Islanders.

254
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,590
Will the King of Nanzhao

255
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,520
go there?

256
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,710
They have already set off.

257
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,240
Really?

258
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,160
Brother,

259
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,440
can you just stay
in this Self-reflection Yard

260
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,280
for a lifetime?

261
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,670
Anyway, I can't stay any longer.

262
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,030
Rather than chopping wood here
every day,

263
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,760
I might as well be dead.

264
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,280
Second Master, Third Master.

265
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,390
What's the matter?

266
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,600
The Chief has returned.

267
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,300
He asked both of you
to return to the main residence.

268
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,700
There are important matters to discuss.

269
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,430
Brother.

270
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,680
Let's go.

271
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,110
Isn't this Wanyue?

272
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,550
- Wanyue is alive.
- She is still alive.

273
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,390
Yes, indeed.

274
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,150
This is unexpected.

275
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,990
How wonderful it is.

276
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,790
Why has Sister returned?

277
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,710
Including my family,

278
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,670
our tribe
has gone through 38 generations.

279
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,230
For generations, the disciples
and tribe members

280
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,790
all can behave themselves well

281
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,200
and take indifference
to fame and fortune.

282
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,840
However, there is a rotten apple

283
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,110
who developed ill intentions

284
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,960
and used the forbidden technique
in Momentary Tower

285
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,590
to harm others.

286
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,350
It is unforgivable.

287
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,950
I brought her back to the tribe

288
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,520
to imprison her for life

289
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,160
as the punishment.

290
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,590
Father, if you want to punish me,

291
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

292
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,520
But you cannot

293
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,520
imprison me.

294
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,880
I beg you to show mercy

295
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,040
and give me a chance.

296
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,560
You still

297
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,000
have no repentance.

298
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,400
I cannot leave you uncontrolled.

299
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,040
I have set up the Barrier for you.

300
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,880
It'll open after I die.

301
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,840
Wanyue,

302
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,560
don't blame me for being ruthless.

303
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,830
Before I die,

304
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,280
just stay obediently in Meng Tribe.

305
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,790
Father.

306
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,840
Father, you can't imprison me.

307
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,880
Father,

308
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,430
I have been poisoned.

309
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,590
I have to return to Nanzhao regularly
to get the antidote.

310
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,310
Otherwise, I'll
lose my martial arts skills.

311
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,640
With your techniques and character,

312
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
it's a good thing for you

313
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,190
to lose those martial arts skills.

314
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,120
Father.

315
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,400
Father!

316
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,330
Xuanyuan Lige,

317
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,560
I am so impressed

318
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,880
that you have come up with
such a method.

319
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,930
Please come in.

320
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,350
Alright.

321
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,880
Now we probably

322
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,580
have been in the Xiling territory.

323
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,840
Yes.

324
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,140
How far can it reach at most?

325
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,450
Southeastern Xiling.

326
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,000
Are you crazy?

327
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,620
The southeastern part
is near the Sanjie Region.

328
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,460
Are you out of your mind?

329
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,500
Do you think

330
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,740
that Jun Beiyue
would deploy heavy troops

331
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,340
in the well-known Sanjie Region?

332
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,340
The Sound Strike Army of Dongling

333
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,580
will arrive at the southeastern part
of Xiling in ten days.

334
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,050
Ten days?

335
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,060
The strategy is a good one.

336
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:54,900
However,

337
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,600
even if each of the soldiers
in the Sound Strike Army

338
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,280
can fight ten enemies,

339
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,220
the military forces
in Xiling Royal City

340
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,260
are more than ten times stronger.

341
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,980
Are you confident of a complete victory?

342
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,100
Ten times?

343
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,340
By that time,

344
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,140
the military forces within Xiling City

345
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,460
will probably be less than ten percent.

346
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,420
Why?

347
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,860
Because they will go to Tieyan.

348
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,700
Tieyan?

349
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,660
Now, Xiling's national strength
has greatly diminished.

350
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,980
Why will they battle against Tieyan?

351
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,940
Because Tieyan
will soon face civil strife.

352
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,180
Chu Tiange

353
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,420
would never miss such an opportunity.

354
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,070
Crown Prince Xuanyuan,

355
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,300
so you're planning
to incite the civil strife in Tieyan

356
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,180
and to take advantage of the situation

357
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,500
when Xiling attacks Tieyan.

358
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,380
But

359
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,580
how will you incite the strife?

360
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,460
Tieyan is currently ruled
by their prince consort.

361
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,020
The princes in the royal family

362
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,850
must be resentful.

363
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,620
I see.

364
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,660
As long as Tieyan is in chaos,

365
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,130
Xiling will launch a full-scale attack

366
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,980
and leave fewer troops behind.

367
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:02,830
Therefore...

368
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,980
It's a smart plan.

369
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,060
Extremely smart.

370
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,580
When should we take action?

371
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Just wait for my message.

372
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,820
Your soldiers of Snow Region

373
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,460
can hinder the Xiling Army

374
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,820
right at the Tieyan border,

375
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,940
and don't give them a chance to retreat.

376
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
After the task is completed,

377
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,780
I will fulfill everything
I promised you.

378
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,500
You will

379
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,260
get all five cities
in the north of Xiling.

380
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,500
However,

381
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,300
if you dare to take one more step west,

382
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,580
don't blame me for turning hostile.

383
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,340
Pass through here?

384
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,260
Alright.

385
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,500
We'll attack Xiling first,
and then go to Tianque.

386
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,500
Jun Beiyue
has probably never dreamed of this.

387
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,540
Relying on just 4, 000 soldiers
of Sound Strike Army,

388
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,820
Dongling can challenge

389
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,550
the hegemony of Tianque in Longyuan.

390
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,140
Hegemony in Longyuan?

391
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,660
It's early

392
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,220
to draw the conclusion.

393
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,220
Alright.

394
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,140
Mother, I like it.

395
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,940
Sis, look at that cloud.

396
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,100
- Does it look like a little bird?
- Yes.

397
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,940
And over there.

398
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,220
A monkey.

399
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,780
There are two monkeys.

400
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,500
Take it easy.

401
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,340
It's okay.

402
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,300
By the way, are you hiding something
from me?

403
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,240
No.

404
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,620
Fine.

405
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,420
You must not tell Father.

406
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,300
If Father finds out,

407
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,300
he will skin me alive.

408
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,220
Got it.

409
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,090
Be careful.

410
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,300
Sis.

411
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,660
Sis.

412
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,900
Sis, are you okay?

413
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,380
Sis.

414
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,860
Mother, I'll go check what's going on.

415
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,580
Who are you?

416
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,260
This is outrageous.

417
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,600
How dare you cause trouble
on the Xiao Family's territory?

418
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,810
Watch your words, young man.

419
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,070
We kindly helped you stop the carriage.

420
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,730
Not only did you not thank us,

421
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,460
but you started to slander us.

422
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,580
Your carriage blocked our way first.

423
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,180
Now you've damaged my carriage.

424
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,550
You need to compensate me
for my carriage.

425
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,660
No, you...

426
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,610
Shadow, why didn't call me to the fight?

427
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,860
My younger brother
has always been mischievous.

428
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,900
Please forgive us.

429
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,260
What are you arguing about?

430
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,940
Shadow,

431
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,620
give them two horses.

432
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,620
Your Highness...

433
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,460
Go.

434
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,580
It's boring.

435
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,530
Come over here.

436
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,140
Give them these two horses.

437
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,980
Yes.

438
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,560
Thank you.

439
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,650
The young men are quite impulsive.

440
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,480
The carriage was smashed badly.

441
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,460
This should be something
they left behind.

442
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,460
Forget it.

443
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,420
I think

444
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,340
they are from Xiao Family.

445
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,540
They will also
attend tomorrow's grand ceremony.

446
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,820
We'll return it to them then.

447
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,660
Okay.

448
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,430
Let's go.

449
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,980
(Xiao Manor)
Sis, let me tell you.

450
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,340
We shouldn't have spared them.

451
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,740
If I run into them again,

452
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,900
I'll make them suffer.

453
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,580
Sis,

454
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,780
when we see Father,

455
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,300
just say they hit us.

456
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,940
Got it.

457
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,740
Look at your painted face.

458
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,580
Let me wipe it for you.

459
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,820
What's wrong, Sis?

460
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,100
Oh no.

461
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,580
Where is the White Jade Xiao?

462
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,300
Why is the White Jade Xiao missing?

463
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,900
Could it be that it fell out

464
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,900
when the carriage overturned just now?

465
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,060
Stop talking. Go find it quickly.

466
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,380
Let's go.

467
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,860
(Sheng Manor)

468
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,700
Your Highness, this way, please.

469
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,060
I'm Sheng Zimo.

470
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,180
Welcome, Fourth Prince.

471
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,500
I have heard

472
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
that Yuqiong Heavenly Pool

473
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,500
has magnificent scenery.

474
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,860
I came specifically
to feast my eyes on it.

475
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,500
Sorry for the disturbance.

476
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,780
Your Highness is too kind.

477
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,980
It is an honor for our tribe

478
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,100
to have your presence.

479
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,660
Fourth Prince, Fourth Princess,

480
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,780
you have been traveling a lot.

481
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,800
It must have been exhausting.

482
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,660
King of Nanzhao,

483
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,420
we meet again.

484
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,020
Your Highness, shall we go rest first?

485
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,780
Please.

486
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,460
Fourth Prince, Fourth Princess, please.

487
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,600
Sheng Xiao Assembly is a grand event
held once every ten years by our tribe.

488
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,020
I know I can't be careless.

489
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,860
I will do my best.

490
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,420
It's good
that you understand the importance.

491
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,020
This Sheng Xiao Assembly

492
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,620
is not just a grand event
held once every ten years,

493
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,460
but also

494
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,060
the assembly
to select the next chief.

495
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,780
If you can't perform well

496
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,660
at this assembly,

497
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,780
the next chief position

498
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,180
will probably

499
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,020
have to be given to the sixth son
of Xiao Family.

500
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,100
The chief is from our family
for three consecutive generations.

501
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,100
I can't bring shame to our Sheng Family.

502
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,380
If only your sister were still here.

503
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,620
Her talent is more than ten times better
than that of ordinary people.

504
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,780
If she were here,

505
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,820
I wouldn't be so worried.

506
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,300
My younger sister passed away
at a young age.

507
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,800
This is indeed a great misfortune
for our Sheng Family.

508
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,020
I can only study diligently
and practice hard,

509
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,380
and remind myself not to slack off.

510
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,780
I hope to ease some of your worries

511
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,860
and also bring peace

512
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,900
to my sister's spirit in heaven.

513
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,140
I'm glad to know

514
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,940
that you have such thoughts.

515
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,860
Go ahead and do your work.

516
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,700
Yes.

517
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,580
At tomorrow's grand event,

518
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,700
be careful of them setting a trap.

519
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
Now, I'm actually worried
that they won't set a trap.

520
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,380
I wonder if those two volumes
of the musical score

521
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,540
are in the Heavenly Pool or not.

522
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,270
Come in.

523
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,180
- Have you made the arrangement?
- Yes, all are ready.

524
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,820
Good.

525
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,940
Are you willing to assist me, Minister?

526
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,140
If the Nanzhao Royal Family
supports you from behind,

527
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,580
and restrains your legitimate brothers,

528
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,010
the position of being the next chief
of Liangye Tribe

529
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,280
will be yours, right?

530
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:46,260
You only get one chance.

531
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,700
Think about it.

532
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,940
If the chief position
falls into the hands of others,

533
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,580
what kind of fate
will Sheng Family have?

534
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,700
Even if you don't think it for yourself,

535
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,460
you should also think about
the people of Liangye Tribe.

536
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,980
You have helped me so much.

537
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,020
How do you want me to repay you?

538
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,700
Draw the Fourth Princess of Tianque
to the Heavenly Pool?

539
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Minister, it...

540
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,900
After it is accomplished,

541
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,580
the Nanzhao Royal Family
will assist you

542
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,740
in ascending to the chief position.

543
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,700
Alright.

544
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,180
I will give it my all.

545
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,460
Let me tell you about Liangye Tribe.

546
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,860
The families in the tribe are expert

547
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,100
at different musical instruments.

548
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,860
The Sheng Family and Xiao Family

549
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,900
are the most powerful.

550
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,210
It is said that their Phoenix Tail Sheng

551
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,900
and the White Jade Xiao

552
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,820
are the most unique.

553
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,020
Therefore, the two families

554
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,420
will fight for the chief position.

555
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,140
The ensemble performance begins.

556
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,320
The ensemble performance has ended.

557
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,940
Distinguished guests,

558
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,460
the ensemble performance just now

559
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,940
was just a small opening.

560
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,620
The funny part

561
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,340
lies in the upcoming family competition.

562
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,180
Please stay tuned.

563
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,820
The competition begins.

564
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,940
Their competition is about

565
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,700
who can use their musical instruments

566
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,740
to continuously evoke the natural sounds
from the bottom of the pool

567
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,800
and successfully open the Heavenly Pool.

568
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,940
Whoever does it will be the winner

569
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,280
and will take the chief position.

570
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,180
I see.

571
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,660
He is Sheng Zimo, the Young Master
of Sheng Family.

572
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,180
He's holding the Phoenix Tail Sheng,

573
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,100
their family's treasured heirloom.

574
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,660
That girl is Gumo Baochuan,

575
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,220
Gumo Family's second daughter.

576
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,700
She should not be underestimated.

577
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,940
You brat.

578
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,020
Tell me the truth.

579
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,420
Where is it?

580
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,700
You...

581
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,700
Father.

582
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,100
How can you still cry?

583
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,060
How did you lose it?

584
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,620
- You brat!
- Father!

585
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,140
We took the White Jade Xiao out

586
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,460
and accidentally lost it.

587
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,460
Where did you lose it?

588
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,140
We have searched the entire mountain.

589
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,900
Do you know

590
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,100
that if the White Jade Xiao is missing,

591
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,660
how seriously our Xiao Family
will be affected?

592
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,420
Our Xiao Family

593
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,860
might face a complete downfall.

594
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,900
Did you hear anything?

595
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,060
In the melody
of this Phoenix Tail Sheng,

596
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,780
there is the tune of Lishang.

597
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,580
Are you saying it's very likely

598
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,300
that he has the last two volumes
of the musical score we are looking for?

599
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,060
I'm not sure about that.

600
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,340
This melody

601
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,100
is subtly changing.

602
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,780
It's hard to tell the difference.

603
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,180
King of Nanzhao,

604
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,900
I want to make a bet with you.

605
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,020
Fourth Prince,
since you have such an interest,

606
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,860
just tell me about it.

607
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,580
Neither of them can win.

608
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,650
Fourth Prince, you may not know.

609
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,690
I have learned it.

610
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,100
In recent years,

611
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,500
the Sheng Family
has never been defeated.

612
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,740
So today, King of Nanzhao,

613
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,860
I will bet against you.

614
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:23,980
What is the wager?

615
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,780
How about this?

616
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,460
If Fourth Prince wins,

617
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,580
King of Nanzhao,

618
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,380
you just give us the Minister.

619
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,180
Although he is quite old,

620
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,460
he can still serve tea and water.

621
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,500
- Your Majesty...
- This wager is novel.

622
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,340
Minister, do not get angry.

623
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,060
I will not lose this round.

624
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,620
Let's just consider it as a funny game
and play it with Fourth Princess.

625
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,300
Alright, I agree.

626
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,260
However, what if you lose?

627
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,700
As you wish.

628
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,540
Good.

629
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
You are indeed straightforward.

630
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,340
What if after we lose,

631
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,540
the King of Nanzhao

632
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,820
asked you to Nanzhao?

633
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,900
Impossible.

634
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,700
Minister,

635
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,940
don't be nervous.

636
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,980
Fourth Princess was just joking.

637
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,180
How could she make you a servant?

638
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,660
So, should we take him or not?

639
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,700
He is too old and no longer useful.

640
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,540
Let's just forget about it.

641
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,980
Fourth Princess,

642
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
thank you for your kindness then.

643
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,180
You're welcome.

644
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,100
You also understand the sheng, huh?

645
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,020
I don't know.

646
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,980
It just feels like this sheng's sound

647
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,060
was born in my mind.

648
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,060
Unknowingly, I followed along.

649
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,260
Your name is Xiaosheng.

650
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,180
Perhaps you do have some connection
with the sheng.

651
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,180
Your Majesty, Sheng Zimo
previously said he was confident.

652
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,100
But he needs
to find the right opportunity.

653
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,980
Sheng Zimo's skills
are quite impressive.

654
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,150
Fortunately, we were well-prepared.

655
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,260
Yuqiong Heavenly Pool
and Nanzhao Ice Pool

656
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,940
can't be connected.

657
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,780
What should we do?

658
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,060
We could pretend that the two places
have been connected.

659
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,820
Make it like the bodies from Ice Pool

660
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,100
are flowing through the secret passage
to the bottom of the Heavenly Pool.

661
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,460
Smart move.

662
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,940
And we can find a few more bodies

663
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,460
to disguise them as human puppets.

664
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:14,620
The King of Nanzhao is guilty.

665
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,800
He will surely believe it to be true.

666
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,300
However, now I'm worried

667
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,200
what should we do

668
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,940
if the Heavenly Pool
cannot be successfully opened?

669
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,940
According to the rules
of Sheng Xiao Assembly,

670
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,220
whether Sheng Family
or Xiao Family wins it,

671
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,940
the winner

672
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,100
will open

673
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,850
the Heavenly Pool.

674
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,300
But what if
something unexpected happens?

675
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,220
If there is such an issue,

676
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,300
I will use a firebomb to blow it open.

677
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,780
Shadow, you arrange some people

678
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,300
to stand by at all times.

679
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,460
Understood.

680
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,980
How did it fail?

681
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Can't Sheng Family
open Heavenly Pool either?

682
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,410
What a pity.

683
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,980
Didn't Sheng Family say

684
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,140
you can open the Heavenly Pool
with the divine music?

685
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,980
What is going on?

686
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,340
Are you fooling me?

687
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,660
I dare not.

688
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,580
I dare not.

689
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,460
King of Nanzhao, please do not be angry.

690
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,020
There should be a chance

691
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,540
of failing to open the Heavenly Pool.

692
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,740
You have also seen it.

693
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,980
Zimo has already given his all.

694
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,380
He didn't fail it on purpose.

695
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,220
Shadow,

696
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,860
go and get ready.

697
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,300
Yes.

698
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,500
Xiaosheng.

699
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,860
- Isn't this Xiaosheng?
- Give me back my sheng.

700
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,000
Just borrowing it for a moment.
